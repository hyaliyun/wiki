It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Whalley, the archdeaconry of Blackburn, and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. ==History== St Leonard's was founded as a chapel of ease to the parish church in Blackburn during the reign of Henry VII; the usual date given is 1504. The fabric of the building deteriorated until in 1852 it was decided to replace it with a new church. Construction of this started during that year, and the present church was consecrated in 1854. It was designed by the Preston architect R. B. Rampling. The tower and spire were added in 1906–07 by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley. ==Architecture== The church is constructed in sandstone rubble with slate roofs. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave, and a chancel at a lower level with a north organ chamber and a projection to the south. There is a polygonal baptistry at the west end, and a slim tower and spire at the west end of the north side of the nave. The baptistry has three windows, and above this is a three-light west window with a pointed head. The nave is divided into bays by buttresses, each bay containing a two-light window containing Geometric tracery. Projecting from the roof, on each side, are two timber dormer windows. The tower has diagonal buttresses, and contains a doorway with a pointed arch. The bell openings have two lights, and are louvred. The tower is surmounted by a parapet and a recessed spire. The east window has five lights under a pointed head, and contains Geometric tracery. Inside the church is an open timber roof. The two- manual pipe organ was made in 1872 by Henry Willis, and restored in 1974 by N. P. Mander. ==External features== In the churchyard, to the south of the church is a sandstone sundial dating possibly from the early 19th century, and re- erected at the beginning of the 20th century. It has an octagonal sandstone base with five limestone columns and a circular sandstone top containing a brass gnomon. The sundial is listed at Grade II. The churchyard also contains the war graves of six World War I soldiers. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Balderstone, Lancashire *List of ecclesiastical works by Austin and Paley (1895–1914) ==References== Category:Church of England church buildings in Lancashire Category:Diocese of Blackburn Category:Grade II listed churches in Lancashire Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in England Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Lancashire Category:Austin and Paley buildings Category:Buildings and structures in Ribble Valley ","title":"St Leonard's Church, Balderstone"},{"id":"35312124","text":"Western Products is an American brand name for snow plows and other professional snow removing equipment manufactured by Western Welding and Manufacturing. The company also manufactures a variety of truck-mounted sand and salt spreaders, snowplow replacement parts and snow removal accessories. Western Products employs approximately 250 people at its manufacturing facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the company is a division of Douglas Dynamics group (NYSE:PLOW), which also owns the Blizzard and Fisher Engineering brand names. ==History== On September 5, 1950, Douglas Seaman purchased Western Welding & Manufacturing, a small machine shop in Milwaukee that was founded in 1943. Western mainly handled small, one-off welding jobs for large manufacturers. A friend suggested to Seaman that he should start manufacturing snowplows as a way to diversify his business, which he did. In 1952, Western Welding introduced its first snowplow at a time when the U.S. population was shifting toward suburb settings, which increased the market for light trucks. This increased the demand for snowplows. ==Growth== Suburban areas continued to thrive through the 1950s, and the light-truck market continued to grow. The demand for snowplows continued rising, allowing Western Products' sales to double between 1961 and 1968. The 1970s also proved to be a profitable time for the company, as its share of the national market for the type of snowplows mounted on light trucks rose from 33 percent in 1968 to 40 percent a decade later. In 1977 Douglas Seaman incorporated as Douglas Dynamics Incorporated, which he placed as the parent company for Western Welding & Manufacturing. In 1984, Douglas Dynamics expanded, purchasing Fisher Engineering, a well respected competitor in the snow plow business. ==Expansion== In November 2005 Douglas Dynamics purchased Blizzard Corporation, including their complete line of snowplows and snowplow patents. Among the patents was a patent for an \\"adjustable-wing snowplow\\" that allowed the blade to extend from 8 feet out to 10 feet. Douglas Dynamics incorporated that technology into both its existing snowplow brands. In the 3rd Quarter of 2012, Douglas Dynamics' profits declined considerably due to a record low snowfall. ==References== Notes ==External links== * Category:Companies based in Milwaukee Category:Manufacturing companies based in Wisconsin Category:Snowplows Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1952 ","title":"Western Products"},{"id":"35312157","text":"Continuous flash suppression (CFS) is an adapted version of the original flash suppression method, first reported in 2004 (https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2131303). In CFS, the first eye is presented with a static stimulus, such as a schematic face, while the second eye is presented with a series of rapidly changing stimuli. The result is the static stimulus becomes consciously repressed by the stimuli presented in the second eye. A variant of CFS to suppress a dynamic stimulus is also reported CFS not only successfully suppresses images, but it strengthens the depth and duration of suppression compared to previous methods, such as flash suppression and binocular rivalry. CFS has the highest magnitude of suppression and allows researchers to increase the suppression time of an image tenfold. Using this method, subjects may report an image presented in their visual field as being invisible for over three minutes. CFS has the longest suppression time compared to other methods. CFS opens the door to studying preconscious processing mechanisms involved in visual perception. == Applications == CFS can be used to measure the salience of an image. Using this application, CFS can assist in determining if emotionally salient faces have a shorter suppression time compared to neutral faces. Significant differences have been shown in suppression duration depending on the images being suppressed. This illustrates how CFS can be used to more accurately measure the varying strength and perceptual influence of individual visual stimuli. Continuous flash suppression is a useful method for psychologists and neuroscientists interested in studying the mechanisms of conscious and nonconscious visual processing. Whereas other visual illusions that render otherwise salient images invisible have their own shortcomings and advantages, continuous flash suppression has a number of advantages for wiping images from conscious vision. It can erase an image presented at the fovea (which usually is much more resistant to perceptual suppression, unlike, for example, crowding), in every trial (unlike binocular rivalry), for a longer duration (>1 sec, unlike backward masking), with an excellent control of timing (unlike binocular rivalry). It has been widely exploited to tackle the scope and limits of unconscious processing. == Methodology == Tsuchiya and Koch (2006) argue that CFS is not simply a stronger form of binocular rivalry, but is actually a continuous form of flash suppression. The succession of multiple flashes that give CFS its increased suppression capabilities. The duration of stimulus suppression is chiefly dependent on the flash rate of the stimulus. Studies conclude that a series of five stimuli flashes in CFS achieve the full depth of suppression. A unique feature of CFS is its immunity to adaptation. Because the stimulus is flashed repeatedly, CFS prevents the subject from achieving actual conscious awareness of the stimulus.  Mondrian patterns  Mondrian patterns are typically used when conducting CFS experiments. Each pattern is generally flashed for 0.1 seconds before being replaced by a different Mondrian image. The typical Mondrian pattern used in CFS is composed of many varied black/grey/white or sometimes multi-colored squares. These Mondrian-scenes act as the suppressors of the probe stimulus. The name comes from Piet Mondrian, an artist who was famous for his use of vertical and horizontal lines. == See also == *Flash suppression == Notes == Category:Vision Category:Binocular rivalry ","title":"Continuous flash suppression"},{"id":"35312176","text":"Nicolas Princen (born 1984 in Rennes, France), was the technical advisor of French President Nicolas Sarkozy from 2007 to 2012.

First opened on November 18, 1948, it has now become a tourist destination as many celebrities are frequently seen at the mart. ==Overview== The Brentwood Country Mart is a shopping center, located at 225 26th Street just south of San Vincente Boulevard. Architect Rowland Crawford designed the barn-like architecture. The Mart has its own free parking lot and offers an outdoor dining area surrounding a large fire pit in the middle. The Mart hosts a variety of stores and dining options. Additionally, The Brentwood Country Mart offers a multitude of free events for families. ==History== In the 1920s, land was zoned in Brentwood Place; 26th Street and San Vicente Boulevard was reserved for commercial construction. The Herbert M. Baruch Corporation, a construction company that existed from the early 1920s until the mid 1950s, originally developed the country mart. Louis M. Sentei and A.L. Levin were the original owners of the mart. Their mission was to create a “one stop shopping” center in the heart of Brentwood. Architect Rowland Crawford, famous for designing the Santa Monica Sears Department Store, and phase two of the Los Angeles Times Building, designed a commercial building with a country feel to it. Sentei and Levin aimed to create a similarity to the Fairfax District Farmers' Market, a place containing a grouping of fresh food eateries. His design embodied the rural atmosphere of Brentwood at the time. People came to visit the Country Mart on horseback as late as 1948. The Country Mart included a post office, shoe repair, and barbershop, which are still present today. J.S. Rosenfield and Co. In 2003, the Brentwood Country Mart was acquired by James Rosenfield of J.S. Rosenfield and co.Roger Vincent (January 27, 2003), Developer Buys Brentwood Country Mart Los Angeles Times.

J.S. Rosenfield and co. leased the property from John E. Anderson (the namesake of UCLA Anderson School of Business). J.S. Rosenfield and Co. is also the owner of the Montecito and Marin Country Marts, the Aero Theatre, and multiple other locations. ==Celebrity sightings== Since opening its doors, The Brentwood Country Mart has played host to a large number of celebrities. Upon opening, movie stars such as Shirley Temple, Elizabeth Taylor, Burt Lancaster, and Greta and Gregory Peck were frequent visitors.

Meetings are held on Thursdays at 11:45 a.m. in the Executive Council Room at Parliament House when the Legislative Assembly is sitting and the Cabinet Room at the Executive Building when it is not. The Clerk of the Executive Council is also present at meetings. The Clerk formally presents each item of business (\\"minute\\") to the Governor, who approves them by initialing. After all the minutes have been approved, the meeting ends, the Councillors leave, and the Governor signs any Orders, commissions, or other documents as required. The formal term for the Governor acting on the advice of the Executive Council is the \\"Governor in Council\\".Constitution of Queensland Act 2001, section 27. Various statutes call for the Governor in Council to carry out its provisions. For example, the Constitution of Queensland Act 2001 provides for the Governor in Council to appoint judges to the Supreme Court. ==Matters considered== Matters dealt with by the Governor in Council include the following: * Appointing, among others, judges, magistrates, justices of the peace, and senior members of the civil service * Proclamations setting commencement dates for acts of Parliament * Orders in Council relating activities and financing of local government * Rearranging the machinery of Government * Statutory instruments and other subordinate legislation ==See also== * Government of Queensland * Federal Executive Council (Australia) ==NotesReferences * Executive Council Handbook Category:Government of Queensland ","title":"Executive Council of Queensland"},{"id":"35312299","text":"Dalcio Víctor Giovagnoli (born 5 June 1963) is an Argentine football coach. ==Honours== Club ;Jorge Wilstermann * Bolivian Apertura (1): 1998 * Bolivian Clausura (1): Runner–up 1998 ;Oriente Petrolero * Primera División de Bolivia (1): 2001 ;San Martín de San Juan * Primera B Nacional (1): Runner–up 2003 Apertura ;C.A.I. * Primera B Nacional (1): Runner–up 2006 Clausura ;Cobresal * Chilean Primera División (1): 2015 Clausura ==References * Dalcio Giovagnoli at Football-Lineups * * Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Rosario, Santa Fe Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Newell's Old Boys footballers Category:Instituto footballers Category:Nueva Chicago footballers Category:Central Córdoba de Rosario footballers Category:Argentine football managers Category:Central Córdoba de Rosario managers Category:San Martín de San Juan managers Category:C.A.I. managers Category:Aldosivi managers Category:Tiro Federal managers Category:Chacarita Juniors managers Category:Club Atlético Belgrano managers Category:Ferro Carril Oeste managers Category:C.D.

The first method attributes spreading of the salt because of sedimentary loading while the second method points to slope instability as the primary cause of gliding of the salt. The first method results in the formation of growth faults in the overlying sediment. Growth faults are normal faults that occur simultaneously with sedimentation, causing them to have thicker sediment layers on the downthrown sides of the faults. In the second method both the salt and the sediment are moving, making it more likely to migrate. ==General Features of the Gulf of Mexico== Present-day map of the main tectonic provinces The Gulf of Mexico is tectonically passive with low shear strength, but seaward slumping has produced a weak but mappable stress field. The stress map shows that in offshore Louisiana, maximum horizontal stress is oriented parallel to the shelf. Characteristics of the clastic sedimentary wedge have the greatest influence on the local stresses. Topography, lithology, and faults also affect how the stress map appears, but impermeable salt structures are significant because they resist movement. Basement tectonic control cannot readily affect the stress map since the salt's weak surface does not easily transmit stress. The observation of minibasins (small sedimentary basins) and other features have suggested that the salt in the Gulf of Mexico primarily moves by spreading under differential sedimentary loading, which needs many conditions (e.g. huge amounts of deposited material above the salt) to be met. However, models and observation of the northern Gulf of Mexico favor gliding via slope instability. Controversies such as this example indicate that this area is structurally complicated. == Mesozoic History == During the Mesozoic Era, the supercontinent Pangaea began to rift apart, forming the Gulf of Mexico basin within the late Triassic and early Jurassic periods. The rifting was accompanied by volcanic and nonmarine deposition. Later, because the newly formed basin was shallow and restricted from the Atlantic Ocean, the expansive salt evaporite deposits that the Gulf of Mexico is known for were created whenever saltwater periodically inundated the basin and then evaporated during the middle Jurassic. Not until the late Jurassic was the Gulf of Mexico connected to the Atlantic Ocean. Carbonate platforms formed during the early Cretaceous and were covered by terrigenous sediments toward the late Cretaceous. == Cenozoic History == The Cenozoic Era is a time of extensive deformation of the northern Gulf of Mexico basin and underlying Jurassic salt due to progradation of the continental shelf; evidenced by the basinward progression of the major fault systems found in the area.  Paleocene-Eocene  The Wilcox growth fault province formed throughout present-day onshore Texas and Louisiana during the Paleocene and Eocene. The series of listric growth faults developed when sediment loading stimulated the collapse of salt bodies, which facilitated slumping toward the center of the basin.  Oligocene-Miocene  A detachment province of Oligocene-Miocene age is located both onshore and within the offshore continental shelf. Primarily made up of listric down-to-the-basin growth faults, the system is overlain by up to five kilometers of deltaic sediments. Subsidence of these sediments is often due to simple gravitational failure or deeper extensional faulting associated with salt withdrawal. The abundance of sandstone in the area makes Louisiana a prime petroleum reservoir. However, the orientation of faults to maximum stress influences how well a seal develops in order to trap petroleum. Because it is very impermeable, salt deflects any vertical petroleum migration that attempts to cut across the salt. Thick salt formation is also known to slow down the maturation of the trapped petroleum underneath. Most of the oil in the Gulf of Mexico was generated in the Late Miocene-Late Pliocene in a period called peak oil generation during which many zones of petroleum formed below the base of the salt bodies. The Late Oligocene-Miocene witnessed the shifting of the area of maximum sedimentation toward the Mississippi River delta.  Pliocene-Pleistocene  The outer continental shelf of Louisiana is laced with listric growth faults, which formed during the Pliocene-Pleistocene Epochs, that detach onto salt-withdrawal surfaces. This geometry is a result of sediment loading on salt structures. The subsequent normal faulting forced salt bodies to migrate updip, causing widespread salt welds and isolated salt structures underneath the system. Using recent models of salt deformation, seismic interpretation, and section restoration, it has been determined that there are three major salt structures in the Louisiana locality, all forming in the last couple million years. These are reactive diapirs, active diapirs, and passive diapirs. Reactive diapirs initiate and grow beneath grabens from normal faults, by rising up into the top layers of the crust through cracks formed by the grabens. Active diapirs form around minibasins by piercing into weak layers of overburdened sediment layers. Passive diapirs are formed by 'passively' growing in height through downbuilding. Tabular Salt/Minibasin Province Much of the Gulf of Mexico subsurface is dominated by relatively horizontal and undeformed salt that has advanced basinward ahead of continental shelf tectonic activity. The southern front of this salt is rimmed by thrust faults as a result of this movement, forming the Sigsbee Escarpment, a 1250-meter change in bathymetry. The salt in this region has stopped advancing recently during the Quaternary. == References == Category:Tectonics Category:Regional geology of the United States Category:Structural geology ","title":"Structural evolution of the Louisiana gulf coast"},{"id":"35312326","text":"Cristian Valentin Ciubotariu (born 24 December 1980) is a Romanian professional footballer, who plays as a midfielder for German lower leagues club Edenkoben.

In 1988 he entered the National Institute of Performance Arts (INAS) in Kinshasa, graduating with a degree in drama in 1996. He also took courses in Mbalmayo, Cameroon on audiovisual techniques and in Douala, Cameroon on animation and visual communication. He worked at Les Films de la Passerelle in Brussels as a post- production trainee and attended workshops at the Lagunimages Festival in Benin. ==Career== Kabeya Muya wrote and directed television dramas in 1999. In 2004 he was first assistant to Thierry Michel on the set of the film Congo River, Beyond Darkness. In 2006 he and Guy Bomanyama-Zandu co-directed the 52-minute drama Muswamba. This movie tells of a teenage girl thrown onto the street and struggling to survive after being accused of sorcery. It provides a strong moral message about the evils of child abuse. Kabeya Muya established the production company Kabola Films which makes cinematographic animations in the center of Kinshasa. As part of a workshop led by Thierry De Mey of Charleroi Danses he directed the 2007 documentary Cailloux (Pebbles) on informal economic enterprise in Kinshasa. Kabeya Muya worked with veteran documentary director Monique Mbeka Phoba on a project where a group of young theater students in Kinshasa learned how to make a film. Kabeya Muya provided the hands-on training while Mbeka Phoba provided guidance via the internet. This led to the 2007 documentary Entre la coupe et l'élection (Between the cup and the election) about the first soccer team from Sub-Saharan Africa to participate in a FIFA World Cup, in 1974, co-produced by him and Mbeka Phoba. The team was The Leopards, the national team of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The team was defeated in three consecutive matches where they scored no goals, had their pay stolen by corrupt officials and had to return home to face an angry dictator. In April 2006 Kabeya Muya was severely beaten by armed men who threatened to kill him because of his relations with foreigners. In 2009 he received death threats for having worked on the film Katanga Business as assistant director to Thierry Michel. The filmmaker Monique Mbeka Phoba quickly mobilized an international campaign to ensure that the Congolese authorities extended their protection. ==Filmography== {class= - !Year !! Film !! Role !!

He is the winner of the 2010 and 2014 Shamus Award, the 2010 Nero Award and the 2013 and 2014 Lefty Award. He is the only author to have won all three of those awards. He writes both standalone domestic suspense novels and a series featuring investigative reporter Carter Ross, who covers crime for a fictional newspaper The Newark Eagle-Examiner, based in Newark, New Jersey. His novels are known for mixing humor with the gritty realism of their urban setting. Library Journal has called him \\"a gifted storyteller (with shades of Mark Twain or maybe Dave Barry).\\" ==Background== Parks was born in New Jersey but grew up in Ridgefield, Connecticut, where he attended Ridgefield High School. He first started writing professionally for his hometown newspaper, The Ridgefield Press, at age 14, covering high school sports. He attended Dartmouth College, founding his own newspaper, The Sports Weekly (now defunct) and singing with the Dodecaphonics, a co-ed a cappella group. While still a student, he worked as a stringer for The New York Times and as an intern for The Boston Globe. After graduating Phi Beta Kappa from Dartmouth in 1996, he interned at The Washington Post, and was eventually hired full-time by the paper, which assigned him to a bureau in Manassas, Virginia. In 1998, he moved to The Star-Ledger and began working as a sports features writer and, later, a news feature writer. In 2007, Crossroads, his four-part series on the 1967 Newark riots won the New Jersey Press Association's top prize for enterprise reporting. He now lives in Virginia with his wife and two small children. ==Career== Parks began writing fiction at age 26 in the cafe at a Barnes & Noble as a way to kill time while his wife was studying for her graduate degree. The inspiration for his first published novel, Faces of the Gone, was a 2004 quadruple homicide in Newark that he covered as a journalist. The novel sold to St. Martin's Press/Minotaur Books in 2008 to be published on December 8, 2009. Prior to publication, Harlan Coben called it a \\"terrific debut.\\" Library Journal gave it a starred review calling it \\"the most hilariously funny and deadly serious mystery debut since Janet Evanovich's One for the Money.\\" The novel went on to win the 2010 Shamus Award for best first novel; and the 2010 Nero Award for best American mystery. Faces of the Gone is the only book to have ever won both awards.

It received a starred review from Library Journal, which called it \\"as good if not better (than) his acclaimed debut.\\" The Wall Street Journal described protagonist Ross as \\"engaging\\" and said the book was \\"a capable follow-up to this author's award-winning debut.\\" The Free Lance–Star described it as \\"a book that melds the style of a Bob Woodward and a Janet Evanovich.\\" Parks' third book, The Girl Next Door, delves into the struggles of the newspaper industry and how a contentious union negotiation ends up imperiling a woman described as being like the girl next door. The novel won the Lefty Award for best humorous mystery. In doing so, Parks became the first author to have won the Lefty, Nero and Shamus Awards. The Girl Next Door also received a starred review from Booklist, which called it \\"... a masterpiece.\\" Library Journal called the Carter Ross series \\"a refreshing tonic for the mystery soul.\\". Shelf Awareness gave it a starred review, calling it \\"perfect for the reader who loves an LOL moment but wants a mystery that's more than empty calories.\\" Kirkus Reviews named it one of the top 100 works of fiction of 2012, making it one of just a handful of mysteries to win that honor.

It received a starred review from Booklist, which called it \\"a tautly written page-turner with charm and humor.\\" Library Journal opined \\"Parks's award- winning series is essential reading.\\" RT Book Reviews said the book \\"will please even the most discerning reader.\\" The Associated Press called it \\"a great lighthearted read.\\" It won the 2014 Shamus Award in the category of Best Hardcover Novel.

The film is set in 1986, in Bangarappeta village near Rajahmundry. Malli (Aadhi) and Chitra (Lakshmi Manchu) are a newly-wed couple who are forced to battle it out against a devastating flood of the River Godavari. They lose all hope of survival, and decide to narrate the darkest moments of their lives to each other after they find a support to rest on. First, Malli narrates his story to Chitra. Malli is an honest fisherman who works under Sambasivayya, a shrewd man at the port. Malli's ambition is to own a fishing boat for which he strives hard. His encounter with Sarala (Taapsee Pannu), the daughter of Sambasivayya, leads to certain disturbances in his life as Sarala, who lusts after Malli, blackmails him to escort her to a film and if not, she will report their intimacy to her father. Malli escorts her and finally tells that her that he can't go much further as his life and ambition is getting disturbed due to her. That night, police arrest Malli for preparing illegal ganja. Malli is fired from his job, his mother loses confidence in him. He finds out that Chandra, a fellow fisherman prepared Ganja. Chandra, after being beaten up by Malli, confesses that Sambasivayya has ordered him to do so as he felt that Sarala and Malli are in love. An enraged Malli goes to Sambasivayya's home to settle the score but finds that he is not in town. Sarala challenges an inebriated Malli as he is walking away after threatening to outrage her modesty by saying, \\"You seem to have forgotten that you are a man after the beating you got from police due to my dad.\\" Thus Malli makes love to Sarala that night only out of anger on her dad before learning that Sarala is going to marry soon. Chitra, after patiently listening to his story, starts telling her story. Chitra was found by a couple when she was 4 years old. They took her to their house and Chitra started being friendly with their son Suri. Due to financial problems, Suri's mother starts an illicit relationship with the town's doctor in order to gain money, which is misunderstood by Suri. Thus Suri starts hating his mother along with his father, getting much closer to Chitra. Years pass by and Suri (Sundeep Kishan), now a man, is a mason and is extremely fond of cock-fights while Chitra works under Dhorababu (Ravi Babu), a womaniser. One day, Chitra and Suri's mother go to the doctor's clinic. There, the doctor misbehaves with Chitra and the ladies leave the clinic, which is seen by Suri. Suri misunderstands that Chitra is also romantically involved with the doctor and starts roaming with Bangari (Suja Varunee) a native of that town, much to the agony of Chitra. Meanwhile, Suri's mother passes away and Chitra's marriage is held with an old man. Chitra pleads Suri to annul the marriage and Suri refuses by telling her what he saw at the doctor's place. Chitra tells the truth, thus leading a change of Suri's heart. That night, Dhorababu tries to molest Chitra only to be attacked by Suri. Suri proposes to Chitra but is attacked by his father. Suri attempts to kill his father but instead is injured fatally. Though Chitra reaches the hospital with Suri, she finds that the doctor who was lusting for her is serving there. She offers herself for a night and the doctor goes to treat him. Suri dies of extreme blood loss and Chitra attacks the doctor by pouring hot water on him. Thus, Malli and Chitra realize their love and wish to live together. But as fate would have it, the support breaks. Malli succeeds in finding a bridge and stands on it. He finds Chitra drifting by and rescues her. Both reach the top of the bridge and are filled with joy that they are alive and together. They throw the ring gifted by Sarala and the chain presented by Dhorababu on their marriage into the flood and start crossing the bridge. ==Cast== * Aadhi as Malli * Taapsee Pannu as Sarala * Lakshmi Manchu as Chitra * Sundeep Kishan as Suri * Ravi Babu as Dhorababu * Suja Varunee as Bangari * Jeeva * Annapurna * Pruthvi * Praveen as Malli's friend * Bala Singh as Sambaiah Garu * Ramesh * Dhanraj * Preethi Asrani as young Chitra * Mumaith Khan as item number ==Production== The project was first reported in January 2011, where it was claimed that Lakshmi Manchu would produce a love film titled Gundello Godari, which would feature her as the protagonist for the first time.

The Court held that it was patently unreasonable for the Minister of Labour to appoint retired judges as arbitrators in labour disputes without considering their expertise in labour relations under the Hospital Labour Disputes Arbitrations Act. ==Background== In Ontario, labour relations at hospitals and nursing homes are regulated under the Hospital Labour Disputes Arbitration Act, RSO 1990, c H14, s 6(5) (HLDAA), which require the parties to resolve labour disputes through collective bargaining with compulsory arbitration. Arbitrators were appointed by mutual agreement between the parties, but in case of a dispute, a panel of three arbitrators is selected with one member selected by each side and a third appointed by the Minister of Labour. A list of approved arbitrators was provided under s. 49(10) of the Labour Relations Act, 1995. In 1998, the Minister of Labour appointed four retired judges not on the pre-approved list as arbitrators to several labour boards. The unions, represented by the Ontario Federation of Labour and Canadian Union of Public Employees, protested, arguing that the retired judges lack labour expertise, experience, tenure and independence from government. They sought an application to declare the Minister's appointments invalid on the basis that he breached the principles of natural justice, creating a reasonable apprehension of bias. The Divisional Court dismissed the application, but was overturned by the Court of Appeal, which ordered the Minister to refrain from appointing further arbitrators not from the approved list. The issue before the Supreme Court of Canada was whether the Minister of Labour had created bias in the arbitration proceedings through his appointment of retired judges. ==Opinion of the Court== The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal decision, finding that the Minister's failure to consider appointees' expertise in labour relations was patently unreasonable. Binnie J., writing for a majority of the Court, invoked the rule of law principle from Roncarelli v. Duplessis, noting that the Minister is not entitled to untrammelled discretion.2003 SCC 29, at paras 91-92. Although the Minister was given broad powers under the provincial legislation and was entitled to a measure of deference, he held that the Minister's discretionary powers were constrained to the purpose and object of the Act. The purpose of the HLDAA was interpreted as providing an adequate alternative to strikes and lock-outs, and that to accomplish the purpose, \\"the parties must perceive the system as neutral and credible\\".Ibid at paras 110-111. In this context, for the union to perceive the arbitrators as credible, they must not only be impartial, but they must have specialized knowledge and expertise in labour relations. Given the statutory powers and discretion granted to the Minister, the standard of review was that of patent unreasonableness. Nonetheless, Binnie J. found that the Minister's appointments were patently unreasonable because he acted beyond the object of the Act in excluding consideration of labour relations expertise and general acceptability to the labour relations community.Ibid at para 184. ==Dissenting opinion== Bastarache J., in dissent, agreed with Binnie J.'s opinion that the Minister was entitled to deference and that the appropriate standard of review was patent unreasonableness. However, Bastarache J. would have held that the Minister's actions were not patently unreasonable, because the powers granted to him under the legislation was broad and set out no criteria for arbitration appointments.Ibid at para 36. ==See also== * Roncarelli v.

She entered Baggot Street with Catherine McCauley the then recently formed Institute of Mercy in Dublin in 1834 and took Ursula in place of her baptismal name. She was appointed Mother Superior in 1842, taking charge of the Institute's first foreign mission foundation in Newfoundland. ==Arriving in Australia== In 1845 she left for Perth, Western Australia in response to a request for religious sisters to staff a newly constructed school commissioned by the recently consecrated Bishop John Brady. Frayne arrived with some companions on 8 January 1846. Concerned for the conditions under which the sisters were working, the Dublin mother-house sent money for return fares. But Mother Ursula refused to abandon the mission. She realised that the sisters would have to generate their own income. In 1849 Ursula opened the first secondary school in Western Australia. It was a ‘select’ fee-paying school for the education of an almost exclusively non- Catholic clientele. It generated much needed funds and brought the mission financial stability. Using this model Frayne commissioned other schools by establishing almost simultaneously a ‘select’ fee-paying school together with an infants school and a primary school, usually on the same site and often within the same building. In 1865, despite the impending withdrawal of government aid the Sisters of Mercy schools in Western Australia were thriving. ==Final years in Melbourne== After enduring a dispute with Bishop John Brady, Frayne responded to a request from the Irish-born Bishop Goold for a Victorian foundation in Melbourne. Bishop Francis Murphy of Adelaide also put a similar request to her but Frayne had already committed to Bishop Goold. Six weeks after her arrival in Melbourne Frayne had raised loans to pay off the mortgages on her convent in Nicholson Street, Fitzroy. Speedy development followed and considerable construction of buildings for social and educational work was undertaken, peaking in the erection of the first wing of the present ‘Academy’ for £6000 in 1870. The Sisters of Mercy were the first teaching nuns in Victoria. She also founded the St Vincent de Paul’s Orphanage in South Melbourne. Frayne's first Victorian foundation was in Kilmore, Victoria in 1875. ==Death== Mother Ursula died in Nicholson Street, Fitzroy on the 9 of June 1885, aged 68. A Gothic architectureGothic chapel to her memory was built by her successor in the convent grounds. Her remains are buried in a vault in the chapel under a Celtic cross, reminding all of her origins. She is commemorated in the name of the Ursula Frayne Catholic College, Perth, Western Australia- and also in the dementia ward of Mercy Place, Albury; renamed in 2014 to commemorate \\"Ursula Frayne\\". ==ReferencesFurther links== St Vincent de Paul's Orphanage, Melbourne. 1855-1967 Category:1816 births Category:1885 deaths Category:People from Dublin (city) Category:Irish Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:Disease-related deaths in Victoria (Australia) Category:Irish emigrants to Australia (before 1923) Category:19th-century Australian educators Category:19th-century Australian women Category:20th-century Australian women ","title":"Ursula Frayne"},{"id":"35312872","text":"Ansonica Costa dell'Argentario is a dry Italian white wine from the region of Tuscany, Italy.

Spencer (born 1926) was an American trombonist and leader of a progressive swing big band bearing his name — Earle Spencer and His Orchestra. He formed the band in 1946 and disbanded in 1949. The band recorded for Black & White Records — a label so named by its founder, Les Schreiber, to reflect the races of its recording artists. == History of the Earle Spencer Orchestra == Spencer was a trombonist who, after playing in the band that he led from 1946 to 1949, gave up playing entirely, due partly to a heart murmur, due partly to the hard economics of big bands in that began in the late 1940s, and due partly to the band's record label, Black & White Records, which went out of business in October 1949. Towards the end of World War II, a conscious movement towards the creation of a new style of big band jazz became apparent on America's west coast. The longest established of these self-styled \\"progressives\\" was Stan Kenton; then came Boyd Raeburn, and finally Earle Spencer. In 1946, Spencer formed his band in Los Angeles after being discharged from the U.S. Navy. Its compositions were progressively styled in the spirit of Stan Kenton, Johnny Richards, and Boyd Raeburn. High-note trumpeter Al Killian, trombonist Tommy Pederson, tenorman Lucky Thompson, trumpeter Buddy Childers and altoist Art Pepper, were among the notable members. Spencer apparently dropped out of music altogether by the end of 1949 – when he was still just 23 – and nothing much has been heard from him since. When Kenton was in his Artistry in Rhythm phase, Earle Spencer was running a roadshow version of the same thing. The evidence is on Concert in Jazz, Tops 1532, dimmed by relatively inadequate recording. The March 5, 1949 Billboard magazine listed the Earle Spencer Orchestra as a \\"B\\" Band -- one that grossed less than $200,000, but more than $100,000 during 1948. Its booking agent firm was General Artist Corporation. Big bands were finding it difficult to survive in the late 1940s and were faced with limited bookings; so Spencer disbanded after a gig in Dallas. Edward Franklin Gabel (\\"Gabe;\\" 1924–2014) left Kenton as Kenton's bandboy to work for Earle Spencer as manager in 1947. == Critical acclaim == : \\"Box Lunch (at the Factory),\\" arranged by Paul Nelson (Black & White 875–A): The always interesting Earle Spencer has a potent, futuristic, impressionist work here. Complex working, stratospheric brass figures, intricate rhythms, and a terrific scream trumpet chorus make this a sure bet for amateurs of the super modern. == Notable band personnel == Unknown period * Ruben Leon 1946 notable personnel * Wilbur Schwartz (clarinet, alto sax), formerly with Glenn Miller * Ray Linn (trumpet) formerly with Tommy Dorsey * Bob Lively (alto saxophone), formerly with Stan Kenton * Bob Haywood (vocalist) * Morty Corb (arranger) * Frank Erickson (arranger) 1948 notable personnel * Frank Isola (20 February 1925 Detroit – 12 December 2004 Detroit) (drums) * Anthony Robert (Tony) Ortega (born 1928), lead alto sax * Toni Aubin and Jerry Hegeman (from Fort Worth) joined the band while it was performing in Fort Worth.

For example, Bob Lively is listed on alto sax along with Art Pepper. The personnel listed here are found in the Lord discography and the liner notes to Fresh Sound 2501. According to jazz historian Noal Cohen, Geller remembers being on this session: \\"I remember that because it was the first time I met and played with Art Pepper. It was around 1947, and perhaps my first recording as a sideman,\\" -- email from Geller to jazz historian Noal Cohen, October 4, 2011. : The 1947 date is mentioned in other sources including the famous 11-volume Jepsen Jazz Discographies, but seems unlikely given the number of Stan Kenton musicians present (Childers, Pepper, Almeida, Betts). Historian Cohen feels that 1949 is more reasonable because Kenton had disbanded in late 1948 after which these musicians joined Spencer (reported in Down Beat Magazine). == Compositions == * \\"E.S.

Gile returned to Iowa until 1873, when he moved to Kansas and took a homestead of eighty acres in Republic County. Gile worked the land, planting orchards and establishing a quarry for the area on his property. Gile was married twice. His first wife Adaline Amelia Ingalls died less than a year after they were married in 1861. Four years later, he married Sarah Ann Mahaffey and they remained in Iowa until her death.

It tells of Zaire's football team at the 1974 FIFA World Cup and what happened to the players afterwards. ==Synopsis== The national team of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Leopards, won the Africa Cup of Nations in 1968 and 1974. They then competed in the 1974 World Cup in Germany. They were the first Sub-Saharan African team to qualify, and hopes were high. The team was decisively beaten, scoring no goals in three games against Scotland, Yugoslavia and Brazil. The Scots were openly racist against the Congo team. In the last game the Leopards let Brazil win a third goal so they could qualify for the next round, and ensure Scotland could not. The Leopards' pay was stolen by corrupt officials and they had to return home to face an angry dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko. However, they were each given a car and a house. A group of young film students from the National Institute of Arts, Kinshasa tracks down the players, now living in obscurity, often without money and in poor health. The film alternates between the past and the present, in the run- up to the 2006 elections that followed the Second Congo War (1998–2003). The film compares failure of the team with the greater failure of the country to establish democracy. The Leopards captain, Kibonge Mafu, is the only successful member of the team, now running for election in Kinshasa. The narrator says of the Leopards \\"For them as for our country, the decline began\\". ==Production== The movie was made by Clarisse Muvuba and Démato Matondo, two students from the National Institute of Arts, before the 2006 elections. They were given hands-on training in the project by Kabeya Muya, while Mbeka Phoba obtained support and provided guidance via the internet. ==Reception== The film was screened at film festivals in cities such as New York, Milan, Libreville (Gabon), Tübingen (Germany), Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) and Leuven (Belgium). A reviewer in Vanity Fair said the film has an unpolished feel but \\"offers as much insight into Congolese political culture as it does into Congolese soccer\\". Another reviewer called it a \\"spectacularly ambitious student film\\". Yet another said \\"The film’s raison d’etre is told unevenly and distractedly ...

The first steps towards abolishing of serfdom were enacted in the Constitution of May 3, 1791, and it was essentially eliminated by the Połaniec Manifesto. However, these reforms were nullified partly by partition of Poland. Frederick the Great had abolished serfdom in his territories gained from the first partition of Poland. Over the course of the 19th century, it was gradually abolished on Polish territories under foreign control, as the region began to industrialize. ==10th to 14th centuries== In the early days of the Kingdom of Poland under the Piast Dynasty in the 10th and 11th centuries, the social class of peasantry was among the several classes that have developed. The peasants had the right to migrate, to own land, and were entitled to certain forms of judicial recourse in exchange for specific obligations toward their feudal lords. Over time, more peasants became dependent on feudal lords. This occurred in various ways; the granting of lands together with their inhabitants to a lord by the king, debt bondage, and peasants subjecting themselves to a local lord in exchange for protection. There were several groups of peasants who had varying levels of rights, and their status changed over time, gradually degrading from a yeoman-like status to full serfdom. Conversely, the least privileged class of the bondsmen, the niewolni or outright slaves (formed primarily from prisoners-of-war), gradually disappeared over the same period. By the late 12th century, peasantry could be divided into the free peasants (wolni or liberi), with the right to leave and relocate, and bonded subjects (poddani or obnoxii), without the right to leave. All peasants who held land from a feudal lord had to perform services or deliver goods to their lord. In time, and with the development of currency, most of those services evolved into payment of monetary rent, which became the dominant form of service around the 14th and 15th centuries. ==15th to 18th centuries== Around 14th and 15th centuries, the right to leave the land became increasingly restricted, and peasants became tied to the land. Proper serfdom evolved in Poland together with the development of noble (szlachta) manorial estates known as folwarks, and with the export-driven grain trade (so-called Polish or Baltic grain trade) economy. According to historian Edward Corwin the year 1496 (Statutes of Piotrków) marks the proper beginning of the serfdom era in Poland. Likewise, Paul Robert Magosci points to a series of related legislation around the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries. It was tied with the decrease in monetary rent, replaced by physical labor, demands for which increased over time. Whereas in the early days of serfdom in Poland, the peasant might have been required to farm less than three weeks in a year for his lord, in the 16th century, a weekly service of 1–2 man-days become common, and in the 18th century, almost all of a peasant's time could have been requested by the lord, in extreme cases requiring a peasant to labor eight man-days a week per 1 łan of land farmed by a peasants family for their own needs (the land belonged to the landlord), which in practice meant that the male head of the family worked full-time for the lord, leaving his wife and children working on the peasant's family land, and even then they had to help him occasionally, unless a peasant hadn't hired additional workers (poorer peasants). Simultaneously, peasantry rights (to own land, to leave it, or to have independent, royal justice) were reduced. 1521 marked the end of the peasant right to complain to the royal court. By the mid-16th century no peasant could leave the land without explicit permission of the lord. The situation of individuals who did not own land also worsened (migrant peasant workers), as several laws attempted to force them to become peasants (serfs). They were also forced to partake in various monopolies of their local lords (such as to buy drinks only in the tavern owned by the lord, or use only the lord's owned mills). Due to increased population, and impact of certain laws, individual peasant estates became steadily smaller. This resulted, particularly from the second half of the 16th century, in increased impoverishment of the peasantry, banditry and the occasional peasant uprising. This phenomenon was also witnessed in several other Central and Eastern European countries, and was known as the \\"second serfdom\\" or \\"neo-serfdom\\". Reversal of those trends begun in the 18th century, as part of various reforms aiming the revitalize the ailing governance and economy of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Some serfs became emancipated by their owners, who replaced the physical labor rent with monetary one. It became illegal for a lord to murder a serf, and the peasants regained some right to land ownership. Describing the system as it existed by the end of the century, Wagner writes: \\"The situation of the peasants in Poland was better than in most other countries. In France and Germany, for example, the owners of landed estates had unlimited jurisdiction over them, including the power to punish by death. In Russia, their economic oppression was notorious, and one of the reasons Catherine II gave for the partition of Poland was the fact that thousands of peasants escaped from Russia to Poland to seek a better fate.\\" Polish government reforms aiming at improving the situation of the peasantry reached culmination with the Constitution of May 3, 1791, which declared that the government would protect the peasantry, and encourage the use of contracts between peasants and their lords. Any further reforms were made impossible by the partitions of Poland and the resulting disappearance of the Polish state. ==Abolition== Abolition of serfdom in Poland occurred gradually. At the end of the 18th century a great reform of the Polish state was carried out. Frederick the Great having gained a significant amount of land in the first partition of Poland, proceeded to introduce reforms in them which also included abolition of serfdom. The Constitution of May 3, 1791 took the peasant class under the protection of the state, as the first step towards elimination serfdom. The Constitution was later overthrown by Polish magnates supported by Russia. Full abolishment was enacted by the Proclamation of Połaniec but this was also short-lived as Poland's neighbors invaded and partitioned the country. In the 19th century, various reforms took place at different paces in the Austrian partition, Prussian partition and the Russian partition with the advent of industrial revolution. Serfdom was abolished in Prussia in 1807, in Austria in 1848, in Russia in 1861, and in Congress Kingdom of Poland in 1864. ==See also== *Agriculture in Poland *Baltic grain trade *Domar serfdom model *Economy of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth *Proclamation of Połaniec ==ReferencesFurther reading== *A.

Under Shapur's influence Papas murdered Cylaces and Artabanes and sent their heads to Shapur as a sign of loyalty. The Roman Emperor, Valens, sent one of his generals, Arintheus, with an army into Armenia and Pap immediately reverted to his loyalty to Rome. In the winter 370, Shapur decided to settle the Armenian matter by force; he declared the Treaty of 363 (a thirty year peace agreement between the Persians and the Romans) to be void and began amassing an army to invade Armenia during the next spring. Learning of the impending attack, Papas mustered an army at Barevand. The Romans, under the command of Valens' generals Traianus and Vadomarius, had armies at Erhand and Baxish. They also marched for Bagrevand and build a fortified camp while they waited for the Armenians to assemble. Eventually, the Armenians fielded an army of 90,000 men. It was decided that the Sparapet (general) Mushegh I Mamikonian would command the Armenian forces while the Romans remained under their own command. ==Battle== The combined Armenian-Roman army met the Sasanid force near a village called Dzirav (near Bagrevand) and were victorious. The Armenians broke the Sasanid battle lines and caused a route. Faustus of Byzantium gives considerable credit for the victory to sparapet Mushegh I Mamikonian. Movses Khorenatsi of Armenia and Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus noted that Valens' generals did not actively participate in the battle, but rather were engaged in protecting the king. During the ensuing battles more Armenian territories were reclaimed from the Sasanids, including Arzanene and Corduene which were ceded to Shapur II by Jovian in 363. ==Aftermath== Although he lost the battle, Shapur was determined not to give in. He launched several minor invasions and raiding parties into Armenian territory, before another major assault led to a second battle at Gandzak.Ammianus Marcellinus, Res Gestae, 29.1.4. At the Battle of Gandzak the Roman-Armenian army defeated the Sasanids for the second time that year. After the battle Shapur sent envoys and a truce was agreed upon. The truce would last for seven years.Ian Hughes, Imperial Brothers, p. 106. ==References== Bagrevand Bagrevand Bagrevand Bagrevand 371 Category:371 Category:370s in the Byzantine Empire Category:4th century in Armenia Category:4th century in Iran ","title":"Battle of Bagrevand (372)"},{"id":"35313130","text":"Émilie Favre (born December 8, 1992) is a French ski mountaineer.Une classe de l'école Brassens en Savoie pour une semaine 17 févr. 2012 \\"Émilie Favre a décroché la médaille de bronze\\" == Selected results == * 2011: ** 2nd, World Championship, relay, together with Laëtitia Roux and Sandrine Favre6\\\\.

The original interiors of the houses consisted of a bathroom and open concept living, dining, and kitchen area on the main floor, with a loft-style, raised sleeping space above. They were built to sell for $6,500$ with inflation accounted for. Shortly after their completion, it was stated that more than 3,000 people had toured the newly constructed bubble houses. The nearby Olympia School even closed early one afternoon so that its students could tour the Bubble Houses. The white Bubble House ==Status== The easternmost of the two bubble houses, painted yellow, received media attention in March 2012 because of its owner's proposal to replace it with a larger house. The historic structure was demolished to allow for the construction of the new house. (This was the easternmost bubble house located at 9096 SE Venus Street, Hobe Sound, Florida.) The only remaining bubble house is still standing, with the current owners intending to keep it in place. The westernmost bubble house, 9086 SE Venus Street, has received little or no attention in the media, although both houses were featured in a 2008 Inside Hobe Sound Tour sponsored by the local chamber of commerce. The bubble house is located on a five plus acre park. It is one mile from local beaches, and two miles from the residences of Celine Dion, Greg Norman and Tiger Woods. ==Media coverage== The two bubble houses were featured in Life magazine in its February 22, 1954, issue, which described them as \\"both hurricane-proof and bugproof\\".

He is currently the proprietor of Theo Randall at the InterContinental Hotel London Park Lane, although he is perhaps best known for being awarded a Michelin star at The River Café in London. ==Career== Randall's career began at Chez Max in Surbiton, London, where he trained in classical cooking for four years. He joined the team at The River Café in 1989. After a year he moved to California to work at Chez Panisse under chef Alice Waters for 12 months. He then returned to the UK where he spent fifteen years, ten of which were as Head Chef and silent partner back at The River Café where he gained his Michelin Star. Randall has been called the \\"unsung hero\\" of the restaurant, and has been credited with creating The River Café's signature dishes and making it an establishment that \\"changed Britain's restaurant culture for good\\". He left The River Café to set up his own restaurant when a space became available at the InterContinental London. Theo Randall at the InterContinental London opened in February 2007 as part of a £60 million refurbishment of the hotel. In an interview he stated that he felt the need to prove to himself that he could do it. The new venture went on to be named \\"Italian Restaurant of the Year\\" at the London Restaurant Awards after it had been open for two years. He has collaborated with Pizza Express, and created four pizzas for their autumn 2008 menu. It was the first time that the chain had collaborated with a celebrity chef. Randall has also attended food festivals, including Taste of London held in Regent's Park, and has been involved in the London Restaurant Festival. On television, he has frequently appeared on BBC One's Saturday Kitchen. In 2010, Theo started working with ASK Italian restaurants as their 'expert friend', developing menus and coming up with new dishes. In June 2015, he took his relationship with the brand further by becoming an investor in to the Azzurri Group, which owns and runs the restaurant chain. In 2013 he appeared as one of the mentors in the series The Chef's Protege. In 2015 he partnered with Gousto to bring them recipes from his latest book. InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) announced in August 2015 that InterContinental Bangkok in Thailand is set to become home to Randall’s first restaurant outside the UK. In March 2018 Theo Randall opened his first restaurant in Hong Kong, THEO MISTRAL by Theo Randall, at the InterContinental Grand Stanford Hong Kong. The trend continues with the opening of Theo Randall's Italian Kitchen in Zurich in June 2018. ==Personal life== He is married to Natalie, and together they have two children, Max and Lola. Lola is a student at the Lycee Francais Charles de Gaulle. They have lived in the Chalk Farm area of London since 2001 in a house that was built in the 1850s.

It was directed by Swedish filmmaker Mikael Håfström, and written by Miles Chapman and Jason Keller (under the anagram pen-name 'Arnell Jesko'). The first film to pair up Stallone and Schwarzenegger as co-leads, it follows Stallone's character Ray Breslin, a lawyer turned prison security tester who is incarcerated in the world's most secret and secure prison, aided in his escape by fellow inmate Emil Rottmayer, portrayed by Schwarzenegger. The film is the first installment of the Escape Plan film series. The film was released in the United States on October 18, 2013, received mixed reviews and grossed $137 million worldwide against a $54 million budget. ==Plot== Former prosecutor Ray Breslin co-owns Breslin-Clark, a security firm specializing in testing supermax prisons. Posing as an 'inmate' to study facilities from within and exploit weaknesses to escape, Breslin is driven by the murders of his wife and child by an escaped convict he had successfully prosecuted. Breslin and business partner Lester Clark receive a multimillion-dollar deal from CIA operative Jessica Miller to test a top secret prison for disappeared persons, but Breslin's team do not know the prison's location, to minimize the chance of outside help. Although this violates his own principles, Breslin agrees anyway, allowing himself to be captured in the guise of a Spanish terrorist named \\"Anthony Portos.\\" The plan goes awry when his captors remove a tracking microchip from his arm and drug him, preventing his colleagues from knowing where he has been taken. Breslin wakes up in a complex of glass cells and realizes that the warden, Hobbes, is not the man he was supposed to meet. He befriends inmate Emil Rottmayer, who works for modern-day Robin Hood Victor Mannheim. The duo stage a fight that allows Breslin to study the solitary confinement cell, which disorients and dehydrates prisoners with high-powered halogen lights. Realising the cell floors have rivets of steel instead of aluminium, Breslin has Rottmayer acquire a metal plate from Hobbes's office floor, before they and Muslim inmate Javed are again thrown into solitary. Using the metal plate, Breslin focuses the reflection from the lights to heat the steel rivets, shearing them when the steel expands. Finding a passageway below the floor, he discovers the prison is inside a massive cargo ship in the middle of the ocean. Breslin and Rottmayer continue to study the complex and learn the guards' routines. However, Hobbes reveals to Breslin that he is aware of his identity and, with the security commander, Drake, watching over him, will ensure Breslin spends the rest of his life in the prison. Breslin offers Hobbes information on Mannheim from Rottmayer in exchange for being released; Hobbes agrees. While Breslin feeds Hobbes false information about Mannheim, Breslin's colleagues Abigail Ross and Hush grow suspicious of Clark when Breslin's paycheck for the job is frozen. They discover from hacked documents that the prison, codenamed \\"The Tomb,\\" is owned by a for-profit organization linked to a private security contractor. Clark is revealed to be in contact with Hobbes about Breslin's imprisonment. Rottmayer has Javed convince Hobbes that he is double-crossing them, and Javed is allowed above deck for his nightly prayer, whereupon he uses a makeshift sextant to determine the ship's latitude. From this, Breslin and Rottmayer deduce they are in the Atlantic Ocean near Morocco. Breslin convinces prison physician Dr. Kyrie to help him and Rottmayer escape by sending an email to Mannheim, and transmits a false tap code message from his cell, convincing Hobbes that a riot will occur in cell block C. With security misdirected, Javed instigates a riot at cell block A, allowing him, Breslin, and Rottmayer to run toward the deck while a lockdown is initiated. Breslin kills Drake, but Javed is killed by Hobbes and his men. Breslin goes to the engine room to shut down the electrical systems, giving Rottmayer time to open the deck hatch before the backup generators come online, while a helicopter sent by Mannheim engages in a gunfight with the ship's crew. Rottmayer boards the helicopter while Breslin is flushed to the bottom of the ship by the automated water system after Hobbes reboots the main electrical system. Reaching the helicopter as Hobbes fires at him, Breslin shoots and blows up some oil barrels, killing Hobbes. The helicopter lands on a Moroccan beach, where Rottmayer reveals he is actually Mannheim and Jessica Miller is his daughter. \\"Portos\\" was a codeword to alert Mannheim that Breslin was an ally, and Hobbes was originally unaware that Breslin's cover story was fake. Later, Ross informs Breslin that they discovered Clark was offered a $5 million annual salary to become CEO of the Tomb's security company, should Breslin's imprisonment prove the ship was escape-proof. Hush tracked Clark to Miami and locked him in a shipping container bound for an unknown destination. ==CastProduction== Development Early reports in 2011 speculated that Bruce Willis was cast as Ray Breslin. It was revealed by producer Mark Canton on The Matthew Aaron Show that Jim Caviezel had signed on to the film, playing the prison warden Hobbes. British actor Vinnie Jones signed on to co- star as Drake, the ruthless prison guard. Variety and other media in the news stated that Amy Ryan, Vincent D'Onofrio, and 50 Cent had joined the cast of Escape Plan. It was confirmed in mid-April that 50 Cent would play the computer expert who was once incarcerated for cyber crimes helping Breslin's character escape, D'Onofrio would play the deputy director of the high-tech prison, and Ryan would play Stallone's business partner and his potential love interest. Filming In an interview with the British newspaper The Sun, Vinnie Jones stated that the film was to shoot April 16 to June 23 in New Orleans. Shooting for Escape Plan was also confirmed to take place in Louisiana in the spring of 2012. In August 2012, at The Expendables 2 conference, Arnold Schwarzenegger commented on the film and stated that filming had finished. ==Release== On April 9, 2013, it was officially announced that the film had been pushed back to a September 13, 2013 release and the film's title had been changed from The Tomb to Escape Plan. It was eventually released on October 18, 2013. Marketing On June 27, 2013, a debut trailer of Escape Plan was released through the gaming website IGN. ==Reception== Box office The film underperformed at the U.S. box office, debuting at number four on the box office chart with $9.89 million from 2,883 theaters and ultimately grossing only $25.1 million domestically. However, Escape Plan was an international box-office success, debuting at first place in several Asian and European markets, with the total international gross more than doubling its $50 million budget at $112.2 million, totaling up to a worldwide gross of $137.3 million. Critical response Escape Plan was met with mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 50%, based on reviews from 107 critics, with an average score of 5.4/10. The site's critical consensus states: \\"As much fun as it is to see Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger team up onscreen, Escape Plan fails to offer much more than a pale imitation of 1980s popcorn thrills.\\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 49 out of 100, based on 33 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \\"B+\\". Tom Huddleston of Time Out London gave the film two out of five stars, commenting that the film \\"would have made a perfect vehicle for, say, a Chuck Norris or even a Jean-Claude Van Damme. But these two redoubtable, enormously watchable old-school heroes deserve better.\\" Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the film four out of five stars, commenting that it \\"defies those who wrote off the abilities of its stars to cut the muscular mustard in today's youth-orientated cultural climate. These supposedly old dogs have plenty of life—but their effectiveness relies on the foundation of a smart script that plays to their strengths and the audience's perception of their star personas.\\" Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times said in his review: \\"Mikael Hafstrom, the director, pushes the suspense buttons efficiently, and the plot twists are disguised well enough for the not-very-demanding crowd this film will draw. The scenes with Mr. Stallone and Mr. Schwarzenegger are a little disappointing — it's their first pairing as top-billed co-stars, yet the script never gives them the kind of memorable exchange that makes fans howl with delight. But all in all, Escape Plan does what it sets out to do.\\" ==Sequels== In February 2017, it was announced that a sequel was then in development with Stallone confirmed to reprise his role as Ray Breslin. In the same report it was revealed that Steven C. Miller would direct the film, with Miles Chapman returning as screenwriter.https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/812145-escape- plan-2-director-confirmed-as-steven-c-miller Dave Bautista, 50 Cent, and Jaime King have also been cast in the film.

Goldschmidt (1877–1935) was a Belgian chemist, physicist, and engineer who first proposed the idea of standardized microfiche (microfilm). Goldschmidt was a polymath who also made advances in aviation and radio, among other fields. In 1913 he constructed a major radio facility at Laeken, Belgium, where in 1914 he and Raymond Braillard inaugurated Europe's first regular radio concert broadcasts. He was also a participant in the first and second international Solvay Conferences reviewing outstanding issues in chemistry and physics. ==Education and academic career== Educated in Brussels and Berlin, Goldschmidt was a professor of chemistry at the University of Brussels for some thirty years. ==Career== Microfilm In the first years of the twentieth century, he worked with Paul Otlet on the creation of microfilm, then known as \\"microphotographs. In 1906, he and Otlet proposed what they called the \\"livre microphotographique,\\" which they considered to be a cheaper, more space-saving means of storing data. In their 1906 essay \\"Sur une forme nouvelle du Livre: Le Livre Microphotographique,\\" Goldschmidt and Otlet wrote that from the point of view of scientific research, books are not the best possible means of storing information, because \\"access to the libraries is not always easy and delays in the transmission of books often discourage the most tenacious workers, to the detriment of scientific progress....Travel by scholars, the international exchange of scientific books between libraries, the copies or extracts requested from abroad, are seriously under-resourced.\\" Thus there is a need for \\"a new form of book that will help overcome these major inconveniences.\\" They proposed that a solution to the problem lay in photography, and proceeded to explain how a single card measuring 12.5 X 7.5 cm, providing 72 square cm of space (margins excluded) could contain the contents of an entire 72-page book. Radio During the first decade of the twentieth century, Belgium became interested in how the new technology of radio communication (then known as \\"télégraphie sans fil\\" (T.S.F.)) could be of value to the country. Interest initially centered on the need to establish effective communication throughout its sprawling central African colony, the Belgian Congo. A second major project would be the construction of a high-powered station in Belgium, that could be used to maintain contact with the colony. Much of the early developmental work was done under the patronage of the King Albert I, who had an early interest in the technology, including his own private laboratory.\\"International Telegraph Monument in Berne\\", The Marconigraph, December 1911, page 27. In 1909, the king made a tour of the Congo, and determined that there was a need to improve communications throughout its vast territory. There was also a need to establish reliable communication from Belgium to the colony.\\"De la T.S.F. au Congo-Belge et de l'école pratique de Laeken aux concerts radiophoniques\\" (Wireless in the Belgian Congo and from the Laeken Training School to Radio Concerts) by Bruno Brasseur, Cahiers d'Histoire de la Radiodiffusion, Number 118, October–December 2013. Goldschmidt was selected to take the leading role in the projects. His work in the radio field dated to 1907, when he had experimented with radiotelegraphy at the Brussels Palace of Justice; the experiments involved Tervuren, the citadel of Namur and to the observatory of Liege. The central site for the radio projects was established at the Villa Lacoste, located near Brussels on the grounds of the summer Royal Palace of Laeken. A training school for operators, workshops and a research laboratory were established at this location. Raymond Braillard, a French engineer, was appointed as both the Chief Engineer of the Congo facilities, and the director of the Laeken installations.\\"20th Anniversary of First Broadcast\\" by Raymond Braillard, The (Singapore) Straits Times, 25 April 1934, page 17 (reprinted from the British Broadcasting Corporation's World-Radio, 30 March 1934, page 446.)(nlb.gov.sg) Braillard went on to become the president of the Technical Committee of the International Broadcasting Union at Geneva, Switzerland. By the end of 1913 twelve radiotelegraph stations had been established to provide communication throughout the Belgian Congo.\\"Inventor Has Faith in Wireless\\", The Wireless Age, January 1914, page 338.La Télégraphie Sans Fil au Congo Belge by Robert B.

That same year also saw completion at Laeken of a high-powered radiotelegraph station used for transmissions to the colony.\\"International Commission for Scientific Radio-telegraphic Researches\\", Nature, 9 July 1914, page 490. The original site included eight towers tall, supporting the station's transmitting antenna. In the fall of 1913 it was reported that messages were now being successfully transmitted from Laeken to the Belgian Congo capital of Boma.\\"Belgium-Congo Wireless\\", New York Times, October 8, 1913, page 1. In the summer of 1914, the foundation was laid for construction of a new central antenna tower, planned to soar high, or taller than the Eiffel Tower.\\"Wireless Station Higher than the Eiffel Tower\\", Popular Mechanics, July 1914, page 76. However, World War I broke out in late July, and the next month Germany invaded Belgium, eventually occupying 90% of the country. To keep the valuable Laeken radio facility from falling under enemy control, in August explosives and straw-fed fires were used to level the radio towers and completely destroy the equipment, a major setback to Goldschmidt's developmental work of the previous three years.\\"The Destruction of the Brussels Wireless Station\\" by Marcel G. de Gallaix, The Cambridge Magazine, 21 November 1914, page 134. First European scheduled broadcasts Laeken radiotelephone equipment, using a Moretti high-frequency spark transmitter and Marzi microphone. A series of weekly radio concerts was inaugurated on 28 March 1914.\\"Radio Telephony: Article V\\" by Alfred N. Goldsmith, The Wireless Age, May 1917, page 565. The Congo stations and the high-powered Laeken station had standard spark-gap transmitters which were only capable of transmitting the dots-and- dashes of Morse code. However, prior to the destruction of the Laeken facility, experimental work was done to develop equipment capable of making audio transmissions, which led to Europe's first organized entertainment radio broadcasts. (These appear to be the second oldest known regularly scheduled radio concerts, preceded only in the United States by Charles \\"Doc\\" Herrold in San Jose, California, who began a similar series of weekly concerts in the summer of 1912.)\\"Musical Concert by Wireless Telephone\\", San Diego (California) Union, 23 July 1912, page 19. Because the spark transmitters required trained operators who could send and receive Morse code, Goldschmidt and Braillard began to investigate whether the stations could be converted to radiotelephone operations which would be easier to staff. In 1913 they began work on audio transmissions using a special high-frequency spark transmitter developed by Italian Riccardo Moretti,\\"Moretti's Wireless Phone\\", The Wireless Age, January 1914, page 338. which was roughly capable of producing the \\"continuous-wave\\" signals needed to make audio transmissions. (Moretti's transmitter only approximated a true continuous-wave transmission, which limited sound quality, and reportedly when no audio was being sent, instead of silence the result was \\"a terrible noise in the ears\\"). The common practice at this time for \\"modulating\\" the transmission in order to encode sound was to insert a microphone in the aerial transmission line. This required a robust microphone that could handle strong electrical currents. In the fall of 1913, the Laeken experimenters began to employ a microphone that had been developed by Italian Giovanni Battista Marzi. Initial tests conducted in 1913 were heard by nearby amateur radio enthusiasts in Belgium and northern France, who were intrigued because previously they had only heard Morse code transmissions. The equipment was perfected to the point that by 13 March 1914 a test transmission was successfully heard at the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, about away. Due to the increasing interest in the test transmissions, it was decided to introduce a series of concerts to be given at 5 p.m. each Saturday. The first of these concerts was given on 28 March 1914, and consisted of a mixture of live performers and phonograph records.\\"Hear Tenor Through Wireless\\", Washington Evening Star, 29 March 1914, Part one, page 2. On this date a second concert was given at 8:30 p.m., which was dedicated to the Belgian royal family. (Belgium's queen, Elisabeth, had shown an early interest in the radio experiments. A crystal receiver had been provided for her use, and she also received instruction in receiving Morse code.) Very little information is available about the subsequent programmes, in part because of the loss of records caused by the chaos of World War I. Raymond Braillard later stated that the concerts lasted for only about four months, ending in July due to the start of the war. Entertainment radio broadcasts would not resume in Europe until November 1919, when a station established by Hans Idzerda, PCGG, began weekly concerts from The Hague in Holland, and they did not return to Belgium until 1923. On 28 March 1934, the Institut National de Radiodiffusion produced a broadcast commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the debut concert.\\"By the Radio Editor\\", Washington Evening Star, 15 April 1934, Part four, page F-9. Belgian Congo work Goldschmidt worked extensively in the Belgian Congo, where he set up a telegraph and telephone network. While in the Congo, he also devised an amphibious train and a wood-burning truck to be used in the colony. Popular Laboratory of Electricity In 1908 he opened a Popular Laboratory of Electricity in Brussels, a sort of museum. Aviation Goldschmidt developed an interest in aviation, and in 1909 constructed a dirigible balloon, La Belgique. Microfilm library Goldschmidt continued to be interested in microphotography throughout his life. He invented reading machines and film processes. In 1925, he and Otlet described an easily manufactured \\"microphotographic library.\\" It consisted of \\"pocket-sized\\" viewing equipment and a portable cabinet that was one meter wide, one meter high, and about ten centimeters deep, and that was capable of holding, on microfilm, 18,750 volumes of 350 pages each, the equivalent of books that would fill 468 meters of conventional library shelving. ==Death== Goldschmidt died on 4 May 1935, and is buried in the Brussels Communal Cemetery. ==References *Solvay Conferences Category:1877 births Category:1935 deaths Category:Belgian physicists Category:People from Brussels ","title":"Robert Goldschmidt"},{"id":"35313240","text":"Olive is an unincorporated community in Olive Township, St. Joseph County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. ==History== A post office opened at Olive in 1836, but was soon discontinued, in 1837.

He attended the University of Barcelona,UB.edu then went to Buenos Aires, Argentina to teach. In 1895, after five years away, Portet returned to Spain and soon got involved in an insurrection. He fled to Paris where in 1896 he met Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia, founder of the Escuela Moderna or Modern School movement. He returned to Barcelona to get information and report on the radicals being tortured there. He then returned to Paris where he ran the publishing house Ferrer had established. After Ferrer was executed in 1909, Portet led a mass demonstration in Paris in front of the Spanish embassy. Though Ferrer left him his house in Paris, his publishing house and stock in Barcelona, and shares in two companies to enable Portet to carry on Ferrer's work, Portet was arrested and expelled from France. Seeking to carry on the work of the Escuela Moderna movement, Portet fled to Liverpool, England where he taught Spanish at the Commercial College and Portet helped to set up an anarcho-communist school in the Toxteth Co-operative Hall. In 1915, Portet met American radical and fellow exile, Margaret Sanger, in a Liverpool cafe. Though married with children, he began an affair with Sanger, who agreed to become the English director of Ferrer's Paris publishing firm. After the two travelled together to London, Wales, Paris and Spain, Sanger decided to return to Canada, pick up her children and then move with them to Paris to be with Portet. However, she was unable to return immediately, and a few months later the younger child, Peggy, died. In mourning, she delayed her return still longer. In the interim, Portet, suffering from tuberculosis, died suddenly on May 10, 1917 in a nursing home in Paris. ==See also== * Margaret Sanger * Modern School (United States) * Escuela Moderna * Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia * Anarchism ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Avrich, Paul.

Vb cyclones are rare events which occur on average only 2.3 times per year. ==Cyclogenesis== Relief map of Alpine region of Europe The northwestern Mediterranean and the Gulf of Genoa in particular, are not only a transition area for passing cyclones, but are frequently areas of cyclogenesis. Low pressure areas move into or are formed as a result of North Atlantic air entering the Mediterranean Sea between the Alps and the Massif Central, via the Rhone Valley, or via the Carcassonne gap between the Pyrenees and Massif Central. This cold and moist air enters the Mediterranean basin, and is deflected by the high mountains of northwest Corsica, which divert the air mass to the northeast, triggering cool and wet Libeccio winds in response into the Ligurian Sea, which in turn hit the western Apennines located in the immediate vicinity of the sea. Several factors that have special relevance in the development of depressions south of the Alps are: * The thermal contrast between land and sea. * Interaction between the polar front jet stream and the subtropical jet stream. * Effect of northerly flow over the Alps, enhancing cyclogenetic activity along the southern slopes. * Effect of the concave curvature of the southern slopes of the Alps, enhancing cyclonic formation. A complex interaction is established between the orography of Liguria and the contrast between the cold and humid air mass and the warmer water of the Ligurian Sea, the process ends with the formation of a low pressure area over the Ligurian Sea, just near the city of Genoa. Genoa low cyclogenesis can occur at any time of year, though usually situated further south during the summer. Cyclogenesis is shifted to the east depending on the amount of cold air entering the Po Valley, and generally shifts to the Gulf of Venice when little enters the valley. ==Effects on climate== The depressions bear rain, often intense, on the Ligurian coast and hills of Tuscany, due to orographic lift which affects the southern side of the Apennines. The area of low pressure is slow moving, and may follow a trajectory from west to east, then going on to affect the regions of the Adriatic, or move from the north-west to south-east down along the Tyrrhenian Sea: in this last case, the structure will reach the same cyclonic area of formation of Tyrrhenian depressions, although not related to the latter. Van Bebber cyclone tracks Map of cyclone tracks over Europe, showing divergence of track V over the Ligurian sea and north Adriatic Most Genoa lows remain stationary or leave a residual trough to the south of the Alps. Three principal tracks which they typically follow were identified by Wilhelm Jakob van Bebber who classified European windstorm tracks (\\"Zyklonenbahnen\\" in German) in 1891. To this date, track V of the latter group has remained in common use, unlike the large majority of van Bebber's tracks. The V track is linked to flooding events in central and eastern Europe, low pressure areas (south of the Alps) can track across France into the Mediterranean Sea where they pick up additional moisture, or form, and then move into central and eastern or southern Europe. the tracks diverge from the Genoa low formation area along the following pathways. Vb track A strong southwesterly flow in the upper atmosphere leads the lows to the northeast and north- northeast, (\\"Zugstrasse Vb\\" Van Bebber) towards the Vienna Basin. The lows then glide over colder and denser air from the northwest and are lifted orographically by the Bohemian Massif, Ore Mountains, Sudetes, Beskids and Tatra Mountains. The warm and moist air masses cause prolonged and abundant precipitation during slow Meridional flow over the upper catchments of both the southern and northern European Watershed. Flooding then progresses down their major rivers of central Europe. This 'Vb-track' displays a high potential for large summer floods in Europe. Although the link between large summer floods and the Vb track have also been described as having a significant but weak correlation. Examples of flooding events which follow this pattern are: * St. Mary Magdalene's flood * 1997 Central European flood from the lows \\"Xolska\\" and \\"Zoe\\". * 2002 European floods from the lows \\"Hanne\\" and \\"Ilse\\". * 2005 European floods * 2009 European floods * 2010 Central European floods from the low \\"Yolanda\\". * 2013 European floods * 2014 Southeast Europe floods Due to the expected warming of the future climate it is predicted that the annuality of Vb-cyclones will decrease. The decrease in Vb-cyclones could be caused by the shift of the cyclone track over Europe to the north. Modelling has shown that precipitation from future Vb-cyclones will have a greater impact on the eastern coasts of the Mediterranean Sea and a lesser impact on the Alpine region compared to the precipitation pattern of current Vb-cyclones. Vc track The Vc track draws the lows across the Panonian plain towards the Carpathian Mountains and on towards western Ukraine and Moldova. Vd track If there is a strong anticyclone over the Balkans, Turkey and the Black Sea, the usual track of the low is southeasterly, skirting the northern coast of the Mediterranean Sea. It is this track that moves the low across the Tyrrhenian Sea. Even after the primary low has moved out of the Tyrrhenian Sea-central Mediterranean area, if a residual trough remains south of the Alps, as is often the case, new centers can develop and occasionally move southeastward along the west coast of Italy. It is also common that a Genoa Low that has moved to the southwest will stall and become stationary, just to the west of the foot of the Italian boot, and this often will be associated with new low centers developing to the east over the Ionian Sea. In this case, gale force Bora are typically generated by the time the depression moves into the Ionian Sea. ==References * Upper-level low moving south - Cyclogenesis in Genoa Bay.

One of the reasons the Romans first colonized the area immediately to the west of the River Danube and established their regional capital at Aquincum (now part of Óbuda, in northern Budapest) is so that they could utilize and enjoy the thermal springs. There are still ruins visible today of the enormous baths that were built during that period. The new baths that were constructed during the Turkish period (1541–1686) served both bathing and medicinal purposes, and some of these are still in use to this day. Budapest gained its reputation as a city of spas in the 1920s, following the first realization of the economic potential of the thermal waters in drawing in visitors. Indeed, in 1934 Budapest was officially ranked as a \\"City of Spas\\". Construction of the Király Baths started in 1565, and most of the present-day building dates from the Turkish period, including most notably the fine cupola-topped pool. The Rudas Baths are centrally placed – in the narrow strip of land between Gellért Hill and the River Danube – and also an outstanding example of architecture dating from the Turkish period. The central feature is an octagonal pool over which light shines from a 10 m diameter cupola, supported by eight pillars. The Gellért Baths and Hotel were built in 1918, although there had once been Turkish baths on the site, and in the Middle Ages a hospital. In 1927 the Baths were extended to include the wave pool, and the effervescent bath was added in 1934. The well-preserved Art Nouveau interior includes colourful mosaics, marble columns, stained glass windows and statues. The Lukács Baths are also in Buda and are also Turkish in origin, although they were only revived at the end of the 19th century. This was also when the spa and treatment centre were founded. All around the inner courtyard there are marble tablets recalling the thanks of patrons who were cured there. Since the 1950s it has been regarded as a centre for intellectuals and artists. The Széchenyi Baths are one of the largest bathing complexes in all Europe, and the only “old” medicinal baths to be found in the Pest side of the city. The indoor medicinal baths date from 1913 and the outdoor pools from 1927. There is an atmosphere of grandeur about the whole place with the bright, largest pools resembling aspects associated with Roman baths, the smaller bath tubs reminding one of the bathing culture of the Greeks, and the saunas and diving pools borrowed from traditions emanating in northern Europe. The three outdoor pools (one of which is a fun pool) are open all year, including winter. Indoors there are over ten separate pools, and a whole host of medical treatments is also available. {  + Thermal baths in Budapest - !

Avoth was a promising amateur boxer who turned professional in 1967. He held the Welsh Heavyweight Championship title from 1971 to 1973. He is the brother of Eddie Avoth, who was also a boxer and who became British, and Commonwealth Light-heavyweight champion, and European Light-heavyweight challenger. ==Boxing career== Avoth boxed out of the Victoria Park boxing club as a youth, and whilst still a teenager, he won the Welsh Amateur Boxing Association title, beating Del Phillips, who at 6 ft 5ins was seven inches taller than Avoth.Jones (2009), p.1 The Welsh title allowed Avoth to enter the European championships, but was forced to retire after a torn rib ligament. Avoth turned professional in 1967 and like Eddie Avoth, his older brother before him, he joined the stable of Merthyr based trainer, Eddie Thomas. Avoth's first professional bout was against London-based fighter Doyley Brown at Grosvenor House in Mayfair, an undercard to a Ken Buchanan match. Avoth stopped his opponent via technical knockout in the fifth of the six round fight. This was the first in a string of seven unbeaten fights, including a victory over Paul Brown at the National Sporting Club in January 1968. Despite this promising start, his allusions of following his brother as a major contender were broken by four straight loses. Avoth was back to winning ways in the first half of 1969, remaining unbeaten in six fights, though all were through points decision. His run was broken in May when he faced future British heavyweight champion Bunny Johnson at the Midlands Sporting Club in Solihull. The eight round fight went the full distance, with the bout being awarded to Johnson. This was followed by a draw against his amateur title opponent Del Phillips, before Avoth again faced a future British heavyweight champion, Danny McAlinden. The fight against McAlinden was part of a national heavyweight competition held in Mayfair, London for a prize of £1,000. The eight-man knockout contest was scheduled for three rounds per bout and Avoth faced Manchester-based fighter Obe Hepburn in the quarter finals. After beating Hepburn on points, he then beat Billy Wynter by the same decision in the semi-final. The other semi-final was between McAlinden and another future champion, Richard Dunn. McAlinden knocked out Dunn in the first round, and then managed to stop Avoth in the final again in the first round, but this time via technical knockout. Avoth fought once more in 1969, a loss to Central Area champion, Billy Aird, before readjusting his sights on a new challenge, the Welsh heavyweight title, held by North Walian Carl Gizzi. 1970 began with mixed results for Avoth. He lost to Charlie White, a fighter he had faced four times previously as a professional, before he recorded a win over Terry Feeley at the National Sporting Club. He then lost to Cliff Field before a Wales heavyweight title eliminator with Del Phillips was arranged. The fight was arranged as the top billing at Swansea's Top Rank Suite on 22 June 1970. The night started poorly for the Avoth family when younger brother Leslie was beaten by Santos Martins on the undercard, and Avoth's ambitions to become Welsh heavyweight were dented after Phillips was given the decision by referee Adrian Morgan after the match went the full ten rounds. Avoth finished 1970 with another two losses; to Peter Boddington in London and then to Bunny Johnson in Aberavon, both on points decision. In 1971, and now managed by his father Jack, Avoth got his shot at the Welsh heavyweight title, which was still held by Carl Gizzi and had now been undefended in the six years since Gizzi won the title. The title fight was taken out of Wales and was staged at the National Sporting Club in London. The fight went the full ten rounds and Avoth was given the decision, making him the new Wales heavyweight champion. 1971 ended with two more wins, over Guinea Roger and Brian Jewitt; but 1972 began with two loses, which included the first time he had ever lost a professional fight by knockout when Roger Tighe stopped him in the sixth round of an eight-round contest. In April 1972, Avoth defended his Welsh title for the first time when he again faced Del Phillips. The two met in Swansea and again the fight went the distance, but this time referee Adrian Morgan gave the fight to Avoth. Avoth defended his title just once more when he beat Gene Innocent in Swansea in June 1973. Avoth was to fight just once more, a home bout in Sophia Gardens Pavilion in his home town of Cardiff. His challenger, Phil Matthew, knocked Avoth out in the first round, and Avoth retired from the sport soon after.Jones (2009), p.2 ==Professional boxing record== - align=\\"center\\" colspan=822 Wins (4 knockouts, 18 decisions), 20 Losses (6 knockouts, 14 decisions), 3 Draws -

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The building is located on State Street, in the historical center of Santa Barbara, California. ==History== The first adobe building on the site was constructed by Augustin Jansens, a Belgian native, and his wife, Maria Antonia Pico. In 1872, it was bought by a local landowner, Bruno Orella, also notable for Orella Adobes, and his wife, Mercedes Gonzalez. The descendants of the Orella family owned the building until the 1950s. From the original building, fragments of the walls are incorporated in the current structure. In 1927, a new house in the Spanish Colonial Revival style was constructed. The project was designed by local architectural firm Edwards, Plunkett, and Howell. In 1932, the building was expanded, in 1946 remodeled, and in 1987 it was returned to the original 1937 shape. After World War II, the building hosted the Copper Coffee Pot restaurant established in memory of a doctor, John Manning, and managed by his wife. The restaurant was a popular social place. It closed on September 30, 1985. The last owner of the restaurant was Birk, hence the name of the building. Currently, the building is occupied by an Italian restaurant with a different name. ==Architecture== The Janssens–Orella–Birk Building is a two-floor structures which is L-shaped and has both flat roof and tile parts. The front of the building is on State Street, the main commercial street in downtown Santa Barbara, and it is located between two buildings constructed much later but built in a similar style. The exterior repeats the original 1927 design, whereas the interior has been considerably altered by later changes. The rear of the building faces a secondary passages and a parking lot. State Street runs on the slope of the hill and the building is therefore skewed. The northeastern (facing State Street) facade features a balcony and is open as a central patio. On the left side of the patio, there is a wall fountain in the shape of a lion head. ==References== Category:Adobe buildings and structures in California Category:Buildings and structures in Santa Barbara, California Category:Houses in Santa Barbara County, California Category:Houses completed in 1927 Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:National Register of Historic Places in Santa Barbara County, California Category:Spanish Colonial Revival architecture in California Category:1927 establishments in California ","title":"Janssens–Orella–Birk Building"},{"id":"35313439","text":"Morrigan was a traditional music group formed in 1978 in Seattle by folk musicians Marc Bridgham, Mary Malloy, and William Pint.

The seventh and final series, entitled Skins Redux, began airing on E4 on 1 July 2013 and ended on 5 August 2013. The final series sees the return of several characters from the first two generations of the show. ==Summary== Notably, all of the characters featured have undergone enormous personality changes since their last appearances: Effy has cast her party-hard lifestyle and issues aside, and has become more mature and ambitious. Naomi has lost much of her ambition as a principled young woman and is now a layabout and stoner. Emily has become more confident. Cassie has overcome her mental issues, but has become solitary, serious, principled and tired, and Cook has become much more subdued, serious and calculated, as a result of having spent years on the run. In addition, the series leaves behind its traditional setting in Bristol, moving to the less familiar cities of London (around Canary Wharf in Fire and near Finchley Road in Pure) as well as Manchester (in Rise). Its subject matter moves on from teenage problems to more adult issues, such as insider trading, terminal illness, rough living and the criminal underworld. ==Background== On 8 March 2012, Channel 4 confirmed that Skins would come to an end after a seventh series of six episodes, which would feature characters from the first and second generations. The third generation would not be involved in the seventh series. Channel 4 promised \\"a celebration of this truly iconic series\\". Jamie Brittain, who had quit the show after series 5, returned as part of the writing staff. Brittain also revealed via Twitter that filming would begin in late October.Twitter / jamiehotsors: @Lewis_v Later this month x Series seven marked a departure in style with former stars Hannah Murray, Jack O'Connell and Kaya Scodelario returning to the roles which had shaped their careers in three individual stories, each one broadcast in two one-hour parts.

Lily Loveless (Naomi) and Kat Prescott (Emily) also appeared in guest roles.

A small bungalow resort was the only tourist infrastructure, electricity in the town was occasionally available in the weekends by a generator. In the early 1990s, the town was affected, as well as the whole of the surrounding coastal area of a palm disease which affected all the town's coconut trees, so all the town's coconut trees have now died. What remains is a long sandy beach, along a coastline that is free of dangerous currents. 21st century In recent years the town has not only obtained full electricity connection, but also restaurants and several lodges and bungalows and luxury real estate.

According to Nigel West the SIS believed that Ellis had been a spy for the Abwehr.Nigel West, ELLIS, DICK, Dictionary of British Intelligence. Ellis was accused by Chapman Pincher of being a traitor.

In 1914, he travelled to England, intending to study at Oxford University. ==Military service== Following the outbreak of the First World War (1914–18), Dick Ellis enlisted as a Private in the Territorial Force, and became part of the 100th Provisional Battalion, which later was renamed the 29th (CITY OF LONDON) Battalion. He saw action on the Western Front and was wounded three times, before being commissioned as an officer in September 1917.Cain, Frank, 'Ellis, Charles Howard (Dick) (1895–1975)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 4 April 2012. In 1918, he transferred to the Intelligence Corps and there served for several months, before the Armistice of 11 November 1918. In 1919, Ellis then was sent to Transcaspia, as part of the Malleson mission against the Bolsheviks in Turkmenistan; and he participated in the Afghan War of 1919; that same year, Ellis was awarded the OBE (military) for being a good soldier.Mr C. H. Ellis (Obituaries) The Times 16 July 1975. ==Intelligence career== After leaving the army, Ellis resumed his studies, learning Russian at St Edmund Hall, Oxford and the Sorbonne. He joined the Secret Intelligence Service in Paris in 1923. Ellis held diplomatic and consular posts in Turkey and the Balkans. In December 1923, Ellis became British vice-consul in Berlin and later worked in Vienna and Geneva as foreign correspondent for the Morning Post. While in Geneva, Ellis wrote a major book on the League of Nations. Although for long attributed to British-Finnish League official Konni Zilliacus, it has been proven that Ellis was the real author. James Cotton,‘”The Standard Work in English on the League” and Its Authorship' In 1938 he was brought back to England to supervise the German embassy's telephone lines. Ribbentrop's staff soon developed an uncharacteristic discretion during telephone conversations. Ellis was subsequently sent to Liverpool to establish a mail censorship centre. In summer 1940 he became deputy-head of British Security Co-ordination in New York. Here, in the period before Pearl Harbor, Ellis briefed J Edgar Hoover in counter-espionage techniques. He provided the blueprint from which William J. Donovan was able to set up the Office of Strategic Services and consequently was awarded the American Legion of Merit.\\"Mr C. H. Ellis\\", H. M.

However, it failed to act and Pincher believes that Ellis was subsequently blackmailed into spying for the Soviets.Chapman Pincher, Letters:\\"Security risks\\", The Times, 6 May 1981 Ellis was subsequently sent to Singapore on the staff of the United Kingdom Commissioner-General for South-East Asia. He was 'controller Western Hemisphere' and 'controller Far East' during the early 1950s. Ellis also helped set up the Australian Secret (Intelligence) Service. He retired in 1953 and was awarded the CMG. A lengthy investigation into the allegations against Ellis was code-named \\"Emerton\\". A former in-house CIA historian, Thomas F. Troy, stated that James Angleton had warned him in 1963 that Ellis was under investigation as a suspected Soviet agent.Lycett, Andrew. Untold tales; Books, The Times, 6 June 1996 Pincher alleged that in 1965 Ellis was challenged and admitted to spying for Germany.

Fatherland UK... The Independent 3 March 2000 Malleson mission Isaak Brodsky's The Execution of the Twenty Six Baku Commissars In retirement C. H. Ellis wrote a book about the Malleson mission: The Transcaspian Episode. Among the incidents addressed in the book was the execution of 26 Commissars – including Stepan Shahumyan – of a Soviet client, the Centrocaspian Dictatorship, in September 1918.Macintyre, Ben. Massacre that was a triumph for the Soviet propaganda machine, The Times, 11 February 2012 The commissars had earlier fled the Mussavatist Azerbaijan advanced guard in the September Days of 1918 just before the Turks occupied Baku. They planned to sail to Astrakhan, the only Caspian port still in Bolshevik hands but were instead dumped at the port of Krasnovodsk where they were summarily executed by the local Menshevik garrison. Ellis fundamentally disagreed with claims by the Socialist Revolutionary journalist Vadim Chaikin that British officers were responsible for the deaths of the Commisars, pointing out that it had been a triumph for Soviet propaganda. In a letter to The Times in 1961, Ellis placed the blame with the \\"Menshevik-Socialist Revolutionary\\" Transcaspian Government, which had jurisdiction over the prisoners. According to Ellis the claim of British involvement arose only after the Socialist Revolutionaries found the need to ingratiate themselves with the stronger Bolsheviks.C. H.

The central character in two historical novels by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sir Nigel and The White Company, is loosely based on Neil Loring. ==Origins== He was born in Chalgrave, Bedfordshire,The Loring Genealogy online. By Charles Henry Pope assisted by Catherine Peabody Loring; Murray and Emery Company, Cambridge, Massachusetts. 1917. Book Page xi (Introduction) the son of Roger Loring by his wife Cassandra Perrott. ==Career== Loring fought at the Battle of Sluys in 1340, following which he was knighted for his bravery and awarded a pension of £20 a year. In 1347 he was with King Edward III during the Siege of Calais, and the following year was invested as one of the founding Knights of the Garter. By 1351 Loring was chamberlain to the Prince of Wales, and a member of his council. He accompanied the prince to Aquitaine in 1353, and distinguished himself in the Poitiers Campaign, during which he was \\"appointed to be in attendance on the prince's person\\". He was sent back to England after the Battle of Poitiers on 19 September 1356 to report news of the English victory. For his service to the prince he was given an annual pension of £83 6s 8d for life as well as lands in Wales. In November 1359 Loring was back in France accompanying Edward III on his military campaign that resulted in the Treaty of Brétigny, signed on 25 May 1360. He was appointed a guardian of the truce and one of the commissioners responsible for overseeing the transfer of lands as agreed in the treaty. Loring was with the Prince of Wales in Aquitaine in 1366, and fought in the prince's division at the Battle of Nájera on 3 April 1367. In 1369 he served under Sir Robert Knolles at the Siege of Domme, and the following year in Poitou, under the Earl of Pembroke. ==Later life== Loring spent his latter days in retirement at his ancestral home in Chalgrave, where in 1365 he had received a royal licence to enclose a park. He died on 18 March 1386, and according to Leland was buried in the church of the Black Canons at Dunstable. The central character of Sir Nigel Loring in two historical novels by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle – Sir Nigel and The White Company – is loosely based on Neil Loring. ==Benefactions== Loring was the founder of a chantry in Chalgrave church. In the list of Benefactors to St. Albans Abbey, Sir Nigel is introduced as the donor of 10 marks and depicted as an old man with a red cap or hood on his head, wearing red shoes, covered with a white robe powdered with Garters, and holding a purse in his left hand. ==Marriage and children== He married Margaret de Beaupel, the daughter, and apparently the heiress, of Ralph de Beaupel whose home was the sub-manor of Beaupel, in the parish of Knowstone, North Devon. There exists today about 1 mile SW of Knowstone village the still-important farmhouse called \\"Beaple's Barton\\", bordered to the south by Beaple's Moor and to the north by Beaple's Wood. He appears in ancient records as \\"Nele Loring of Knowston-Beaupell\\". By marriage he also came to hold the manor of Landkey, 2 miles east of Barnstaple and 16 miles west of Knowstone. They had two daughters and co-heiresses: *Isabel Loring (died 21 August 1400) who married twice:http://thepeerage.com/p48958.htm#i489577 **Firstly at some time before 1382, as his second wife, to Sir William Cogan, feudal baron of Bampton.

He was also a member of the Privy Council of Ireland and was regarded by three successive English monarchs as a valued servant of the Crown. He was noted for his integrity, but was criticised for remaining in office when old age and illness had made him clearly unfit for it. He is notable as the fifth of the six husbands of Jenet Sarsfield. ==Background and early career== He was the eldest son of Christopher Plunket of Dunsoghly Castle, Finglas, and his wife Catherine Bermingham.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221–1921 1926 John Murray London p.208 His grandfathers, Thomas Plunket and Philip Bermingham, had presided respectively over the Court of Common Pleas and the Court of King's Bench. His precise date of birth is unknown but Elrington Ball believed that he was at least 85 when he died.Ball 1926 p.140 He joined the Inner Temple and was Master of Revels there in 1518. He entered the service of Richard Delahide, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, who had married his sister Jenet; Delahide arranged for him to be appointed a clerk in the Common Pleas.Ball 1926 p.208 He inherited Dunsoghly sometime before 1547. 200px Dunsoghly Castle, Plunket's family home ==Political career== In the reign of King Edward VI he was described as the right-hand man of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Edward Bellingham, whom he served as Comptroller of the Household; his job included such mundane tasks as providing beds and beer for the Deputy's entourage. He is also said to have enjoyed the confidence of the Lord Protector, the Duke of Somerset.Ball F. Elrington History of Dublin Vol.6 1920 Dublin Alexander Thom and Co. p.66 Under Mary I he became a member of the Privy Council and sat on several legal commissions; he is said to have enjoyed the Queen's personal goodwill. Mary's regard for Plunket was shared by Elizabeth I who as soon as she succeeded her sister as Queen appointed him her Lord Chief Justice.Ball 1926 p.208 ==Lord Chief Justice== He remained a member of the Privy Council to the end of his life life, and until his last years, when his health failed, was one of its most diligent members. In 1562 he went to England to report to the Queen on Irish affairs. In 1565, after the long- standing feud between Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond and Gerald Fitzgerald, 15th Earl of Desmond had erupted into the conflict known as the Battle of Affane, Plunket was entrusted, together with the Lord Justice of Ireland, Sir Nicholas Arnold, with holding an inquiry into the causes of the dispute, and in 1567 he oversaw the confiscation of certain of the Desmond properties. He was knighted the same year.Ball 1920 p.67 During the cess controversy, where almost all of the landowners of the Pale objected to the taxation reforms proposed by the Lord Deputy, Sir Henry Sidney, Plunket was almost alone in supporting Sidney, and earned his gratitude as a result (although Sidney privately admitted that he was concerned about Plunket's fitness for office, in view of his age and failing health). Successive administrations praised Plunket's diligence and incorruptibility. However, from about 1577 complaints were increasingly made about his unfitness for office due to his great age and ill health: \\"an old man, and evil able to attend his place with diligence.Crawford, Jon.G A Star Chamber Court in Ireland-the Court of Castle Chamber 1571–1641 2005 Four Courts Press p.103 ==Last years and death== He remained in office until his death, by which time he was well into his 80s, and said to be infirm and blind. Although his third marriage to the much-married Jenet Sarsfield (who had already buried four husbands, and would marry one more time) seems to have been happy enough, he was troubled by a long lawsuit between Jenet and her stepson Edward Cusack. Not surprisingly he took his wife's side in the dispute and was accused by Edward of corruption as a result, to which charge he indignantly replied that he had served the Queen uprightly since the beginning of her reign and had never in his life written anything but the truth.Ball 1920 p.67 After a long decline in health, he died in 1582. In his will he noted that the money which Jenet had brought him made him \\"none the richer\\"; however he lists among his valuables an impressive collection of silver. He was noted for charitable works: he built two chapels, and a room over a local mineral spring.Ball 1926 p.208 One of the chapels contains a carving on which the initials of John and Jenet are visible. Although he was outwardly a member of the Church of Ireland, (his sister, Margaret, married John Garvey, Archbishop of Armagh), he is said to have practised the Roman Catholic faith in private.Lennon, Colm Sixteenth-century Ireland- the Incomplete Conquest Gill and Macmilan 1994 p.313 ==Family== Plunket married firstly Elizabeth Preston; secondly Catherine, sister of Sir Thomas Luttrell; and thirdly Jenet Sarsfield.Ball 1926 pp.208–9 All his children were from his marriage to Catherine Luttrell. They were: *James, who married Catherine FitzWilliam, daughter of Sir Thomas FitzWilliam of Merrion Castle; after his death she remarried Christopher Preston, 4th Viscount Gormanston, and died in 1602; *Robert, who married Anne Plunket; *Alice, who married Richard Netterville, and died in 1607; *Janet who married firstly Thomas Marward, titular Baron Skryne, and secondly Nicholas Nugent; *Anne, who married Wiliam Bermingham; *an unnamed daughter who married Barnaby Skurlock. James predeceased him and Dunsoghly passed to his grandson Sir Christopher Plunket. ==Character== Plunket was a popular and respected figure, known as \\"good Sir John Plunket\\", and he seems to have had remarkably few enemies. Despite the attack on his probity by Edward Cusack he was much praised for his integrity. Only in his last years was he criticised for clinging to office when he was clearly unfit for it.Crawford p.103 A certain arrogance about his family's lineage was considered to be one of his few faults. ==References== Category:Members of the Privy Council of Ireland Category:1497 births Category:1582 deaths Category:People from Dublin (city) Category:16th-century Irish people Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland Category:Lords Chief Justice of Ireland ","title":"John Plunket (judge)"},{"id":"35313867","text":"Soumya Sarkar (Bengali: সৌম্য সরকার) (born 25 February 1993) is a Bangladeshi cricketer.

During the morning of April 3, a large low-pressure area and associated frontal boundaries tracked across the Southern US Plains. Initially, environmental conditions did not favor the development of tornadoes. However, an outflow boundary from an area of storms in Oklahoma moved southwards before stalling over the Dallas–Fort Worth area. This allowed the formation of individual supercells, which would produce numerous tornadoes in the region. Many of these tornadoes occurred in the afternoon and evening hours of the day. One of these tornadoes was an EF3 tornado which struck areas of Forney, Texas, damaging or destroying multiple homes and businesses; this tornado would be the strongest confirmed during the outbreak. However, the costliest tornado was of EF2 intensity, and struck the counties of Ellis and Dallas, causing roughly $400 million in damages and damaging or destroying hundreds of homes. The same tornado also injured 10 people, but did not cause any fatalities. Throughout the duration of the outbreak, there were 22 confirmed tornadoes, though 17 of them were rated EF0—the lowest rating on the enhanced Fujita scale. Along with the tornadoes, numerous hail and wind reports were received by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) that day, though it is unclear which were directly associated with the storm complex. However, severe weather in Texas resulted in excess of $1 billion in damages, mostly due to the tornadoes. It was estimated that at least 1,100 homes in the metropolitan area were damaged in the outbreak, including at least 349 that were destroyed. Despite hitting heavily populated areas, however, no deaths were reported. However, a total of 29 injuries were confirmed. ==Meteorological synopsis== Satellite image of the low-pressure area and frontal supercells associated with the outbreak A low pressure system and associated frontal boundaries tracked across the Southern Plains on April 3. The large-scale synoptics were marginal for tornadoes, hence only a slight risk of severe weather was issued by the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, with large hail the primary threat and tornadoes and damaging winds secondary threats. As a result of the initially perceived low risk, only a severe thunderstorm watch was initially issued for the region at 9:20 am CDT (1420 UTC). Once the small-scale synoptics became more conducive for tornado activity, the watch was upgraded to a tornado watch for North Texas at 12:10 pm CDT (1720 UTC). What was initially believed to be a wind and hail event from reliable models and forecast unexpectedly developed into a locally significant tornado outbreak as a result of changing mesoscale situations, concentrated on the heavily populated Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. That development was attributed to an outflow boundary from another area of storms farther north in Oklahoma that tracked southward across the Red River and into the Metroplex where it stalled just south of the Interstate 20 corridor in the southern suburbs, allowing discrete supercells to form along the boundary. The boundary increased low-level wind shear significantly due to easterly winds, allowing for tornadoes to develop. As a result, taking advantage of the highly unstable environment that became much more highly sheared than initially forecasted with high CAPE values, the storms became much more intense than forecasted and quickly became tornadic and intense, resulting in severe damage across the region in heavily populated areas. South of the boundary, shear was much more marginal and tornadoes did not develop. Once the cells tracked eastward towards Louisiana, the atmosphere was much more stable and the cells rapidly weakened. ==Tornadoes== April 3 event { class=\\" collapsible\\" width=\\"100%\\" !colspan=\\"8\\"List of reported tornadoes – Tuesday, April 3, 2012 - EF#  Location  County  Coord.

Kennedale made the disaster declaration official on April 4, 2012. Both mayors Bryan Lankhorst of Kennedale and Robert Cluck of Arlington signed disaster declarations for their cities. These declarations paved the way for Texas Governor Rick Perry to declare Dallas, Kaufman, and Tarrant counties disaster areas on Thursday, April 5, 2012. ==See also== *December 2015 North American storm complex – On December 26, 2015, 12 tornadoes struck around the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, including a couple of devastating tornadoes striking southern Dallas County, and Garland/Rowlett.

He was probably born in Hof in Upper Franconia, Bavaria, around 1485. He studied at the University of Leipzig and obtained a master's degree at Wittenburg University in 1523 and became a monk. Although a monk, he was an advocate of the Protestant Reformation and a disciple of Martin Luther. He was Probst of the cloister at Steterburg from 1519 until July 1522 when he was appointed a master in the St. Katherine and Egidien School in Braunschweig. He wrote in 1523 \\"Allein Gott in der Höh sei Ehr\\", a German paraphrase of the Latin Gloria, adapted by Luther in 1525. Decius's version was first sung on Easter Day at Braunschweig on 5 April 1523. Decius's Low German version first appeared in print in Gesang Buch by Joachim Sluter, printed in 1525. In 1526, Decius became preacher at the Church of St. Nicholas in Stettin at the same time as Paulus von Rhode was appointed preacher at St. James's in Stettin. In 1535 he became pastor of St. Nicholas and died there in March 1541 after a suspected poisoning. Shortly before his death he wrote the hymn \\"O Lamm Gottes, unschuldig\\" (O Lamb of God, innocent) sung on a tune from the 13th century. Decius's version was first published in Anton Cornivus's Christliche Kirchen-Ordnung in 1542. Johann Sebastian Bach used it as a cantus firmus in the opening chorus of his St Matthew Passion. It was translated into English by Arthur Tozer Russell in the 19th century. ==Sources== * Ludger Stühlmeyer: Nikolaus Decius – ein Kirchenlieddichter aus Hochfranken.

It is optimized for embedding in applications and used in several different types of packaged software applications offered by independent software vendors (ISVs) and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). It is available for software as a service (SaaS) deployment due to a file-based architecture enabling partitioning of data for multitenancy needs. Applications can store the data and the relationships in tables in a relational model (RDBMS) or store the data in a schema-less way with no fixed data model (key-value store). Pervasive PSQL runs on system platforms that include Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Both 32-bit and 64-bit editions of Pervasive PSQL are available. Editions are also specifically designed for different computer networking deployment needs, such as workgroup, client-server, and highly virtualized environments, including Cloud computing. The original name for Pervasive PSQL was Btrieve. Pervasive Software was acquired by Actian Corporation in 2013. ==Uses and customers== Because Pervasive PSQL is used for embedded databases, and sold indirectly, it is not well known. Pervasive PSQL is embedded by OEMs like Sage, maestro* Technologies, ABACUS Research AG (Switzerland), and Unikum (Sweden) in packaged software applications that address the accounting, finance, retail, point-of-sale, entertainment, reservation system, and medical and pharmaceutical industry segments. “Users include Novell, Microsoft, PeachTree Software, Fair Isaac, Disney World, Radio Shack, Cardiff and others.” The accounting industry formed a large part of its market in 2007. Historically, Pervasive PSQL served as a DBMS for small and medium enterprises. ==DBMS architecture== Pervasive PSQL supports stand-alone, client-server, peer-to-peer and software-as-a-service (SaaS) architecture. The central architecture of Pervasive PSQL consists of two database engines: (1) the storage engine, known as MicroKernel Database Engine (MKDE) and described by Pervasive Software as a transactional database engine and (2) the relational database engine, known as SQL Relational Database Engine (SRDE). Both engines can access the same data, but the methods of data access differ. MicroKernel Database Engine Pervasive’s transactional database engine, the MicroKernel Database Engine, interacts directly with the data and does not require fixed data schema to access the data. It uses key-value store to store and access the data. Calls to the MKDE are made programmatically with Btrieve API rather than through the use of a query language; therefore, Pervasive PSQL does not have to parse the request. This places the MicroKernel Database Engine in the category of NotOnlySQL databases. Low-level API calls and memory caching of data reduce the time required to manipulate data. The MKDE operates in complete database transactions and guarantees full ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). If a transaction does not fully run its course due to an external event such as a power interruption, the data remains in the state in which it existed before the transaction began to run. In the MKDE, records are stored in files which are roughly equivalent to the tables of a relational database engine. It supports multiple keys on a record and therefore multiple indexes in the file. The MKDE caches data in memory to facilitate performance. When a call is made to the MKDE, cached data is searched first; physical storage is searched if there is no cache of the data. Configuration settings for caches can be pre-configured by ISVs to optimize Pervasive PSQL performance for their applications. Relational Database Engine The second database engine, the SQL Relational Database Engine or SRDE, operates in a manner similar to other relational database engines, that is, through the support of Structured Query Language queries. SRDE parses SQL queries and sends them to the MKDE to run. The SRDE implements SQL-92. Significant other features include relational integrity, database security, and temporary tables. SRDE extends its functionality by supporting stored procedures, user-defined functions, and triggers. In addition to its support for SQL-92, the SRDE supports several significant features of COBOL: COBOL data types and COBOL OCCURS and VARIANT records. ==Additional features== Pervasive PSQL provides the following additional features: * Multi-core processor aware * IPv4 and IPv6 support * Row-level locking * Record and page compression * Over-the-wire encryption and data encryption * Cluster environments compatibility * I18N support, code page (including UTF-8) translation between data files and SQL clients, Unicode support in Btrieve API, Japanese localization * Data backup agents or enablers with Pervasive Backup Agent and Pervasive PSQL VSS Writer * Data auditing with Pervasive AuditMaster * Data replication with Pervasive DataExchange ==Interfaces== Interfaces for Pervasive PSQL Pervasive PSQL interfaces fall into two categories: management interfaces and data manipulation interfaces. Management interfaces Pervasive Software provides the management interfaces Distributed Tuning Interface (DTI) and Distributed Tuning Objects (DTO), a Component Object Model (COM) adapter pattern (wrapper) for the DTI. These provide application programming interfaces for configuration, monitoring, and diagnostics of Pervasive components. COBOL can also provide component management through a COBOL connector that can talk to DTI. Application interfaces All other interfaces exist for data manipulation purposes. * Btrieve, Java Class Library (JCL), COBOL, and ActiveX provides direct access to the MicroKernel Database Engine (MKDE). * ADO.NET; ODBC v3.51 and JDBC 2 for Core, Level 1, and Level 2; and OLE DB provide access to the SQL Relational Database Engine (SRDE). * Pervasive Direct Access Components (PDAC) are a set of Visual Component Library (VCL) components that enable direct access to both MKDE and SRDE for Embarcadero Delphi and C++ Builder environments. ==Tools== Pervasive provides utility software designed to facilitate administration and use of Pervasive PSQL. There are graphical and command line utilities in Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X environments. Pervasive Control Center (PCC) is the main utility that enables the user to create and manipulate databases and tables, to access servers and clients, to set configuration, properties, and to edit data. Through PCC, the user can access a series of other utilities: * License Administrator utility handles license management activities. * Notification Viewer utility displays licensing- related messages logged by the PSQL engine. * Monitor utility checks and displays activities and attributes of both engines, including resource usage, session information, and communication statistics. * Pervasive System Analyzer utility tests the connections between the engines and within the network and displays information about system components. * Maintenance utility enables users to create and edit schema-less files. * Rebuild utility enables users to convert file formats and rebuild files in its MKDE file format. * DDF (data definition file) Builder utility enables SQL users to create and modify table schemas for data stored in the MKDE, thus providing relational access to the data. * Query Plan Viewer enables SQL users to analyze query plans for optimization. * Function Executor assists developers with development, testing, and debugging by simulating direct API operations into MKDE and providing a view into the schema-less data. ==Versions== See Btrieve, beginning with Pervasive.SQL 7. ==Editions and licensing== Editions There are four editions of PSQL: Pervasive PSQL Client, Pervasive PSQL Workgroup, Pervasive PSQL Server, and Pervasive PSQL Vx Server. * Pervasive PSQL Client is designed for use with Pervasive PSQL Server and Pervasive PSQL Vx Server in a client-server network. * Pervasive PSQL Workgroup edition is intended for single- and multi-engine configurations with up to five users. * Pervasive PSQL Server edition is intended for configurations that have at minimum ten concurrent connections and it is scalable up to thousands of concurrent network users in client-server network and web-based applications on the enterprise level. * PSQL Vx Server runs under hypervisors in a VM environment. It is designed for customers “who need support for highly virtualized environments enabling live migration, fault tolerance, high availability and cloud computing.” Licensing Pervasive Software uses two different licensing models, user-count licensing and capacity-based licensing. * In user-count licensing, each product key specifies a licensed user. At any given moment, that many users can be connected to the engine. * Capacity-based licensing is based on the amount of processing performed by the database engine. It measures data in use and sessions in use. This license model is designed to facilitate Cloud computing and highly virtualized environments. Both PSQL Server and PSQL Workgroup use a user-count licensing model, while PSQL Vx Server uses capacity-based licensing. ==Limitations== Pervasive PSQL lacks: * some of the data warehousing, data mining, and reporting services built into database engines such as MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server. * Unicode support in the RDBMS layer. * the ability to perform distributed transactions. * support for database caching unless the application has specifically been designed to take advantage of the Client Caching Engine(very few applications take advantage of this feature), the inbuilt feature of the engine and only supported caching option. Because the engine does not natively support database contention negotiation but relies on the front-end to manage contention issues, it is infrequently implemented. This makes the majority of applications developed with Pervasive PSQL unsuitable on any system where network or host server performance could cause a performance bottleneck. ==See also== * Connolly, P.J., “Pervasive Living Up to Its Name at 25”, SD Times, 3/15/2007, http://www.sdtimes.com/content/article.aspx?ArticleID=30319 * DatabaseJournal.com Staff, “Pervasive Expands Linux Database Offering to Support Linux Desktop and Embedded Data Needs” Database Journal, 6/17/2003, http://www.databasejournal.com/news/article.php/2223111 * DatabaseJournal.com Staff, “ Pervasive.SQL Database Updated to Enhance Security of Mission- critical Data” Database Journal, 7/22/2003, http://www.databasejournal.com/news/article.php/2238931 * Domingo, Michael, “Pervasive PSQL Certified for Windows 2008, Adds Linux Support”, Application Development Trends, 3/14/2008, http://adtmag.com/articles/2008/03/14/pervasive-psql-certified-for- windows-2008-adds-linux-support.aspx * Information Management Editorial Staff, “40 Vendors We’re Watching in 2011”, Information Management, 3/1/2011, http://www.information-management.com/issues/21_2/40-vendors-were-watching- in-2011-10019878-1.html?pg=2 * Kilburn, Will, “Pervasive joins Magic; unveils Linux DBMS”, Application Development Trends, 6/11/2003, http://adtmag.com/articles/2003/06/11/pervasive-joins-magic-unveils-linux- dbms.aspx * Kilburn, Will, “Pervasive upgrades database security”, Application Development Trends, 7/23/2003, http://adtmag.com/articles/2003/07/23/pervasive-upgrades-database- security.aspx * Kyle, Jim, Btrieve Complete: A Guide for Developers and System Administrators, Addison-Wesley, 1995 * Marsan, Carolyn Duffy, \\"Database Firm Reports Rising Demand for IPv6\\", NETWORKWORLD, May 17, 2010, https://web.archive.org/web/20100523052202/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/051710-ipv6-pervasive- software.html * Monash Research, “Pervasive Summit PSQL v10”, DBMS2, 9/24/2007, http://adtmag.com/articles/2003/07/09/pervasive-gains-advanced- database-search-engine.aspx * Seeley, Rich, “Pervasive gains advanced database search engine”, Application Development Trends, 7/9/2003, http://adtmag.com/articles/2003/07/09/pervasive-gains-advanced-database- search-engine.aspx * Seiden, Jeff, “Quotes from Partners Supporting Novell Linux Small Business Suite 9”, Novell, March 20, 2005, http://www.novell.com/news/press/2005/3/pr05024_quotes.html * Trocino, Richard B., The Illustrated Guide to NetWare Btrieve 6.x, Golden West Products International, 1994 * White, Elizabeth, Armstrong, Bruce, and Remde, Kevin, “Pervasive Software Announces Pervasive PSQL Vx Server 11 for Virtualized Environments”, .NET Developer’s Journal, 2/13/2012, http://dotnet.sys- con.com/node/2163895 * Whiting, Rick, \\"25 Infrastructure Software Vendors You Need to Know\\", CRN, July 26, 2011, http://www.crn.com/slide- shows/applications-os/231002581/25-infrastructure-software-vendors-you-need- to-know.htm;jsessionid=RjEiTtd9S-SaZB9p8vH9qA**.ecappj01?pgno=18 ==References * - product page * - company site Category:Proprietary database management systems ","title":"Pervasive PSQL"},{"id":"35314048","text":"The Qatari–Bahraini War also known as the Qatari War of Independence was an armed conflict that took place between 1867 and 1868 in the Persian Gulf. The conflict pitted Bahrain and Abu Dhabi against the people of Qatar. The conflict was the most flagrant violation of the 1835 maritime truce, requiring British intervention.Jill, Crystal. Oil and Politics in the Gulf: Rulers and Merchants in Kuwait and Qatar. Cambridge University Press. P.30. The two emirates agreed to a truce, mediated by the United Kingdom, which led to Britain recognizing the Al Thani family of Qatar as the semi-independent ruler of Qatar. The conflict resulted in wide-scale destruction in both emirates. ==Background== The 1835 maritime truce was a truce agreed between individual Arab emirates such as Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, the rest of the Trucial States as well as Bahrain and Oman. The truce was supervised by the British Royal Navy (notably the Bombay Marine). In order to enforce a pre-existing peace treaty (the General Maritime Treaty of 1820), the Bombay Marine deployed squadrons to the Persian Gulf, based in Qeshm Island. The treaty prohibited piracy in the Persian Gulf but it did not outlaw maritime warfare, as a result, the British acted differently towards pirates who attacked ships hoisting a British flag (these pirates were deported to Bombay to be tried) and those who attacked other parties' ships (the pirates would then be handed over to the country in question). In 1835, a loose coalition of Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Sharjah and Ras al Khaimah ships began to harass and plunder vessels belonging to Oman. Britain intervened when two British flagged ships were plundered by Abu Dhabi. The Bombay Marine was dispatched and on 16 April 1835, a decisive victory for the British was won, leaving much of the Abu Dhabi vessels in ruins. The 1835 truce initially started as a British-sponsored six-month truce during the pearling season, and was successful. It was renewed willingly by the Sheikhs for another eight months. The truce would then be renewed annually until 1843 when Britain proposed a 10-year truce, which was agreed by the Sheikhs. During the peace, the Arab emirates of the Persian Gulf experienced an economic boom, hence why, in 1853, when Britain proposed a permanent peace, the Trucial States agreed. ==Chronology== In 1860s, the relations between Qatar and Bahrain deteriorated with a series of small disputes. Hostilities emerged when, in 1867, Bahrain arrested a Qatari Bedouin in the Qatari mainland and deported him to Bahrain. In response, the Qataris, led by the Al Thani tribe, attacked and defeated the Bahraini army that was based on the peninsula, effectively expelling them. These tensions led Bahrain, allied with Abu Dhabi, to attack Qatar. The conflict failed to pacify and resulted in an escalation between the two parties in the following year. In October 1867, the Bahraini Hakim Mohammed al Khalifa, sent his brother, Ali Al Khalifa, with a force of 500 men in 24 boats to attack Qatar. He was joined by a force of 200 men under Ahmed al Khalifa. Additionally, Bahrain's ally Abu Dhabi sent 2,000 troops in 70 boats. The attack on Qatar led to the sacking of Bida (Doha) and Wakra. A British record later stated \\"that the towns of Doha and Wakrah were, at the end of 1867 temporarily blotted out of existence, the houses being dismantled and the inhabitants deported\\". A Qatari counterattack followed the next year, resulting in the destruction of most of the Bahraini naval vessels deployed. The 1868 attack resulted in some 1,000 individuals killed and 60 ships destroyed. ==Anglo-Bahraini agreement of 1868== An agreement between Britain and Bahrain in September 1868 as an aftermath to the Qatari–Bahraini War. Prior to 1867, the British recognized Qatar as a Bahraini dependency. Lieutenant Colonel Lewis Pelly, the British Resident in Bahrain, issued an ultimatum to the Bahraini Hakim, accusing him of violating the maritime law and demanding reparations of 10,000 Iranian Tomans. On 6 September 1868, Ali al Khalifa effectively took control of Bahrain as hakim after Colonel Pelly appointed him, after his brother Mohammed fled. The dispute led to the British recognizing the Al Thani for the first time as a semi-independent political unit in Qatar. Lewis Pelly visited Qatar, met the sheikhs and signed the Treaty of 1868 with Muhammad Al Thani. The treaty ended the maritime warfare. As part of the treaty's conditions, Bahrain was forced to renounce claims of sovereignty on Qatari soil as well as accept several British penalties, most of which were financial. ==See also== *List of conflicts in the Near East ==References== Category:Conflicts in 1868 Category:1867 in Bahrain Category:1868 in Bahrain Category:1867 in Qatar Category:1868 in Qatar Category:Wars involving Qatar Category:Wars involving Bahrain War Category:Bahrain–United Arab Emirates relations Category:Qatar–United Arab Emirates relations Category:1860s in Asia ","title":"Qatari–Bahraini War"},{"id":"35314049","text":"Zorgvlied entrance Gebroken Kolom, writers' monument Moedermonument Sterretjesveld Gordel van Smaragd Zorgvlied is a cemetery on the Amsteldijk in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on the left bank of the river Amstel. The cemetery was opened in 1870 by the city of Amstelveen which still owns and operates it, though since 1896 (when city lines were redrawn) it is located within the boundaries of the city of Amsterdam. One of the country's best-known cemeteries, it is notable for the large number of celebrities, especially from the literary and theater worlds, buried there. ==History== The cemetery takes its name from the villa on whose grounds it is built. The design, by Jan David Zocher, is in the English garden style. Zorgvlied was expanded in 1892 by Zocher's son, Louis Paul Zocher, and again in 1900, 1919, and 1926, when it became a burial place for the upper classes who had often been buried in Westerveld in Driehuis. An atrium was added in 1930. ==Notable monuments== Perceptions of death and burial have changed considerably. After the 1994 burial of Manfred Langer, whose monument features him holding a glass of beer, some burials have become more extrovert. After a dispute over the burial of visual artist Peter Giele, the board of directors of Zorgvlied set aside a special area, called Paradiso, for monuments with extraordinary appearance or dimensions. ==Rijksmonuments== Monument of the Dorrepaal family (Rijksmonument) Grave of the Johanna Elisabeth Sophia Knoll family (Rijksmonument) The cemetery itself (the park and its paths), as well as a number of grave sites, were added to the list of Rijksmonuments in March 2008: *Park construction, 1869-1931 (design Jan David Zocher junior, L. van der Bijl, and C.P.

It is housed within a part of the Grade II* listed civic centre building which previously housed the magistrates' court and police station. The museum contains two permanent exhibitions, one dedicated to Southampton's connection with RMS Titanic, and the other to the city's role as gateway to the world. A third space for temporary exhibitions is housed in a purpose built pavilion extension to the civic centre. Further phases of development may yet add to the exhibition space. The museum was designed by Wilkinson Eyre with Kier Southern serving as the main contractor. The budget for the museum was £15M, approximately £5M of which came from the Heritage Lottery Fund, with Southampton City Council and Southampton Cultural Development Trust providing the remainder. The council had planned on selling works from their municipal art collection to fund the museum, but backed down after encountering significant opposition from both within and outside the city. ==Background== Plans for a heritage centre in Southampton began to emerge in 2002, with the city council's formation of the Heritage Working Group to explore options and to outline the way forward for such a scheme. In 2004, the following locations were shortlisted as potential sites for the then named \\"Story of Southampton\\" heritage centre – *Lower High Street *Mayflower Park *Berth 101 at the Port of Southampton *The former Vosper Thornycroft shipyard, Woolston All of the shortlisted sites were deemed too costly and unworkable. Following these developments, in 2006 Southampton Police announced their intention to vacate their civic centre headquarters due to a lack of space. With the magistrates' court having left the building in 2001, this would leave an entire block of the civic centre vacant. And so the civic centre became a candidate to host the heritage centre, and by 2007 was considered the front runner. Plans were unveiled for the civic centre heritage centre in 2008. The original plans included a 3-storey extension to the building, and a water feature running from nearby Watts Park, both of which were scrapped to reduce the cost by £10M to £28M. The project was split into two phases. The focus of phase one was to be Southampton's Titanic connection, and the Sea City name was attached. Phase one had a budget of £15M and a completion date due in 2012. ==Funding== Southampton City Council sought Heritage Lottery Funding towards the museum; it was awarded £0.5M in 2009 for the development phase, and a further £4.6M in 2010 for the construction. To raise the rest of the £15M, in 2009, Southampton City Council proposed selling off works from their municipal art collection. The council selected two works to be sold, an oil painting by Alfred Munnings, After the Race (1937), and one of two bronzes by Auguste Rodin, either Eve (1880) or Crouching Woman (1882). The council believed that these works were not core to the gallery's focus on British modern and contemporary 20th and 21st century art. Due to space constraints at Southampton City Art Gallery, only 200 of the 3,500 works in the collection can ever be displayed there at one time; the council believed that the sale of the two works would allow space to be created in the new museum for the display of 100 further works from the collection. It was hoped that the sale would generate £5M towards the museum. The proposed sale of the artwork had backing from the local paper, the Daily Echo, which had campaigned for three years for the deaccessioning of pieces from the \\"overflowing\\" municipal collection. There were voices of dissent from within the city however, in spite of Alec Samuels, the then Conservative council leader's assertion that, \\"If we don't sell some paintings we don't get a heritage centre.\\" Councillors from opposition Liberal Democrat and Labour camps described the proposed sale as a \\"betrayal of public trust\\" which would damage the reputation of the city's museum. Alan Whitehead, MP for neighbouring Southampton Test described the proposed sale as an \\"outstandingly bad idea\\", which would discourage future donations and bequests to the city and destroy the national standing of its gallery. Labour politicians proposed borrowing funds as an alternative to the proposed sale, but the ruling Conservative faction dismissed this plan, arguing that it would lead to either cuts in front-line services, or increases in council tax, to cover interest and repayments. Opponents formed the \\"Save our Collection\\" group to campaign against the proposed art sale; they protested outside the civic centre and handed a petition with over 2,500 signatories opposing the proposed sale to the council. Nonetheless, the council voted to proceed with its plans, and in September 2009, they formally approached Baroness Scotland of Asthal, then Attorney General for England and Wales to approve the sale. Criticism came from further afield when the Museums Association stated that the proposed sale would be in breach of the association's code of ethics as Southampton City Council had not fully explored alternate sources of funding. The Munnings forms part of the Chipperfield bequest to the city, over which the Tate held an advisory responsibility. They joined in the criticism, stating that \\"the sale of works acquired through the Chipperfield bequest to raise funds towards a capital project is not advisable and, indeed, not in the spirit of the bequest.\\" The Art Fund, which had previously provided funding towards the acquisition of Bridget Riley's Red Movement (2005) by the city, expressed concern at the proposed sale, wary that it would \\"set an uncomfortable precedent, stretching the sector's guidelines and effectively sanctioning the disposal of works of art from owned collections to support other areas of public sector cultural provision\\". In November 2009, due to the strong opposition, Southampton City Council placed the proposed art sale on hold to re-evaluate their funding possibilities. By February 2010, the council had cancelled the proposed art sale. The council stated that movements in the property markets had allowed it to consider selling off assets that were previously seen as unviable for sale. The council also looked to other organisations to provide funding, such as partnerships with neighbouring Hampshire County Council through a loan of artworks scheme. And if these efforts were to fail, the council stated that any shortfall would be met through borrowing. A charity, the Southampton Cultural Development Trust was formed in 2010 to raise funds towards the project. The museum further received a grant from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in conjunction with the Wolfson Foundation, and another from the Garfield Weston Foundation. Over its first two years of operations income was £468 thousand (23%) lower than expected. Visitor numbers were 10 thousand lower than expected at 240 thousand. Visitor numbers have continued to fall in subsequent years raising concerns over ongoing funding and long term viability. ==Construction== The pavilion consists of three interlocking bays Southampton City Council appointed the design team in July 2009, naming Wilkinson Eyre as lead. A year later, Kier Southern were named as main contractor. Despite reservations over the appearance of the new pavilion, English Heritage gave their approval for the designs, and final planning permission was granted in September 2010. Work began in October. There were some obstacles to the build, contractors discovered significant corrosion to the original building's steel frame which had to be repaired. Adding the necessary security elements to cover museum exhibits in a listed building also proved challenging. Features from the original building were preserved in the design, the former prison cells were kept intact and used as toilet facilities, and a court room was preserved as an exhibition space. By August 2011, contractors had reached the top of the pavilion, and a topping out ceremony was held. The pavilion was designed as three interlocking bays to negotiate the irregular site upon which it sits, which rises two metres from South to North. Stone aggregate was used on the pavilion's exterior to maintain consistency with the original civic centre building's portland stone exterior. Wilkinson Eyre described the pavilion as a \\"bold architectural addition\\" which signalled \\"the presence of a new important cultural attraction within the city\\". Oliver Green, writing for Museums Journal described the shape of the pavilion as echoing the \\"prows of ocean liners cutting through art deco waves\\". The completed museum provides 2,000 m2 of exhibition and learning space. The museum opened on time on 10 April 2012, marking the centenary of RMS Titanic's departure from the city. Southampton City Council forecast that the museum would receive over 150,000 visitors per year, but these numbers were only achieved in the first year, and annual totals have subsequently fallen consistently. Work on the SeaCity Museum attracted positive attention from industry bodies. The Institution of Structural Engineers shortlisted Ramboll's structural design work for their 2012 Structural Awards; Architects' Journal shortlisted Wilkinson Eyre and interior fitters 8build for their 2012 Retrofit Awards. ==Exhibits== There are three exhibitions at SeaCity, all of which were designed by Urban Salon. Two permanent exhibitions are housed in the former police station and magistrates' court. *Gateway to the World examines Southampton's history, and its role as a hub for human migration. Exhibits include a one tonne, seven-metre long replica of RMS Queen Mary, rehoused from Southampton Maritime Museum. Both Southampton Maritime Museum and Southampton Museum of Archaeology closed permanently in September 2011 to allow their exhibits to be rehoused at SeaCity and Tudor House Museum. *Southampton's Titanic Story explores the Titanic tragedy through the eyes of its crew, the majority of whom listed Southampton as their address. A preserved court room uses audiovisual elements to re-enact scenes from the British inquiry into the sinking and to explore its ramifications. The civic centre clock tower, approximately the height of a funnel on the Titanic can be viewed through a roof light as visitors enter the exhibition, giving them an impression of the scale of the ship. The story incorporates audio recordings given by the survivors and features interactive elements allowing visitors to steer the virtual ship and to stoke its engines. The pavilion plays host to temporary exhibitions. The first of which, to coincide with the Titanic centenary, is Titanic: The Legend which explores the public's enduring fascination with the ship through its portrayal in popular culture. The exhibition hosts screens playing back scenes from films such as 1912's In Nacht und Eis and 1997's Titanic. Titanic memorabilia collected include Steiff \\"mourning bears\\", beers from the Titanic Brewery, jigsaw puzzles and many other such kitsch that SeaCity scoured the internet to find. Catherine Roberts, reviewing Southampton's Titanic Story for Culture24 described the comparison between the height of the civic centre and the height of the Titanic as inspired. She praised the graphics for making the story digestible for children and adults. And while she mentioned that the motif of following several crew members through the story never quite pans out, she concluded that it was a well-conceived exhibition and that \\"there can be no better place than Southampton to remember both those who died and those who survived the Titanic’s first and final voyage.\\" Oliver Green, writing in Museums Journal welcomed the new building, comparing it favourably to Southampton Maritime Museum's former home at The Wool House, which he described as being \\"completely unsuitable for telling the story of 20th century Southampton\\". Green praised the use of multimedia as \\"creative but restrained\\", and highlighted their careful integration with the museum's collections. He finished his review on a hopeful note, eyeing the still undeveloped spaces available in the civic centre building for further expansion. He concluded that it would be \\"a real shame if the project were to falter at this stage\\", and that further phases of expansion \\"must surely be good for the city and its future success.\\" ==NotesReferences *SeaCity Museum official website *SeaCity Museum at Southampton City Council Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Hampshire Category:Maritime museums in England Category:Museums in Southampton Category:RMS Titanic Category:History museums in Hampshire ","title":"SeaCity Museum"},{"id":"35314584","text":"Mahmudabad (, also Romanized as Maḩmūdābād; also known as Maḩmūdābād-e Shārīn) is a village in Ak Rural District, Esfarvarin District, Takestan County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

Her art career started when she was only fourteen, when she took a summer job as a colorist for a textile design company. She later graduated from the City College of New York with a degree in art. She took graphic design at the School of Visual Arts, taking two years off to work as a traffic editor at The National Enquirer. Her first job out of school was as a graphic designer at a Madison Avenue ad agency.Starr bio, Comic Vine. Accessed Jan. 10, 2017. Flaming Carrot Comics In 1980, Starr moved to Atlanta and worked as a freelancer in the graphic design field there. She began lettering comics in 1982, initially with Bob Burden's Flaming Carrot Comics. At first, Starr hand- lettered, eventually creating fonts that imitated hand-lettering. By creating her own fonts, she allowed for more exploration as to what could be done with a computer. There were several independent comic titles at the time that employed computer lettering, but none as high-profile as Flaming Carrot. In 1984, soon after Starr started working on Flaming Carrot, the book was picked up by Canadian-based publisher Aardvark-Vanaheim. Four years later, Starr became Flaming Carrot's editor when it was picked up by Dark Horse Comics. The 1990s By the early 1990s, Starr was freelancing as a comic book letterer while working a day job in the commercial magazine industry. As a commercial art director, she gave cover and interior editorial art assignments to comics artists like Dave Johnson, Craig Hamilton, and Michael Zulli. In the early 1990s, Starr was assigned by editor Paul Jenkins to re-letter the first two issues of Alan Moore and Bill Sienkiewicz's ultimately unfinished project Big Numbers — which was to be picked up by Tundra Publishing — and continue on as the project letterer of the remaining issues. Big Numbers would halt with only two issues released commercially; the third issue, which was lettered by Starr, has surfaced online only a handful of times. Big Numbers is now \\"Lost Numbers,\\" in that the series will never be completed. Starr did most of her professional lettering during the comics’ boom of the 1990s. In addition to Flaming Carrot Comics, titles she worked on included books published by Malibu Comics' Ultraverse imprint (1993–1995) and James D. Hudnall's ESPers (1996–1997). The majority of her work was with Caliber Comics, lettering Brian Michael Bendis' creator-owned Jinx (1997) and Joe Pruett's anthology comic book series Negative Burn (1998). Starr lettered a number of \\"The Alan Moore Songbook\\" stories in Negative Burn — stories written by Moore and illustrated by a diverse collection of artists. Currently Starr currently lives in Atlanta, Georgia, and still works with Bob Burden on his various creator-owned projects, including his 2012 Flaming Carrot Kickstarter campaign which raised $42,048.Flaming Carrot Kickstarter Campaign This campaign had enough backing to create a Flaming Carrot website and store that Roxanne Starr helped design. In 2015, Stable Enterprises Press released the first issue of Stable Enterprises, entitled \\"Sexy Enterprises,\\" an illustrated novel written by Starr, with art by Timothy Paul. \\"Sexy Enterprises\\" is the first chapter of the pseudo-autobiographical parody novel about the comics industry and the many freelance artists with whom Starr has worked.Starr, Roxanne \\"Sexy Enterprises\\" Stable Enterprises Press, 2015. ==References== Category:Living people Category:French emigrants to the United States Category:American graphic designers Category:Women graphic designers Category:City College of New York alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:French female comics artists Category:American female comics artists Category:French comics artists Category:Comic book letterers Category:Women calligraphers ","title":"Roxanne Starr"},{"id":"35314854","text":"Akihisa Makida (牧田 明久, born June 3, 1982) is a former Japanese professional baseball outfielder and currently second squad coach for the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles of the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB).

Sailor Jerry's work typified this style of tattooing during the early-mid twentieth century. After falling out of style for several decades, these stylized tattoos are regaining popularity again among young people, both sailors and non-sailors. They are particularly favored among tattoo artists themselves. This returning trend is also seen in the increasing popularity of traditional Sailor Jerry designs, nautical tattoos and even clothing printed with stylized sailor tattoo images. ==Tattoos' origin== It is believed that tattooing on European sailors originated with Captain James Cook's crew after he arrived in the Pacific. Sailor tattoos eventually became one of the attributes that identified a sailor. Many other cultures had long used tattoos for identification or aesthetics, such as the Japanese, Chinese, and Pacific Islanders, but the connection with a seafaring lifestyle in European culture developed into its own unique style of tattooing. Diagram of tattoo apparatus Western European sailors took up the practice of religious designs readily: Tattoos with sailors can be traced back as far as the 1700s when Captain James Cook came across the Maori of the South Pacific, and his crew decided to get tattoos as \\"souvenirs\\" of their visit. After that the connection between sailors and tattoos steadily increased. A focus on the regulation of tattoos did not begin until the early 1900s when the United States government declared that anyone with an \\"obscene\\" tattoo would not be allowed in the Navy. With the declaration many young men took advantage of an easy way out of serving, thus creating a boom in tattoos of nude women. However, if they later decided to join the navy they had to have a tattoo artist \\"dress\\" the woman. Sailor Jerry Norman Collins, better known as Sailor Jerry, was a prolific tattoo artist for sailors. During the Second World War in Honolulu, Hawaii, the red- light district was ablaze with sailors and soldiers about to ship off, and in the center of this was Collins. His skill and prolific work helped make tattoos an art form in America rather than merely a permanent souvenir for drunken sailors. The popularity of his tattoos resulted in publicity that nearly ruined Collins. Government scrutiny made him temporarily quit tattooing in the 1950s, after nearly 20 years in the profession. Collins despised tattoo artists who he felt sought the spotlight, like Lyle Tuttle of San Francisco, because they drew broader government attention to the tattooing business. Classic Sailor Jerry tattoos * Bottles of booze * Snakes * Wildcats * The \\"aloha\\" monkey * Birds of prey * Swallows * Motor heads and pistons * Nautical stars * Weapons, such as guns, and knives * Dice ==Custom, tradition and superstition== Sailing cultures tend to be rich in traditions. Over time, tattoos became one of the more popular traditions among mariners. Since their introduction, tattoos became a graphic language and a way for sailors to express themselves through body art, as well as a means of visually identifying with a broader social group. The purpose of sailor tattoos was also to record important events or experiences such travels, achievements, naval hierarchy, rank, status, membership, and/or any other significant event in life. Examples of popular symbols in the sailor tattooing are: * Anchor: Refers to a sailor who has achieved the rank of Boatswain or Chief, though historically indicated sailing across the Atlantic. * Dragon: Refers to a sailor that has served in Asia. * Fully rigged Ship: Represents traversal of Cape Horn. * Golden Dragon: Means a sailor has crossed the International Date Line. * Harpoon: Refers to a member of the fishing fleet. * Hula Girl: Reflects being stationed in Hawaii or sailing there. *Red and green nautical stars on the chest: Shows that the wearer has won a bar fight in a foreign port. *Shellback: Represents crossing the equator. *Golden Shellback: Represents having crossed the equator and international date line at the same time. *Winged Shellback: Worn by aviators who have crossed the equator whilst flying. * Rope around the wrist/\\"Hold Fast\\" across the knuckles: Represents a sailor who is or was a deckhand. * Swallow: Initially obtained when first setting to sea, now traditionally received for each increment of 5,000 miles sailed. *Chicken and Pig: Usually tattooed on each foot (pig on the left, chicken on the right) to protect the sailor from drowning in a shipwreck. This is from chicken and pigs said to survive wrecks because their wooden shipping containers kept them afloat. *Shark: As a protection against being eaten if the sailor fell overboard. Sailor tattoos are also a visual way to preserve the culture of the sailors' superstitions. Throughout history sailors were a very superstitious group and believed that certain symbols and talismans would help them in when facing certain events in life. They thought that those symbols would attract good luck or bad luck in the worst of the cases. For example, the images of a pig and a hen were considered wards against drowning; both animals are not capable of swimming but during shipwrecks, the only survivors would be the animals caged in wooden crates, hence they would float. Another example is the North Star (Nautical Star or compass rose); sailors had the belief that by wearing this symbol it would help them find their way home. Tattoos developed in the underclass of mariner culture; in time, they grew in popularity in the port districts frequented by those sailors. Consequently, the tattoos became associated with the criminals, prostitutes, and gangs who dwelt in these same districts. Sailor tattoos differentiated from these terrestrial tattoos as sailors continued to design new mariner motifs of their own, creating a distinct tattooing culture among sailors. By the 19th century, about 90% of all United States Navy sailors had tattoos. In 2016 the US Navy issued new, more liberal policies on sailor tattoos, allowing Sailors to have tattoos below the knee and on the forearms and hands, as well as allowing tattoos up to one inch by one inch on the neck including behind the ear. Additionally, Sailors with visible tattoos will be eligible for recruiting duty or duty training recruits at boot camp. ==See also== *History of tattooing *Old school (tattoo) *Sailors' superstitions *Swallow tattoo ==References== Category:Tattooing traditions Category:Maritime folklore ","title":"Sailor tattoos"},{"id":"35314929","text":"Macchia is an Italian village and hamlet (frazione) of the municipality of Montecorvino Rovella in the Province of Salerno, Campania.Macchia on GeoNames With a population of 1,933 (2011), is the largest frazione of Montecorvino. ==History== Its name, literally meaning \\"stain\\" in Italian, derives from the maquis shrubland (), typical of the area.

Polseres Vermelles has propulsated at the success Teràpia de shock and \\"els Vuit\\" and it has been bought for the American channel ABC that it thinks to do an arrangement that will be called “The red band society” and it will be on TV for the rest of Spain by Antena 3 (without count a possible second emission of new chapters and it will be amited at the same time by TV3).http://www.lavanguardia.com/television/20111028/54237284871/spielberg- producira-polseres-vermelles.html, Polseres Vermelles phenomenon in La Vanguardiahttp://www.tv3.cat/actualitat/368160/Steven-Spielberg-i-Marta- Kauffman-adaptaran-Polseres-vermelles-per-emetre-la-als-Estats-Units, Polseres Vermelles in USA Polseres Vermelles is about a group of boys and girls that they match in a hospital because they have illnesses. Without they exit of their especial circumstances that they are, the story about this six boys and teenagers shows as the anecdotes and situations of this boys and girls of the same age, but with the difference that their world is a hospital. Their second single, “Dorm”, has the collaboration of Nil Cardoner and Mikel Iglesias and it has been nominated like other successful groups “Els Catarres”, “Obrint pas” or “Amelie” at the best “Videoclip of the Year” in the Enderrock Awards Enderrock Awards 2012. In fact, the presence of Mikel Iglesias has started to be usual in their concerts, that every day are more numerous. Vuit has actuated in mythical concerts rooms like Luz de Gas or at Palau Sant Jordi, place that other famous musical artists has seduced the Catalan (Lady Gaga, Shakira, Madonna, Bruce Springsteen,....

He was educated at the University of Bologna, receiving a doctorate in law. After university, he became a notary of the Holy See. On April 15, 1592, Pope Clement VIII made him a protonotary apostolic. He was then made papal envoy to the County of Flanders. In 1595, he became Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura. He became vice-governor of Fermo on September 20, 1596. On November 1, 1597, he became the majordomo of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini. He traveled to Ferrara with the cardinal in 1598. In 1600, he became Secretary of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops and Regulars. In the consistory of June 9, 1604, Pope Clement VIII made him a cardinal priest. On June 25, 1604, he received the red hat and the titular church of San Pietro in Vincoli. He participated in the papal conclave of March 1605 that elected Pope Leo XI.

It was developed to formalize problems arising in the study of various natural and social phenomena, and has close ties to the theories of optimal control and set- valued analysis. == Motivation == Many systems, organizations, and networks arising in biology and the social sciences do not evolve in a deterministic way, nor even in a stochastic way. Rather they evolve with a Darwinian flavor, driven by random fluctuations but yet constrained to remain \\"viable\\" by their environment. Viability theory started in 1976 by translating mathematically the title of the book Chance and Necessity by Jacques Monod to the differential inclusion x '(t) \\\\in F (x (t)) for chance and x (t) \\\\in K for necessity. The differential inclusion is a type of “evolutionary engine” (called an evolutionary system associating with any initial state x a subset of evolutions starting at x. The system is said to be deterministic if this set is made of one and only one evolution and contingent otherwise. Necessity is the requirement that at each instant, the evolution is viable (remains) in the environment K described by viability constraints, a word encompassing polysemous concepts as stability, confinement, homeostasis, adaptation, etc., expressing the idea that some variables must obey some constraints (representing physical, social, biological and economic constraints, etc.) that can never be violated. So, viability theory starts as the confrontation of evolutionary systems governing evolutions and viability constraints that such evolutions must obey. They share common features: # Systems designed by human brains, in the sense that agents, actors, decision-makers act on the evolutionary system, as in engineering (control theory and differential games) # Systems observed by human brains, more difficult to understand since there is no consensus on the actors piloting the variable, who, at least, may be myopic, lazy but explorers, conservative but opportunist. This is the case of economics, less in finance, where the viability constraints are the scarcity constraints among many other ones, in connectionist networks and/or cooperative games, in population and social dynamics, in neurosciences and some biological issues. Viability theory thus designs and develops mathematical and algorithmic methods for investigating the \\"adaptation to viability constraints\\" of evolutions governed by complex systems under uncertainty that are found in many domains involving living beings, from biological evolution to economics, from environmental sciences to financial markets, from control theory and robotics to cognitive sciences. It needed to forge a differential calculus of set-valued maps (set-valued analysis), differential inclusions and differential calculus in metric spaces (mutational analysis). == Viability kernel == The basic problem of viability theory is to find the \\"viability kernel\\" of an environment, the subset of initial states in the environment such that there exists at least one evolution \\"viable\\" in the environment, in the sense that at each time, the state of the evolution remains confined to the environment. The second question is then to provide the regulation map selecting such viable evolutions starting from the viability kernel. The viability kernel may be equal to the environment, in which case the environment is called viable under the evolutionary system, and the empty set, in which case it is called a repellor, because all evolutions eventually violate the constraints. The viability kernel assumes that some kind of \\"decision maker\\" controls or regulates evolutions of the system. If not, the next problem looks at the \\"tychastic kernel\\" (from tyche, meaning chance in Greek) or \\"invariance kernel\\", the subset of initial states in the environment such that all evolutions are \\"viable\\" in the environment, an alternative way to stochastic differential equations encapsulating the concept of \\"insurance\\" against uncertainty, providing a way of eradicating it instead of evaluating it. == See also == * Autonomous agency theory * Viable system theory ==Notes References == *Aubin J.-P.

It was created and executive produced by Chris Nee and premiered on March 23, 2012, on Disney Channel, Disney Junior, and Tiny Pop. The series is about a girl who can \\"fix\\" toys, with help from her toy friends. It features songs written and composed by Kay Hanley and Michelle Lewis. The series received positive reviews due to the series' concept and the main character, as well as its portrayal of African Americans (Nee stated in 2013 that Doc is African American, proposed by Disney during her initial pitch, Nee initially only knowing she wanted a girl doctor) in a Disney series. Chris Nee describes the series as \\"Cheers for Preschoolers.\\" On November 16, 2016, the series was renewed for a fifth season by Disney Junior. On April 4, 2018, Lara Jill Miller, the voice of Lambie, said that the final episode of the final season has been recorded. The series ended on April 18, 2020 after five seasons. ==Premise== The series chronicles freckled, seven-year-old Dottie \\"Doc\\" McStuffins who decides she wants to become a doctor like her mother, a pediatrician. She practices her dream by fixing toys and dolls. When she activates her magic stethoscope, she can create a variety of supernatural effects, including traveling through time. (in response to Hallie asking how it is possible when Doc suggests she could meet Florence Nightingale) Her most regular use of it in the TV series is to cause toys, dolls, and stuffed animals to come to life. They are able to move, speak, hear, see and smell, and she can interact with them. With help from her stuffed friends – Stuffy the Dragon (a.k.a. Stuffy Philbert McStuffins), Hallie the Hippo, Lambie the Lamb, and Chilly the Snowman – Doc helps toys recover, or \\"feel better\\", by giving them check-ups and diagnosing their fictional illnesses with an encyclopedia called \\"The Big Book of Boo Boos\\" and another encyclopedia called \\"The Big Vet Book\\" for her toy pets when she's a veterinarian. In Season four the Big Book of Boo Boos and The Big Vet Book go Hi-Tech in a tablet form. Each 11-minute episode includes original songs. During ending credits in Season 1, Doc gives advice to viewers about staying healthy. Seasons 1 and 2 have the original intro for the theme song, but in Season 3, the spoken line by Doc at the end of the theme song was re-recorded with Doc's new voice. In Season 3 Doc opens up a veterinarian clinic for fixing toy pets in addition to the regular medical services that she provides for the other toys. In Season 4, Doc's Grandma reveals her own magical stethoscope and teleports her and Doc to McStuffinsville, a magical city populated by living toys, and puts Doc in charge of the McStuffinsville Hospital. In Season 5, Doc puts together the McStuffinsville Pet Rescue Team, where she and her toys rescue pets in need. ==EpisodesCharacters== Main * Dottie \\"Doc\\" McStuffins (voiced by Kiara Muhammad in Season 1-2 and Laya DeLeon Hayes in Season 3-5) – The main character of the series, Doc is a seven-year-old girl who likes to fix toys, dolls, and stuffed animals.

The series received positive reviews and criticisms after its release. Kia Morgan Smith of Cincomom.com said that \\"It truly warmed my heart and almost brought tears to my eyes when my 8-year-old, Mikaela, saw 'Doc McStuffins' for the first time and said, 'Wow, mommy — she's brown,'\\" Dr. Myiesha Taylor founding president of Artemis Medical Society said that \\"This program featuring a little African-American girl and her family is crucial to changing the future of this nation.\\" Taylor also applauded the concept of its portrayal of a young black girl who wishes to follow in the footsteps of her mother as a doctor as the lead character, that inspired her to collect pictures of 131 doctors — all women of color — and publish a collage online under the heading, 'We Are Doc McStuffins.'\\" The program is also a ratings hit on Disney Junior. The series premiere attracted 1.08 million children ages 2 to 5, and the show has attracted an average of 918,000 viewers in the same demographic, leading AdWeek magazine to dub the show an \\"improbable ratings juggernaut\\". In 2013, $500 million worth of Doc McStuffins merchandise was sold, something New York Times writers claimed industry experts said \\"seems to be setting a record\\" for a \\"toy line based on an African-American character\\". They also said the character had broad appeal and the toys sold well to all demographics. In 2016, news that Disney had yet to formally renew the program for a fifth season resulted in a number of celebrities, including W. Kamau Bell, Jamilah Lemieux and Audra McDonald to appeal Disney to continue the program. Chris Nee, the show's creator, tweeted that she would report immediately if she received any news of the show being picked up, commenting that the writing staff was eager to continue with new stories. Episode featuring an interracial lesbian couple On August 5, 2017, Season 4 Episode 22a, \\"The Emergency Plan\\", featured Thea and Edie, an interracial lesbian married couple, making Doc McStuffins the first Disney Junior preschool series and Disney's first TV series to include a same-sex couple. The characters were voiced by real life lesbian actresses Wanda Sykes (Thea) and Portia de Rossi (Edie). LGBT rights organization GLAAD expressed its support and lauded Disney for the inclusion of the characters. By contrast, it was protested by the One Million Moms division of American Family Association.

From 1917–1928 it also served as the home of the Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team. ==Current use== The Men's Gymnasium, more commonly referred to now as part of the School of Public Health-Bloomington building, is part of a complex for the Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington, as well as the recreational programs offered by the school's Division of Recreational Sports. The Men's Gymnasium, together with the Wildermuth Intramural Center, make up the SPHB complex. ==History== On January 19, 1917, the Indiana Hoosiers began playing in the Men's Gymnasium, a Gothic basketball cathedral. The team won their initial game against Iowa 12–7. The low score was attributed to both teams struggling to adjust to the new baskets in the arena. The new facility was built from Indiana limestone and cost $250,000. In addition to the basketball portion, it included an indoor track, a pool, locker rooms, offices for athletics and staff, and a trophy room. The primary focal point of the facility was a 2,400-seat basketball arena on the second floor. It was simply called the new Men's Gymnasium, and for the first few years was often just called the \\"New Gym.\\" After the first few games spectators complained that they could not see the game because of opaque wooden backboards. The Nurre Mirror Plate Company in Bloomington was employed to create new backboards that contained one-and-a-half inch thick plate glass so that fans could see games without an obstructed view. It was the first facility in the country to use glass backboards. Indiana's first All-American, Everett Dean, played in the facility. Later he returned as head coach for the team and won a Big Ten Conference championship in his second season in 1925–26. The basketball team's last season in the facility was in 1927–28, when the team again won the conference championship. Because of the growing popularity of basketball at the school, the team needed a larger arena to host games and moved to the Old Fieldhouse. ==Swastika tiles== Tiles in the building, including one depicting a black swastika Tiles in the building depict symbols representing health and well-being in various cultures, including swastikas. A plaque in the lobby addresses this and reads: > Installed in 1917 with the construction of the original IU Men’s Gymnasium > building, the elaborate ceramic tiles in the foyer of each wing contain > symbols from cultures around the world. These beautiful and historic tiles > represent themes of energy, movement, good fortune, prosperity, growth, > health, and harmony. Collectively they represent aspirations for a healthy > life through fitness and wellbeing. Among the tiles you may see are > equilateral crosses with four arms bent at 90°, known historically as > swastikas. The word swastika comes from the Sanskrit svastika - \\"su\\" meaning > \\"good,\\" \\"asti\\" meaning \\"to be,\\" and \\"ka\\" as a suffix. Thus, swastika, > literally means \\"to be good.\\" The origins of this symbol are quite ancient. > The earliest archaeological evidence of these ornaments dates back to the > Indus Valley Civilization, Ancient India, as well as Classical Antiquity. > The spiritual design has been used by Greeks, Romans, Celts, Buddhists, > Jainists, Hindus, and Native Americans.

She has an adopted sister, Marissa Brandt. Her parents struggled with infertility for the first 12 years of their marriage, and decided to adopt a child. They chose to adopt from South Korea in part because Greg's sister had adopted two boys from that country, and adopted an infant girl, naming her Marissa. About two weeks before Marissa was set to arrive in the U.S., the couple found out that Robin was pregnant; she gave birth to Hannah about six months after Marissa joined the family. The sisters were originally involved in figure skating as small children, but Hannah switched to hockey at age 5, with Marissa following suit a few years later. They then played on the same teams until Marissa graduated from Hill-Murray School a year before Hannah; Marissa went to NCAA Division III school Gustavus Adolphus College while Hannah went to Minnesota. Both won gold medals at the 2017 IIHF Women's World Championships—Hannah for Team USA in the top division, and Marissa for South Korea in Division II (the third level) under her birth name of Park Yoon-jung.

In his later years, following the collapse of the regime, he served as Senate President. ==Biography== Origins and early career Born into a family of teachers in Comrat in the Imperial Russian province of Bessarabia, Lavinia Betea, \\"Alexandru Bârlădeanu: Spion, speculant, retrograd, degradat cinic şi moral\\", Jurnalul Naţional, 18 June 2010; accessed April 3, 2012 Dan Drăghia, Biography at the 1990 Mineriad section of the Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes and the Memory of the Romanian Exile site; accessed April 3, 2012 he finished primary school in Căuşeni in 1921, studying in Tighina in 1921–1926 and attending high school in Iaşi from 1926 to 1928. His first job was in 1928, as a functionary at the Tighina school inspectorate. For the following eight years, he was a tutor and substitute teacher at the commercial school and the apprentices' school in Iaşi. From 1929 to 1931, he attended Politehnica University of Bucharest sporadically, but did not graduate. From 1933 to 1937, he attended the Political Economy section of the University of Iaşi Law faculty, receiving his doctorate in 1940, having worked as university assistant under Gheorghe Zane for the preceding three years. Generally thought to have joined the banned Romanian Communist Party (PCR) in 1943, other sources place the date at 1935. In either case, the student environment at Iaşi had drawn him into communist circles by 1933. Between 1934 and 1936 he headed the communist- inspired student organization \\"United Centers\\", worked on the leftist newspaper Manifest, and was an active member of the Antifascist League, the Tighina Antifascist Committee and Amicii URSS. In 1936, he was also in the leadership of the Iaşi section of the Student Democratic Front. The June 1940 Soviet occupation of Bessarabia found him on vacation there; he chose to remain and become a Soviet citizen. In September 1940 he began working at the Institute for Scientific Research in Chişinău, forced to flee in June 1941 following the province's recapture by Romania. Ending up in the Karaganda area, for nearly two years he was a teacher, school director, miner and party activist on a kolkhoz, until being sent to Moscow in 1943 to resume his studies. An active member of the Romanian communist exile circle in the Soviet Union during World War II, he worked in the Romanian-language division of Radio Moscow (1943–1945); contributed to TASS and to Graiul liber, the newspaper of Romanian prisoners in the Soviet Union (1943–1946); and was a teacher at the Romanian section of the anti-fascist school for prisoners (1944–1946), heading it in 1945. A member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, he undertook the latter task as a party employee, helping indoctrinate Romanian prisoners. He also studied political economy at the Plekhanov Moscow Institute of the National Economy from 1943 to 1946 on a scholarship from the Chişinău institute. He taught there as well during his last year of study, but did not graduate because he left the country. He was brought back to Romania in June 1946 at the PCR's request, officially joining the party after recommendations from Leonte Răutu and Mihail Roller. From June to November 1946, he worked as instructor and assistant director at the central committee's economic section, beginning a rise that was aided by his start in an important position and his educated background. Years in power His return to Romania saw him beginning to hold influential positions in economic ministries. In 1946, he was chosen economic expert on the government committee participating in the negotiation of the Paris Peace Treaties. In December 1946 he became secretary general at the National Economy Ministry, serving until the following August, when he was transferred to the Industry and Commerce Ministry in an equivalent position, remaining until March 1948. He was thus part of the group that enacted the 1947 monetary reform. Following the establishment of a Communist regime, he was, together with Gheorghe Gaston Marin, a creator of the planned economy imposed on the country, serving successively during 1948 as deputy Industry and then Commerce Minister. Top posts in foreign trade and planning came: Minister of Foreign Trade (1948–1954), vice president (1954) and president (1955–1956) of the State Planning Committee, deputy prime minister for economic issues (1955–1965 and 1967–1969) and first deputy prime minister (1965–1967). As Romania's representative at the Comecon between 1955 and 1966, he frustrated Soviet plans for creating a supranational economic area, earning him the enmity of Nikita Khrushchev. During the same period, he also represented Romania at the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. Meanwhile, he began opening the economy to the West, signing economic and commercial agreements with France, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belgium as early as 1959, later promoting ties to West Germany and Italy.

Bârlădeanu was in the party leadership for nearly fifteen years, sitting on the central committee from 1955 to 1969, and was one of the party's ideologues. An alternate member of the politburo under Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej from 1962 to 1965, followed by a stint as full member (March–July 1965), he joined the political executive committee (CPEx) and the permanent presidium at the ninth party congress in July 1965 under Gheorghiu-Dej's new successor, Nicolae Ceauşescu. From 1960 to 1962, he was president of the Romanian Football Federation. As such, he sidelined the national football team from competition, withdrawing it from the 1962 FIFA World Cup qualification on the grounds that it would lose anyway and had no need to participate in capitalist propaganda.

This forced retirement saw colorless apparatchiks appointed in his stead to supervise scientific and technological research, further solidifying Elena's rise to the apex of political power.Vladimir Tismăneanu, \\"The Tragicomedy of Romanian Communism\\", in Ferenc Féhér and Andrew Arato (eds.), Crisis and Reform in Eastern Europe, p.153.

NYU Press, 2005. In later years, he and Paul Niculescu- Mizil helped create the myth of a \\"patriotic faction\\" within the party where a radical break was marked between early Stalinism and post-1960 developments; Bârlădeanu in particular fostered the image of a benign Gheorghiu-Dej in contrast to Ceauşescu.Vladimir Tismăneanu, Stalinism for All Seasons: A Political History of Romanian Communism, p.275. University of California Press, 2003, During the two decades after his fall from grace, he ran into trouble with the authorities twice: once in the 1970s for publishing an article in Contemporanul without approval, and once in the 1980s for discussing with Gheorghe Apostol how Ceauşescu might be removed from the leadership. He also encountered difficulties while selling expensive goods, confiscated during the nationalization process, that he had acquired. In March 1989, he was a signatory of the Letter of the Six, terrified of Ceauşescu's approach to the command economy;Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, \\"The Romanian Postcommunist Parties\\", in András Bozóki and John T.

Following the fall of the regime at the end of that year, he was awarded important posts and honors as an elder statesman of the National Salvation Front (FSN), and as part of its council belonged to a group who had fallen foul of Ceauşescu.Peter Siani-Davies, The Romanian Revolution of December 1989, p.116.

In 1991, he quit (or was removed from) the FSN and withdrew from politics altogether in 1993.

This moth is one of several very similar looking species within the genus Wiseana and this group are collectively referred to as \\"Porina\\" moths. In its larvae form this species consumes pasture grasses and, if numerous, is regarded as a pest by New Zealand farmers reliant on good quality pasture for their stock. ==Taxonomy== W. copularis was first described by Edward Meyrick in 1912 under the name Porina copularis. Meyrick used material collected by Alfred Philpott from the West Plains district of Invercargill. George Hudson discussed and illustrated this species under this name in his 1928 publication The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand. Pierre Viette placed this species within the genus Wiseana in 1961. The lectotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. John S. Dugdale noted that the name despecta was misapplied by L. J. Dumbleton to this species in his 1966 publication Genitalia, classification and zoogeography of the New Zealand Hepialidae (Lepidoptera). This error was perpetuated in subsequent agricultural literature. ==Description== The wingspan is 34–40 mm for males and 43–52 mm for females. The colour of the forewings varies from dark to pale brown. The hindwings are pallid to infuscate. W. copularis has variable wing patternation and is visually very similar to four other species within the genus Wiseana. It is possible to distinguish the male of W. copularis by the long rectangular antennal pectinations of the adult moth. However the recommended technique to distinguish specimens down to species level is through microscopic examination of the genitalia of the species or alternatively mitochondrial DNA analysis. ==Distribution== This species is endemic to New Zealand. It is common in the Wairarapa and Wellington districts as well as throughout the South Island. ==Biology and behaviour== W. copularis is on the wing from October to April. They take flight just before dusk onwards and are attracted to light. They only live for a few days. Female moths have been observed fanning their wings just prior to copulation with a male. Evidence suggests that the female moths release a sex pheromone to attract male moths prior to copulation. After mating females lay between 500 - 2300 eggs in grass. After 3 to 5 weeks the eggs hatch and the young larvae feed on leaf litter. As they mature, at an age of between 4 and 15 weeks old, the larvae create a vertical tunnel in the soil from which they emerge at night to eat grass species surrounding their tunnel. The tunnel entrance is concealed by silk and plant detritus. At approximately 38 weeks they reach maturity having grown to a length of up to 7 cm. The moth then enters the pupa stage of their life cycle which lasts approximately a month. The moth pupates in their tunnel. Field collected larvae of this species have been successfully reared in the laboratory for research purposes. During that study it was found that the survival to adulthood of the larvae was greatest at a temperature of 15 Celsius. Eggs and immature larvae are vulnerable to dry weather and trampling by stock. Once in their tunnel, they are relatively protected from dry conditions. Larvae have also been shown to be at risk from bacterial infection. Research has been undertaken on the possibility of exploiting this susceptibility to ensure biological control of larvae inhabiting farmland pasture. ==Habitat and host species== A host plant for W. copularis - Lolium perenne W. copularis prefer moist sites in shrub and grasslands. Host species for the moth larvae include Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens. ==Interaction with humans== The larvae of this species have been implicated in pasture damage. Farmers use an insect growth regulator such as Diflubenzuron where they believe moth larvae infestation may cause significant damage to their pasture. ==References== Category:Hepialidae Category:Moths described in 1912 Category:Moths of New Zealand Category:Endemic fauna of New Zealand Category:Taxa named by Edward Meyrick ","title":"Wiseana copularis"},{"id":"35315465","text":"Wiseana fuliginea is a species of moth belonging to the family Hepialidae.

Italy's Fascist Party leader, Benito Mussolini, expressed different views on the importance of race in the course of his career: at times he spoke of alarm about the possible extinction of “white people” (with Italians considered “white” in his view), while at other times he denied the theory of race. Consolidation of territory gained in the northeast of Italy led to the state-sanctioned persecution and ethnic cleansing of Slovenes. By 1938 Mussolini supported racism, as evidenced by his endorsement of the \\"Manifesto of Race\\", the seventh point which states that \\"it is time that Italians proclaim themselves to be openly racist\\". ==Slavs== Male inmate at the Rab concentration camp. In the 1920s, Italian fascists targeted Yugoslavs, especially Serbs. They accused Serbs of having \\"atavistic impulses\\" and they claimed that the Yugoslavs were conspiring together on behalf of \\"Grand Orient masonry and its funds\\". One anti-Semitic claim was that Serbs were part of a \\"social-democratic, masonic Jewish internationalist plot\\".Burgwyn, H. James. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918-1940. p. 43. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. Benito Mussolini considered the Slavic race inferior and barbaric. He identified the Yugoslavs (Croats) as a threat to Italy and viewed them as competitors over the region of Dalmatia, which was claimed by Italy, and claimed that the threat rallied Italians together at the end of World War I: \\"The danger of seeing the Jugo-Slavians settle along the whole Adriatic shore had caused a bringing together in Rome of the cream of our unhappy regions. Students, professors, workmen, citizens—representative men—were entreating the ministers and the professional politicians\\".Benito Mussolini, Richard Washburn Child, Max Ascoli, Richard Lamb. My rise and fall. Da Capo Press, 1998. pp. 105-106. In September 1920, Benito Mussolini stated: As noted by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Mussolini's government, Galeazzo Ciano, when describing a meeting with the secretary general of the Fascist party who wanted an Italian army to kill all Slovenes: The Province of Ljubljana saw the deportation of 25,000 people, which equaled 7.5% of its total population. The operation, one of the most drastic in Europe, filled up Italian concentration camps on the island of Rab, in Gonars, Monigo (Treviso), Renicci d'Anghiari, Chiesanuova as well as other concentration camps that were located elsewhere. Child inmates at the Rab concentration camp. Mario Roatta's \\"Circular 3C\\" (Circolare 3C), tantamount to a declaration of war on the Slovene civilian population, involved him in war crimes while he was the commander of the 2nd Army in the Province of Ljubljana.James H. Burgwyn: \\"General Roatta's war against the partisans in Yugoslavia: 1942\\", Journal of Modern Italian Studies, Volume 9, Number 3, September 2004, pp. 314-329(16), link by IngentaConnect In 1942, the Italians put the barbed wire fence (which is now the Trail of Remembrance and Comradeship) around Ljubljana in order to prevent communication between the Liberation Front in the city and the partisans in the surrounding countryside. On 25 February 1942, only two days after the Italian Fascist regime established the Gonars concentration camp the first transport of 5,343 internees (1,643 of whom were children) arrived at the Rab concentration camp which was already overpopulated at the time, from the Province of Ljubljana itself as well as another Italian concentration camp in Monigo (near Treviso). The Italian violence against the Slovene civilian population easily matched the German violence against Serbs.Ballinger, P. (2002). History in exile: memory and identity at the borders of the Balkans. Princeton University Press. For every major military operation, General M. Roatta issued additional special instructions, including one that the orders must be \\"carried out most energetically and without any false compassion\\".Giuseppe Piemontese (1946): Twenty-nine months of Italian occupation of the Province of Ljubljana. Page 10. One of Roatta's soldiers wrote home on 1 July 1942: \\"We have destroyed everything from top to bottom without sparing the innocent. We kill entire families every night, beating them to death or shooting them.\\"James Walston, a historian at the American University of Rome. Quoted in Rory, Carroll. Italy's bloody secret. The Guardian. (Archived by WebCite®), The Guardian, London, UK, June 25, 2003 After the war Roatta was on a list of the most wanted Italian war criminals who were indicted by Yugoslavia and other countries, but Italy never saw anything like the Nuremberg trials because at the beginning of the cold war the British government believed that Pietro Badoglio, who was also on the list, would guarantee the existence of an anti-communist post-war Italy.Effie G.

(Archived by WebCite®), The Guardian, London, UK, 25 June 2003 ==Jews== At the 1934 Fascist International Congress, the issue of antisemitism was debated amongst various fascist parties, with some being more favourable to it, and others being less favourable. Two final compromises were adopted, resulting in the official stance of the Fascist International: \\"[T]he Jewish question cannot be converted into a universal campaign of hatred against the Jews [...] Considering that in many places certain groups of Jews are installed in conquered countries, exercising in an open and occult manner an influence injurious to the material and moral interests of the country which harbors them, constituting a sort of state within a state, profiting by all benefits and refusing all duties, considering that they have furnished and are inclined to furnish, elements conducive to international revolution which would be destructive to the idea of patriotism and Christian civilization, the Conference denounces the nefarious action of these elements and is ready to combat them.\\"\\"Pax Romanizing\\". TIME Magazine, 31 December 1934. The Manifesto of Race which was published on 14 July 1938, paved the way for the enactment of racial laws. The Italian Racial Laws were passed on 18 November 1938, excluding Jews from the civil service, the armed forces, and the National Fascist Party, and restricting Jewish ownership of certain companies and property; intermarriage was also prohibited.John Morley, Vatican diplomacy and the Jews during the Holocaust, 1939-1943, p.167 ==Non- white races== In a 1921 speech in Bologna, Mussolini stated, \\"Fascism was born... out of a profound, perennial need of this our Aryan race\\". Mussolini was concerned about the low birth rate of the white race in contrast to the higher birth rates of the African and Asian races. In 1928 he noted the high birth-rate of blacks in the United States, and stated that they had surpassed the population of whites in certain areas, such as Harlem in New York City. He described their greater racial consciousness in contrast to that of American whites as contributing to their growing strength.Aaron Gillette. Racial theories in fascist Italy. London; New York. p. 43. In a 1919 speech denouncing Soviet Russia, Mussolini claimed that Jewish bankers in London and New York City were bound by the chains of race to Moscow and that 80% of the Soviet leaders were Jews.Neocleous, Mark. Fascism. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1997. p. 35. On the issue of the low birth rate of whites, Mussolini said in 1928: \\"[When the] city dies, the nation – deprived of the young life-blood of new generations – is now made up of people who are old and degenerate and cannot defend itself against a younger people which launches an attack on the now unguarded frontiers [...] This will happen, and not just to cities and nations, but on an infinitely greater scale: the whole White race, the Western race can be submerged by other coloured races which are multiplying at a rate unknown in our race.\\"Griffin, Roger (ed.). Fascism. Oxford University Press. September 1995. p. 59. . During the Great Depression Mussolini again expressed his alarm about the low birth rate among whites, saying \\"The singular, enormous problem is the destiny of the white race. Europe is truly towards the end of its destiny as the leader of civilization.\\" He went on to say that under the circumstances, \\"the white race is sickly\\", \\"morally and physically in ruin\\", and that, in combination with the \\"progress in numbers and in expansion of yellow and black races, the civilization of the white man is destined to perish.\\" According to Mussolini, only through promoting natality and eugenics could this be reversed. In 1933, Mussolini contradicted his earlier statements on race, saying, \\"Race! It is a feeling, not a reality: ninety-five percent, at least, is a feeling.

All vowels but exist in nasalized form. :{  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - ! ! Front ! Central ! Back - ! High    - ! Upper Mid    - ! Lower Mid    - !

The vowels in the pre-syllables are always after a consonant and otherwise. ==Grammar== Syntax Like many other languages of Southeast Asia, including Vietnamese, Chru is an analytic (or isolating) language without morphological marking of case, gender, number, or tense. In its typological profile it reflects extensive language contact effects, as it more closely resembles a Mon-Khmer language with monosyllabic roots and impoverished morphology rather than a canonical Austronesian language with bisyllabic roots and derivational morphology (Grant 2005). It has subject-verb-object (SVO) word order. Negation Chru uses a pre-verbal negative particle, 'buh /ʔbuh/ as a simple negative in declarative sentences: kơu 'buh mưnhũm alak 1Sg NEG drink wine 'I don't drink wine.' (Chru LL 3) An optional clause-final negative particle, ou, may also be used, particularly in negative questions and negative responses to questions: Du phơn ni nhũ làn lam ia 'buh ơu? But thing this will melt in water NEG 'But this thing will melt in water, right?' (Chru 1st grade primer 59) Lăm klơu Aràng hu Aràng sêi prong rơlau rêi?

It is a collection of rarities, B-sides and demos previously unavailable on CD. It was issued as a companion volume to the band's 1997 album remasters and has been described as \\"[tying] up loose ends\\" in the band's career. The album received positive reviews. The album only contains tracks from the 1982–1988 period, as EMI could only obtain rights for Talk Talk music from this period. An album of rarities for Talk Talk's career after 1988 was released in 2001 as Missing Pieces. ==Background== Talk Talk released four studio albums on record label EMI in the 1980s, as well as numerous singles, an EMI-curated remix album (It's My Mix), and several EPs. Though the four studio albums were remastered onto CD in the 1980s (and again in 1997), the singles, remix album and EPs all contained B-sides and remixes that were not republished onto CD. A surge in Talk Talk's popularity arose following the 1997 aforementioned remasters of the band's catalogue, which was coupled with a new compilation album entitled The Very Best of Talk Talk, as well as new material from Mark Hollis and .O.rang. To capitalise on this, EMI decided to remaster and re- release all the previously unavailable songs on one double album. ==Songs== Disc one consists solely of remixes, all of which had only been available on 12\\" singles and were not available on CD at that time. (New Talk Talk remixes had been released on the 1991 compilation album History Revisited which the band disowned and tried to block the release of.) Disc two opens with rare demo versions of \\"Talk Talk\\" (already featured in its extended form on disc one), \\"Mirror Man\\" and \\"Candy,\\" all of which had appeared on a limited edition double 7\\" single of \\"Such a Shame.\\" The disc progresses into B-sides such as \\"John Cope,\\" the B-side for \\"I Believe in You\\" from 1988. Single edits of songs such as \\"Eden\\" are also included. Disc two does feature one song that had already been available on CD: \\"My Foolish Friend,\\" which had appeared on the 1990 retrospective album Natural History, but was not included in the 1997 CD remaster campaign. \\"Call in the Night Boy (Piano Version),\\" \\"For What It's Worth,\\" \\"It's Getting Late in the Evening\\" and \\"John Cope\\" later appeared on 2003's Introducing ... Talk Talk. All the remixes on disc one were reissued in 1999 as the standalone album 12 x 12 Original Remixes, which itself was reissued as Remixed in 2001. ==Reception== Chris Woodstra of Allmusic found that the 12 inch single remixes which comprise the first disc are of only marginal interest, but that the obscure tracks featured on the second disc stand up well even against the band's contemporary album tracks. He summarized, \\"Asides Besides can certainly be seen as a cash-in release to coincide with Mark Hollis' first solo release and the reissue of Talk Talk's EMI catalog, but rarely does such a calculated industry move result in such a treat for fans ... Asides Besides may be of interest only to diehard Talk Talk fans, but for that audience this collection is absolutely essential.\\" In a rundown of Talk Talk's discography, the BBC said that Asides and Besides was \\"a double CD set that includes many of the band's best 12\\" mixes and b-sides.\\", though they criticized the sloppy scans of the sleeve artwork for the singles. In 2014, the NME ranked the album at number 9 in their list of \\"30 Killer B-Side and Rarities Albums\\". ==Track listing== Disc One #\\"Talk Talk\\" (Extended Version) – 4:35 #\\"Today\\" (Extended Version) – 4:34 #\\"My Foolish Friend\\" (Extended Version) – 5:30 #\\"It's My Life\\" (Extended Version) – 6:19 #\\"Such a Shame\\" (Extended Version) – 7:01 #\\"Such a Shame\\" (Dub Mix) – 6:34 #\\"Dum Dum Girl\\" (12\\" Mix) – 5:24 #\\"Without You\\" (12\\" Mix) – 5:55 #\\"Life's What You Make It\\" (Extended Mix) – 7:01 #\\"Living in Another World\\" (Extended Remix) – 8:58 #\\"Pictures of Bernadette\\" (Dance Mix) – 8:06 #\\"Happiness Is Easy\\" (12\\" Mix) – 7:02 Disc Two #\\"Talk Talk\\" (Demo) – 3:28 #\\"Mirror Man\\" (Demo) – 3:30 #\\"Candy\\" (Demo) – 4:25 #\\"Strike Up the Band\\" – 2:45 #\\"?\\" – 4:09 #\\"My Foolish Friend\\" – 3:20 #\\"Call in the Night Boy\\" (Piano Version) – 3:50 #\\"Why Is It So Hard?\\" – 4:05 #\\"Again a Game ...

Parade in Uruguay honoring the Artiguist thought. Artiguism is the set of political ideas, economic and social, of José Gervasio Artigas, the main leader of the Oriental Revolution held in the Oriental Province of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, which was a predecessor of the modern Republic of Uruguay. ==Sources of Inspiration== Artiguism has two main sources: the works of American authors such as Thomas Paine (supporters of federalism) and the French authors of the Enlightenment as Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Artigas read books in his teens as \\"Common Sense\\" of Paine and \\"The social contract\\" of Rousseau. Is the first \\"Caudillo\\" or Founding Father of the La Plata territory to seems to be inspired more in the Anglosaxon enlightenment than from the French The ideology Artigas is partially taken from the U.S. legal texts. The American political liberalism exerted strong influence on Artigas. Other Hispanic independence leaders, however, were more influenced by the French Revolution and the authors of France. Some historians such as Eugenio Petit Muñoz and Ariosto González, have shown that some paragraphs of the artiguist documents were taken directly from \\"The independence of the mainland justified by Thomas Paine, thirty years ago\\" published by Paine in Philadelphia in 1811 and translated immediately into Spanish, and \\"concise history of the United States\\" by John McCulloch. Artigas had both books. The first of the works cited contained a large appendix of documents with the United States Declaration of Independence, the Federal Constitution of 1787 and the State Constitutions of Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Artigas was educated at a Catholic school of the Franciscans, from which he retired to the ranches of his father, which were located in the current land bordering Villa de Casupá. In the first stage of his life he was not influenced by revolutionary ideas. His education was not very orthodox, although it showed brilliance in performance. They chroniclers at the time of purification, when he had 3 or 4 secretaries, reported that he dictated letters simultaneously to the four, with surprising clarity. Those were related to administrative and political organization, through diplomatic letters and minor issues as refunds of goods to villagers, or set pensions for widows and children of its fighters killed in action. During his association with the campaign he gained experience for the revolution which took place later. In the opinion of author Carlos Maggi, Artigas was influenced in his teens by his relationship with the natives, black peoples and gauchos. He mixed his roots, his readings and his contact with high society in Montevideo and the outcasts. ==Ideas== The Artiguist ideology consisted of political ideas, which were expressed in the Instructions of the Year XIII and the establishment of the League of the Free Peoples.

The main ideas of Artigas were: * Independence from the Spanish and Portuguese Empire. * Formation of a confederation between the former provinces of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. * Political organization as a republic with separation of the three powers. * Organization embodied in a written constitution. * Civil and religious liberty. * Government focused on the preservation of equality, liberty and security of citizens. * Capital outside of Buenos Aires. * Free trade among the provinces of the confederation. * Freedom of the port of Maldonado and Colonia del Sacramento for all ships. * Solution to the Countryside Agreement by: ** Distribution of land to free negros, free Zambos, natives, poor criollos and needy widows with children. ** Expropriation of the land of emigrants that have not been pardoned for having their old properties and land sold or donated by Montevideo between 1810 and 1815. ** Licensing for landlords to meet and plunder animals. ** Mandatory mark earned by farmers and ban the slaughter of livestock by ranchers if they did not prove that were his trademark. ** Ban on livestock exports to Brazil. ** Prohibition of slaughter of females. ** Persecution of vagabonds, criminals and deserters in the campaign. ** Obligation of landowners to register their workers and prosecution of those who did not have the ballot from their employers. ==See also== *Instructions of the Year XIII ==References== Category:Political movements in Uruguay Artigas Category:History of Uruguay Category:Classical liberalism Category:José Gervasio Artigas ","title":"Artiguism"},{"id":"35316055","text":"Shane Barr (born 21 October 1969) is a former professional tennis player from Australia.ITF Pro Circuit Profile ==Career== Barr was the boys' singles champion at the 1985 Australian Open, beating Steve Furlong in the final.

It was planned to replace Concurrent mark sweep collector (CMS) in JVM 7 and was made default in Java 9. ==Garbage collector== Garbage-first (G1) collector is a server-style garbage collector, targeted for multiprocessors with large memories, that meets a soft real-time goal with high probability, while achieving high throughput. G1 preferentially collects regions with the least amount of live data, or \\"garbage first\\". G1 is the long term replacement of CMS. Whole-heap operations, such as global marking, are performed concurrently with the application threads, to prevent interruptions proportional to heap or live-data size. Concurrent marking provides both collection completeness and identifies regions ripe for reclamation via compacting evacuation. This evacuation is performed in parallel on multiprocessors, to decrease pause times and increase throughput. G1 was first introduced as an experimental option in Java SE 6 Update 14, where it can be enabled with the following two command-line parameters: \`-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions\` and \`-XX:+UseG1GC\` With JDK 7, G1 was planned to replace CMS in the Hotspot JVM. There are two major differences between CMS and G1. The first is that G1 is a compacting collector. G1 compacts sufficiently to completely avoid the use of fine-grain free lists for allocation, which considerably simplifies parts of the collector and mostly eliminates potential fragmentation issues. As well as compacting, G1 offers more predictable garbage collection pauses than the CMS collector and allows users to set their desired pause targets. Proposals for Java 9 included making G1 the standard garbage collector, with Google counter proposing the well- known CMS as the standard, claiming the modified CMS it uses performs better than G1. In Java 9 the G1 was made the default garbage collector. ==Related products== Guaranteed real-time behavior even with garbage collection requires a real-time garbage collector such as those that come with Sun's Java RTShttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/index-138577.html An Introduction to Real-Time Java Technology: Part 2, Garbage Collection and the Sun Java Real-Time System (Java RTS) or IBM’s WebSphere RT.http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-rtj4/index.html?S_TACT=105AGX02&S;_CMP=EDU Real time Garbage Collection ==See also== * Mark-compact algorithm ==References * Garbage-First Garbage collection * How does the Garbage-First Garbage Collector work? * JAVA GARBAGE COLLECTION HANDBOOK G1 – Garbage First * G1: One Garbage Collector To Rule Them All * 1.

In 1960, at the age of 14, Frieberg was signed by Eileen Ford to Ford Models. After relocating to California, she appeared on over 100 covers for publications including Vogue, Elle, Mademoiselle and Glamour, among others.

It is a distributary of the Mahanadi, situated in both Kendrapara and Cuttack districts. The river starts from Guali/Salipur, downstream towards Kendrapara. Within again it subdivides into Chitroptala (main river) and Luna (distributary). Luna being the deeper one carries almost 60 percent of water of the main river in dry season. In its way the Distributary Luna further divided in to two rivers near Danpur - the main river as Luna and distributary as Karandia. These two rivers confluent near the village Karandia after flowing 30 kilometers independently. It is well observed that maximum water of Chiropatala gets carried by Luna and subsequently by Karandia for being deeper during partition. However in rainy season the equation changes when there is mammoth amounts of rain water to be evacuated. Chitroptala flows eastward approximately and near Paradeep it joins with its tributary river Luna. It merges into the Bay of Bengal near Paradeep. It has six bridges across it in . The bridges are at Shishua, Nemala-Jaladia, Narendra pur, Gardapur, Patkura and finally near Haldia-Gada.

It has a sandy bed, Jhaun forest, local-myth and pilgrimage prospects and sugarcane, paddy and groundnut cultivation along its course. Salipur is the most happening place situated in the bank of Chitoptala, known for Rassagolla (an Odiya cuisine), education and business. Nemala is known in coastal Odisha for Malika-bachana (a purana) which was depicted by the saint Acyutananda five hundred years ego, since then the place is Nemala-Bata. Another place is Kuda- Nagari at its bank, which is known for Magha-Mela. In the Hindu month of Magha, thousands of pilgrims from Cuttack and Kendrapara district take the holy-dip in the river and offer tarpan to their ancestors (pitrupurush). Other places along its course are Gardpur (revenue office), Patkura (police-station) in Kendrapara district. The river is useful to nearby villagers to cultivate winter crops and as well as summer crops. Surfaced roads have been constructed on the river embankments on both sides, which helps thousand of villagers to travel from their village to Cuttack/Bhubaneswar/Salipur. However, in rainy season the river brings havoc to the nearby villages in terms of heavy flooding. Almost in every rainy season, the river brings trauma to the villages downstream. ==External links== * http://wikimapia.org/2672648/River- Chitroptala * http://www.telegraphindia.com/1030901/asp/nation/story_2321239.asp * http://www.indianexpress.com/news/orissa-flood-victims-suffer-as-relief- measur/366498/ Category:Rivers of Odisha Category:Kendrapara district Category:Cuttack district Category:Rivers of India ","title":"Chitroptala river"},{"id":"35316606","text":"Magnetic Soccer is a European-exclusive Game Boy video game that was released in 1992; the concept of the game is based on the board game of tabletop football. ==Gameplay== Each team has eight players (one goalkeeper, two attackers/defenders, and three midfielders).

In the second half of the Georgia- Virginia game in Atlanta, a Georgia fullback named Richard Von Albade (\\"Von\\") Gammon was fatally injured on a play. The Georgia, Georgia Tech and Mercer football teams soon disbanded. The Atlanta Journal ran a headline; \\"Death Knell of Football\\" and the Georgia legislature passed a bill to outlaw football in the state of Georgia. Practically ever other Southern team followed in discontinuing its football program. North Carolina On November 6, the Commodores beat the Tar Heels 31–0 . Sewanee Vanderbilt beat in-state rival Sewanee 10-0\\\\. A shocking event occurred in 1897 at the Thanksgiving Day match with Sewanee on the original Dudley Field. The word \\"hell\\" had been used in the line of a popular cheer on campus by Vanderbilt students and spread into events as football. This caused uproar with the university administration and the city of Nashville. Both teams commenced to pass the ball around for the purpose of limbering up. Throughout this preliminary the students of both colleges gave their respective yells and sung their several songs written for the occasion. There was one yell given with great frequency by the Vanderbilt students which was very offensive to decent people. It starts off \\"Hippity Huz, Hippity Huz; What in the hell is the matter with us.\\" It had become so popular at Vanderbilt that it was in the minds and causes them to be oblivious to the fact that it was not exactly proper to shock refined ladies by such utterances. Phil Connell and captain Howard Boogher dove to recover the ball after the victory. Virginia After the Sewanee game, all talk in Nashville was about Vanderbilt being the champions of the South. The other southern university with an outstanding season was the University of Virginia. The Cavaliers were 6-2 with losses to Navy and Pennsylvania. Virginia agreed to come to Nashville for a game on December 7 with a guarantee of $600, plus half of the net receipts. Virginia used only 15 players and traveled 26 hours on the train that brought them to Nashville. A crowd of 2,400 watched the game end, 0-0. The Nashville American reported, \\"Unquestionably it was the greatest game ever played in the South. The assaults on the line were terrific, the tackling was brutal, the entire play fierce. Only once was the 20-yard line of either team invaded. Almost immediately after McAlester kicked off, the terrors of the tandem play were displayed. This play meant to bend one side of the line so that the end, the tackle and the guard reinforced the four backs in their charges at the line. Whether the force was directed was not known.\\" Said Coach Acton, \\"It was the best game ever played in the South. Virginia was heavier and made most of her weight, using mass plays almost entirely. Our men played a more scientific game. My team can beat any team in America of the same weight.\\" Vanderbilt's average weight was 165 pounds.

It was merged into the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance in 1997. Chaired by Hu Fa-kuang and vice- chaired by Maria Tam and Philip Kwok, the leading figures included Tso Wung- wai, Howard Young, and Daniel Heung. ==History== The party was established by a group of conservative businesspeople and professionals in the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee (BLCC), Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee (BLDC), which was often called the \\"Group of 89\\", and appointed members in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo) who worried about welfare spending and adversarial on 6 November 1990, as the reaction to the liberals forming the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) on the eve of the first direct LegCo elections.

The Coalition for Equal Marriage was created in response to the Coalition for Marriage, a Christian group campaigning against same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom. The coalition's website states the campaign started after Lattimore read a BBC News article regarding the Coalition for Marriage and seeing a comment from Lord Carey stating \\"The avowed intention to widen the scope of marriage as we see before us is a hostile strike, which rather than strengthening marriage, will destroy its meaning and diminish its importance drastically\\". Lattimore and his partner began working on the site and mimicked the look and design of the Coalition for Marriage website as a spoof, with Facebook and Twitter campaigns launched a day later. Signatures reached 10,000 roughly ten days afterwards and 40,000 signatures in April 2012. ==Signing of Nick Clegg== Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has signed the Coalition for Equal Marriage petition, and in an interview for The Independent Clegg was reported to have called it \\"a matter of how, not whether, equal marriage becomes legal in England and Wales.\\" Conor Marron, co-founder of the Coalition for Equal Marriage, released a statement thanking Nick Clegg and the MPs \\"who have voiced their position on the subject\\". ==Sponsors== The Coalition for Equal Marriage is sponsored by many organisations, including LGBT organisations, anti-bullying groups, charities, political parties, human rights groups and activists, religions and religious groups, community groups, and also media companies.

I support gay marriage because I am a Conservative.\\" On 25 April 2012, Buonaiuto's short film was released encouraging support for the government plans to legislate in favour of equal civil marriage rights for LGBT people. The video shows British army members returning home to their families, with one reunion turning into a marriage proposal between a same-sex couple.

It is known from Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia, and the Caprivi Strip region of Namibia. It is one of the most distinctive members of its genus because of its semi-aquatic habitat preference, its floating stems, its long and narrow leaves that are folded in on themselves, and its many-flowered lower cincinnus, just to name a few characters. The species has tuberous roots set in the soil which allow it to withstand periods of severe drought despite its preference for water. It can grow in over a half meter of water, typically in marshes, swamps, rivers, or lake shores. Like many members of the genus, it cannot self-pollinate, and furthermore has a tendency for its ovules to abort, leading to fruits with few seeds. A phylogenetic study based on the nuclear ribosomal DNA region 5S NTS and the chloroplast region trnL-trnF, two commonly used gene regions for determining relationships, revealed that Commelina fluviatilis forms a clade with Commelina purpurea and Commelina welwitschii. Both of these relatives are African, share an unusual leaf anatomy, and have linear leaves that are often folded. ==References== fluviatilis Category:Flora of Africa Category:Aquatic plants Category:Plants described in 1967 ","title":"Commelina fluviatilis"},{"id":"35317128","text":"A Libris Award is a prize for Canadian literature.

The series was based on the actor Amitabh Bachchan, with his approval, and ran for approximately two years. The comics occasionally carried messages from the actor to his fans. Supremo was the brainchild of Pammi Bakshi, editor of Movie magazine, who developed the series for her magazine's publisher, India Book House (IBH), under their imprint Star Comics. In an interview, Pammi Bakshi stated that the name Supremo came about from actor Randhir Kapoor's tag for superstar Bachchan. Bakshi recalled that she roped in the well-known writer- director Gulzar as consultant, and for the character design, approached Pratap Mullick, then an illustrator for the Amar Chitra Katha comic books. According to the same interview, the series was written mostly by actress Sudha Chopra and freelance writers, with some contributions from readers. The initial comic books in the series, however, credit Gulzar for script. Sudha Chopra is credited as script coordinator, and Pammi Bakshi as editor, while Pratap Mullick is listed as art director, and also as an artist along with three others. In the comics, Supremo was an alter ego of the actor Amitabh Bachchan. As described in a contemporary article in The India Magazine, Supremo conceals his identity by wearing large glasses which resemble welding glasses, a skin- tight costume with a wrap which resembles those worn by fishermen on India's western coast, and a chakra pendant. He loves peanuts and \\"music is his passion\\", which is why he carries a Walkman. Supremo has two helpers, boys named Vijay and Anthony after Bachchan's screen characters. He also has a dolphin named Sonali, and a falcon scout Shaheen, inspired by the bird in Bachchan's film Coolie. ==See also== * Jimmy Zhingchak ==References *Amitabh Bachchan as Supremo Like you've never seen before *Amitabh Bachchan: Comic Superhero *Supremo at International Catalogue of Superheroes *Indian comics featuring celebrities Category:Indian comics Category:Comics superheroes Category:Indian superheroes Category:Cultural depictions of Amitabh Bachchan Category:Gulzar ","title":"Supremo (comics)"},{"id":"35317136","text":"EAGL may refer to: *East Atlantic Gymnastics League, an NCAA Division 1 women's gymnastics conference *EA Graphics Library, a game engine which was created and developed by EA Canada ","title":"EAGL"},{"id":"35317200","text":"Frida Vogels (born 9 January 1930, in Soest) is a Dutch writer, known especially for her partly autobiographical trilogy De harde kern (\\"The hard core\\"), the second part of which was awarded the inaugural Libris Prize in 1994.

His novels Gewassen vlees and Publieke werken won him the Libris Prize in 1995 and 2000; he is the only author to have won it twice. ==Career== Rosenboom received his secondary education in Arnhem and then studied psychology in Nijmegen, but after three years switched to Dutch language and linguistics, gaining his degree cum laude in 1983. His authorial debut was a novella, Bedenkingen, which he published in the literary magazine De Revisor. His 1983 collection De mensen thuis, which included Bedenkingen, won him the Lucy B. en C.W. van der Hoogtprijs. His first novel was the 1985 thriller Vriend van verdienste. In 2004 Rosenboom wrote the Boekenweekgeschenk, Spitzen. He has taught at the University of Michigan, and has given classes in prose fiction writing in Amsterdam. ==Novels== Rosenboom's novels are often historical, containing recognizable, universal characters who are often unable to avoid their fate. His novel Gewassen vlees is set during the eighteenth century, at the time of the Pachtersoproer. His Publieke werken features a pharmacist in Drenthe and his nephew, a violin luthier in Amsterdam, and takes place between 1880 and 1889 against the backdrop of the peat bogs in Drenthe and the late-nineteenth century wealth and expansion of Amsterdam. The novel was contracted for movie adaptation in 2008. After 2003 he took a break from novel writing and did not publish one until 2009, when Zoete mond appeared, a novel which combines autobiographical elements and historical events.

The game was also released as a PlayStation 4 enhanced port, The Witch and the Hundred Knight Revival in early 2016. The game's story revolves around Metallia, a powerful swamp witch who summons the legendary Hundred Knight in order to defeat her rival, the Forest Witch Malia, and cover the world in swamp mud. The game received mixed reception from critics, who praised the unconventional story but faulted the game for various gameplay and technical issues, including a game-breaking bug. The Witch and the Hundred Knight was followed by a sequel released in 2017. == Gameplay == The Witch and the Hundred Knight is an action RPG played from a top-down isometric view. The player character, the Hundred Knight, can equip up to 5 weapons and cycle through them to create combos. The player can also equip different \\"facets\\" that not only change their appearance but alter their stats and weapon proficiencies. As the game progresses, the player will gain access to special abilities and powers that can help them in battle and increase the bonus gauge, which leads to better rewards after clearing a stage. The game world is linear, with new stages being unlocked one after another. However, the player can go back and revisit previous stages to find new areas and items. The character's main base of operations is Metallia's house in Niblhenne Swamp, where they can save their game and access a basic merchant. If the player activates a Pillar in the field, they can warp directly to back to base and start at that Pillar when they re-enter the level. If the player is KO'ed while exploring, they will return to Metallia's house and forfeit any items they acquired during their adventure. The player may raid NPC villages to gain items, although this increases the player's \\"karma\\", possibly causing NPCs to attack the player on sight if it is too high. By picking up Anima from defeated enemies, the player can use Metallia's Bucket List to do such things as lower Karma and unlock new abilities. While exploring the world, fighting enemies, and using special abilities, the player consumes Giga Calories, or Gcals for short. When the player runs out of Gcals, their HP begins to quickly and continuously deplete until they are KO'ed. The player can restore Gcals by consuming food items or devouring weakened enemies in a short [quick time event]. This creates \\"garbage\\" in the Hundred Knight's stomach that takes up space and must be expelled through the use of special items. The Revival PS4 port version improves on graphics and makes a new Metallia-playable mode available. == Plot == The game takes place in the dark fantasy world of Medea, where there exists a highly poisonous swamp, Niblhenne, bounded by a large forest. Metallia, the self-proclaimed \\"Swamp Witch\\", lives in the swamp along with her robotic servant, Arlecchino. Despite not being an officially recognized witch, Metallia is incredibly powerful and immortal, though her one weakness is that she cannot leave the swamp at all. She has been at war with Forest Witch Malia for 100 years, until she finally summons the Hundred Knight to turn the tide in her favor. The Hundred Knight turns out to be far smaller and weaker than she envisioned, but it does have the ability to release \\"Pillars\\" that have sealed in the swamp. She sends the Hundred Knight out on a mission to release all Pillars and spread the swamp across the world to extend her power and reach. The Hundred Knight defeats Malia and Metallia curses her into a mouse despite learning that she was her \\"mother\\". Afterwards, she encounters Visco, a princess who has been cursed to look like a dog and desires Malia's help. Metallia tricks Visco into joining her, but is unable to cure Visco's curse. She also meets Lucchini, a beastman astrologer who desires to become her apprentice, and Mani, a smart-mouthed \\"punk\\" swamp fairy who is the Hundred Knight's backup guide. She continues spreading the swamp until she is invited to the witches' \\"Nighttime Soiree\\", which would make her a real witch. The excited Metallia does all the required preparations only to learn that they were a prank by the witches to make her look like a fool. The depressed Metallia shuts herself in while Visco and the Hundred Knight infiltrate Brockenturm, the witches' gathering place, to unlock the Pillars there and allow Metallia to come. She arrives and exacts her revenge by destroying Brockenturm and defeating several of the witches, forcing them to recognize her as a real witch. Afterwards, Metallia is invited to become the court witch of the kingdom of Amataya, but it turns out to be a plan orchestrated by the Church of Niike and Belda the Scum Witch to destroy the other witches, accusing them, and Metallia, of being evil. Metallia is captured but the Hundred Knight saves her from being executed and defeats Belda. The seemingly happy ending is ruined when Lucchini betrays Metallia, and helps his evil father Totopepe kill everyone in Amataya's castle, including Visco. He reveals that he is a powerful astrologist who viewed the end of the world countless times, and hates Metallia as even she could not change the destruction fated to befall the world, despite him believing in her as the only hope. Metallia escapes to another universe, and causes it to become unstable, destroying it and using its power to revive everyone in the real world. Totopepe is killed, and Metallia allows Lucchini to flee. Visco, however, remains dead. The Hundred Knight breaks the final swamp's seal under Amataya and they journey to the bottom, where they find Great Witch Uruka. Metallia is shocked that Uruka is her mentor, the Old Hag. Uruka tells Metallia that she was actually artificially created from a seed in order to drain the swamp, which are the remnants of the perished ancient god Niike who was killed by the witches. The more Metallia uses her magic, the more the poisonous swamp drains, ultimately destroying all magic but saving the world from the Green Spots plague and the further threat of Niike returning. Malia was a co-conspirator, provoking her to use her magic power. She also claims the Hundred Knight was a part of Niike, but his power was sapped due to Metallia taking away his true name as part of the contract. Suddenly, Mani appears, also betraying Metallia and revealing that she was Niike's former confidant and lover, the witch Aguni. Mani kills Uruka and goes to join the reviving Niike. Metallia breaks her contract with the Hundred Knight and agrees to become the new seal for Niike to keep him contained, but the Hundred Knight convinces her to fight and destroy Niike instead. The Hundred Knight kills Niike (in the form of a \\"mega\\" version of himself), and then finally Aguni, who morphs into a twisted monster in her rage at seeing Niike killed. After this, Metallia finds Visco's soul, and despite Visco's wishes, sacrifices herself to revive Visco. The Hundred Knight, however, presents a seed that they use to eventually revive Metallia again. ==Development== Development on The Witch and the Hundred Knight began around April 2010, while it was expected to be complete in one or one-and-a- half years, the game was delayed over time because of many issues. NIS claimed they did not want the graphics or visuals of the game to look inferior to other titles. There was talk, early in development, about making it an open world game, but instead NIS chose to focus on the 3D graphics technology. The development team has been working on the action part of the game and reducing load times, and the open world were scrapped. ==Release== The Witch and the Hundred Knight was originally scheduled for release in Japan on June 28, 2012, but was later pushed back to an indefinite 2013 release date, and was eventually released on July 25, 2013. The game was released in Europe on March 21, 2014, and in North America on March 25, 2014. There is both a regular and limited edition version of the game. The limited edition comes with a 44-page hardcover visual book, a Metallia Nendoroid Petit figurine, and the game's soundtrack on two discs. ==Reception== On Gamerankings, The Witch and the Hundred Knight has an aggregate score of 56.41% based on 39 Reviews on PS3, and 62.40% based on 15 Reviews on PS4. Cubed3 awarded The Witch and the Hundred Knight 6/10, praising the \\"awesomely dark\\" main character Metallia, but noted there were some gripes in the gameplay, including repetitive exploration and unreliable camera angles. A major bug that spontaneously occurs at seemingly any time, forcing the game to return to the PS3 system menu - losing all unsaved progress in the process - is also a factor in the game not being received more favourably.2014-04-01, The Witch and the Hundred Knight (PS3) Review, Cubed3 The Revival Edition on PlayStation 4 fared better, scoring 7/10, with Cubed3 praising the changes that improved the game and made it more accessible, whilst seemingly removing or reducing the rate of the crash bug.2016-04-25, The Witch and the Hundred Knight: Revival Edition (PS4) Review, Cubed3 == See

Rich was born in Nauvoo, Illinois, as the oldest son of the Latter Day Saint converts Charles C. Rich and Sarah DeArmon Pea. In 1847, the family traveled with Mormon pioneers from Nauvoo to the Salt Lake Valley. In 1849, Charles Rich became an apostle of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In 1860, Joseph Rich traveled to England and Wales, where he was a missionary for the LDS Church until 1863. During that time, his father was the president the LDS Church's European Mission, which was based in England. Returning to Salt Lake City, Charles and Joseph Rich were recruited by Brigham Young to participate in the settlement of the Bear River Valley in Idaho Territory. Under the leadership of Charles Rich, the settlers founded Paris, Idaho. On January 25, 1867, Joseph Rich became a member of the Council of Fifty. In 1868, Rich wrote a famous article in the Deseret News in which he claimed that a group of settlers had seen \\"monsters\\" swimming in the waters of Bear Lake.D. Robert Carter, \\"The meandrous monster migrates to Utah Lake\\", Daily Herald (Provo, Utah), May 6, 2006. This was the beginning of the popular legend that the Bear Lake monster inhabits the lake. Rich was a Democrat and was twice elected to represent Bear Lake County in the Idaho Territorial Legislature.

S. Van Dyke, with uncredited assistance from Barrymore. The story concerns an attorney who murders a man who wants to marry his daughter. ==Plot== On a train trip, lawyer Richard Grant (Lionel Barrymore) tells fellow passengers that, based on his long experience both prosecuting and defending murder cases, murder is sometimes justified and a clever man should be able to commit it undetected. He is traveling to the isolated estate of his wealthy client and friend, Gordon Rich (Alan Mowbray); his young adult daughter Barbara (Madge Evans) surprises him at the train station, where she informs him that she has already been there a week. Grant's view is soon put to the test. Rich asks him to rewrite his will, including bequests to all his former mistresses (except one who is dead already; she was just 16, and Grant believes it was suicide). When Rich explains that he wants a new will because he intends to marry Barbara, Grant is appalled. He repeats what he said on the train. Rich deserves to be murdered, and if that is what it takes to stop the marriage, Grant will do it and get away with it. Rich retorts that if necessary he will retaliate from beyond the grave. Grant pleads with his daughter, pointing out the great age difference and Rich's indecent character. But she loves Rich and is adamant. Nor has Tommy Osgood (William Bakewell), a young man Barbara had been seeing, been able to change her mind. At a dinner party that night, Rich announces the wedding and says it will take place in the morning. His longtime girlfriend, Marjorie West (Kay Francis), is dismayed, but after the party he assures her that, as usual, he will return to her once he exhausts his obsession with Barbara. He is only marrying Barbara because she would not go to bed with him otherwise. Rich orders two servants to watch Grant's bungalow on the estate, but Grant uses a cutout mounted on a record player to cast a moving shadow on the curtain to make it appear that he is pacing restlessly, and slips back to the main house. Meanwhile, Rich goes to Barbara's room. He loses control and grabs her roughly; she recoils in disgust and he leaves. Rich then writes a letter to the police accusing Grant in case he is found dead. At this point, Grant sneaks into the room, takes Rich's gun from his desk, and shoots him during a clap of thunder. Grant places the gun in the dead man's hand, takes the letter, and returns to his room just in time to be seen by the servants. When the body is discovered, Grant insists that his host must have committed suicide. To Grant's shock, Barbara soon informs him that she had changed her mind, rendering the crime unnecessary. Alone of all the houseguests, Marjorie West is certain it was murder. She figures out how Grant concocted his alibi, then accidentally finds the imprint of the incriminating letter on the desk blotter. However, Grant returns and wrestles the evidence away from her. He tells her that if she accuses him, he will trump up a murder case against her, based on her jealousy of Barbara and her inheritance under Rich's existing will; but if not, she is free to enjoy Rich's fortune. When the police arrive, West is uncertain what to do. The coroner examines (and moves) the body. The chief of police, an old friend, accepts Grant's \\"conclusion\\" that it was suicide. West finally decides to speak out, but just then a gradual rigor mortis contraction of the victim's trigger finger fires the gun, fatally wounding Grant. \\"You did it, Rich\\", he remarks. He then asks Tommy to take good care of Barbara. Seeing no reason to hurt Barbara, Marjorie decides to remain silent. ==Cast== * Lionel Barrymore as Richard Grant * Kay Francis as Marjorie West * Madge Evans as Barbara \\"Babs\\" Grant * William Bakewell as Tommy Osgood * C.

Sérot enlisted in the infantry in 1915, then saw action in the Battle of Argonne and received the Croix de Guerre. The following year he was an officer candidate at Saint-Cyr. In 1917 he transferred to aviation, flying reconnaissance missions. In 1919, Lieutenant Sérot transferred to the intelligence service. In 1923 he was sent to Strasbourg. In 1933, he became deputy chief of station Belfort, or Military Communications Service (MCS). He married Berthe Grünfelder (1898–1971). During the \\"Phoney War\\" period (1939–1940), Sérot was sent behind German lines with a series of false identity papers to perform reconnaissance missions. After the 1940 defeat, he helped organize the counter-espionage section of the Service de Renseignements de l'Armée de l'Air (\\"Air Forces Intelligence Service\\") newly created by Colonel George Ronin, classmate of General Jean Bergeret. After the Allied landings in North Africa in November 1942, he and Paul Paillole went there to organize the new Service de Sécurité Militaire (\\"Military Intelligence Service\\"). On June 23, 1943, his wife was arrested by the Gestapo in Clermont-Ferrand and was deported to Ravensbruck in Germany. In 1945, she was rescued and released by Count Folke Bernadotte. This led to a friendship between the two men. In 1944, Captain Sérot headed the SSM. ==Death== Sérot, now a Colonel in the Armee de l'Air, was serving with UN forces in Palestine in 1948, where he commanded a detachment of French peacekeepers. On September 17, 1948, he was traveling by car in Jerusalem, accompanying Bernadotte, now the United Nations Mediator for Palestine. Both were unarmed, as were their bodyguards and Israeli Army liaisons, as Bernadotte wanted to project a peaceful, non-combative image. Their vehicle was ambushed by members of Lehi, who were wearing Israeli army uniforms, intent on assassinating Bernadotte. Both Bernadotte and Serot were killed. The killers were never arrested but the murders led to the discrediting and disbandment of the Stern Gang. ==Commando Colonel Sérot (Indochina War)== Capitaine Albert-Charles Meyer, an Armee de l'Air Fusilier-Commando officer, arrived in Indochina in 1951. He set up an intelligence and counter-sabotage unit to defend the airbases of Bien Hoa and Tan Son Nhut. He used native auxiliaries led by Fusilier-Commandos to patrol the area of operations near the base to prevent sabotage to the planes or raids on the airfields. It also handled informants, infiltrators, and Viet-Minh turncoats who gave information on Viet Minh operations. The unit, Brigade de Recherches et de Contra-Sabotage (BRCS) (\\"Intelligence & Counter-Sabotage Brigade\\") was dubbed the Commando Colonel Sérot in the slain Colonel's honor. Meyer's father had been Sérot's friend and Sérot mentored Meyer when they worked together in the Resistance. ==References== Category:1896 births Category:1948 deaths Category:Recipients of the Croix de Guerre 1914–1918 (France) Category:French soldiers Category:French military personnel of World War I Category:French military personnel of World War II ","title":"André Serot"},{"id":"35318406","text":"Versatile may refer to: *In botany, versatile refers to anthers that swing freely at their attachment to the filament *Versatile (sex), person who enjoys both being dominant and submissive, and may alternate between the two in sexual situations ==Entertainment== *Versatile (producer), real name Andrew Roettger, American record producer, songwriter and remixer *The Versatiles, a Jamaican reggae group *Versatile (album), Van Morrison *\\"Versatile\\", song by Claude Bolling from Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano Trio 1973 *\\"Versatile\\", song by Pansy Division from Undressed (Pansy Division album) 1993 *\\"Versatile\\", song by Jermaine Stewart Frantic Romantic 1986 *\\"Versatile\\", song by Baba Dee from The Headies 2007 *\\"Versatile\\", song by Kodak Black from Project Baby 2 2017 ==Other== *, a Royal Navy destroyer that saw service in both world wars *Versatile (company), Canadian manufacturing company and brand of agricultural equipment by the company ==See also== *Versatile Multilayer Disc aka VMD or HD VMD, a high-capacity red laser optical disc technology ","title":"Versatile"},{"id":"35318417","text":"Abdoul Mbaye is a Senegalese banker and politician who was Prime Minister of Senegal from April 2012 until September 2013.

Instead of defining Sylvester–Gallai configurations as subsets of the points of a projective space, they may be defined as abstract incidence structures of points and lines, satisfying the properties that, for every pair of points, the structure includes exactly one line containing the pair and that every line contains at least three points. In this more general form they are also called Sylvester–Gallai designs. A closely related concept is a Sylvester matroid, a matroid with the same property as a Sylvester–Gallai configuration of having no two-point lines. ==Real and complex embeddability== In the Euclidean plane, the real projective plane, higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces or real projective spaces, or spaces with coordinates in an ordered field, the Sylvester–Gallai theorem shows that the only possible Sylvester–Gallai configurations are one-dimensional: they consist of three or more collinear points. was inspired by this fact and by the example of the Hesse configuration to ask whether, in spaces with complex-number coordinates, every Sylvester–Gallai configuration is at most two-dimensional. repeated the question. answered Serre's question affirmatively; simplified Kelly's proof, and proved analogously that in spaces with quaternion coordinates, all Sylvester–Gallai configurations must lie within a three-dimensional subspace. ==Projective configurations== studied the projective configurations that are also Sylvester–Gallai configurations; a projective configuration has the additional requirement that every two points have equal numbers of lines through them and every two lines contain equal numbers of points. The Sylvester–Gallai configurations include, for instance, the affine and projective spaces of any dimension defined over finite fields, and these are all also projective configurations. Every projective configuration can be given a notation (pa ℓb), where p is the number of points, ℓ the number of lines, a the number of lines per point, and b the number of points per line, satisfying the equation pa = ℓb. Motzkin observed that, for these parameters to define a Sylvester–Gallai design, it is necessary that b > 2, that p < ℓ (for any set of non-collinear points in a projective space determines at least as many lines as points) and that they also obey the additional equation :\\\\binom{p}{2}=\\\\binom{b}{2}\\\\ell. For, the left hand side of the equation is the number of pairs of points, and the right hand side is the number of pairs that are covered by lines of the configuration. Sylvester–Gallai designs that are also projective configurations are the same thing as Steiner systems with parameters ST(2,b,p). Motzkin listed several examples of small configurations of this type: *7373, the parameters of the Fano plane, the projective plane over a field of two elements. *94123, the parameters of the Hesse configuration. This is the affine plane over a three-element field, and can also be realized with complex-number coordinates, as the set of inflection points of an elliptic curve. *134134, the parameters of the projective plane over a three-element field. *136263, the parameters of the two 13-element Steiner triple systems. *157353, the parameters of a three-dimensional projective space over a two-element field and of 79 other Steiner triple systems *165204, the parameters of the affine plane over a four-element field. *215215, the parameters of the projective plane over a four-element field. *256305, the parameters of the affine plane over a five-element field. and studied alternative geometric representations of Sylvester–Gallai designs, in which the points of the design are represented by skew lines in four- dimensional space and each line of the design is represented by a hyperplane. Both the seven-point and 13-point projective planes have representations of this type. ==Other examples== more generally classified all non-collinear Sylvester–Gallai configurations and Sylvester–Gallai designs over at most 14 points.

His film career began the year before playing Rev. Mark Stebbing in the Vitagraph film The Better Man, based on the novel by Cyrus Townsend Brady. Courtleigh appeared in at least 14 films over his brief career and was probably best remembered for playing Neal Hardin in the 1915 serial Neal of the Navy with Lillian Lorraine. Courtleigh played opposite Ann Pennington in her first two films, Susie Snowflake and The Rainbow Princess, both released in 1916.

Coons patches are named after Steven Anson Coons, and date to 1967.Steven A. Coons, Surfaces for computer-aided design of space forms, Technical Report MAC-TR-41, Project MAC, MIT, June 1967. ==Bilinear blending== Given four space curves c0(s), c1(s), d0(t), d1(t) which meet at four corners c0(0) = d0(0), c0(1) = d1(0), c1(0) = d0(1), c1(1) = d1(1); linear interpolation can be used to interpolate between c0 and c1, that is :L_c(s,t)=(1-t) c_0(s)+ t c_1(s) and between d0, d1 :L_d(s,t)=(1-s) d_0(t)+ s d_1(t) producing two ruled surfaces defined on the unit square. The bilinear interpolation on the four corner points is another surface : B(s,t) = c_0(0) (1-s)(1-t) + c_0(1) s(1-t) + c_1(0) (1-s)t + c_1(1) s t. A bilinearly blended Coons patch is the surface :C(s,t)=L_c(s,t)+L_d(s,t)-B(s,t). ==Bicubic blending== Although the bilinear Coons patch exactly meets its four boundary curves, it does not necessarily have the same tangent plane at those curves as the surfaces to be joined, leading to creases in the joined surface along those curves. To fix this problem, the linear interpolation can be replaced with cubic Hermite splines with the weights chosen to match the partial derivatives at the corners. This forms a bicubically blended Coons patch. ==See also== * Surface * Atlas (topology) * Interpolation ==References== * Category:Multivariate interpolation Category:Splines (mathematics) ","title":"Coons patch"},{"id":"35318711","text":"Parsi has been used as a name for several languages of South Asia and Iran, some of them spurious: * Parsi, an alternative spelling of Farsi, the Persian language. * Parsi, the variety spoken by the Parsis of Gujarat and Maharashtra in India.

She was born Casimira Kaupas in Ramygala, Lithuania, then part of the Russian Empire. At the age of 17 she emigrated to the United States, where she settled in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to work as a housekeeper for her brother, Anthony Kaupas, who was pastor of St. Joseph Parish there. While there she had her first contact with religious sisters and was attracted by their way of life. She also became aware of the struggle her countrymen had in the United States due to the language barrier, especially in their spiritual life. Overcome by homesickness, Kaupas returned to Lithuania in 1901, but she kept seeking to determine where her call in life was. She soon resolved to become a teaching Sister, especially committed to the care of the Lithuanian immigrants in America. Kaupas' brother soon informed her that the Lithuanian clergy in the United States were seeking to establish a new community of religious sisters dedicated to teaching the youth of their community in a religious setting, and to preserve their native language and customs. She was asked to lead this new venture and she began her studies toward this end with the Sisters of Mercy of the Holy Cross in Switzerland in October 1902. Although the Priests Council disbanded in 1904, Kaupas determined nonetheless to pursue the idea of a new religious congregation. In 1905 Jeremiah F. Shanahan, Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, agreed to sponsor this new congregation. M. Cyril accepted Kaupas and two companions into the novitiate of the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, based in Scranton, for their preparation for consecrated life. At that time she received the religious name of Sister Maria. On August 29, 1907, Kaupas made her profession of religious vows, and the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Casimir was founded. The Sisters immediately began to work in the parochial schools of the region. In 1911, they established their motherhouse in Chicago, where there was a large Lithuanian population. They began to staff schools in Lithuanian parishes of the city. Over time, Sisters were sent to teach in many parishes across the United States, both Lithuanian and non-Lithuanian. Their service also came to include home missions in New Mexico. In 1928, the Sisters of St. Casimir began their health care ministry with the opening of Holy Cross Hospital in Chicago. She founded the beautiful school Villa Joseph Marie in Holland, Pennsylvania. This school remains thriving to this day. It is situated on beautiful acres of property at the corner of Holland and middle Holland Road. It has roughly under 400 students and 40 faculty members. It has countless elective opportunities, clubs, and classes available. Students often attend highly selective universities post VJMHS graduation. See http://www.vjmhs.org/ for more information. Kaupas died in Chicago, Illinois, on April 17, 1940. In 2010, she was found to have lived a life of heroic virtue by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome and was declared Venerable.Catholic News Service ==See also== * List of venerable people * List of saints * List of blesseds * List of Servants of God ==References * Official website of the Sisters of Saint Casimir * Patron Saints Index Category:1880 births Category:1940 deaths Category:People from Ramygala Category:Lithuanian emigrants to the United States Category:American Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope Benedict XVI Category:American venerated Catholics ","title":"Maria Kaupas"},{"id":"35318718","text":"Jim George may refer to: *Jim George (footballer) (active 1970s and 1980s), Scottish football player and manager *Jim George (rugby union) for Falmouth RFC *Jim George (weightlifter) (born 1935), American Olympic weightlifter *Jim George (author) (born 1943), American author ==See also== *Jimmy George (disambiguation) *James George (disambiguation) ","title":"Jim George"},{"id":"35318735","text":"\\"Paris (Ooh La La)\\" is the second single from Grace Potter and the Nocturnals' eponymous third studio album. ==Covers== *Brian Fuente, a contestant on the second season of the U.S version of The Voice, covered the song in his blind audition. *Ashley De La Rosa, another contestant on the second season of the U.S version of The Voice, covered the song for her last chance performance. *Jennel Garcia, a contestant on the second season of the U.S. version of The X Factor, covered the song in her audition. *Amanda Brown a contestant on the third season of the U.S. version of The Voice, covered the song during the knockout rounds. *Pamela Anderson danced to this song in the 15th season of Dancing with the Stars. *Fatin Shidqia, a contestant on the first season of the Indonesian version of The X Factor, covered the song in her bootcamp. *Emily Piriz, a contestant on the thirteenth season of American Idol, covered this song during \\"Rush Week,\\" a round featuring the top 20 contestants of the season.

In the 7th edition in 1979, it was moved into the main \\"commands\\" section of the manual (section 1). From there, the factor utility was copied to all other variants of Unix, including commercial Unixes and BSD. In some variants of Unix, it is classified as a \\"game\\" more than a serious utility, and therefore documented in section 6. A free software version of the factor utility was written for the GNU project by Paul Rubin, in 1986. It is now available on all Linux distributions as part of the GNU Core Utilities. In 2008, GNU factor started to use the GNU MP library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, allowing it to factor integers of any size, not limited by the machine's native datatypes. ==Syntax== factor [number] The command can be used by supplying an integer value. Various projects, including simple ones such as printing prime numbers, are facilitated by using this command. ==References== #manual page from Fifth Edition Unix (section 6: \\"user maintained programs) #factor manual page from Sixth Edition Unix (section 6: \\"user contributed\\"). # ==External Links== *GNU's factor manual page *FreeBSD's factor man page Category:Unix software Category:Plan 9 commands ","title":"Factor (Unix)"},{"id":"35318805","text":"is a retired Japanese tennis player.

The F. malloryi leaves are the earliest appearance in the fossil record of a member of the witchalder genus Fothergilla, which includes the living species F. gardenii, and F. major, both of which are native to the southeastern United States. The genus also includes three or four other fossil species with two Asian Miocene species, F. viburnifolia from China, F. ryozenensis from Japan along with one Miocene North American species, F. praeolata of Oregon. Fothergilla durhamensis described from Eocene sediments in King County, Washington is considered dubious in placement. ==History and classification== Fothergilla malloryi is represented by a single counterpart compression fossil specimen from the Ypresian aged Klondike Mountain Formation which outcrops in Republic, Ferry County, Washington. The age of the formation is based on Argon–argon dating, which has returned a date of 49.4 ±0.5 million years old. The fossil was recovered from \\"Boot Hill\\", University of Washington site UWBM B4131 located within the city limits of Republic. The holotype specimen for Fothergilla malloryi is numbered UWBM 56625 and currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections of University of Washington in Seattle, Washington. The specimen was studied by paleobotanists Meghan G. Radtke and Kathleen B. Pigg of the School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University and Wesley C. Wehr of the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture in Seattle. Radtke, Pigg and Wehr published their 2005 type description for F. malloryi in the International Journal of Plant Sciences. The etymology of the specific name malloryi was derived from V. Standish Mallory, University of Washington professor of geology and paleontology,V.-Standish-Mallory Encyclopædia Britannica> in honor of his contributions to the Tertiary paleontology of Washington State. ==Description== The specimen used for the description of F. malloryi is a simple, ovate leaf having a slightly asymmetric base. The overall length of the leaf is and is at the widest point near the base. The pinnate secondary veins diverge from the primary vein at an angle of 53° and form a craspedodromous patterning. The leaf margin has large rounded, possibly glandular teeth each with a single major vein. F. malloryi is similar in size range to the extant F gardenii and the Miocene F. viburnifolia, but differs in the structuring of the leaf base. F. malloryi is generally shorter and less elongated then the Miocene species F. ryozenensis while the Oregon species F. praeolata has a notably different overall shape and petiole structure. ==References== Category:Hamamelidaceae Category:Flora of Washington (state) Category:Fossil taxa described in 2005 Category:Plants described in 2005 Category:Ypresian plants of North America Category:Extinct flora of North America Category:Klondike Mountain Formation ","title":"Fothergilla malloryi"},{"id":"35318862","text":"Poorimane Puri bhaji (sometimes spelled poori bhaji) is a dish, originating from the Indian subcontinent, of puri (deep-fried rounds of flour) and aloo (potato) bhaji (a spiced potato dish which may be dry or curried).

It is located just opposite to the Jafarganj Cemetery in the Lalbagh area of the town of Murshidabad and near Mahimapur in the Indian state of West Bengal. Namak Haram Deorhi refers to both the place of Mir Jafar and the main gate which leads to the palace. This building was used as the residence of Mir Jafar, before he ascended the musnad of Bengal or when he was the Commander-in-Chief of the subha. ==Features== The palace was fortified with towers and turrets. It was also provided with a cannon to protect it from attacks. Now nothing of the palace remains except the Deorhi (gate) which led to the palace. ==Significance== The last secret conference was held here, before the Battle of Plassey, between William Watts, Mir Jafar and his son Mir Miran. Watts was chief of the Kasimbazar (or Cossimbazar) factory of the East India Company. He lived in Bengal, and he was proficient in Bengali, Hindustani and Persian languages. Miran received Watts in one of the palace's seraglio. A seraglio is a sequestered living quarters used by wives and concubines of a Muslim. Watts placed the Quran on Mir Jafar's head and Jafar's hand on the head of Miran. Then Mir Jafar swore with great solemnity that he would faithfully perform whatever he was told to do (i.e. to betray Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah in the Battle of Plassey, which was to be held the next day, so that the British could win the battle and he would be dethroned from the throne of the Nawab of Bengal). According to Seir Mutaqherin, Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah was murdered by Muhammad-i-Beg on the orders of Mir Miran in the campus of this Deorhi, beside the public road under a Neem tree on 2 July 1757 after he fled to save his life, after he was defeated in the Battle of Plassey. But, according to historian Robert Orme, he was seen to be murdered inside the Mansurganj Palace, on the west banks of the Bhagirathi River, opposite to this Deorhi. There in the Mansurganj Palace Mir Miran used to reside. After the murder Siraj's mangled body was taken over the river and kept at Jafarganj for the night. The next morning, his body was placed on an elephant and paraded through the streets of Murshidabad and also past Siraj ud-Daulah's mother, Amina Begum's house. He was then taken across the river to Khushbagh. ==Etymology== Namak Haram is a Hindi phrase which means \\"one who is treacherous\\" or \\"one who cannot be trusted\\" while Deorhi is a word in Hindi which means \\"gate\\". So the total sums up to \\"the gate to him who cannot be trusted\\". It has been named so because Mir Jafar and Mir Miran asked Muhammad- i-Beg to kill Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah just for the reason so that Mir Jafar could become the next Nawab of Bengal. Furthermore, his betrayal of his master during the Battle of Plassey eventually led to the total annexation of East India by the East India Company. \\"Namak Haram Deorhi\\" is also known by its English transliterated name, the \\"Traitor's Gate\\". ==See also== *Mir Jafar ==References== Category:Tourist attractions in Murshidabad Category:Palaces in West Bengal Category:Buildings and structures in Murshidabad district ","title":"Namak Haram Deorhi"},{"id":"35318965","text":"Macna metaxanthalis is a species of snout moth in the genus Macna.

It has a surface area and is located on the south side of Cypress Gardens Boulevard. The lake once had a larger surface area, but when Cypress Gardens Boulevard was upgraded it ran over some of the northern part of Lake Roy; this part had been filled so the road could be rerouted. A small part of the old lakebed is north of the street, but is more of a retention pond now, for the most part remaining dry. The lake is of an irregular shape.

It originally aired on May 7, 1987 on NBC. During the fifth season, Sam Malone (Ted Danson) repeatedly proposes to Diane, and she refuses repeatedly until she accepts engagement in \\"Chambers vs. Malone\\" (1987). In the previous episode, \\"A House Is Not a Home\\", Sam and Diane bought a house together. Before this episode aired, Ted Danson decided to renew his contract with the show as Sam Malone, while Shelley Long decided to quit the series, which could conclude the on-and-off romance of \\"Sam and Diane\\" that went on for the first five years since 1982. In this episode, Diane is offered an opportunity to finish one of her novels. However, she must choose between her talents and her man, Sam. After she becomes persuaded into honing her talents, Diane leaves the job, the bar, the relationship, and the city behind for that. In the 1993 series finale, \\"One for the Road\\", Shelley Long makes her special guest appearance as Diane Chambers and the \\"Sam and Diane\\" story line is there resurfaced. Meanwhile, with Long's departure, producers of the series made plans to reconstruct the show by introducing a new female lead who does not resemble Shelley Long. == Plot == Sumner Sloane (Michael McGuire), Diane's ex- fiancé who jilted her in the series pilot, returns to Cheers, surprising bar patrons. Alone in the billiard room, Sumner tells Diane that he submitted one of her unfinished manuscripts against her will to one of his colleagues, who praised it and sent it to publishers. Initially, she becomes excited. However, Sumner warns her that she would not spend enough time finishing the novel if she marries Sam. Diane tells Sumner to leave the bar. Unbeknownst to them, Sam overhears this conversation under the pool table whose underneath is covered by drapes. At home, in the house they bought together in the previous episode, \\"A House Is Not a Home\\", Sam wants to postpone the wedding, but Diane suggests that they be married immediately, so she leaves him alone for a moment. Later, Sam daydreams about their own elderly selves living in what would have been if Diane chooses Sam over her career. In that fantasy, Sam and Diane are happily married elderly couple with children and grandchildren. Moreover, Diane has not finished her novel but assures Sam that she has no regrets and that abandoning her talents does not affect their marriage and her happiness with him. Back into reality, then they decide to set the wedding at the bar, where people know about their relationship. The following day, at the wedding, commissioned by the Justice of the Peace (William Addison), a phone call, picked up by Woody, announces that Diane's unfinished novel was praised by publishers and, if finished, will likely be published. Unaffected Diane still wants to marry, but Sam convinces her to set her writing talents first before marriage. After failures, like ballet and filmmaking, and becoming convinced to hone and cherish her writing skills, Diane decides to give writing career a chance, putting a wedding to an end. At closing time, Sam and Diane alone embrace each other for the last time together. Diane promises him that she will return to him in six months. Sam tells her to \\"have a good life,\\" but Diane attests to her promise and leaves the bar. Now alone in the bar, Sam again tells her to \\"have a good life,\\" then he fantasizes elderly versions of himself and Diane embracing and dancing. == Production == Shelley Long (pictured in 1996) makes her final appearance as Diane Chambers in this episode. The producers intended Cheers to be a comedy about the bar itself, but, as Burrows claimed, the \\"Sam and Diane\\" romance predominated the show for five years and, as he hypothesized, would have made the bar more of a minor role and more irrelevant if Shelley Long had not left the show as Diane Chambers in this episode. With Long leaving the series, the producers made plans to revamp the show with the bar as a central setting, as originally intended, and then they credited Long's departure for saving the series from cancellation. After years of writing Sam as a \\"straight man\\", especially to Diane, the writers would transform Sam into becoming more \\"carefree\\" and a \\"goof-off\\" in season six. The creators, in February 1987, decided to find a female lead replacement whose hair is not blonde and who does not resemble Shelley Long. Brunette-haired Kirstie Alley debuts as Rebecca Howe in the next episode, \\"Home Is the Sailor\\" (1987). This episode was written by Glen and Les Charles and directed by James Burrows. On December 15, 1986, Shelley Long decided to leave Cheers as the regular character Diane Chambers, even though she and Ted \\"[had] done some really terrific work at Cheers\\", for her movie career and family, while Ted Danson signed a contract for the next season (1987-1988), which led producers, the Charles brothers and Burrows, to separate Sam and Diane. An idea to keep Sam in and write Diane out without risk of ruining the quality and losing viewers had been developed. Before Diane was written out by having her leave Boston for a writing career, some ideas were attempted and discarded, like Sam and Diane's child in the next season, as Sam would have been a single father, and another ideal man for Diane. Three endings were filmed, in part to attempt to keep the actual one a secret, and because it was possible that Long might decide to stay: 1) Sam and Diane become married; 2) Diane accepts an offer to finish a novel; 3) not revealed by the producers. The alternate ending in which Sam and Diane get married aired on May 27, 1998 as part of a 90-minute Fox special produced by the Paley Center called Behind the Laughs: The Untold Stories of Television's Favorite Comedies: A Museum of Television and Radio Special. Steve Giannelli is credited for his background appearance, and Walter Addison portrays the Justice of the Peace performing Sam and Diane's bar wedding. == Reception == This episode originally aired on May 7, 1987, on NBC at 9:00pm (Eastern) / 8:00pm (Central) and scored a 28.4 rating and 45 share, was watched by 24.8 million homes, and ranked #1 in Nielsen ratings. In 1987, estimated 87.4 million homes owned at least one television, on which a rating is based. Share is a percentage of watching one program during its time period. After the episode originally aired, Kathy Carlisle of Los Angeles Times called this episode \\"hilarious, but somewhat contrived and very disappointing\\" and felt that Sam and Diane should have been married at the end. Monica Collins from USA Today called Diane a \\"snitty, selfish snob\\" and was relieved that the character left the series. According to Collins, she has not made friends with people in Cheers onscreen. More often, she has not befriended women, and she has \\"[teased] men more than [pleased] them\\". Later reviews analyzed the departure of Diane Chambers and the end of her relationship with Sam Malone. In 2005, David Hofstede in the guide 5000 Episodes and No Commercials and Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk found Diane's departure poorly done. The following year, Gillian Flynn from Entertainment Weekly called Sam and Diane's breakup in this episode one of the \\"all-time best breakup scenes\\" in history. In 2010, Jane Boursaw from Huffington Post and Amy K. Bredemeyer from The Talking Box blog called the wedding of Sam and Diane one of their favorite \\"weddings that [did not] happen\\". The following year, UGO.com called Sam and Diane's breakup from this episode one of \\"the most horrible [television] breakups.\\" In 2014, IGN placed it as number one of the top ten Cheers episodes. In 2019, Joseph J. and Kate Darowski in their book Cheers: A Cultural History rated the episode all four stars. == References == General * Specific == External links == * * Category:1987 American television episodes Category:Cheers episodes Category:Television programs directed by James Burrows ","title":"I Do, Adieu"},{"id":"35319156","text":"Dream Team 1935 () is a Latvian film directed by Aigars Grauba about the Latvia national basketball team which won EuroBasket 1935, the first FIBA European basketball championship. ==Plot== The first European Championship in basketball is about to take place in Geneva.

The main feature of the Elections was the near obliteration of the Scottish Liberal Democrats as they collapsed from 17 to just 3 seats on the City Council which sees the party occupying the position as the smallest party. Their leader, and the leader of the Council, Jenny Dawe, lost her seat in Meadows/Morningside, epitomising the poor performance.

The Scottish National Party became the second largest party gaining 6 seats and 18 seats in total. The Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party retained 11 seats on the Council while the Scottish Green Party doubled their seat numbers to 6.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Lancaster and Morecambe, the archdeaconry of Lancaster, and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. The authors of the Buildings of England series describe the appearance of the church as being \\"decidedly monumental\\". ==History== St John's was a new church built in 1906–07 to replace a church of 1800 located on a different site. It was designed by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley, and cost about £5,000 (), providing seating for 380 people. The original intention had been to build a spire on the tower but this never transpired. ==Architecture== Exterior The church is constructed in sandstone rubble, and it has a roof of red tiles. Its plan consists of a nave with a clerestory on the north side only, a north aisle, a south porch, a tower at the crossing with a north transept and vestry, and a chancel. In the south wall of the nave are three windows of three and two lights under segmental heads containing Perpendicular tracery. To the west of the windows is a porch with a doorway under a pointed arch, and a gable surmounted by a cross finial. To the right of the three windows is a smaller two-light window at a higher level, and a doorway. The windows in the north wall of the aisle have two or three lights under flat heads, and the clerestory windows have two lights with elliptical heads under flat lintels. The tower has buttresses on the north and south sides, and a square stair turret on the south side. Also on the south side, in the middle stage, is a window with a pointed head. In the top stage the bell openings have two lights, and on the summit of the tower is a plain coping. In the south wall of the chancel is a two-light window with a segmental head. The east window has five lights. Its tracery is in a mixture of Perpendicular and Decorated styles. Interior Inside the church is a six-bay arcade carried on alternating round and octagonal piers. In the chancel is a piscina. The stained glass consists of a scheme by Shrigley and Hunt dating from the early 20th century. The two-manual pipe organ was made by Ainscough of Preston. ==External features== The churchyard contains the war grave of a Royal Garrison Artillery soldier of World War I. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Ellel, Lancashire *List of ecclesiastical works by Austin and Paley (1895–1914) ==References== Category:Church of England church buildings in Lancashire Category:Diocese of Blackburn Category:Grade II listed churches in Lancashire Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in England Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Lancashire Category:Austin and Paley buildings Category:Churches in the City of Lancaster ","title":"St John's Church, Ellel"},{"id":"35319340","text":"The Taganrog Old Cemetery is a historic cemetery on the outskirts of Taganrog's historical downtown district that was closed for new burials in 1971. ==History== The cemetery was officially established in 1809 as a Christian cemetery, although the site has already had some burials. In 1810 the All Saints' Church in Taganrog on the cemetery's land was founded, which was consecrated and completed in 1824. After Taganrog had been captured by the Red Army in late 1919, the cemetery was used for all interments. After the Second World War, several monuments and a traditional Soviet eternal flame were established on the cemetery territory. On May 25, 1971 the cemetery was closed for new interments.

It was held April 6, 2012, in the main Sarajevo street and it consisted of a large chair installation, street exhibition of war posters and a concert. Authors describe Sarajevo Red Line as a drama and music poem dedicated to the Sarajevo citizens killed during the 1992-96 siege of their city. ==Program== The central event of Sarajevo Red Line was staged near the Eternal Flame monument. From the stage near the flame down the Maršal Tito Street, 11,541 empty red chairs were arranged in 825 rows (as an audience). This red “audience” stretched for 800 meters and ended in the area between the building of the Presidency of BiH and Ali-pasha’s Mosque. 11,541 empty chairs symbolized 11,541 victims of the war which, according to Research and Documentation Center were killed during the Siege of Sarajevo.City.ba: Sarajevo Red Line - 11541 - In Bosnian[cited April 04, 2012]E-News: Red Line for the victims of the Siege of Sarajevo - In Bosnian[cited April 04, 2012] 643 of the chairs were small, representing the slain children.

Therefore, 643 of the chairs in Sarajevo Red Line were small – representing the slain children. On some, passers-by left teddy bears, little plastic cars, other toys or candy.The Huffington Post: Bosnian War: Sarajevo Marks The Conflict's 20th Anniversary by Aida Cerkez [cited April 04, 2012] The International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY) sentenced two former Bosnian-Serb generals for overseeing the siege of Sarajevo. Stanislav Galić and Dragomir Milošević were both found guilty of terrorizing civilians in Sarajevo and sentenced to life imprisonment and 29 years' imprisonment respectively. The siege of Sarajevo lasted 44 months and is considered today the longest in modern history. Most of the people killed in the city were hit by snipers and bombs fired from the surrounding Serb-held mountains. The April 6, 2012 commemoration was the first time that Sarajevo has put on an official program of this scale in memory of the victims of the siege. Aerial view of Sarajevo Red Line In 2014, an exhibition of photographs from the Sarajevo Red Line opened in Istanbul, Turkey. ==History== During the Siege of Sarajevo, 380,000 people were left without food, electricity, water or heating during 46 months, hiding from the 330 shells a day that smashed into the city. On April 6, 1992, around 40,000 people from all over the country – Muslim Bosniaks, Christian Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats – poured into a square further down the red street demanding peace from their quarrelling nationalist politicians. The European Community had recognized the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia as an independent state after most of its people voted for independence. However, the vote went down along ethnic lines, with Bosniaks and Croats voting for independence, and Bosnian Serbs preferring to stay with Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. The ethnic unity being displayed on the Sarajevo square irritated Serb nationalists, who then shot into the crowd from a nearby hotel, killing 5 people and marking the start of the 1992-1995 war. The Serb nationalists, helped by neighbouring Serbia, laid siege to Sarajevo and within a few months occupied 70% of Bosnia, expelling all non-Serbs from territory they controlled. Bosniaks and Croats – who started off as allies – subsequently turned against each other, so that all three groups ended up fighting a war that made half of the population homeless and left the once- ethnically mixed country devastated and divided into mono-ethnic enclaves. It is estimated that during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, more than 100,000 people were killed. Thousands of people were raped and hundreds of thousands of people were forced out of their homes or fled before a peace accord was signed in 1995. During nearly four years of siege, an average of 329 grenades fell on Sarajevo each day. The daily record of 3,777 grenades was tallied on July 22, 1993. ==Gallery== File:Sarajevo Red Line01.jpeg File:Sarajevo Red Line 2.jpeg File:Sarajevo Red Line 3.jpeg File:Sarajevo Red Line 4.jpeg File:Sarajevo Red Line 5.jpeg File:Sarajevo Red Line 6.jpeg ==References * Category:2012 in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:April 2012 events in Europe Category:Events in Sarajevo Category:Culture in Sarajevo ","title":"Sarajevo Red Line"},{"id":"35319392","text":"Argyresthia atlanticella is a moth of the family Yponomeutidae.

C. flavicans is one of the easier Chionochloa species to identify because of its distinctive plumes.

In 1744 at the age of 18, Deketh joined the Admiralty of Amsterdam. He became a lieutenant and later extraordinary captain and sailed to the Dutch East Indies. In 1758, Deketh continued his career in the Frisian Admiralty. He became captain of a ship, Edam. He was appointed full captain of the Frisian Admiralty in 1760. ==Early life and family== Jacobus Deketh was the youngest son of Jan Goverts Deket(h) and Anna Gardin(g)ius. On 9 April 1726, he was baptized in the Great Church (Grote Kerk) in Harlingen. He had three brothers: Govardus, born 1717, Reiner, born 1719, and Everhardus, born in 1722. Although his father's origins are unknown it is likely that he came from Jutland in Denmark. In 1701, his father got a job in the receiver- general's office of the Frisian Admiralty, and in 1721 Jacobus Deketh became receiver-general himself. His mother, Anna Gardinius, was also associated with the Frisian Admiralty, being the widow of Captain Peter Coderq, before becoming the third wife of Jan Goverts Deketh. ==Career== In 1744 at the age of 18, Deketh joined the Admiralty of Amsterdam. During his service there he first became a lieutenant and later extraordinary captain and sailed to the Dutch East Indies protecting merchant ships. After 1758, Deketh continued his career in the Frisian Admiralty. He commanded the ship Edam. In 1759 he was appointed full captain and in 1760 he commanded the Prins Willem, a frigate with 36 guns. Article also has parts at this and this In this ship he escorted several convoys sailing to Italy, England and France. He made four journeys to the Mediterranean Sea between 1761 and 1763. On behalf of the Dutch Republic he undertook several diplomatic visits to Algiers. He brought gifts with him on these voyages to propitiate the Barbary pirates who at that time made the Mediterranean unsafe. Deketh died at home in Almenum on 26 July 1764, only 38 years old. His death is recorded on a plaque in the Grote Kerk in Harlingen. Deketh's estate included a stable, orangery, gardening shed, carriage house and farm house. His portrait was painted on 13 July 1761 in Livorno by Ranieri Ducci. In the painting he is surprisingly holding a book with the English title Guardian Volume 1, which during a restoration of the picture was discovered to have been a later pentimento, covering a miniature of a lady. The Fries Scheepvaartmuseum purchased the painting from a man from 's-Hertogenbosch, who was discovered to possess it when he showed it in an episode of Tussen Kunst & Kitsch, the Dutch version of the Antiques Roadshow. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Journaal, gehouden door den schrijver H. van den Burch op 's Lands schip Edam, onder bevel achtereenvolgens van den kapitein F.

Hanley, commonly known as \\"the Potteries\\" was the center of china industry in England and Henry's occupation in the 1841 census suggests that he may have been headed into his father's trade. His mother, Barbara, was a cook early in her marriage, and undertook training to become a doctor, but practiced medicine for only a short time. Shortly after Henry's birth in 1828, his father, John, became gravely ill with typhoid fever. The disease was not fatal in John's case, but it left him debilitated so that he no longer had the dexterity to apply intricate designs to pottery and fine china. Barbara's income as a doctor was not sufficient to support their family and so she embarked on a daring business venture for a woman in the mid-nineteenth century—she bought a bakery. Largely due to Barbara's industry and business acumen the bakery was a commercial success. Barbara ran the bakery from Henry's infancy and so Henry was cared for during the day by his father and by his older sister Jane. In 1834, when Henry was six years old, Nicholas Thomas Silcock (1819–1906) came to live with the Heaths. Silcock's mother, Ann died when he was about 10 years old and his father, John Silcock was a carpenter who was in and out of work until his death in 1847.Banner, p. 23-24. Aside from the Heaths' pure charity, it is unclear what circumstances led to Nicholas attaching himself to their family. Silcock would have a significant influence on Henry Heath's life. Silcock, who went by Thomas in the family, was apprenticed to a master carpenter and would have been well on his way to journeyman status when he married Henry's older sister, Jane on April 14, 1841.Banner, p. 125. It is likely that Thomas passed on at least some skills to Henry. The 1841 Census of England and Wales lists Henry (age 12) as working in the potteries and Thomas Silcock as a \\"joiner.\\" Henry's father, John, weakened by typhoid, contracted tuberculosis and died on September 8, 1841.Death Records, Public Records Office, Stoke on Trent, vol. XVII, p. 101. (See FreeBMD.org.) == Mormonism == Thomas Silcock joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints on August 24, 1840 after hearing the preaching of early Mormon missionaries in England, among them, Parley P. Pratt and Wilford Woodruff.Banner, p.6 Jane joined the church in 1841, but only after struggling to convince her father to allow her to do so. Since he left no known journals, it is impossible to say what his attitude was toward the Mormons as a 10-year-old boy, but the new faith would begin to influence his life almost immediately. When his older sister, Jane, left England in 1842 to join Thomas Silcock in Illinois, Henry's mother, Barbara, confessed to Jane that she believed the teachings of the church. Barbara made plans to join the Mormons and leave England. == Emigration to Nauvoo == At age 17 Henry departed England with his mother and two brothers on September 1, 1845. Two months earlier his mother, Barbara, had sold her bakery. She packed a bake oven and considerable hardware, purchased passage and with her three boys, Henry, Thomas and Frederick, set sail on the Oregon, landing in New Orleans on October 28, 1845.Louisiana. New Orleans Passenger Lists, 1820-1945. (NARA M259 and T905). National Archives and Records Administration, Washington D.C. published at FamilySearch.org They arrived some weeks later in their intended destination, Nauvoo, Illinois, an idyllic city founded by Joseph Smith on a bend of the Mississippi river. Nauvoo was in turmoil when Henry arrived after the Death of Joseph Smith sixteen months earlier. Since that time, mobs of anti-Mormon agitators regularly harassed residents. By October 1845, the future of the Latter-day Saint settlement at Nauvoo was increasingly in doubt. Pressured by the state militia and continued mob violence, most residents were preparing to depart the city, ultimately for settlement in the American West. (See Mormon Pioneers article.) Edward Hunter and Nicholas Silcock secured a wagon (likely built by Silcock) and trained Henry and the boys to drive teams. They were scheduled to leave Nauvoo in February, but stayed behind with Hunter while he attempted to sell his considerable property in Nauvoo. When that proved futile, Barbara Heath and her three sons left Nauvoo in April, 1846 along with Edward Hunter and his family. The Heaths lived in Nauvoo for only six months.Banner, p. 307. They traveled to Council Bluffs, Iowa and then on to Winter Quarters at the North part of present-day Omaha Nebraska, arriving in September, 1846.Banner, p. 309. (Nicholas and Jane Heath Silcock remained behind for one more month while Nicholas assisted in the final work on the Nauvoo temple.) Several volumes in his own handwriting, plus numerous compilations of family history indicated Nicholas and Thomas did not immediately follow with the saints west. Poor and without funds they would move to St. Louis where Thomas became the leader of the sixth ward of saints. Edward Hunter a couple of years later back in St. Louis would encourage Thomas and Jane to move west to avoid a bad fever plague hindering Jane's health in the St. Louis area. == Orphan == At Winter Quarters, the sudden influx of approximately 2,500 strained local resources. Despite efforts to trade with local residents and American Indians, many suffered from scurvy due to the lack of fresh vegetables in their diet. Still weak from a battle with malaria (\\"ague\\") contracted en route from Nauvoo, Barbara Heath contracted scurvy and, \\"lay ill for fourteen weeks.\\"Banner, p. 309 citing compiled biographical sketches, principally Dansie, Nina Etta Silcock, The Story of John Heath and Barbara Hulme and their Daughter Jane Heath Silcock.Fourteen weeks is likely an embellishment since Barbara Heath arrived at Winter Quarters in September, 1846 and died on October 20 that year. It does indicate, however, a protracted struggle with scurvy, malaria or both. She died October 20, 1846 from either scurvy or malaria and was buried in an unmarked grave. Her name is listed, however, on a memorial to Mormons who died at Winter Quarters. Barbara's death left Henry and his two brothers, Thomas and Frederick orphans, camped on the American plains, well beyond what anyone then considered civilization with a group of religious outcasts whose future was far from certain. Henry was 18 years old. Thomas was 15 and Frederick was 13. == Trek to Salt Lake Valley == Edward Hunter became the Heath boys surrogate father. He led a wagon company of 155 people and 59 wagons from Winter Quarters to the Great Salt Lake Valley. Henry, and most likely Thomas Heath, were teamsters in the company. They are listed as members of the company in a letter sent from the trail by Hunter to Church leaders on August 17, 1847.Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel, 1847-1868 Henry departed Winter Quarters June 19 and entered the Salt Lake Valley on October 1, 1847. == Exploration of the Southern Great Basin == By 1849, the Mormon pioneers were well established in the Salt Lake Valley and their leader, Brigham Young, was anxious to branch out. At his request, the territorial legislature commissioned an exploring party to map the country to the south and identify areas that would make good settlements. Parley P. Pratt led the party that departed on Nov 23, 1849. Henry Heath was one of the 47 men in the company who explored as far south as the confluence of the Virgin River and Muddy rivers (south of present-day St. George, Utah). They traveled over 526 miles, identified more than 26 sites for future settlement, described soil, vegetation and watershed and charted the transportation routes used in settlement. Heath was 21 years old at the time. The expedition was arduous. They departed at the beginning of winter and soon encountered bitter cold and deep snow. The original plan was to go to the southern end of the Virgin River gorge. By the time they reached the Muddy river, supplies were running low. (Several men on horseback did explore part of the Virgin River gorge.) The return journey was harrowing. As they traveled north, they encountered deep snow that made travel with the wagons extremely difficult. At one point they even removed the wheels from the wagons and attempted to pull them like sleds over the snow. In January 1850 the expedition was mired in snow near present- day Filmore, Utah. With supplies running dangerously low, Pratt decided to take about 20 of the infirm, older and married men on horseback and sprint to Fort Utah (present-day Provo, Utah), approximately 100 miles north. From there he could send a rescue party back to the main body of the expedition. He did so, barely making it to Fort Utah alive. Henry Heath remained with the main body of the expedition bivouacked near Filmore. They survived mainly on rabbits and sleeping in holes in the snow. Although rescue party was sent back, it was seven weeks before the snow was melted enough to return with the wagons. == Marriage and family == Henry Heath married Sarah Ann Bird on February 19, 1851 at Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. The marriage was performed by Parley P. Pratt.Handwritten record in Family Bible belonging to Henry Heath.

All were born in Salt Lake City, Utah. The oldest, Sarah Malissa died in April, 1861. == Frontier lawman == Henry Heath worked as a law enforcement officer from as early as 1862 until at least 1868. In his own account his describes himself as, \\"a member of the Salt Lake police force in 1862.\\"Deseret News, June 3, 1893 At least one other account describes him as a Deputy Sheriff. During that time he participated in several cases that typified the rough-hewn legal system in the American West. The most famous, the apprehension of a grave robber, has been widely embellished, prompting at least one article attempting to debunk some of the more fantastical claims. Contemporary accounts paint a much less sensational picture. In 1862, Henry discovered evidence of grave robbery in the city cemetery when following up on the burial of an indigent criminal (Moroni Clawson) killed in a shoot-out with other officers. His investigation soon led him to the house of the grave digger, Jean-Baptiste, where he found piles of clothing pilfered from graves in the cemetery. Henry feared that the grave-digger may have disturbed the grave of his daughter, Sarah Malissa, who had died within the last year. He apprehended Baptiste and took him to Sarah's grave site. Interviewed years later, Henry said he had determined to kill Baptiste on the spot if he had robbed his child's grave. Baptiste was able to satisfy Henry that Sarah's grave was untouched and so his life was spared. With Baptiste apprehended, Henry's problem quickly turned from revenge to protection. He reported that, \\"The news of our discovery and Baptiste's confession spread like wildfire and it was with difficulty that we got him to the county jail in safety.\\" Baptiste had been at his macabre misdemeanors for some time and so his crimes touched hundreds in the community. But grave robbing, however repugnant, was not a capital offense, even in the frontier west and Baptiste's capture posed the problem of how to both protect and punish him. One of the officers, Albert Dewey, described the community response: \\"It meant death to him to turn him loose in the community. So, to give him a chance for his life, to save him in reality from an exasperated public, it was decided to banish him and a well-stocked island in the Great Salt Lake was chosen for his future home. He was conveyed there but there was not ball and chain or shackles or gyves of any kind on his limbs. He was absolutely untrammeled.\\" Baptiste's forehead was tattooed, \\"Branded for robbing the dead,\\" with ink, not with hot irons. Some recent dramatizations of Baptiste's case have his ears being clipped or \\"docked.\\" Detailed accounts recorded at the time of the banishment have no mention of such treatment. Contemporary accounts, including Henry Heath's own, do not indicate whether he participated in Jean-Baptiste's banishment, but Henry's involvement with the grave robber certainly ended at that point if not before. None of contemporary sources cited in the Deseret News account, including Heath and Dewey, believed that Baptiste remained on the island for any length of time. Most believe that he drowned attempting to leave the island or that he actually escaped and fled the state. == Later life == Heath continued to work as a law-enforcement officer until at least 1868. During that time he also farmed land in Salt Lake City and worked as a night watchman\\"United States Census, 1880,\\" index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MNSV-T6V : accessed 3 April 2012), Henry Heath (Salt Lake City, Salt Lake, Utah). to support his large family.

He is perhaps best known for his De arte canendi (\\"On the Art of Singing\\", third installment published 1540) which is considered to have had a major impact on scholarship and the teaching of singing to young boys. It has been speculated that Heyden was the world's first true musicologist. ==Biography== Heyden was born in Bruck (now part of Erlangen) to a family of Nuremberg patricians. He studied under music theorist Johannes Cochlaeus at the school of St. Lorenz from 1505. He entered the University of Ingolstadt in 1513, graduating with a master's degree in 1519. From 1519 he worked as a cantor, and later as rector at the Nuremberg Hospital School. In January 1525 he was appointed the first Lutheran rector of the school of St. Sebald. Among his pupils was Nicholas Selnecker. He was in regular contact with Hans Sachs and Albrecht Dürer. Over the decades, Heyden developed a great reputation as a scholar, devoted to studies and writing on education, theology, and music. He was originally a Lutheran, but in the 1530s he became influenced by Zwingli. Heyden's birthplace Heyden's first publications appeared around 1523–25, theological tracts such as Salve regina, which he gave to the Reichstag in a different Christian context. In 1524 he published Adversus Hypocritas Calumniatores, super falso sibi inustam haereseos nota, also a theological tract. In 1527 he began publishing textbooks such as Formulae puerilium colloquiorum (Nomenclatura). His Formulae immediately became an important work, used as a phrase book between German-, Polish-, and Hungarian-speaking students at the University of Krakow. In 1530, he wrote the hymn \\"\\" (O man, bewail thy sins great). The Passion song reflects poetically in \\"great passion\\" the sufferings of Christ. He wrote it on a tune by Matthias Greitter, to the original text: \\"Es sind doch selig alle, die im rechten Glauben wandeln hie\\" (Blessed are they all who walk here in true faith). In 1532 he published further text books Leges scholasticae and Musicae stoicheiosis. Heyden's De arte canendi, its third and final edition completed in Nuremberg in 1540, is said to have \\"had a greater impact on modern scholarship than any other writing on mensuration and tactus from the 15th or 16th century.\\" A collection of secular songs, it has been described as a \\"treatise on singing technique aimed at the growing number of amateur musicians who wished to improve their skills.\\" The first installment was produced in 1532 in 26 pages, the second in 1537 grew to 115 pages and the third in 1540 to 163 pages. From 1537, Heyden borrowed a copy of Tinctoris's Proportionale from Georg Forster and extensively studied the composers featured in it. Heyden also composed several hymns and poems. In the third installment, Heyden confessed to being an admirer of Josquin des Prez and his contemporaries, transcribing Josquin's Missa L'homme armé sexti toni (Benedictus), amongst others. Notably, Heyden is said to have \\"adopted a horror fusae position at a time when Italian musicians were writing pieces a note nere under the signature of C.\\" Indeed, the treatise is said to have \\"influenced many twentieth-century scholars to believe that the tactus of the sixteenth century represented an unvarying beat.\\" In 1546 he published Paedonomia scholastica pietatis, studii literarij ac morum.

Liu Bang has been experiencing nightmares and living in fear and apprehension as he constantly suspects that someone is trying to kill him. In his whole life, he has been afraid of only two persons: Xiang Yu, who fought with him for supremacy over China after the fall of the Qin dynasty; Han Xin, a man who previously served Xiang Yu, but later became a general under him, and helped him defeat Xiang Yu. Liu Bang then reflects on key events in his life, such as the Feast at Hong Gate and the Battle of Gaixia. Among all his subjects, Liu Bang regards Han Xin, Xiao He and Zhang Liang as the three most important persons who assisted him in overcoming Xiang Yu in the Chu–Han Contention. However, he believes that Han Xin wants to rebel against him and has Han imprisoned for the past six years. Liu Bang reluctantly releases Han Xin and lets him stay in Zhang Liang's residence. Liu Bang's wife, the empress Lü Zhi, eventually forces Xiao He to lure Han Xin into a trap under the guise of inviting Han to attend a banquet. Han Xin was captured, charged with treason and executed, with his dead body suspended inside a bell. Xiao He cuts off Han Xin's head and presents it to Liu Bang. Liu Bang also dies shortly after.

The film was originally titled 鸿门宴 (Feast at Hong Gate) in Chinese, but was later changed to 王的盛宴 (lit. The King's Supper) to avoid confusion with Daniel Lee's White Vengeance (Chinese title 鸿门宴), which is also based on events in the Chu–Han Contention. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, when asked on how different The Last Supper would be as compared to other Chinese historical films, director Lu Chuan said, \\"I wish to present to audiences something believable. Many earlier Chinese historical films showcase gorgeous scenes and flamboyant costumes, but what actually occurred in history thousands of years ago was not like this. I want to show history in its true form, and things that really happened in the past.\\" Lu also revealed that to paint a more accurate picture of history, he and his team had invested a lot of time and money. He had read many historical books and texts, and carefully designed the character models, costumes, props, etc. Casting Chow Yun-fat and Liu Ye were initially considered for the roles of Liu Bang and Xiang Yu respectively, but eventually the latter was cast as Liu Bang instead and Daniel Wu was chosen to play Xiang Yu. Principal cast members Daniel Wu, Qin Lan and Liu Ye gained weight to prepare for their roles. Wu felt that he was too slim to portray the robustly built Xiang Yu, so he put on 10 kg by having seven meals a day. Qin increased her weight from 48 kg to 54 kg by consuming foods and drinks high in calories and fat in order to play a middle-aged Lü Zhi. 《王的盛宴》结束象山拍摄 项羽造型曝光 Qin portrayed Lü Zhi again in King's War, a 2012 Chinese television series about the Chu–Han Contention.

With further extensions, the line ran from Cocker Street to Dean Street near South Pier and from Manchester Square along Lytham Road. The tramway was a financial success. In 1890 the profits of the year were £2,983 (equivalent to £ in ), out of which a dividend of 7 per cent was paid. ==Closure== When the lease expired, the Corporation took over the tramway on 18 September 1893, and it continued as Blackpool Corporation Tramway.

However, Channel 4 claim the title of the series was based upon Society's preconceptions. The Undateables faced a lot of back lash from doctors who branded the show \\"offensive\\" and \\"exploitative\\". Dr Rachael Pickering said the series left her \\"disturbed at being part of a society that might seek to view disabled people as a source of comedy\\". She also spoke with the BMA, British Medical Association, annual representatives about the danger of patients being exploited by the TV documentary. In an interview with Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield on This Morning, two stars of the then-upcoming fifth series, Tammy and James, hit back at these assertions, with Tammy stating that “I find it quite insulting that I would be exploited in any way. Just because I’m disfigured, I’m not stupid.\\" == Awards and nominations == {  width=\\"100%\\" - ! Year !! Association !! Category !! Nominee(s) !!

It was written by P. J. Plauger of Bell Labs. LIL attempted to fill the gap between assemblers and machine-independent system implementation languages (such as the C programming language), by basically adding structured programming to the PDP-11 assembly language. LIL resembled PL360 with C-like flow control syntax. The LIL compiler \\"lc\\" was part of Fifth Edition Unix (1974), but was dropped by Sixth Edition Unix (1975). Plauger left Bell Labs in the same year. Plauger explains why LIL was abandoned in Bell Labs in favor of C: :... LIL is, however, a failure. Its stiffest competition at Bell Labs is the language C, which is higher level, and machine independent. Every time it looked like C was too expensive to use for a particular project, LIL was considered. But almost every time, it proved easier (and more rewarding) to improve C, or its runtime support, or the hardware, than to invest time in yet another language. ... A machine independent language is always superior -- even for writing machine dependent code (it's easier to find trained programmers) -- so long as the overhead can be endured. It is clear now that writing straightforward code and then measuring it is the formula for the best end product. At worst there will be 5-15 per cent overhead, which is seldom critical. Once system writers become mature enough to recognize this basic truth, they gravitate naturally toward machine independent SILs. ... it looks like the little implementation language is an idea whose time as come -- and gone. ==See also== *High-level assembler ==References== *LIL, The Little Implementation Language *A Little Implementation Language *LIL Reference Manual, June 19, 1974, Bell Labs Technical Memo: TM-74-1352-8. *Programming in LIL: A Tutorial, June 19, 1974, Bell Labs Technical Memo: TM-74-1352-6. *Fifth Edition Unix manuals, lc(6), the LIL compiler.

In 1523 he enrolled at the University of Wittenberg, where he was amongst the likes of Martin Luther, Philipp Melanchthon, Justus Jonas, and pursued a degree in theology. From 1526 to 1528, he was the private secretary of the captain Georg von Frundsberg to the German mercenaries in Italy. He witnessed the Sack of Rome in the Italian War of 1521–1526, along with his friend Jakob Ziegler. He then became an independent scholar teaching theology in Strasbourg, where he was a friend and spiritualistic supporter of Kaspar Schwenckfeld. In 1532-1548 he worked as a chronicler in his native Mindelheim, but he lost this position as a result of the Schmalkaldic War. He lived for a number of years in Frankfurt, working as a scholar until at least 1563, but appears to have returned to live in his native town before his death. He was quoted in Korte Reis by Solomon Schweiger who was visiting Jerusalem at the time. As a scholar, he wrote historical and theological works, including an \\"anti-papal history.\\" He later became known as a hymn writer from about 1530. He paraphrased psalms for the Psalter of Sigmund Hemmel. His hymn \\"In dich hab ich gehoffet, Herr\\" (In you, Lord, have I put my trust) is still included in the German hymnal.

George was brother to William Humphrey Pilcher and John Giles Pilcher.The Law Reports [of the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting]: Equity Cases, Including Bankruptcy Cases, Before the Master of the Rolls, the Vice-chancellors, and the Chief Judge in Bankruptcy, Volume 11, 1870-71, 34 Vic, p.52 Pilcher was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England on 2 April 1824. Immediately afterwards he began to practise as a surgeon in Dean Street, Soho, London, and was soon appointed lecturer on anatomy, physiology, and surgery at the Webb Street school of medicine, Snow's Fields, then belonging to his brother-in-law, Richard Dugard Grainger. His lectures on comparative anatomy drew on Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville. Desmond associates Pilcher at Webb Street with Benthamite views, shared with Thomas Southwood Smith. Pilcher was for many years consulting surgeon to the Surrey Dispensary. As a professional he had to contend in his field with the quackery of John Harrison Curtis, as did James Yearsley and Joseph Toynbee. In 1838 Pilcher was awarded the Fothergillian prize for his treatise On the Structure and Pathology of the Ear, and in 1842 he was elected president of the Medical Society of London. When the Webb Street school was reabsorbed into the Borough hospitals from which it had originally sprung, Pilcher became attached to Lane's school, which was affiliated to St George's Hospital. At that hospital he became lecturer on surgery on 6 July 1843, and in the same year he was made an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. In 1849 he was admitted a member of its council. Pilcher died suddenly on 7 November 1855,Court of Chancery records alternately have this date as 7 Nov 1853 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. ==Pilcher v Rawlins== Pilcher would have become embroiled in the notable opposition referenced as Pilcher v Rawlins in the Court of Chancery had he lived as long as 1872. This case, which is complex and often employed as a justification of the Torrens title system, stemmed from a trust executed by his father, Jeremiah, on 23 August 1830, involved a mortgage transaction entered into by his brother William Humphrey Pilcher, and was only resolved by judgment of Lord Hatherley:COURT OF APPEAL IN CHANCERY - PILCHER v. RAWLINS, 1872 Summary of Hatherley judgment The defence of purchase for value without notice may be sustained, although the Defendant, in order to make out his title to the legal estate, must rely on an instrument which discloses the title of the Plaintiff, the Defendant not having had notice of such instrument at the time of his purchase. The trustees of a settlement advanced the trust money on the security of real property which was conveyed to them by the mortgagor, the mortgage deed noticing the trust. The surviving trustee of the settlement afterwards reconveyed part of the property to the mortgagor on payment of part of the mortgage money, which he appropriated. The mortgagor then conveyed that part of the property to new mortgagees, concealing, with the connivance of the trustee, both the prior mortgage and the reconveyance. When the fraud was discovered, the cestuis que trust under the settlement filed a bill against the new mortgagees claiming priority: Held, that the Court would not interfere to take away the legal estate which passed to the new mortgagees under the reconveyance. The trustees of a settlement advanced the trust money on the security of real property which was conveyed to them by the mortgagor, the mortgage deed noticing the trust. The surviving trustee afterwards induced the mortgagor to execute a deed by which the mortgaged property purported to be conveyed to the trustee as on a purchase by him, though no money in fact passed. The trustee then, concealing the prior mortgage, and shewing title under the pretended purchase deed, conveyed the property to a mortgagee without notice: *Held, that the Court would not interfere to take away the legal estate from the mortgagee. *Decree of the Master of the Rolls reversed. *Carter v.

Not believing that she would kill herself, Steve turns detective to finding the culprits behind the murder, before his policeman friend Inspector Corrigan can solve the mystery. But the brave journalist soon realizes he is going to get much more than what he expects. ==Story== Steve Harmas, American newspaper correspondent, comes after World War II to London, a place where he has had good memories, on official business, and finds that his girlfriend staying there has committed suicide under mysterious circumstances in her apartment. It appears that Netta Scott has set herself ablaze in the apartment. Her neighbors Madge Kennitt and Julius Cole appear to know things but are silent. The police conclude that it is suicide, but Harmas, knowing Netta not to be that type, thinks it is murder, and goes about trying to solve the case. He takes into confidence Inspector Corrigan, a long- time friend, who is known to solve all cases in the country. But Corrigan too simply puts him off, telling him that is suicide, and this leaves Harmas with no option but to solve the case all by himself, though it would not be \\"any of his business'. Soon Netta's body is stolen, and Harmas and the police come to know that Netta's sister also has committed suicide the same way as Netta did. Tracing Netta's activities, Harmas soon comes across a friend of the deceased working in Bradley's bar, a tough guy and a goon. Inspector Corrigan repeatedly arrives wherever Harmas goes and warns him to stay out of this business, but he does not listen. His questions to Mbutis are simply thrown out. Soon Madge Kennitt is also brutally murdered, when Harmas tries to question her, but she leaves a clue - a handwritten name in the sand \\"Jacobi\\" which Harmas sees. He soon learns of Jacobi, who had pulled off a robbery successfully sometime ago and was later murdered, with the loot still missing, and of Selma Jacobi, his girlfriend. Soon Harmas and Bradley have an unpleasant showdown. Bradley sends goons to beat Harmas black and blue and threaten him to leave Britain. Harmas takes on the help of Private detective Merryweather, who assigns Mr. Littlejohns to carry out work according to Harmas' advice. But Merryweather soon backs out after being threatened by Bradley. However, Littlejohns continues to work with Harmas secretly. Harmas then decides to take on the goons himself. He beats Bradley black and blue, and comes to know that Netta Scott is actually alive and in hiding. He goes to Selma Jacobi's house, only to find that Mr. Littlejohns has been brutally murdered by Netta, who then tells him that she did it unknowingly by mistake. She then tells Harmas that she has been involved in the robbery against her will, and the murdered person was her sister Anne, and it was the same person found at both places. She pleads with Harmas to take her to the United States, to which he agrees. She hides in Madge Kennitt's flat. Harmas and Netta plan to fly out of UK secretly with Harmas's pilot friend. But Julius Cole appears on scene and threatens to blackmail Harmas. However, Harmas later traps Julius Cole while he is taking money into revealing the truth about himself, and Julius gets arrested by the Scotland yard police (not Corrigan). The climax where Harmas and Netta are getting ready at the latter's flat to leave at night, when Corrigan breaks into the house to arrest Harmas. To everyone's surprise, Harmas then pushes Netta and takes a bag off her, containing all the robbery loot that Jacobi had pulled off. The cat is now out of the bag, as Harmas goes on to explain everything he has come to know in the case, and that Netta-Anne were one and the same. A bigger surprise then comes when Scotland yard police, secretly called by Harmas to the flat, come out of hiding, and Harmas points to Corrigan as being the murderer. The novel ends with an epilogue, where Harmas and explain everything to his friends. ==External links== * No Business of Mine at Angelfire.com Category:Novels by James Hadley Chase Category:1947 British novels Category:Thriller novels Category:Works published under a pseudonym Category:Jarrold Publishing books ","title":"No Business of Mine"},{"id":"35320252","text":"Henry III, Count of Gorizia (c. 1266-1323) was a member of the Meinhardiner dynasty.Wilhelm Baum, I conti di Gorizia (LEG, 2000), family tree on the cover ==Biography== He was the son of Count Albert I of Gorizia and his wife, Ephemia of Silesia-Głogów.

He now manufactures and sells these bags. He has also worked as a gold miner, and now owns a trailer park in Enumclaw, Washington. ==Theories== According to Carter, the universe is composed of what he calls \\"circlons\\", ring-like structures like \\"atomic LEGO blocks, interlocking rings that snap together to form all the elements\\". He proposes that instead of the Big Bang theory, the universe began when two circlons combined and mated, subdividing to make up all the matter in the universe. His theory is mechanistic, and does not involve action at a distance. He explains gravity as due to the constant expansion of the universe. He derived his theories from experiments involving smoke rings, which he sees as forming analogies for the workings of circlons. His theories and experiments resemble those of 19th century scientists Lord Kelvin and Peter Guthrie Tait. ==Exhibitions== An exhibition about Carter's theories was held at the Santa Monica Museum of Art, in Santa Monica, California in 2002, curated by Margaret Wertheim. The exhibition included video animations, models and diagrams.

Within the parish and also on the A466 is the hamlet of Sandyway. St Weonards lies within the area known to the Saxons (and later English) as Archenfield, previously the kingdom of Ergyng, adjoining the modern border with Wales. Ergyng was later reduced to a semi- autonomous cantref retaining Welsh language and customs until the early nineteenth century. ==St Weonards Church== The parish church is dedicated to St Weonard, who may have been a local Celtic saint. Old stained glass in the church, now destroyed, described him as a hermit and showed him with a woodcutter's axe. His name is spelled in various ways, including Wannard and Gwennarth. Guide to St Weonards Church. Accessed 4 April 2012David Hugh Farmer, The Oxford Dictionary of Saints, Oxford University Press, 2004 The church was first mentioned in a charter of 1155. The chancel arch, part of the south wall, and the inner doorway of the porch, date from the 13th and 14th centuries, as does a large wooden chest. Most of the current church building dates from the early 16th century, when it was enlarged by the building of the north aisle, south porch and tower. The internal oak screens date from the same period, as does the Mynors Chapel, built for the family who owned, and still own, Treago Castle. The pulpit dates from the 17th century. The chancel was enlarged in 1884, and the south vestry added. The churchyard contains the remains of a 15th-century cross base. ==St Weonards Tump== Immediately south of the churchyard is a large mound or \\"tump\\", some in diameter at the base and high. This was traditionally the burial place of St Weonard, in a golden coffin. Excavations in 1855 revealed two cremation burials dating from the Bronze Age within the mound. The tump seems to have been used by the Normans as a motte for a small wooden castle, and in later centuries was used as the site of morris dancing and other village festivities.Michael Raven, A Guide to Herefordshire, 1996, pp.175-177 National Monuments Record: St Weonards Tump.

He provided a valuable insight during his travels in the Balkans, Constantinople and the Middle East, and published a famous travel book of his exploits. He also published the first German language translation of the Qur'an. ==Biography== Schweigger was born in Sulz am Neckar. His father was Henry Schweigger, notarius (court and town clerk) and praefectus pupillorum (superior of the orphanage children in Sulz). Salomon first attended the convent school in Bad Herrenalb-Alpirsbach, and from 1572, studied theology and classical philology at the University of Tübingen. In 1576, having completed his studies and being in search of employment, he was hired as embassy chaplain by Joachim von Sintzendorff, Habsburg ambassador to Istanbul (1578–81). He traveled as a Habsburgian envoy to Constantinople with an Austrian delegation from Vienna on a diplomatic mission of Emperor Rudolf II to Sultan Murad III. He spent several years attached the Habsburg embassy, in the role of Hofprediger (court preacher) successor to Stephan Gerlach. In this travel diary, he vividly describes his personal experiences and also provides an interesting insight into life in the former Ottoman Empire. He deduced that \\"Serbians, Bulgarians, Rascians, have their origins in the ancient German tribes of Daci\\", and also wrote about Bulgarian jewelry, curious at the nose rings he saw worn by the women and the \\"exoticism\\" he witnessed. He also commented on jugglers, fires, the \\"clumsy\\" music of the Turks, their food, customs, and buildings. He left Constantinople in 1581 and traveled to Egypt and Jerusalem, where he quoted Adam Reusner. Visiting Ramla, he commented on the Jewish populations in the city. In Egypt, he traveled with Gerlach and David Chytraeus. He also visited Damascus before returning to Germany via Crete and Venice. On returning to Germany, Schweigger served as pastor in the town of Grötzingen from 1581–1589. In 1589, Heinrich Hermann Baron Schutzbar von Milchling, appointed Schweigger to be patron of the parish of Wilhermsdorf in Middle Franconia. The City of Nuremberg called him in 1605 to serve at the Frauenkirche where he worked for 17 years. His account of his years spent in the Balkans, Turkey and the Middle East would later gain fame in his \\"Ein newe Reiss Beschreibung a Deutschland Nach Constantinopel und Jerusalem\\", published in 1608. Several of his sketches appeared centuries later in Kiril Petkov's 1997 book Infidels, Turks, and Women: The South Slavs in the German Mind, ca. 1400-1600. In 1616, he published \\"The Turkish Alcoran, religion, and superstition\\". Solomon is also the author of the first German version of the Qur'an. In the Ottoman Empire, Schweigger found an Italian translation of the Qur'an, which was known among Christians living there to a certain extent. Schweigger translated from the Italian but published it only after his return to Nuremberg (1616, 2nd edition 1623, further editions without naming 1659; 1664). He translated from a first Italian version of 1547 by Andrea Arrivabene, itself based on translation from Latin by Robert of Ketton in the 12th century. It is surprising that Schweigger did not resort to the Latin text. Schweigger's German translation of the Italian translation of the Latin translation of the Arabic Koran was in turn translated into Dutch in 1641 and printed in Hamburg. ==Personal life== He was first married to Susanna Michael (d. 1585 in Grötzingen) from Memmingen, who in 1583 gave birth to his first son, Immanuel, who became the father of the Nuremberg sculptor, Georg Schweigger. Salomon married Elisabetha Vischer on 13 September 1585. On 16 September 1588, their son Solomon was born, whose descendants lived in Nuremberg. He died, aged 71, in Nürnberg, and was buried at St. Rochus Cemetery. ==Literature== *Heyd, Wilhelm von, Schweigger, Salomon. In: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (ADB).

However, the phrase is mentioned neither in the non-fiction book that preceded the film nor in any documentation of the scandal. The book has the phrase \\"The key was the secret campaign cash, and it should all be traced,\\" which author Bob Woodward says to Senator Sam Ervin.Woodward, Bernstein, All the President's Men, Chapter 12, p. 248 ==History== The phrase Follow the money was mentioned by Henry E. Peterson at the 1974 Senate Judiciary Committee hearings as Earl J. Silbert was nominated to U.S. Attorney. A 1975 book by Clive Borrell and Brian Cashinella, Crime in Britain Today, also uses the phrase. Since the 1970s, \\"follow the money\\" has been used several times in investigative journalism and political debate. One example is Follow the Money, a series of CBS reports. Donald Trump In September 2016, the Trump campaign used the phrase to criticise Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, a humanitarian aid non- profit; for several events that took place, including; a uranium deal approved by Clinton's state department after her charitable foundation received large donations from people with stakes in the deal; Clinton's relationship with Irish telecom billionaire Denis O’Brien; and a 2009 deal over the disclosing of the identities of American account-holders, that the State Department concluded with Swiss bank UBS, a Clinton Foundation donor. In February 2017, Carl Bernstein, who with Woodward exposed the Watergate scandal, used the phrase to encourage reporters to discover President Trump's potential conflicts of interest. The Trump Foundation was later found guilty of illegal campaign contributions and other financial crimes. In November 2019, Trump was ordered to pay a $2 million settlement for misusing the foundation for his business and political purposes. ==See also== * Cui bono, a Latin phrase meaning \\"To whose benefit?\\", suggesting a hidden motive. * Cherchez la femme, a French phrase taking women to be the chief motive in crimes. * Political corruption ==ReferencesLinks== * Fred Shapiro on the phrase's origin Category:Finance in the United States Category:Catchphrases Category:Political funding Category:Political corruption Category:Watergate scandal Category:Words and phrases introduced in 1976 Category:Quotations from film ","title":"Follow the money"},{"id":"35320426","text":"Argyresthia praecocella, the ochreous argent or juniper berry miner moth, is a moth of the family Yponomeutidae.

According to a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers conducted by The Marketing Accountability Standards Board, 69% of subjects responded that they consider average annual growth rate to be a useful measurement.Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. . The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language in Marketing Project. The formula used to calculate annual growth rate uses the previous year as a base. Over longer periods of time, compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is generally an acceptable metric for average growth rates.  Measure of success  Perceptions of the success or failure of many enterprises and businesses are based on assessments of their growth. Measurements of year-on- year growth, however, are complicated by two simple factors: * Changes over time in the base from which growth is measured. Such changes might include increases in the number of stores, markets, or salespeople. This issue is addressed by using 'same store' measures (or corollary measures for markets, sales personnel and so on). * Compounding growth over multiple periods. For example, if a company achieves 30% growth in one year, but its results remain unchanged over the two subsequent years, this would not be the same as 10% growth in each of three years. CAGR, the compound annual growth rate, addresses this issue.  Calculations  \\"Percentage growth is the central plank of year-on-year analysis. Dividing the results for the current period by the results for the prior period will yield a comparative figure. Subtracting one from the other will highlight the increase or decrease between periods. When evaluating the comparatives, one might say that results in Year 2 were, for example, 110% of those in Year 1. To convert this figure to a growth rate, one need only subtract 100%. The periods considered are often years, but any time-frame can be chosen.\\" The first step of this process is to identify the value of the investment at the beginning and end of the year. The next step is to subtract the beginning value from the end value. Dividing the difference by the beginning value, and then multiplying the answer by 100 converts it to a percentage. == Notes and references == Works cited * Category:Economic growth Category:Actuarial science Category:Investment ","title":"Annual growth rate"},{"id":"35320567","text":"Sir Anthony Forrest ( 1590s–1620s) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1624 to 1626.

Catherine of Austria by Anton Boys ==Early life and family== Catherine was the oldest of two daughters; her younger sister was Agnes of Austria, who married Bolko II the Small, Duke of Świdnica. The daughters' paternal grandparents were Albert I of Germany (son of Rudolph I of Germany) and Elisabeth of Gorizia-Tyrol, a descendant of Henry II of England, and their maternal grandparents were Amadeus V, Count of Savoy and his second wife Maria of Brabant.

The marriage contract was signed at Vincennes on 25 November 1338. The marriage produced one son, Enguerrand.

The protests began during October 2008 after the Fianna Fáil–Green Party coalition of the 30th Dáil oversaw the implementation of the bank guarantee, and were given further impetus by the late 2010 intervention of the European Union/European Central Bank/International Monetary Fund troika and the collapse of that government early the following year. Protests continued during the Fine Gael–Labour coalition of the 31st Dáil. ==Background== Workers march through Dublin against the government's response to the financial crisis, 2009 The post-2008 Irish economic downturn, coincided with a series of banking scandals, followed the 1990s and 2000s Celtic Tiger period of rapid real economic growth fuelled by foreign direct investment, a subsequent property bubble which rendered the real economy uncompetitive, and an expansion in bank lending in the early 2000s. An initial slowdown in economic growth amid the international financial crisis of 2007–08 greatly intensified in late 2008 and the country fell into recession for the first time since the 1980s. Emigration, as did unemployment (particularly in the construction sector), escalated to levels not seen since that decade. The Irish Stock Exchange (ISEQ) general index, which reached a peak of 10,000 points briefly in April 2007, fell to 1,987 points—a 14-year low—on 24 February 2009 (the last time it was under 2,000 being mid-1995). In September 2008, the Irish government—a Fianna Fáil-Green coalition—officially acknowledged the country's descent into recession; a massive jump in unemployment occurred in the following months. Ireland was the first state in the eurozone to enter recession, as declared by the Central Statistics Office (CSO). By January 2009, the number of people living on unemployment benefits had risen to 326,000—the highest monthly level since records began in 1967—and the unemployment rate rose from 6.5% in July 2008 to 14.8% in July 2012. The slumping economy drew 100,000 demonstrators onto the streets of Dublin on 21 February 2009, amid further talk of protests and industrial action. With the banks \\"guaranteed\\", and the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) established on the evening of 21 November 2010, then Taoiseach Brian Cowen confirmed on live television that the EU/ECB/IMF troika would be involving itself in Ireland's financial affairs. Support for the Fianna Fáil party, dominant for much of the previous century, then crumbled; in an unprecedented event in the nation's history, it fell to third place in an opinion poll conducted by The Irish Times—placing behind Fine Gael and the Labour Party, the latter rising above Fianna Fáil for the first time. On 22 November, the Greens called for an election the following year. The 2011 general election replaced the ruling coalition another, between Fine Gael and Labour. This coalition continues with the same austerity policies of the previous coalition, as the country's larger parties all favour a similar agenda. Official statistics showed a drop in most crimes coinciding with the economic downturn. Burglaries, however, rose by approximately 10% and recorded prostitution offences more than doubled from 2009 to 2010. In late 2014 the unemployment rate was 11.0% on the seasonally adjusted measure, still over double the lows of the mid-2000s but down from a peak of 15.1% in early 2012. The Irish economy started to recover from 2014 onwards. ==2008== The Irish government officially declared it was in a recession in September 2008. Before this declaration, the government announced, on 3 September 2008, that it would bring forward the 2009 government budget from its usual December date to 14 October 2008. In a statement, the government claimed that this was largely due to a decrease in the global economy. The budget, labelled \\"the toughest in many years\\", included a number of controversial measures such as a proposed income levy which was eventually restructured, and the withdrawal of previously promised HPV vaccines for schoolgirls. Other results of the budget included a new income levy being imposed on all workers above a specified threshold and the closure of a number of military barracks near the border with Northern Ireland. An unexpected public outcry was invoked over the proposed withdrawal of medical cards and the threatened return of university fees. A series of demonstrations ensued amongst teachers and farmers, whilst on 22 October 2008, at least 25,000 pensioners and students descended in solidarity on the Irish parliament at Leinster House, Kildare Street, Dublin. Some of the pensioners cheered on the students as the protests passed each other on the streets of Dublin. Changes to education led to a ministerial meeting with three Church of Ireland bishops who were assured by O'Keeffe that religious instruction would be unaffected by the budget changes. Rebellion within the ranks of the ruling coalition government led to a number of defections of disenchanted coalition members. County Wicklow TD Joe Behan resigned from the Fianna Fáil party in protests at the proposed medical card changes after suggesting that past taoisigh Éamon de Valera and Seán Lemass \\"would be turning in their graves at the decisions made in the past week\\". Independent Deputy Finian McGrath then threatened to withdraw his support for the government unless the plan to remove the over-70s automatic right to a medical card was withdrawn completely. Taoiseach Brian Cowen postponed a planned trip to China, sending Minister for Education and Science Batt O'Keeffe ahead to lead the delegation. Behan, alongside McGrath and former government minister Jim McDaid, later voted against his former colleagues in two crucial Dáil votes on medical cards and cancer vaccines. These defections reduced the Irish government's majority of twelve by one quarter. ==2009== On 18 February 2009, 13,000 civil servants voted for industrial action over a proposed pension levy.

Literary critic and translator, he is the author of more than a dozen books and numerous articles and essays. He has travelled widely and lived in several Asian and African countries as a university lecturer and director of French cultural institutes under the French Foreign Service (Singapore, Japan, Indonesia, Mauritania, Côte d’Ivoire). == Career == While serving as a young French lecturer at the University of Singapore he fell under the charm of the literatures and poetry of the Southeast Asian Archipelago. Since then, his ambition, both personal as well as professional, has been to draw closer together what he calls the Francophone and the Malayophone Archipelagoes (i.e. the countries bound by a common language, Malay / Indonesian (Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore and the southern province of Patani in Thailand) – this extremely rich crossroad of civilisations and cultures of the ‘East Indies’ which according to him have by far insufficiently attracted the French literary world compared to the ‘West Indies’. These problematics are illustrated in his book Les Lèvres du Monde (The Lips of the World, 2011), which presents diverse thematics and scores of names of writers from this part of the world, starting from the Malay version of the Story of Alexander the Great to contemporary Cambodian cinema ; from Derek Walcott to Multatuli via Henri Fauconnier and Pramoedya Ananta Toer; from Senghor to the Indonesians Sitor Situmorang and Ayu Utami or the Singaporean poet Edwin Thumboo; from Victor Segalen to Jean Rhys via Joseph Conrad; from Césaire and Edouard Glissant to the Malaysian poet Muhammad Haji Salleh, etc. Exploring an immense intercultural space little known to the Western public, he highlights in thirty over essays the unsuspected wealth of numerous relations between literary “archipelagoes” apparently remote. Since long familiar with these literatures, he has translated and commented on poetry, both modern and traditional, as can be seen in his Anthology of some sixty modern poets La Terre et l’Eau (Land and Water) and above all Sonorités pour adoucir le souci (Rhymes to Soothe Care). Due to this work, a too often neglected poetical world has entered the prestigious UNESCO collection of the World Representative Works. His interest and work on the pantun have made him one of the few French specialists of this genre, as illustrated by his Histoire du Genre Pantoun (History of the Pantun Genre, 1998) and several translations and new translations : Pantouns malais (Malay Pantun, 1993), Pantouns malais (2009), Le Chant à quatre mains (The Four-Hand Singing — Pantun and other Love Poems, 2011). His latest book is a compilation of Jungle Tales (Contes Sauvages – Les très curieuses histoires de Kancil le petit chevrotain, 2012), an adaptation of a few of the very famous folkloric animal tales on Kancil or Pelanduk the Mouse-deer published in Singapore at the turn of the 20th Century—a confirmation of Georges Voisset’s long lasting commitment for Malay traditional literatures, as he re-orientates our curiosity towards a more general and younger public. == A History of the Pantun genre == The Malay pantun is a poetical expression of orality which can be formalized as a quatrain of four lines which cross rhyme (ABAB), where the first two lines introduce a general analogical atmosphere while the last two convey the meaning of the poem, which can be moral, sentimental, etc. Georges Voisset explains and illustrates in his book the filiation from the Malay pantun to the pantoum \\"à la française\\" and its internationalization, after this form was revealed to Victor Hugo by a young romantic orientalist, Ernest Fouinet. Hugo was the first, in France, to quote a linked pantun in a famous note of his collection The Orientals (1829). It is first of all due to the success of this work, and to a misprint (pantoum for pantoun), that the pantoum owes its individualization in French poetics. But it is Leconte de Lisle who first wrote a really valuable series of linked pantun; after him, the international literary movement of the Parnasse would spread to the entire francophone area. The names of Théophile Gautier, Théodore de Banville, Charles Asselineau and his friend Baudelaire, Verlaine, Jules Laforgue, René Ghil, should be mentioned, but also the Vietnamese poet Nguyen Van Xiem, etc. Georges Voisset then quotes, beyond Francophonie, numerous other poets who practiced the linked pantun, many from other sources than Hugo’s, such as Chamisso the Franco-German poet, the Russian Karolina Pavlova, the Czech and Nobel Prize winner Jaroslav Seifert, etc. Georges Voisset ends his book by questioning the total lack of interest shown for the genuine Malay form in the French-speaking world, with the exception of a handful of poets, whereas the Japanese haiku has received an overwhelming success. A regrettable state of affairs, according to Georges Voisset who has endeavoured to reveal in his translations and works the infinite beauty of the pantun genre. == Works ==  Essays  *Histoire du genre pantoun.

He was educated at Chatham House, Ramsgate, and at Charterhouse School (1832–4). He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, but at the end of his first term migrated to Clare College where he was admitted on 17 December 1834, and elected a scholar on 24 January 1835. In 1838 he obtained a Latin essay prize. He graduated B.A. in 1840 and M.A. in 1859, after which he moved to Corpus Christi College. On 16 June 1870 he was incorporated at Exeter College, Oxford. Riley was called to the bar at the Inner Temple on 23 November 1847, but early in life he began hack work for booksellers to make a living, by editing and translation. On the creation of the Historical Manuscripts Commission (by royal charter in April 1869), Riley was engaged as an additional inspector for England, and given the task of examining the archives of various municipal corporations, the muniments of the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, and the documents in the registries of various bishops and chapters. Riley died at Hainault House, the Crescent, Selhurst, Croydon, on 14 April 1878, aged 61. ==Works== For Bohn's Classical Library, Riley translated: * the complete works of Ovid (the Metamorphoses, 1851, the Fasti, Tristia, &c.;, 1851, and the Heroides, 1852) * the comedies of Plautus (1852, 2 vols.) * the Pharsalia of Lucan (1853) * the comedies of Terence and the fables of Phædrus (1853) *(with John Bostock) the Natural History of Pliny the elder (1855–7, 6 vols.) His Dictionary of Latin Quotations (1856 and 1860), was included in the same series. For Bohn's Antiquarian Library, he translated the Annals of Roger de Hoveden (1853, 2 vols.); and Ingulph's Chronicle of the Abbey of Croyland (1854). For the Rolls Series, he edited the Munimenta Gildhallae Londoniensis, including the Liber Albus (1859), the Liber Custumarum (1860, in two parts), with a translation of the Anglo-Norman passages, and a glossary (1862); the Chronica Monasterii S. Albani, comprising the Annals of John Amundesham (1870 and 1871, 2 vols.); and a further set of the chronicles of St. Albans, in eleven volumes, including the works of Thomas Walsingham, John of Trokelowe, Henry de Blaneford, and William Rishanger, and the register of John Whethamstede. Riley translated for the corporation of the city of London the Liber Albus (1861) and the Chronicles of the Mayors and Sheriffs of London, 1188–1274, from the Latin and Anglo-Norman of Arnald Fitz-Thedmar; with the French Chronicle of London, 1259–1343, from the Chroniques de London (1863). He also published in 1868 a volume entitled Memorials of London and London Life, a series of Extracts from the City Archives, 1276–1419. Riley wrote in the Athenaeum, the Gentleman's Magazine, and the Archaeological Journal.

Anesthesia refers to the use of drugs to subdue a patient's mind and prevent him or her from feeling any pain during a surgical operation. It is very important for anesthesia tools to be well organized and maintained so that patients receive proper anesthesia care. To ensure that patients remain unconscious and pain-free throughout the procedure, anesthesia supply carts can help to keep all the necessary anesthesia tools easily at hand. These carts allow anesthesiologists easy access to all anesthesia tools, in one simple, portable location. Anesthesiologists are able to present or take away their medical tools quickly and easily whenever they are needed. Sometimes, patients must be rapidly taken out of the anesthetized state and this may not be possible or as easy if anesthesiology carts are not utilized. The design of Anesthesia supply carts allows for easy transportation between rooms and could be used in multiple operating rooms. Medical personnel save time and energy by not having to seek out and gather anesthesia tools. Many optimized features are available for anesthesiology carts. To keep anesthesia tools safe and in the hands of authorized users, locking drawers are a useful option. These same anesthesiology supplies cart drawers glide smoothly on rolling sliders to prevent displacement or wobbling. Built-in stabilizing bases increase anesthesia storage cart stability and prevent tipping during transport. Easy- grip push handles and smooth-rolling and locking casters provide for maximum anesthesiologist cart maneuverability. Anesthesiology carts are available in many different sizes and colors to accommodate specific facility needs. Colors are often used by facilities to coordinate which cart belongs in which room in the hospital or medical center. ==Anesthesia machine vs anesthesia cart== The Anesthesia machine contains mechanical respiratory support (ventilator) and O2 support as well as being a means for administering anesthetic gases which may be used for sedation as well as total anesthesia. An anesthesia cart holds extra IV push meds for anesthesia, sedation and reversal, extra equipment that the person giving anesthesia/sedation might need, and the hardware for respiratory support and resuscitation.

The agency is formally known as \\"die Beauftragte des Landes Brandenburg zur Aufarbeitung der Folgen der kommunistischen Diktatur“ (abbreviated as LAkD) and usually referred to as „Die Landesbeauftragte für Aufarbeitung“ or „Die Aufarbeitungsbeauftragte“. == Background ==  The Brandenburg \\"Aufarbeitungsbeauftragtengesetz\\"  On 7 July 2009, in one of the last sessions of the legislative period, the Brandenburg state parliament approved the “Aufarbeitungsbeauftragtengesetz”. While similar legislation had been passed in all the other new states by the early 1990s, Brandenburg was the last to catch up under the Grand Coalition of Christian (CDU) and Social Democrats (SPD). The commissioner's official title differs from that of her counterparts in other states, who are generally referred to as \\"Commissioner for the Stasi Records\\".  Political situation after the 2009 state elections  The first commissioner, Ulrike Poppe (since 2010). The state elections of autumn 2009 led to the formation of a governing coalition by the Social Democrats and the Left Party (\\"Die Linke\\"). In the aftermath, concerns were raised that the discussion (“Aufarbeitung”) of the Socialist Unity Party (SED) dictatorship and its consequences would receive even less attention. Indeed, the subject had been strongly neglected in Brandenburg ever since the Peaceful Revolution, as the long-lived governments under Manfred Stolpe (SPD) had chosen to pursue a policy of indulgence towards former GDR and MfS (“Stasi”) officials. Despite attempts at appeasement - for instance, by outlining their historical policy in the coalition contract - the new government was threatening to lose even more of its credibility as a determined agent of “Aufarbeitung” when the media exposed the MfS implications of several Left Party deputies. Consequently, it was crucial for the state parliament to prove its willingness to come to terms with the past, which was eventually achieved through the nomination of a candidate as Brandenburg commissioner, the general submission of all MPs to an MfS check-up, and the establishment of a commission to assess Brandenburg’s socialist history and its transition to democracy.  Appointment of Ulrike Poppe as first commissioner  On 17 December 2009 the state parliament unanimously elected the former member of the GDR opposition and civil-rights activist Ulrike Poppe as Brandenburg’s first commissioner. Poppe officially began her six years’ term on 22 February 2010 and was solemnly introduced into her office on 23 March by the president of the state parliament Gunter Fritsch (SPD) at Cecilienhof Palace, Potsdam.  First amendment to the “Aufarbeitungsbeauftragtengesetz”  After the law’s coming into effect, the commissioner was subordinated to the Brandenburg Department for Education, Youth and Sports. However, on 26 February 2010 the state parliament passed a resolution by which the commissioner was transferred from the Department’s jurisdiction to that of the state parliament. This measure was designed to guarantee the commissioner’s independence from respective governments. == Function == Para. 2 of the “Aufarbeitungsbeauftragtengesetz” defines the duties of the state commissioner. These can be summarised in three categories. The LAkD office in central Potsdam (Hegelallee 3)  Advising citizens  The commissioner provides counsel for all those who seek clarification as to the history of the Soviet occupation zone and the GDR. Most of these will be victims of the regime requiring support with their application for access to MfS files about them (as per §§13-17 of the Stasi Records Act). The commissioner also assists victims of political persecution and their relatives during the procedures of rehabilitation and compensation as per the “SED-Unrechtsbereinigungsgesetze”, or by procuring financial or medical aid in case their political persecution has had lasting repercussions for their health.  Political and historical education  The commissioner is also responsible for informing the public about the workings of dictatorships, especially the socialist dictatorship in the Soviet occupation zone and the GDR. This is partly done in collaboration with victims’ associations, educational institutions and memorials.  Advising public offices on how to treat MfS records and to check employees and applicants  The commissioner also gives guidance to state institutions and other public offices wishing to assess the biographies of their employees and job applicants for collaboration with the MfS. == First report (December 2009 – December 2011) == On 15 March 2012 Ulrike Poppe handed over her first report to the president of the state parliament, Gunter Fritsch. As per §4 of the “Aufarbeitungsbeauftragtengesetz” the commissioner must give the state parliament account of his or her work every other year. According to the report, when the commissioner took her office, the greatest challenge lay in the backlog of victims in need of counselling. During the first two years a total of 1,977 persons consulted the commissioner for help. As to the report, many of the increasingly elderly victims are reluctant to seek counsel, fearing the lengthy application procedures before official recognition of their status as victims. Aware of this widespread hesitation, the commissioner suggested that the processors in charge treat their cases with greater sensitivity and advocated a so-called inversion of the evidence-taking procedure. In other words, if a board refuses to recognise a health problem as the effect of repression, it should no longer be the responsibility of the applicant to produce the counter-evidence but that of the board. Further, the report summarises the projects supported by the commissioner and her collaboration with organisations and institutions, for instance in form of an oral history project with the Potsdam University of Applied Sciences, cooperation with several victims’ associations and the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records. ==References *Official LAkD website *First report (2012) - Part 1 *First report (2012) - Part 2 Category:Brandenburg ","title":"Land Brandenburg Commissioner for the Study of the Repercussions of the Communist Dictatorship"},{"id":"35321003","text":"Linda Castillo is an American author of novels including the New York Times bestsellingNew York Times Best Seller list, July 11, 2010.

The house was constructed in the 1960s during the period of architectural experimentation on materiality and structure in houses. Simon House was the first project received on the day when Guilford Bell and Neil Clerehan opened their office in South Yarra. The Simons were Clerehan's partners but the house was a collaboration of partners. Therefore, the house has a mixture of both Clerehan and Bell's typical style of architecture. == Description == The house is a single-storey house, planned in a rectangular shape. The house consists of five bedrooms, two toilets, two garages, one kitchen, dining room, living room, pool and terrace. The enclosed pool, natural finishes, glazed wall and an extensive view over the bay recalled contemporary Californian house of architects like Craig Ellwood. design diagram == Design Approach == The central core program of the house was a pool and terrace, positioned right in the centre of the house. With the pool and terrace in the centre with programs surrounds that engaged with it, allows family members to gather together. It was said that was one of Clerehan's conception of the house where how he deal with the provision of a frame for family life. The pool and living room aligned on axis, forming the central part of a symmetrical square plan. Then the programs around the pool were given a corresponding position in the house's spatial hierarchy. Because of this distinct insistence of having an equivalent position of programs, the programs are mirrored and consist of dual garages and entrances. It was said that was one of Bell's typical style of architecture. Bell has been influenced by the architecture and gardens of Japan. As a countryman, he feels, when in the city, a hunger for the freedom of sky and vegetation. He thinks that a building must stand in spectacular relationship to its environment. With the pool and terrace positioned in the centre of the house, the engagement between the indoor and outdoor spaces then became ambiguous. It creates a sense of feeling when one is inside, it will feels like outdoors and when one is outside it will feels like indoors. One of his design principal was that he thinks of views or views from the building first, instead of the form of the building. Therefore, glass panels are used across the living and dining areas to capture the view of the bay.perspective view of outside terrace == Current == Unfortunately, one of the garage have been renovated into a main entrance, also as a living room. Another garage is built right opposite the existing garage. In this approach, it loses the spatial qualities of the house but in turn allows a convenient use to the owner in the house's circulation. current view of Simon House garage == Materiality == The materiality that uses in the house were unadorned, they are fibrous plaster ceiling left in natural, unpainted stated, flat steel decking roof, timber walls, and reinforced concrete floor slab under concrete block. == Awards == Neil Clerehan and Guilford Bell has received numerous honours for his architectural works while they were practicing architecture. The Simon House was the most prominent work of Bell Clerehan partnership. The home beautiful considered the pool, terrace to be one of Australia's outstanding outdoor areas.

A typical dowry may include cash and jewellery. Requests for, and payment of, dowry were prohibited under the Dowry Prohibition Act (1961) in Indian civil law and subsequently by Sections 304B and 498a of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), but the practice still continues, illegally.

The palace owes its name to Duchess Auguste (1633–1701). Augustenborg gave its name to the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg- Augustenburg, the last member of which was Duke Christian August II (1798–1869).\\"Augustianas historie\\", Sønderborg Kommune. Retrieved 4 April 2012. ==History== Facade The original half-timbered manor house was built in 1660-4 by Ernest Günther, the first Duke of Augustenborg, after he bought the village of Stavensbøl and demolished it for the land. The one-storey, red- roofed buildings around the outer courtyard were added from 1733 while the main three-winged building, replacing the original manor, was built from 1770 to 1776 in full symmetry, a fine example of Baroque architecture. With its yellow-painted walls and blue-tiled roof, the wings gradually increase in height up to the central section. The three central bays of the facade protrude as an avant-corps three storeys high. Inside a beautiful entrance hall was finished in white-painted stucco by the Italian decorator Michel Angelo Taddei (1755–1831). Taddei also worked on the interior of the two- storey Baroque chapel in the building's northern wing, adding a Rococo altarpiece with an integrated pulpit as well as decorations along the vaults and walls of the nave.\\"Augustenborg Slot\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 5 April 2012. During the same period, much of the town was regenerated. The palace building underwent further renovation in the 1920s. Hans Christian Andersen spent two weeks at the palace in the autumn of 1844 and wrote The Little Match Girl when he visited the castle. During the First Schleswig War (1848–50), Christian August II, the last duke to live in the palace, left Augustenborg as a result of his close relations with Germany. Thereafter the building was first used as a barracks and from 1878 as a seminary for women. In 1921, Augustenborg was purchased by the Danish state. It was fitted out as a hospital in 1927–28 and since 1932 has been used as a psychiatric hospital. There is an exhibit about the palace, the town and its ducal history in the building's entryway. ==Church== The church of Augustenborg Palace. The largest room in the castle is the church hall, which dates from the late 18th century. Not visible from the outside, it covers the entire two-storey annexe of the north wing and is the successor of an older chapel, from 1671, which was demolished before the construction of the castle. The hall, which has served as the parish church of the town since 1874, was extensively restored in 1972. The rococo architecture of the church hall is consistent with the rest of the building. The stucco work was probably designed by Michelangelo Taddei. The hall has seven divided window bays. Six Doric and six Corinthian columns separate the room, forming a three-aisled hall. A curved balustrade leads to the pulpit altar on the eastern wall. The organ is placed over the high altar and was built by the Holstein organ builder, Johann Daniel Busch. The Carrara marble baptismal font was a gift of the Russian Tsar Alexander I. ==Grounds== Palace grounds The castle is situated directly above a bay of the Augustenburger Fjord, an arm of the Baltic Sea. The views of the bay and the landscape behind it appear to be a continuation of the garden in the distance. The grounds included a Baroque-style garden, which in the 19th century was transformed into a landscaped park. The garden includes large grass terraces and a shaped topiary hedge. The garden area in front of the palace building is framed by trees and a sculpted hills, which is accessible by trails. Under one of the lindens in the castle grounds is a memorial plaque to the poet Andersen, who is said to have worked there for many of his stories. Within the park, there are two summer-houses and outbuildings, which after the departure of the ducal family in 1848, were converted to public use. The House of Prince is a small, relatively spartan-appearing house. It was built in 1765 for Emil August, the younger brother of Duke Frederick Christian I. The red house served as a hermitage for Emil August who lived there until his death in 1786. The small estate was bequeathed to his sister, Christine Louise Caroline, for use in her lifetime. The palace church, which now serves as the parish church of Augustenborg, is open to the public in the summer months. Tours of the ducal apartments can be arranged by appointment.\\"Augustenborg Slot og by\\", Kulturarv.dk.

Elder was troubled by illness throughout her life, and perhaps as a result, \\"turned her creative energies to painting, poetry-writing, gardening and her house, which she filled with light and beauty\\". In the mid-1960s, encouraged by Bruce Dawe and Philip Martin she began to publish poetry regularly in newspapers and periodicals, including the Australian, Meanjin, Quadrant, Overland and Southern Review. Her first collection of Poems, For the Record, was published in 1972. A second collection of her poetry, Crazy Woman, was published posthumously in 1976, and was highly commended in the National Book Council awards for 1977. In 1976, her husband John Elder established The Anne Elder Trust Fund Award for poetry, presented annually to the best first book of poetry published in Australia. The award was administered for forty years by the Victorian Branch of the Fellowship of Australian Writers. It is now run by Australian Poetry. A commemorative volume of her poetry, Small Clay Birds, was published by Monash University in 1988. A biography of Anne Elder, The Heart's Ground, written by Julia Hamer, appeared in 2018 along with a new collection of Anne's poems, The Bright and the Cold, compiled by her daughter Catherine Elder. Both volumes are published by Lauranton Books. == Personal == Born Anne Josephine Chloe Mackintosh in Auckland, New Zealand in 1918, she moved to Melbourne with her parents in 1921. In 1940 she married John Stanley Elder, a solicitor serving in the 2nd/8th Field Regiment, Australian Imperial Force. They had two children, a son and a daughter, born in 1945 and 1947.

The concert featured symphonic movements based on the Kingdom Hearts series, Secret of Mana, the Chrono series, and the Final Fantasy series. The concert was produced and directed by Thomas Böcker, with arrangements provided by Finnish composer and musician Jonne Valtonen with assistance by Roger Wanamo. Due to overwhelming demand, a second concert was necessitated at the König-Pilsener-Arena in Oberhausen, on September 11, 2009. The concert was performed by the WDR Radio Orchestra Cologne and the WDR Radio Choir Cologne under conduction from Arnie Roth, with guest performers Rony Barrak and Benyamin Nuss joining the orchestra. Symphonic Fantasies was broadcast over radio on the WDR4 station and streamed live video online. In 2012, four new performances were scheduled, taking stage in Tokyo, Stockholm, and a reprise in Cologne. These performances featured slightly modified versions of the original arrangements, and like the original concerts, were sold out. Another performance was held in London in October 2016 by the London Symphony Orchestra. The original concert and the Tokyo concert both sparked the release of an album. These albums, along with the concerts themselves, were heavily praised, both for the quality of the performance and for the quality of Valtonen's arrangements, which overlaid themes from multiple pieces rather than relying on a traditional medley. ==Concerts== Production Thomas Böcker and then WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne director Winfried Fechner began collaborating on orchestrated video game concerts in 2007, after Fechner had attended the Fifth Symphonic Game Music Concert held in Leipzig. As their ideas and plans materialized, three projects were set in motion to determine the interest of a younger audience in classical music performance and the aptitude of the WDR orchestra in focusing on a new source of compositions. The first project was PROMS: That's Sound, That's Rhythm, held in early 2008, featuring a mixture of classical works and video game music, ranging from works by Ralph Vaughan Williams and Morton Gould as well as arrangements of music from video games such as Shenmue and Castlevania previously featured in the Symphonic Game Music Concerts. The second project, held in August 2008, was a composer specific concert titled Symphonic Shades - Hülsbeck in Concert, focusing entirely on the works of German video game composer Chris Hülsbeck. After the concert, Fechner revealed in an interview the existence of the third project, saying that he and Böcker would be involved in another concert of video game music the following September. The third project was to be a concert of music from one game company, focusing on multiple titles released by the same developer. This company was later confirmed to be Square Enix when Fechner announced Symphonic Fantasies as a video game music concert to take place on September 12, 2009. A website was set up for announcements, interviews and other concert information. Producer Thomas Böcker in 2010 Böcker later explained that the decision to focus on Square Enix was made due to the large library of games to choose from, all of which he felt had a distinct sound, and many of which were very well known in Germany. An emphasis was put on balancing out the concert program and the arrangements, so that the music would appeal to first-time listeners, classical music fans, and longtime gamers. The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II from the Kingdom Hearts series, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross from the Chrono series, and the Final Fantasy series. In order to select the pieces presented, the original composers were consulted to assemble a list of their personal favorites. The composers were Yoko Shimomura for the music of Kingdom Hearts, Hiroki Kikuta for the music of Secret of Mana, Yasunori Mitsuda for the music of Chrono Trigger and Cross, and Nobuo Uematsu for the music of the Final Fantasy series. Arranger Jonne Valtonen in 2010 For the concert, Jonne Valtonen returned as the lead arranger; he had previously been the arranger for video game music concerts since 2005, including Symphonic Shades. He was given complete freedom to arrange the music based on the general outline given to him by Böcker. Valtonen spent six months on the arrangements, during which Valtonen studied each song and referred to the composer's original intended expression. No Japanese guest arrangers were used for this concert in order to maintain a unique European take on the source material, but Valtonen brought in former classmate and close friend Roger Wanamo to assist on the arrangement of the music from the Chrono games. This was Wanamo's first time arranging video game music. On March 9, 2009 it was also announced that Valtonen had additionally been commissioned to compose an original fanfare to be played at the start of the concert, and with a video preview of his composition was released. The arrangements in the concert were structured as suites, dubbed \\"Fantasies\\", with multiple songs from each game series positioned and arranged together to tell melodic stories rather than using the conventional medley structure more commonly heard in video game music arrangements. The fanfare, titled Fanfare Overture, was done in a style of traditional fanfares with some accentuated textures in order to introduce all the elements of the orchestra. The Kingdom Hearts suite featured seven songs from the two titles, and was arranged as a romantic piano concerto. Secret of Mana featured six songs featured in the original game. The arrangement made use of notable unique techniques in order to replicate the atmosphere found in the original game; for example, the choir was used to create \\"sound effects\\" such as floor vibration by foot stomping and simulating distant rain with their voices. The Chrono suite featured ten songs from Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross. The suite featured a \\"crossing\\" of melodies, in which multiple melodies would be layered on top of one another, resulting in different well-known themes performed simultaneously in harmony. The Final Fantasy suite contained eight songs from the first seven titles in the series. Unlike the other suites, it featured a simpler structure, focusing more on each individual theme rather than overlapping multiple pieces. This was due to a request by Uematsu that the arrangement remain similar to those of prior Final Fantasy concerts. Original performance Symphonic Fantasies performers at the end of the September 12, 2009 concert The orchestra received about two weeks of rehearsal time prior to their performances, more than any other game concert before. The concert was originally scheduled to be performed on September 12, 2009 in the Cologne Philharmonic Hall in Cologne, but once the tickets were sold out, a second performance was added for September 11, 2009 at the König Pilsener Arena in Oberhausen. Ticket sales for the initial concert began on January 17, and half of them were sold within a week, with the remainder sold by April 2, 2009. The concert was preceded by a Meet and Greet session that included the original composers as well as the arrangement team and guest artists for the show. The concerts were performed by the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne and WDR Radio Choir Cologne, conducted by Arnie Roth. Before each suite, the moderator would introduce the upcoming musical piece, as well as introduce the composer in attendance. Each \\"Fantasy\\" lasted for more than 15 minutes each. The Kingdom Hearts suite featured solo pianist Benyamin Nuss. For the Chrono suite, Rony Barrak joined the orchestra and performed on his signature darbuka. A surprise encore was performed after the final suite, which took the form of a medley of the final boss themes from each game. Rony Barrak returned on stage as a soloist for the encore. No video screens or other form of tools were used during the concert, with only minimal lighting effects at certain parts for atmosphere being employed. The event was broadcast live on the WDR4 radio station, as well as through an online video stream, enabling a worldwide audience to watch the concert. It was the first fully live-streamed video game concert. Later performances Three years after the original performance, on September 14, 2011, during the Tokyo Game Show, Square Enix Japan announced on their website that the Symphonic Fantasies concert would be performed in Tokyo on January 7 and 8, 2012. They also announced that Benyamin Nuss, Rony Barrak, Jonne Valtonen, Roger Wanamo and Thomas Böcker would be in attendance. Böcker returned to produce the event, and Nuss and Barrak returned as soloists. The concerts were held at the Tokyo Bunka Kaikan Main Hall, and were performed by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra and the Tokyo Philharmonic Chorus. The concerts were conducted by Eckehard Stier. In addition to the originally announced attendees, in attendance were guest of honors Hiroki Kikuta, Yoko Shimomura, and Yasunori Mitsuda, as well as guests such as video game composers Takenobu Mitsuyoshi, Yuzo Koshiro, Masashi Hamauzu, and Mahito Yokota. The concerts were featured extensively in the February issue of Famitsu as well as on their official website. Symphonic Fantasies Tokyo was the first all-European video game concert production to take place in Japan. More than 4600 fans were in attendance, and the concerts sold out within days. The arrangements and tempo were slightly modified from the original concert, and the encore was changed by Wanamo to add elements from an additional Final Fantasy song. At the conclusion of the Symphonic Odysseys concert in Cologne by Merregnon Studios on July 9, 2011, the WDR announced that Symphonic Fantasies would return to Germany in 2012. The concerts were held on July 6 and 7, 2012 at the Cologne Philharmonic Hall. The concert was again performed by the WDR Radio Orchestra Cologne and WDR Radio Choir Cologne, conducted by Niklas Wíllen. On March 26, 2012, Merregnon Studios announced that Symphonic Fantasies would also be performed at the Stockholm Concert Hall on June 9, 2012. The concert was performed by Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra and Katarina Choir, conducted by Andreas Hanson. Like the other concerts, the 2012 European concerts were sold out. Four years later, on October 6, 2016, the Symphonic Fantasies concert was performed in London at the Barbican Centre by the London Symphony Orchestra and London Symphony Chorus. Selections from the concert, along with ones from Final Symphony and Final Symphony II, were performed at Symphonic Memories concerts on June 9, 2018 in Stockholm, March 14, 2019 in Oulu, Finland, and June 6, 2019 in St. Gallen, Switzerland.

It was announced to be in production on April 15, 2010, and made available for pre-order. In an interview, Fechner stated the album was being mixed and edited at a \\"prestigious European studio\\". This was later revealed to be Abbey Road Studios in London. The album was first released in Japan on September 15, 2010, published by Square Enix Japan's own label under the auspices of Sony Music Distribution. The album was released in Europe on September 17, 2010, published by Decca Records. Both album versions feature identical track listings and production, with the only differences being the artwork and provided booklet. The artwork for the European album was designed by the German design house, schech, and features a cross between a violin and a game controller, while the Japanese cover has an image of a white book. Böcker produced the European album, and was a consultant for the production of the Japanese release. The album does not contain the encore suite, which was released as a single on iTunes on December 14, 2010. The album's five tracks have a duration of 1:12:30, with the encore track bringing it to 1:20:56. Upon release, it reach position #13 on the German classical Media Control Charts for sales in September 2010. The Japanese release reached position #102 on the Oricon charts and stayed on the charts for one week. After the concert in Tokyo, a second album was released. Titled Symphonic Fantasies Tokyo, the two-disc album is a recording of that performance, including the encore. The album, produced by Merregnon Studios and mixed by a team of sound engineers from Japan and Germany, was released on June 11, 2012. Its cover is a modified version of the original European album with a large red circle, and it includes a twenty-page booklet with comments from the original composers. The album's six tracks have a length of 1:20:50. A new printing of the Symphonic Fantasies Tokyo album on two CDs or three vinyl records, as well as a double album combination with the Final Symphony concert album (2015) was released by Laced Records in December 2016. { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"# ! scope=\\"col\\"Track name ! scope=\\"col\\"Performer ! scope=\\"col\\"Arranger ! scope=\\"col\\"Composer ! scope=\\"col\\"Length (Tokyo album) - !scope=\\"row\\"  1.  \\"Fanfare Overture\\"  WDR Symphony Orchestra  Jonne Valtonen  Jonne Valtonen  3:12 (3:09) - !scope=\\"row\\"  2.  \\"Fantasy I: Kingdom Hearts\\"  WDR Symphony Orchestra Benyamin Nuss  Jonne Valtonen  Yoko Shimomura  15:28 (15:53) - !scope=\\"row\\"  3.  \\"Fantasy II: Secret of Mana\\"  WDR Symphony Orchestra WDR Radio Choir  Jonne Valtonen  Hiroki Kikuta  17:42 (18:54) - !scope=\\"row\\"  4.  \\"Fantasy III: Chrono Trigger/Chrono Cross\\"  WDR Symphony Orchestra Rony Barrak  Jonne Valtonen Roger Wanamo  Yasunori Mitsuda  17:39 (16:36) - !scope=\\"row\\"  5.  \\"Fantasy IV: Final Fantasy\\"  WDR Symphony Orchestra WDR Radio Choir  Jonne Valtonen  Nobuo Uematsu  18:29 (18:37) - !scope=\\"row\\"  6.  \\"Encore: Final Boss Suite\\"  WDR Symphony Orchestra WDR Radio Choir Rony Barrak  Jonne Valtonen  Yoko Shimomura, Hiroki Kikuta, Yasunori Mitsuda, and Nobuo Uematsu  8:26 (7:41) } ==Reception== The initial event received widespread critical acclaim, with much praise given to the focused presentation, deeply developed arrangements and evolution of the concept. Audun Sorlie of Original Sound Version stated that the concert \\"exceeded all expectations\\" and further added that the event was \\"absolutely amazing\\". Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online concluded in his report that \\"Symphonic Fantasies ranks among the greatest musical and social experiences of my life. Each arrangement took listeners on an extended journey through the atmospheres, emotions, and melodies of their respective series.\\" Polish site GameMusic.net's Kamil Rojek said in his report that \\"Symphonic Fantasies is a significant turning point in the history of video game music concerts. It was a remarkable event that made great progress in breaking the boundaries between game music and traditional classical works.\\" The composers themselves expressed great regard for the concert and the arrangement. Yoko Shimomura noted she was extremely pleased with Valtonen's arrangement of Kingdom Hearts, feeling it \\"very colorful and beautiful, just superb really\\". Hiroki Kikuta stated that Valtonen's arrangement \\"defied the framework of regular orchestra and was a very experimental attempt,\\" resulting in \\"free and unbound expression\\". Yasunori Mitsuda expressed that he was \\"really amazed by its fantastic quality\\", and Nobuo Uematsu said that it was \\"an exceptionally well- produced concert compared to most game concerts.\\" Uematsu was very taken with the unique arrangements of the other sections of the concert, especially the Mana portion, that he asked Böcker to take more liberties with the source material if the opportunity arose in the future; this led to the creation of the Final Symphony concert in 2013. The composers also voiced their desire to bring the concert to Japan. The Symphonic Fantasies album garnered universal praise upon its release. Patrick Gann of RPGFan said that it was \\"the best game music arranged album of 2010. It may be the best in years, with the only things rivaling it being other recordings from the WDR.\\" Audun Sorlie of Original Sound Version called it \\"the best symphonic game arrangement CD you can get your hands on,\\" and further added \\"for every game music fan out there, especially the ones with a taste for Square Enix, this is the definitive pick for you.\\" Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online gave the album the score of 10 out of 10, and stated that it \\"offers a definitive tribute to Square Enix\\" and \\"certainly deserves a perfect score and an unconditional recommendation.\\" Benjamin Schmädig of the German site 4players.de said of the album \\"Symphonic Fantasies represents memories of great emotional moments. The orchestra and choir put in all their strength, all their subtlety in these moments.\\" He further complimented Jonne Valtonen, saying that he \\"knows exactly how to arrange the known motifs in such an imaginative way that they tell the familiar stories from scratch.\\" Denis Brown of the German site OnlineWelten said that for Square Enix fans, it is an obligatory purchase. Symphonic Fantasies Tokyo was also praised upon release. Jayson Napolitano of Destructoid said that the \\"arrangements are brilliant and are some of the best in the business,\\" and that the addition of the encore was an improvement over the physical version of the original album, though he felt that the sound quality \\"lacks some of the dynamics of the original release\\" in the bass regions. Joe Hammond of Square Enix Music Online found the opposite difference in the sound quality, finding that the deep drum sounds had more impact than in the first album. Stephen Meyerink of RPGFan felt that \\"the production and mastering on the album is stellar\\", and was pleased by the modifications to the arrangements between the original concert and the Tokyo concert, especially the slight increase in tempo. Audun Sorlie of Original Sound Version also praised the changes, not only in the tempo but also in the arrangements, noting the more integrated piano in the Kingdom Hearts suite and the more impressive brass section in the opening fanfare. He also noted that, unlike the original performance and album, the recording of live audience did not include any laughter when the chocobo theme interrupted \\"One Winged Angel\\" in the Final Fantasy suite. He concluded that the album was worth purchasing even for owners of the first album. ==References * Symphonic Fantasies * MAZ Sound Tools * Square Enix's Official Website * Personal website of Thomas Böcker Category:2010 live albums Category:Video game concert tours Category:Final Fantasy music Category:Kingdom Hearts Category:Mana (series) Category:Chrono series ","title":"Symphonic Fantasies"},{"id":"35321179","text":"MK Lions Arena MK Lions Arena, also known as Prestige Homes Arena due to sponsorship reasons, was a basketball arena in Milton Keynes, England. It was the home venue for the Milton Keynes Lions of the British Basketball League from 2010 to 2012.

With the team still awaiting the completion of arena:mk - a purpose-built muilti-function arena next to the stadium:mk - an immediate solution was sought and the city centre facility was converted into a new basketball centre for the 2010-11 season. As well as the main arena, which has seating for 1,400 spectators, the venue featured two practice courts under the same roof of the 30,000 square foot facility. The arena, was located in the Winterhill district, a five-minute walk from the city centre and from Milton Keynes Central railway station. Lions' first game at the new venue was played on 28 November 2010, with the home team winning 79-73 against BBL rookies Essex Pirates with the game televised live on SkySports. The lease between Lions and the building owners featured an opt-out cause which was triggered in order to let the building as a retail unit. The final basketball game at the arena was played on 18 April 2012, with Lions defeating Plymouth Raiders 128-113.

Its seat was located in Opochka between 1772 and 1776, and in Pskov after 1776. The governorate was located in the west of Russian Empire and bordered (after 1796) Saint Petersburg Governorate in the north, Novgorod Governorate in the northeast, Tver Governorate in the east, Smolensk Governorate in the southeast, Byelorussia Governorate (since 1802, Vitebsk Governorate) in the south, and the Governorate of Livonia in the west. In terms of modern administrative division of Russia, the area of the governorate is currently split between Pskov, Tver, and Novgorod Oblasts. The former border between Pskov Governorate and the Governorate of Livonia still largely corresponds to the state border between Russia in the east and Estonia and Latvia in the west. ==History== The European part of the Russian Empire in 1917. Pskov Governorate is shown in blue. In 1772, as a result of the First Partition of Poland, Inflanty Voivodeship and eastern Belarus were transferred to Russia. In order to accommodate these areas, Pskov Governorate was created, and Velikiye Luki and Pskov Provinces of Novgorod Governorate (with the exception of future Gdovsky Uyezd) were transferred to this governorate. In addition, Vitebsk, Polotsk, and Dvina, taken over from Poland, were included into the governorate. The town of Opochka was made the administrative center of the governorate. Pskov Governorate has proven to be too big to be administered properly, and in 1776, the decree of the empress, Catherine the Great, was issued. It divided the governorate into Pskov and Polotsk Governorates. Pskov was made the administrative center of Pskov Governorate. Gdov and Porkhov were transferred from Novgorod to Pskov Governorate. In 1777, Pskov Governorate was transformed into Pskov Viceroyalty, which was administered from Novgorod by Jacob Sievers, who at the same time administered Novgorod and Tver Viceroyalties. In 1796, the viceroyalty was abolished, and on 31 December 1796 the emperor Paul I issued a decree restoring Pskov Governorate. At this point, the governorate consisted of the following six uyezds (the administrative centers, which all had the town status, are given in parentheses), * Pskovsky Uyezd (Pskov); * Opochetsky Uyezd (Opochka); * Ostrovsky Uyezd (Ostrov); * Porkhovsky Uyezd (Porkhov); * Toropetsky Uyezd (Toropets); * Velikoluksky Uyezd (Velikiye Luki). Izborsk was a town but not an uyezd center. In 1802, Novorzhevsky Uyezd (with the center in Novorzhev) and Kholmsky Uyezd (Kholm) were established. In 1920, the westernmost part of Pskovsky Uyezd were transferred to Estonia, and the southwesternmost part of Pskovsky Uyezd and 3 volosts of Ostrovsky Uyezd went to Latvia.

Cumbria, England. It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Barrow, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. ==History== A church was built on the site in about 1690 replacing an earlier church. This was itself replaced in 1852–53 by a new church designed by the Lancaster architects Sharpe and Paley. Its estimated cost was £520 (equivalent to £ in ), and it provided seating for 184 people. It was an aisleless chapel with an octagonal bell turret. This church was again replaced in 1907–08 by the present church, designed by the successors in the practice, Austin and Paley. This much larger church was made necessary by the increase in the size of the local population from about 500 in 1891 to about 5,000 in 1903. The same Lancaster practice was involved again in 1930–31, when an additional bay was added to the west end of the nave together with a new vestry and a south porch at a cost of £4,597. It was intended to build a tower at the crossing, but this never transpired. ==Architecture== The church is constructed in sandstone, and has roofs of tile, slate and lead. Its architectural style is Gothic Revival with Perpendicular details. The plan consists of a five-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, north and south transepts, and a two-bay chancel with a south chapel and a north vestry. The windows along the sides of the aisles have two or three lights, and those in the clerestory have four lights. At the west end of the church is a four-light window flanked by buttresses, above which is a quatrefoil window. On the apex of the gable is a cross. There are three-light windows in the transepts and chapel, and the vestry has two four- light windows. The east window has five lights and a crenellated transom, and is flanked by buttresses. Inside the church, the octagonal font stands on colonettes, and the oak pulpit is on an ashlar plinth. The stained glass in the east window was designed by R .R. Nichol for Abbott and Company, and dates from about 1990. The two-manual pipe organ was made by Wadsworth and Company from Manchester. ==See also== *List of works by Sharpe and Paley *List of ecclesiastical works by Austin and Paley (1895–1914) *List of ecclesiastical works by Austin and Paley (1916–44) ==References== Citations Sources * * ==External links== *Photographs of the exterior from Visit Cumbria St Mary the Virgin Category:Church of England church buildings in Cumbria Category:Diocese of Carlisle Category:Grade II listed churches in Cumbria Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in England Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Cumbria Category:Austin and Paley buildings ","title":"St Mary the Virgin's Church, Walney"},{"id":"35321250","text":"Stephan Thee (born July 26, 1988) is a German footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder who currently is playing for FC Pipinsried. ==Career== Thee came through SpVgg Unterhaching's youth team, and made his debut in a 3–2 win over VfR Aalen December 2008, replacing Anton Fink who had just completed his hat-trick.

After considering lifts and inclined planes to assist trams in negotiating the steep hills to the south of the town, they obtained permission to build a conventional system in 1897, and the first three routes opened in 1898. By 1905 there were of track and 96 tramcars, supplied by two manufacturers. In 1921, an additional route was added to the system, and the Corporation embarked on a programme of building their own tramcars, some of which replaced existing vehicles, while some extended the fleet. During the 1930s, the trams were gradually replaced by motor buses, either run by the Corporation or by private companies, and the last tram ran on 14 February 1939. The Corporation also looked at running trolleybuses in 1903, but no action was taken. However, they bought two little-used vehicles from Dundee in 1918, and opened a short route in 1921. The experiment was not entirely successful, as the vehicles suffered damage as a result of the poor condition of the roads. A new vehicle was bought in 1924, but the system was abandoned in 1926, when the General Manager was replaced by someone who had previously managed the Dundee system, and did not like trolleybuses. ==History== Halifax was not easy territory in which to build a tramway, as Salterhebble Hill, one of the main routes to the south of the town centre, rose at 1 in 9.6. Consideration was given to building a lift, onto which the tramcars would run, or of building an inclined plane, on which the tramcar would be carried by trolley. Such systems had been used in Pittsburgh and Cincinnati, but after two failures to obtain permission to proceed, Halifax Corporation succeeded in obtaining the Halifax Corporation Tramways Act 1897, which authorised the building of a conventional electric tramway system with a gauge of . Construction took place rapidly, and on 9 June 1898 three single-track routes with a total mileage of opened. These radiated out from the Post Office, and ran along Horton Street to Halifax railway station, to King Cross Street, and along Gibbet Street, where a depot was built for the tramcars, to reach High Road Well. For the opening of the tramway, the Corporation bought ten open top double deck cars, from G.F. Milnes & Co. of Birkenhead. Expansion of the system was also quite rapid, with a further 48 cars being bought from Milnes over the next two years. The depot proved to be too small, and a new one was built near Skircoat Lane, while the Gibbet Street depot became an engineering workshop. The next batch of open top double deck cars came from Brush Electrical Engineering Company, with 12 bought in 1901, 12 in 1902 and 12 more in 1903. Brush was again approached to supply two single deck vehicles, designed for one-man operation, in 1904, and by 1905 there were of track. The tramcars were fitted with runback brakes, and track brakes were also fitted, but despite this, there were a number of accidents on the steep gradients. In the ten years after 1905, top covers were fitted to most of the open top tramcars, although car 64 did not receive one, as it was destroyed in an accident in 1907. Brush supplied six new top covered double deck vehicles in 1912, which were numbered 97 to 102. The two single deck trams performed special duties during the First World War, with number 95 acting as an army recruiting office, while number 96 was used as a mobile kitchen. A new route to Stainland was opened on 14 May 1921, and apart from some small extensions and modifications to the trackwork, the system was more or less complete. The Corporation then embarked on a programme of building their own tramcars, twelve of which replaced cars withdrawn from service. The replacement vehicles consisted of a single deck car to replace number 96, which was subsequently converted to an open top double deck car, five open topped vehicles and six top covered cars. In 1924 the fleet was increased when they built three single deck bogie cars, followed by a top covered car which was outshopped in a new livery. Another eleven top covered cars were built in 1928–29, and the final purchase of new cars was a batch of ten similar vehicles from the English Electric Company. The fleet was made up to its maximum size of 131 trams by the purchase of four second hand trams from Exeter Corporation in 1931. The first part of the system to be closed was the route between Bailiff Bridge and Brighouse, which ran along Bradford Road. This was double track, and linked to the Bradford system and the Huddersfield system. The systems were not physically connected, as they used a wider gauge than the of the Halifax system. Bradford used a gauge of while Huddersfield used . Through the 1930s, the tram services were gradually replaced by motor buses run by the Corporation or by private companies. The last section to be closed was that from the depot to the town centre, on which services were withdrawn on 14 February 1939, with the final tram being number 109. Trolleybuses In 1903, consideration was given to using trolleybuses to extend the tramway network to serve less populous areas, where the cost of building a tramway could not be justified. Although the tramways committee decided to ask for tenders to construct such a system, no further action was taken at the time, and the increased reliability of motor buses resulted in any action being deferred when the issue was raised subsequently. However, neighbouring towns were adopting the idea, as Leeds began running trolleybuses in June 1911, Bradford followed four days later, and Keighley's system opened in May 1913. Dundee in Scotland had run trolleybuses from 1912 to 1914, but had withdrawn them due to the poor condition of the roads and when their two vehicles were offered for sale, Halifax decided to experiment with the new form of transport. They visited Dundee in December 1917, and bought the vehicles in January 1918, but construction of a trial route had to wait until the end of the First World War. They selected an existing motor bus route for the trial, running from Pellon to Wainstalls via Mount Tabor. Contracts for the constrution of the overhead lines were awarded in 1919, and the trolleybuses were overhauled at the works on Skircoat Road. The vehicles were numbered 103 and 104 in the tram series, and the Ministry of Transport inspected the new route in June 1921. Public services began on 20 July 1921, on what was really a country lane for most of the route, and as in Dundee, the trolleybuses did not fare well on the rough road surfaces. The manager was complaining about damage to the vehicles within two months of the system opening, and roadworks were put in hand. By 1923, the condition of the trolleybuses was poor, and they bought a chassis with motors from Tilling- Stevens of Maidstone, on which the tramways department built a single deck body with a front entrance. It was numbered 2, and entered service in June 1924. Number 103 probably took the number 1 at this point, as trams with the numbers 103 and 104 were added to the fleet in 1925 and 1921. Trolleybus 104 was withdrawn from service, but retained. Motor bus technology and comfort continued to improve, and justifying the retention of such a small trolleybus system became increasingly difficult. Matters got worse when the manager, Ben Hall, left the company after four years service in 1926, and his successor was Walter Young, who had managed the Dundee Tramway since 1921. Young was keen to retain the trams, but he closed down the trolleybus route on 24 October 1926. The electricity committee advocated using trolleybuses again when the tramway system was being closed in 1936, but the manager of the time, G F Craven, ruled that electricity costs would be too great, because of the gradients that needed to be negotiated. ==Fleet== ;Trams Halifax Corporation owned a total of six single deck and 137 double deck tramcars during the life of the system. However, they never owned this number at the same time, as one single deck and 11 double deck cars were built by the Corporation to replace original cars that were withdrawn. { - Car numbers  Type  Year built  Builder  Notes - 1–10  double deck open top  1898  Milnes  - 11–58  double deck open top  1899–1900  Milnes  - 59–70  double deck open top  1901  Brush  64 destroyed in accident 1907 - 71–82  double deck open top  1902  Brush  - 83–94  double deck open top  1903  Brush  - 95–96  single deck one-man operated  1904  Brush  - 97–102  double deck top covered  1912  Brush  - 96  single deck  1921?

She was the daughter of Justin Boots founder H.J. \\"Daddy Joe\\" Justin, who had begun boot-making in Spanish Fort, Texas in 1879. Cowboys ordered his custom-fit boots, which were ready to pick up after their cattle drives. In 1887, the railroad came through Nocona, and the boot factory moved there to take advantage of better shipping. Enid started working in her father's shop at the age of 12 in 1906, where she remained for the next 12 years. After he died in 1918, other members of the family wanted to move the business to Ft. Worth. Enid felt so strongly her father wanted the company based in Nocona, she stayed behind when her brothers moved the factory's equipment to Ft. Worth in 1925. She borrowed $5,000 and kept seven employees to found the Nocona Boots brand. The discovery of oil near Nocona brought many new customers. Nocona made a 16-inch lace-up boot tough enough to survive the oil fields, bringing the wildcatters back for more. In 1981, Nocona Boots merged with Justin Industries, the then parent company of Justin Boots, bringing the two boot-making companies full circle. In 1999, the Nocona plant was shut down and production moved to El Paso, Texas. ==Today== Today, Nocona Boots still handcrafts premium cowboy boots offering collections in the Fashion, Legacy, Exotic, Western, Rancher and Competitor categories. The brand was also the first to offer cowboy boots officially licensed by The Collegiate Licensing Company, the College Boots Collection, handcrafted in the U.S.A. Nocona Boots footwear is available for men, women and children at western specialty stores across the country and online footwear retailers, including Zappos. In November 2016, the city of Nocona learned that it would receive a $500,000 Community Development Block Grant from the Texas Department of Agriculture to help with costs to turn the original Justin Leather Goods building located at 100 Clay St. into a community activity center and farmers market. ==References== * ==External links== * Official Website Category:Clothing companies established in 1925 Category:Manufacturing companies based in Texas Category:Shoe brands Category:Shoe companies of the United States ","title":"Nocona Boots"},{"id":"35321303","text":"Damijan Stepančič (born 22 May 1969) is a Slovene painter and illustrator, best known for his children's books illustrations.Slovenia's Best for Young Readers by the Slovenian Book Agency Stepančič was born in Ljubljana in 1969.

The one-term postgraduate certificate program offers complementary studies in public management. It is aimed at young and future government officials holding a graduate-level degree. It resembles the first semester of the Master of Administrative Sciences program. The Master of Administrative Sciences (Magister rerum publicarum) is the school's traditional flagship program. It is a one-year postgraduate program open to students holding an additional graduate-level degree, preferably in law, economics, history, or sociology. Students can choose from some 100 courses that are divided into five policy areas: 1. Public tasks, Organization and Proceedings, 2. Public Management, 3. European and International Affairs, 4. State and Economy, and 5. Higher Education and Research Management. The program comprises two terms at the school, an eight-week internship at German or European institutions, and a subsequent period of three months to write the master's thesis and pass an oral examination. International student enrollment in this program regularly hovers around 50 percent.consisting of 35 % Asian, 30 % European, 25 % African, and 10 % American students (Data as of 2004). The Master of Arts in Administrative Sciences is a two-year interdisciplinary program focusing on public administration in an international context. First year students follow a core curriculum consisting of six modules on administrative, legal, economic, methodological, and strategic topics, and complete a mandatory eight-week internship. In the second year, students choose courses from the following six optional modules: 1. Government and Administration, 2. Public Policy, 3. Europeanization and Internationalization of Public Administration, 4. Organization and Personnel, 5. Funding of Public Services, and 6. Competition and Regulation in the Infrastructure Sector. At the end of the second year, students complete the master's thesis. The Master of Arts in Public Economy is a two-year program dedicated to the study of the public economic sector from an interdisciplinary perspective. During the first year, students follow the core curriculum of the M.A. in Administrative Sciences. Second-year students complete four deepening modules in Public Finance, Competition and Regulation, Procurement, and Public Corporate Governance, choose one optional module on Public Enterprises, or Infrastructure, and write a master's thesis. Both M.A. programs also offer a one-year option for students holding a previous relevant master's degree. The Master of Public Administration in Higher Education and Research Management is a two-year part-time program for professional university or research institute administrators. The university runs doctoral programs in administrative sciences (Doctor rerum publicarum), law (Doctor juris), and political sciences and economy (Doctor rerum politicarum). Doctoral candidates are required to complete one year of coursework in residence at the school, and produce a dissertation which makes a creditable contribution to scholarship in its field. The dissertation must be supervised by a member of the faculty. The school's executive education provides in-service training for senior civil servants of all government levels. The seminars, workshops and conferences deal with contemporary problems of administration, legislation, and European affairs. The Speyer Leadership College (Führungskolleg Speyer) is a two-year in-service program preparing senior executives holding at least the rank of a Government DirectorRegierungsdirektor (A15); equivalent to U.S. GS-14 / O-5 positions to assume higher positions. ==Admission and fees== Admission to the school is competitive and is limited to 25 seats per program and year for the M.A. programs, and to 60 seats for the Master in Administrative Sciences program. Formal minimum entry requirement for all degree programs is a class rank among the top third in the previous academic degree program. Professional administrative experience is considered an asset. For prospective international students, a language test for German at CEFR C1 level is required. The German state heavily subsidizes university study to keep higher education affordable regardless of socio-economic background. Like most German public universities, Speyer charges no tuition fees for academic programs, for both EU and non-EU citizens.Note: As of 2012, only public universities in Bavaria and Lower Saxony continue to charge tuition fees for undergraduate and academic consecutive graduate programs. For the professional M.P.A. in Higher Education and Research Management program, the school charges €8,000 in tuition. The annual housing costs for on-campus dormitories range from €1,560 to €3,240. ==Research== The university performs \\"fundamental research with high relevance to practice\\", and regularly publishes treatises on administrative, legal, political, and economic matters in the Speyer University Monograph Series (Schriftenreihe der Hochschule Speyer). With its 17 chairs dedicated to public and constitutional law, administrative sciences, economics, modern and contemporary history, sociology, and political science, the school maintains a strategic partnership with the German Research Institute for Public Administration, which is part of the Leibniz Association, and is located on the campus. It also maintains individual research cooperations with 20 universities in Europe, the Americas, and Asia. It is a member of the European Group of Public Administration (EGPA), the Standing Conference of European Public Service Training Agencies (SCEPSTA), the Transatlantic Policy Consortium (TPC), the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration (NASPAA), and the International Association of Schools and Institutes of Administration (IASIA). ==Alumni== Besides numerous politicians, diplomats, professors, judges, and high-ranking government officials at local, state, federal, and international level, the university's noted alumni and faculty include President of Germany Roman Herzog; current Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht; former Federal Minister and Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Klaus Töpfer; Federal Minister Wolfgang Bötsch; First Mayor and Prime Minister of Hamburg Christoph Ahlhaus; vice president of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany Ferdinand Kirchhof; president of the Bundesbank Helmut Schlesinger; president of the Federal Court of Auditors of Germany Dieter Engels; Head of the German Chancellery Waldemar Schreckenberger; president of the Federal Court of Justice of Germany Willi Geiger; president of the Federal Employment Agency of Germany Florian Gerster; Executive Director of the Bundesbank Thilo Sarrazin; Attorney General of Germany Alexander von Stahl; Advocate General at the European Court of Justice Carl Otto Lenz; former CEO and current Chairman of BASF Jürgen Strube; and former CEO of Allianz Global Investors and current Chairman of the Deutsche Börse Group Joachim Faber. ==See also== German Research Institute for Public Administration == References  *German University of Administrative Sciences Speyer *German Research Institute for Public Administration *European Master of Public Administration Consortium *City of Speyer *Rhine Neckar Metropolitan Area Category:Public administration schools Category:Public policy research Category:Public policy schools Category:Social science institutes Category:Public universities and colleges in Germany Category:Postgraduate schools in Germany Category:Universities and colleges in Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Educational institutions established in 1947 Category:Speyer Category:1947 establishments in Germany ","title":"German University of Administrative Sciences, Speyer"},{"id":"35321331","text":"Vilasini Natyam is an Indian classical dance form originating in Andhra Pradesh. Its repertoire comprises temple dances, court dances, and dance operas of female singer-dancers of Telugu origin. ==History== The cultural history of the Telugu people indicates the existence of two formal dance streams — Purusha Sampradaayam is performed by men, and Stree Sampradaayam is performed by women. References to a Sthree Sampradayam abound in the archival, epigraphic and literary sources, establishing the vital artistic presence of female singer-dancers in temples, royal courts and public theatres, certainly from the 10th century AD. They were referred to by several terms including Vilasini, Swamini and Bhogini, (colloquially Saani and Bogam) and their troupes termed Chinna Melam or Nattuva Melam. By mid 20th century, these artists were called the Kalavantulu, a term that derives from Kalavati (a woman who excels in the arts). When the Anti-Devadasi Dedication Act was passed, the consecration of singer-dancers in temples was banned. It was then that the art of the Kalavantulu began to decline. Saanis and Bhogams were distanced from mainstream social life only thereafter. Vilasini Natyam represents the ritual, ceremonial and dance operatic legacy of this group, a section of whose last living artists have taught dancer Swapnasundari. This art differs in technique from the Purusha sampradayam presently represented by Kuchipudi. Though Vilasini Natyam movements appear quintessentially feminine, its 100-odd Adavus (dance-units) include Tandava (vigorous) and Lasya (soft) aspects. Vilasini Natyam's complex Abhinaya is widely admired. Its extensive repertoire comprises temple dances, court dances and dance operas of the hereditary female singer-dancers of Telugu origin. These are vital- requirements of formal Indian dance systems, some of which came to be described as \\"classical\\" dance styles after the advent of the English language and the subsequent application of English terms to describe indigenous traditions. Decline and revival The unique Nrtta and Abhinaya of Vilasini Natyam (the temple, court and theatrical dance traditions of the Telugu Devadasis) and its extensive repertoire are widely admired. Following the abolition of their dedication to temples, the dance style earlier practiced by the Devadasis had declined. This style has subsequently been resurrected, rejuvenated, and recast as Vilasini Natyam. Post-Independence history has been created by Swapnasundari and her disciples in the 400-year- old Vishnu Temple (Rangbagh, Hyderabad) where Vilasini Natyam is danced in the worship rituals during the Brahmotsavam. Performance of worshipful dances gradually declined from 1948 with the banning of Gudi-Sevas (temple services) by consecrated dancers. Near-obsolete temple dances were revived by the internationally renowned dancer Swapnasundari, after painstaking research and by direct learning from some of the last living Kalaavanthulu (traditional dancers) of the Telugu land. It was during Brahmotsavam of the temple at Rangbagh in 1996, that she initially performed these dances. The first male Vilasini Natyam dancer is Sri Sanjay Kumar Joshi from Hyderabad. Vilasini Natyam endeavours to present, in an educative and aesthetically appealing manner, the total content of the ancient Sthree Nrithya Sampradaayam (female solo dance tradition) which once dominated Telugu-speaking areas of Southern India. ==Aalaya Sampradaayam (Gudi Seva)== Vilasini Natyam's temple repertoire contains the following song-dance which is offered as an integral part of the Agamic worship inside a live temple, primarily for the pleasure and appeasement of the deity. Vilasini Natyam is re-integrated with live worship in the 400-year-old Sri Ranganatha Swamy temple, Rang-bagh, Hyderabad. The Agamic ritual-dances, once the prerogative of consecrated temple dancers are presently performed inside a living temple by female and male Vilasini Natyam dancers. The near-obscure original Choornikas (Sanskrit stanzas) and Talams (rhythmic metres) pertaining to these have been reclaimed and restored to dance-worship after a lapse of nearly 80 years when only nominal mantra chanting by the priests had continued. This landmark achievement of Vilasini Natyam has been sustained for over 12 years. Modified versions of these rituals for Vilasini Natyam stage-performance retain the important components. Elaborate Tala expansion now embellishes the earlier Nrittha items, which were of simpler construction. ==Aasthaana Sampradaayam (Kaccheri Aata)== This repertoire of Vilasini Natyam evolved from the following: * Concerts in a temple: As the dancer of yore performed facing the sanctum, the audience of worshipers could watch from close quarters. Prarthana, Varnam, Padam, Javali, Adhyatma Ramayana Keertanam, Ashtapdi, and Shlokam, were some of the items performed. The concert lasted many hours. Temple singer-dancers were required to welcome royalty during their temple visits. On such occasions, the virtues and achievements of the royal visitor would be extolled through compositions like Salaam-Daruvus. * Concerts in royal assembly: Temple dancers were invited to perform in the court on special occasions. Over time, some of them gained full-time employment as Raja-nartakis (court dancers). A few could retain the temple connection if permitted by the temple and the court. Many unique Varnams of the Telugu temple and court dancers are unavailable in published form. Abhinaya Swayambodhini (Telugu, c1915) gives the text of some Varnams but without their musical notation. Fortunately, most Varnams have survived as oral tradition amongst the descendants of the Saanis and Bhogams. All of these have been recovered and feature in today's Vilasini Natyam performances. More Nrittha has been added. Padam is central to Kaccheyri Aata. The Abhinaya of the Telugu Saanis is extremely detailed. Each word and sentence of the lyric is etched, then the whole Padam extensively elaborated, taking up an hour. Sanskrit Shlokas are treated similarly. The seated Abhinaya of the Northern school is retained. Manodharma (spontaneous improvisation) remains a vital feature. ==Aata Bhaagavatham (dance-operas)== These were performed by the Gudi-Saanis in the temple courtyard to entertain the pilgrims during special festivals, after the main worship-rituals concluded. The popular dance operas Parijaatham and Golla-Veysha Katha also came to be called Bhaama-Kalaapam and Golla Kaalapam. Vilasini Natyam presentations of Aata-Bhaagavatam retain the Margi (formal) and Desi (regional) elements which characterize its music. Use of the typical Ganiyam (light-weight gilded wooden ornaments) has been revived. ==See also== * Kuchipudi * Andhra Natyam ==Further reading== * Vilasini natyam: Bharatam of Telugu temple and court dancers, by Swapnasundari.

Their influence on UK and international sailing, particularly team racing, has been quite disproportionate to their small numbers of just over 300 people. Since the founding of the Oxford & Cambridge Sailing Society (O&CSS;) in 1934, members have competed in 13 Sailing Olympics and won 8 medals (3 gold, 3 silver, and 2 bronze). The Society (O&CSS;), Oxford & Cambridge Sailing Society (O&CSS;) website was formed in 1934 by Cambridge Half Blue Stewart Morris, along with 3 of his contemporaries; Morris was later to win a gold medal at the 1948 Olympics. The aim of the Society was \\"to keep members of the two Clubs together after coming down from the University, and encourage team racing throughout the country, at the same time maintaining a high standard of helmsmanship\\". The two Clubs referred to are the Oxford University Yacht Club, Oxford University Yacht Club (OUYC) website (founded in 1884) and the Cambridge University Cruising Club, Cambridge University Cruising Club (CUCrC) website (founded in 1893). The Society has always limited its membership; 24 sailors were elected in the first year and since then 4 to 10 of the best sailors from Oxford and Cambridge have been elected each year as they graduate. Occasionally non-blues are elected because of their later achievements in either competitive sailing or sailing administration.

History page of the Cambridge University Cruising Club's website ==Sailing Olympics== Like many sports in the 1930s, Oxford and Cambridge students and alumni competed at the highest sailing levels. In the 1936 Olympic yachting trials, half of the recently formed Society's membership took part. Since then, Society members, usually after their student days, have continued to compete with success at the highest levels in sailing. In 2011 the top three sailors in the International 14 Dinghy World Championships were all members of the Society, as was the OK dinghy World Champion and Yachtsman of the Year, Nick Craig., Yachts & Yachting article on Nick Craig's successes The skipper of the winning Abu Dhabi Ocean Racing entry in the 2014/15 Volvo (round-the-world) Ocean Race and two-times Olympic Silver Medallist, Ian Walker, is a member. Four-times winner of the International 14 World Championships, Archie Massey, is also a member. It is unlikely that any UK sailing club, particularly one that has had such a small membership, can boast of such a record.

His duties including overseeing the pre-Olympic regattas, International Jury service, and other roles. ==Team Racing== While the Society's involvement with the Olympics is the most public testimony of its contribution to sailing, it is the discipline of team racing that is at the Society's heart. A good general history of team racing is available on the Wikipedia article on team racing. Founder Stewart Morris had experienced the occasional team race in his youth on the Norfolk Broads, where the professional skippers raced against their amateur owners from time to time. When he went up to Cambridge in October 1927, he sailed in three Varsity Match against Oxford (1928-1930), and experienced intense team racing competition, fuelled by traditional Light Blue-Dark Blue rivalry. The sailing Varsity Match was first held in 1912, but was interrupted between 1915 and 1919 by the First World War and in 1940 by the Second World War. Over the years, the standard and tactics of the team racing improved considerably, and great rivalry existed between the University teams. A fuller history of the match will be found on the O&CSS; website., Varsity Match history page of the Oxford & Cambridge Sailing Society (O&CSS;) website Stewart's desire to bring together members of both teams to continue team racing, and to promote this aspect of the sport, was the reason for forming the Society. By organising matches against other sailing clubs, the Society began to promote team racing and, in time, facilitated the development of events such as the West Kirby Sailing Club Wilson Trophy., Wilson Trophy website That event is now the single most prestigious open team racing event in the UK, with an international entry and reputation. The Society's vital role is referred to in the record of West Kirby's initial planning meeting: \\"Support would have to be gained from the Oxford & Cambridge Sailing Society, which was the most important body sponsoring team racing.\\", and (Sir) Cyril Clarke, one of the three West Kirby helmsmen who provided the stimulus for the first 'Wilson' event,Team racing#History of Team Racing in the US, UK, and Ireland, History Section of Wikipedia Team Racing Article was a member. Since then, team racing has grown both in popularity and skill levels, with the sport becoming international and a Team Racing World Championships Team Racing World Championship history Team Racing World Championship past results starting in 1995. The UK Royal Yachting Association and UK Team Racing Association (UKTRA) UK Team Racing association website actively promotes team racing and holds an annual UK Championship and Ladies Championship. There is also an annual British Universities Sailing Association, British Universities Sailing Association (BUSA) website. Team Racing Championship, contested after several rounds of regional qualifiers. UK schools are also active with annual championships organised via the British Schools Dinghy Racing Association,, British Schools Dinghy Racing Association (BSDRA) website and the National Schools Sailing Association., UK National Schools Sailing Association (NSSA) website Society members play a leading role in the organisation of all these events, and the Society's Ladies team won the UK National Ladies Championships four times during the five years 2004--2008, and again in 2013. Furthermore, Bruce Hebbert, the instigator of the European 2K Keel Boat Team Racing Series, 2K Team Racing website is a member. ==Vintage Port== One less serious aspect of the Club is also worth commenting on. In 1936, a member donated 48 bottles of vintage port for consumption at the annual dinner. Grateful members subsequently elected him President for a term, and in 1946 the Society started investing its own funds in vintage port. This ‘liquid’ investment strategy has proved most successful. Excellent port is available at annual dinners at extremely low cost, the Society's reserves have steadily appreciated, and bottles of port are occasionally sold to provide funds to buy newer vintages for future generations to enjoy. ==References and External Links== Category:Sailing in England Category:Sailing rules and handicapping ","title":"Oxford &amp; Cambridge Sailing Society"},{"id":"35321349","text":"The 4.6×36 mm is a cartridge developed by Heckler & Koch for its experimental HK36 assault rifle of the 1970s. When the rifle was not taken into service by any military force, its ammunition was not used for any other weapon design. The main feature that set the bullet apart from its contemporaries was the use of a so-called \\"spoon tip\\" (German: Löffelspitz): the tip had a concave area on one side which was intended to make the bullet \\"tumble\\" after hitting a target, in order to give it greater stopping power than such a small, high- velocity bullet would otherwise have. ==Development== In the 1970s, ammunition for military rifles saw a reduction in calibre, largely inspired by the American 5.56×45mm round used in the M16 assault rifle. In an effort to create a weapon with low recoil, low weight, a flat trajectory and a high chance of incapacitating its target, Heckler & Koch designed the HK36 rifle together with the 4.6×36 mm ammunition. ==Cartridge Types== Two variants of the round were developed, one with a soft core and another with a hard core, the former being intended for use against personnel, the latter against hard targets and to penetrate cover.

She argued that while it was a \\"useful guide to Deng's activities\\" it is a \\"sanitised version of Deng's life, partly or perhaps\\" because of Evans's experiences in China.

It does not use the plot of the opera. The film was released in 2008 by Sullivan Entertainment. Magic Flute Diaries won the award for Best Family Film in the 2008 Staten Island Film Festival. ==Synopsis== Tom (Warren Christie), a young classical singer, reluctantly accepts the lead role in a production of The Magic Flute during Mozart’s 250th birthday celebration in Salzburg at the urging of his girlfriend Sandy (Kelly Campbell). As rehearsals unfold, Tom is captivated by the magical power of Mozart’s final opera. He is completely overcome with amazement at the musical genius that surrounds him. In an effort to visualize Mozart’s fantasy, Tom imagines himself in the opera’s story and drifts in and out of reality as if in a dream. Gradually he becomes completely enraptured by the intoxicating musical atmosphere swirling around him. Tom’s rapture is heightened further when he meets his mysterious co-star, Masha (Mireille Asselin), an unknown Russian soprano of astonishing talent. This extraordinary young singer is kept isolated from both the company and the press by her manager, Professor Nagel (Rutger Hauer). Tom becomes infatuated with Masha causing his relationship with Sandy to fall apart. Tom finds himself seduced as much by Mozart’s music as by his bewitching co-star. Tom’s concern for the girl, and his obsession to find out more about her mysterious past, becomes a quest that parallels the operatic fable actually being played out onstage. Tom’s strong feelings for Masha have left him unable to distinguish between reality and fantasy. Like his character in the opera, Tom wonders if he is being tested for a higher purpose but he knows he must play out his role in Masha’s story until the final curtain. ==Production== Origin The concept for a film inspired by Mozart’s The Magic Flute emerged from a number of sources. Director, writer and producer of the film, Kevin Sullivan, became interested in the city of Salzburg after his daughter travelled there with her school orchestra to attend Mozart’s 250th birthday celebrations. Sullivan was also inspired by Andrew Lloyd Webber’s stage musical, The Woman in White, which used three-dimensional backdrops in its London production. Though Sullivan claims not to be an opera buff, he had always had a love for Mozart’s The Magic Flute.Taylor, Kate. \\"Mozart, by way of Sin City\\", The Globe & Mail, 4 July 2006. Filming Due to the impossibility (budget and time constraints) of filming on-location in Salzburg, Sullivan and a team travelled to Austria, Germany and Hungary, taking digital photographs of various churches, streetscapes, grand interiors and scenic backdrops.Tilley, Steve. \\"The Land of Movie Magic\\", The Toronto Sun, 23 June 2006. Filmed in Toronto, shooting was completed in front of a green screen, allowing computer animators to remove the background and splice in digital photographs and images in postproduction.Terauds, John, \\"There’s Magic in the air\\", The Toronto Star, 24 June 2006. Thom Best served as DOP, with special effects by Tony Willis.Davidson, Sean, \\"Sullivan feels the Magic\\", Playback, 10 July 2006. Advanced mixers with live links to the live cameras allowed for the technicians to adjust background images in real time as the cameras rolled, giving a rough idea of what the finished product would look like. Opera Atelier The Toronto opera company, Opera Atelier, partnered with Sullivan Entertainment for the production, providing costumes, crew and cast. Opera Atelier co-Artistic Directors Marshall Pynkoski and Jeannette Zingg were choreographers for dance numbers in the film.

It stands at the junction of Walkley Road and South Road in one of the busiest parts of the area. It is one of 27 suburban branch libraries within the city. The building is a Carnegie library, the only library in Sheffield to receive Carnegie funding, it is also a Grade II listed building as are the boundary walls and commemorative plaque in front of the library. ==History== Construction of the library began in August 1904 to served the growing population of Walkley, the suburb had become a popular area with commuters with the arrival of the Sheffield Tramway in the early 1900s. The City’s Libraries and Museums Committee were lobbied by various local dignitaries to build a library and the search for a suitable site began. Moor End on Commonside was considered but was deemed unsuitable for a library, in the end, William Craven, an insurance agent from Industry Street found five old cottages at the corner of South Road and Walkley Road which were for sale. Sheffield Corporation paid £1,500 for the land to the owner Mr. William Addy Hall. Local Liberal Councillor J.W. Crowther had the task of supervising the building of the library without incurring any cost to local tax payers and he approached Andrew Carnegie, the Scottish American steel magnate who had set up a fund to cover the cost of new libraries. Carnegie agreed to provide £3,500 in two stages for the construction of the library with the proviso that Sheffield Libraries Committee consented to spend no less than £230 per annum on its upkeep. Local architects were invited to submit plans for the new library that would not only be within the £3,500 budget but also correspond with the specifications drawn up by the Sheffield City Surveyor. These specifications included an entrance hall with drinking fountain, separate reading rooms for men and women and a lending library and rooms for the librarian and the committee. The submitted plans were judged by the renowned London architect William Emerson. The winner was Henry Leslie Paterson of the architects Hemsoll & Paterson of Bank Street, Sheffield. Paterson had previously designed many buildings for the council including Upperthorpe and Morley Street Schools. The building contractor was Daniel O’Neil of Scotland Street and the foundation stone was laid on August 9, 1904 by Alderman Brittain. The building was complete at the end of 1905 after 16 months of work and was opened by the Lord Mayor of Sheffield Herbert Hughes. Councillor Crowther died in 1916 and a commemorative plaque was placed in his honour on the boundary wall in front of the library in 1927. On November 3, 1924 a junior section was added to the library in what had been the women’s reading room. The building had internal alterations in 1954 which included the relocation of the junior library to the former men’s reading room and the demolition of an internal wall enabled the main lending library to be extended.\\"A Veritable University - Memories Of Walkley And Its Library\\", Walkley Library Millennium Publication, No ISBN, Gives history of library. Walkley Library Action Group (WLAG) This group was set up in 1992 after it was rumoured that the library was to be closed by Sheffield City Council. In the end the library remained open although six branch libraries did close in the city in 1995. The group's aims are to help maintain a library service in Walkley, to support improvements to the library service, to encourage the provision of a wide range of activities which will extend the use and popularity of the library service and building and to help maintain and improve the unique Walkley Library building.

In September 2013 Walkley Library was identified as one of 15 city libraries slated for closure in the Sheffield City Council library review.Sheffield City Council Library Review, 2013 A campaign group called Walkley Against Library Closures (WALC) formed in February 2013 to fight the closure of all city public libraries including Walkley. Walkley Community Library Futures Group Walkley Community Library Futures Group (WCLFG) was a group formed by local residents to examine options for running Walkley Library as a community endeavour, given the withdrawal of public funding. They submitted a draft business plan in January 2014 which was accepted, then submitting an Associate Library business plan in July 2014. A bid was also submitted by The Forum Cafe' Bars Ltd. Both bids were accepted by Sheffield City Council, who suggested that the parties work together to create a combined library and cafe bar facility. Walkley Carnegie Library Walkley Carnegie LibraryWalkley Carnegie Library was formed by local residents, including members of WCLFG, to run the library after it was handed over by Sheffield City Council on November 17, 2014. Although the original intention was to develop a combined library and cafe (with Forum Cafe' Bars Ltd, subsequently renamed True North Brew Co Ltd), this has not come to fruition as the proposed partnership ended in 2018. ==Architecture== The building consists of two wings and is in the Tudor Revival style with the stone for the external walls being quarried locally at the Bole Hills quarry at Crookes with the smooth dressing stone around the entrance and windows coming from Stoke Hall at Calver. The building originally had a small ornamental wooden cupola over the entrance hall but this was removed in 1956 after it was deemed to be unsafe. The building is small but quite striking with its large bay windows and distinctive entrance which consists of a portico with six Ionic columns with a curving staircase leading to it.

The first five tracks come from the 1982–1984 period, including a piano version of \\"Call in the Night Boy\\", B-side to a non-album A-side in 1983. Whilst the remaining seven tracks cover 1986–1988, the EMI era of the band's more experimental phase, most songs in this part of the album are drawn from The Colour of Spring and Spirit of Eden. Nothing post-1988 is featured, as EMI, who released the album, couldn't collect material from Laughing Stock or Missing Pieces, both recorded over 1990–1991, or the live album London 1986, released by Pond Life in 1999. ==Reception== Allmusic said in their 3/5 review that the album had a \\"bizarre\\" track list, but \\"this will be ideal for fans who want cheap access to some of the group's best B-sides without breaking for the extensive and more expensive Asides Besides.http://www.allmusic.com/album/introducing-r657793 ==Track list== #\\"Have You Heard the News?\\" – 5:07 #\\"Candy\\" – 4:41 #\\"Renée\\" – 6:21 #\\"Tomorrow Started\\" – 5:58 #\\"Call in the Night Boy\\" (Piano version) – 3:52 #\\"For What It's Worth\\" – 5:21 #\\"Happiness Is Easy\\" – 6:33 #\\"April 5th\\" – 5:52 #\\"It's Getting Late in the Evening\\" – 5:48 #\\"Desire\\" – 7:04 #\\"John Cope\\" – 4:41 #\\"I Believe in You\\" – 6:03 \\"Desire\\" is cut short of 13 silent seconds.

Otho joined his brother Thomas in Edward III's military expedition to Normandy in 1346 and fought at the Battle of Caen. There the Constable of France surrendered himself to his brother who sold him to the King. Back in England the Constable was given to Otho to guard until he could be ransomed but Otho allowed his prisoner too much freedom (by allowing him to cross to France on parole) and was heavily censured as a result. In 1348 he was invested, along with his brother Thomas, as a founder knight of the new Order of the Garter and allocated stall 23 at the home of the order in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. In 1355 he again joined his brother Thomas on a campaign in France, but was taken prisoner in Dauphiny and ransomed. He was made Governor of the Channel Islands in 1359.

It initially used steam locomotives pulling unpowered tramcars, but as the system was expanded, a decision was taken to change to electric traction in 1900, and the first electric trams began operating in February 1901. The system was built to the unusual gauge of , in the hope that coal wagon from neighbouring coal tramways, which used that gauge, could be moved around the system. This did not occur, but two coal trams were used to delivered coal to three mills. A number of extensions to the system were made until 1923, and some doubling of track took place in 1924, but a decision to trial trolleybuses was made in 1931/32, and the first tram route to be converted closed in 1933. Thereafter, lines were closed as the new infrastructure was erected, and the final tram ran on 29 June 1940. None of the vehicles survived into preservation. ==History== Construction of tramways in England was covered by the Tramways Act 1870, which allowed local authorities to own the infrastructure, but did not allow a municipal authority to run the service. Huddersfield received authorisation for their system in 1880, and construction began in 1881. When they then advertised for an operator, no interest was shown, and so they applied to the Board of Trade for a licence to operate the service themselves. This was granted, on the proviso that should a company subsequently express interest, and make a reasonable offer for the cars and associated plant, then Huddersfield would cease to operate the system. Trials were carried out using a steam tramway locomotive on Chappel Hill on 13 November 1882, and a Board of Trade inspection on 29 November resulted in of track being declared fit for purpose. Services started on 11 January 1883. Huddersfield was the first local authority in England to operate its own tramcar services, as well as own the tramlines.Capital, Entrepreneurs and Profits, Richard Peter Treadwell Davenport-Hines, Routledge, 1 April 1990 The benefits of this were mostly felt by the employees, notably in being required to work fewer hours per day than employees of neighbouring systems run by private companies.Official Papers of Alfred Marshall: A Supplement, Alfred Marshall, Peter D. Groenewegen, Cambridge University Press, 30 May 1996 Huddersfield corporation employees worked 8 hour days, compared to 14–16 for private employers. Part of the system nearly became cable-hauled, as the Hallidie Cable Company offered to build and run a section. However, having laid a cable conduit between the tracks and begun work on the foundations of a building to hold the winding-engine, they pulled out of the project, and the Corporation ran steam trams along the tracks. Horse trams were used on the route to Moldgreen until 1888 when they were replaced by steam trams. The tram engines were four-wheeled Wilkinson type machines. Wilkinson owned an engineering works in Wigan, and tried out a vertical-boilered locomotive on the local tramway. He secured sufficient orders that manufacture of his designs were carried out by Beyer, Peacock, and Company in Manchester, Thomas Green & Son in Leeds and Black, Hawthorn & Company in Gateshead. Passengers were carried in four-wheeled, open-top cars. Those from the Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company Ltd could seat 38, and those from the Starbuck Car and Wagon Company could seat 34. As patronage of the system increased, the Corporation ordered some larger tramcars from G.F. Milnes & Co. of Birkenhead. These were bogie vehicles with a covered upper deck and could seat 62 passengers. The tram engines were underpowered to haul the new tramcars, and so 15 new locomotives were ordered from Kitson and Company of Leeds, with another 10 from Thomas Green & Son. When the system opened, the main depot was in Northumberland Street, but a new depot on Great Northern Street was opened on July 1887, with capacity for 30 locomotives and 30 tramcars. The depot included engineering facilities, as the Corporation built two additional locomotives there. The unusual track gauge of was chosen because there were a number of coal tramways in the locality, and the Corporation planned to run coal wagons around the system in addition to the passenger trams. The concept had been demonstrated to be feasible on the Portsmouth and Glasgow systems, both of which used the same gauge, but such trains did not run on the Huddersfield tramlines while there was steam haulage. In order to protect their investment, the Corporation obtained an Act of Parliament in 1897, which enshrined their right to operate the system. 1897 was also the first year in which the tramways made an operating profit, and did not have to be supported with money from the rates. In 1900, a line to Slaithwaite was opened, which included a section which ran through the Urban District of Linthwaite. Linthwaite built the tracks for this section and then leased them for £1,125 per year to Huddersfield, who ran the steam trams over them. This was a more common model for tramway operation than Huddersfield's owner/operator model. Electric services The opening of the line to Slaithwaite required additional rolling stock, and it was this that ultimately led to the decision to electrify the whole system. Reports were produced by the Tramways Department, the Electricity Department and by the Borough Engineer, Mr K F Campbell. Campbell suggested building a new power station, car sheds and offices at Longroyd Bridge, and this was accepted by the Corporation. They obtained powers and borrowed £47,780, () to modernise and electrify the system in 1900. The main contractors were Greenwood & Batley of Leeds. 25 new tramcars were ordered from G.F. Milnes, who had by this time moved to new works at Hadley in Shropshire. Each car ran on two four-wheeled bogies, had an open upper deck, and seating for 56 passengers. The downstairs saloon was heated, with crimson velvet cushions and curtains at the windows. The power station was formally opened on 7 February 1901. 150 guests were invited to the event, including the managers of other local tramway systems. The Board of Trade then made an inspection of the tracks, and electric services started running from Huddersfield railway station in St. George's Square to Outlane and Lindley both via Marsh and Edgerton on 14 February 1901. The first phase included the conversion of five routes, and these were completed by the end of February. A second phase was completed between February and July 1902, when the rest of the lines were converted. This phase included an extension to Honley of the existing tracks to Berry Brow. Honley was the first place served which was outside the Borough of Huddersfield. A further 36 tramcars were ordered from the British Electric Car Co of Trafford Park, Manchester. These were of two designs, seating 51 and 55 passengers. They had an open-topped upper deck and ran on a 4-wheeled truck. They were better suited to the steeply graded routes than the larger bogie cars. In 1903, nine more tramcars were purchased, bringing the total to 70 cars. Roofs began to be fitted to the upper decks from November 1902. When the system was converted to electric traction, the gauge was retained, as the Corporation still hoped to use the steam tram locomotives to haul coal wagons around the system. In anticipation of such a service, a branch was built from the Outlane route to Wellington Mills, owned by Martin Sons & Co. The branch reached above sea level near the mills. Negotiations to allow a connection from the Bradford Road route to the coal chutes at Hillhouse Sidings took rather longer, but after three years of negotiation, the London and North Western and Lancashire and Yorkshire Joint Railway finally agreed, and the connection was made. Two electric coal trams were built, each with Westinghouse motors and Westinghouse-Newall magnetic track brakes. They could carry 10 tons of coal and were first demonstrated on 2 September 1904. Subsequently, Gosport Mill and Lindley Mill, both on the Outlane route, also took delivery of coal by the tramway. Each year around 12,000 tons of coal was delivered, and the cars covered some . Expansion A series of extensions to the system took place between 1903 and 1914, and several sections were converted from single track to double track. These necessitated the acquisition of 36 more tramcars, which were purchased from the United Electric Car Company at Preston, Lancashire. During the First World War, the tramways experienced some difficulties, particularly with maintenance. Staffing shortages were helped by employing women as conductors, but they were not used to drive the trams, as some of the routes were thought to be too arduous for them. The employment of women-only lasted until 1919. After the end of the war, several more extensions were made, including one from Smithy to Brighouse, which included the only stretch of track on its own right of way, where it crossed fields to reach Clough Lane, Fixby. A final extension to the Leeds Road football ground was opened in August 1923, although further doubling of tracks took place in 1924 as part of a road- widening programme. A new depot at Longroyd Bridge was completed in July 1921, capable of holding 100 tramcars. The fleet was expanded by the purchase of 38 more tramcars between 1919 and 1932, again obtained from Preston, although the United Electric Car Co had been taken over by Dick, Kerr & Co. in 1917, and Dick, Kerr had become part of English Electric in 1918. The final eight were fully upholstered, and fitted with air brakes. ==Closure== In 1931/32, Huddersfield began looking at using trolleybuses, and the tramway route to Almondbury was chosen for an experiment. Once Parliamentary sanction was obtained, the trams were withdrawn, the roadway was reconstructed, and new overhead wiring was erected. The new service opened on 4 December 1933, and the Corporation quickly decided to convert the routes to Lindley, Outlane, and Waterloo. All three routes were opened on 11 November 1934. An order was then placed for a further 85 trolleybuses, and they were gradually brought into use as the tramway routes were converted. Tram services ended completely on 29 June 1940. The closing ceremonies were somewhat muted, due to the blackout and other restrictions caused by the hostilities of the Second World War. In the early years, the tram service had been supported from the rates, at a cost of £73,041, but it was profitable from 1906 onwards, generating £87,027 for the Corporation, which was used for rate relief. After closure, all of the trams were scrapped, and none survived. ==Bibliography== * * References Category:4 ft 7¾ in gauge railways in England Category:Tram transport in England Category:Transport in Huddersfield Category:1883 establishments in England Category:Transport companies established in 1883 Category:British companies established in 1883 ","title":"Huddersfield Corporation Tramways"},{"id":"35321631","text":"Argyresthia freyella is a moth of the family Yponomeutidae.

Published by Taylor and Francis. with horse power. The system re-opened three days later as Keighley Corporation Tramways and stayed in service until 1924 when it closed for good. ==History== Keighley Tramways Company constructed a horse-drawn tramway from Ingrow through Keighley to Utley. Services started on 8 May 1889 and were extended into Stockbridge. The company also plied a route from Coney Lane (where the successor company would build a power station) onto Marley Street via East Parade in the town. All services cost 1d (1 pence) and the interval of services was every 10 minutes stretching to 14 minutes on a Saturday.\\" This service was originally single track, but after electrification, double track was installed. The service was never financially successful. The only dividend ever paid by the company was when it was wound up in 1901. The company sold out to Keighley Corporation and the 30 horses and 6 tramcars and other equipment were sold at auction for £804. The service was modernised and continued as Keighley Corporation Tramways. The route began operations with electric trams on 24 September 1901, with trial runs to Ingrow taking place the week before. The hub of the system was opposite the Mechanics Institute in the town where a triangular junction was in operation to allow trams to access all three destinations from any of the routes that they were originating from. The system from Ingrow to Utley was electrified and a branch was added to connect Keighley railway station, Victoria Park and Stockbridge some east of the town. The extension to Stockbridge was in response to the Mid Yorkshire Tramways company who had obtained powers to install a tramway between Shipley and Keighley. The Keighley company exercised their right to build the section between Stockbridge and the town and this duly opened in February 1905. During 1921, another extension was added between Ingrow and Oxenhope. This service would run on single track and pass at a designated loop for the tracks but without a passing loop in the overhead cables, which necessitated having to transfer a small receiver car between trams travelling to and from Oxenhope. Other extensions were added to Sutton-in-Craven and Oakworth; with all the three extension branches (Sutton, Oakworth and Oxenhope) the trams were of a trackless trolleybus type that allowed extension to those towns without resorting to tracks. These employed a special system created by an Austrian company named Cedes-Stoll. The winding up of the Cedes-Stoll company during the First World War accelerated the demise of the special trackless trolleybuses, and they were withdrawn in 1926. The new system took power from the Corporation Power Station in Coney Lane and was operated with electric trams until December 1924 when the system closed to trams. However, trolleybuses continued using the overhead wires until 1932, with trackless cars. ==References== Bibliography * Category:Tram transport in England Category:Keighley Category:4 ft gauge railways in England Category:Rail transport in West Yorkshire ","title":"Keighley Tramways"},{"id":"35321804","text":"Kirill Nikolaevich Shikhaev (born 1925) is a Soviet and Russian scientist.

Her youngest son, Charles Rolls, took the royal couple on what might have been their first car ride. Charles was the first British person to die in a flying accident when his plane crashed in 1910. Lady Llangattock was well known for her philanthropic and social interests, and for promoting the role of women in society. She was in 1902 elected president of the Monmouthshire branch of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families' Association. In December 1910 she instigated a meeting in Monmouth which set up a branch of the British Red Cross Society in the county, and first considered the setting up of Voluntary Aid Detachments (VAD) in the area. She became the first President of the Monmouthshire branch of the Society. Lord Llangattock died in 1912. Her two other sons were killed in action during the First World War, so she was the last Lady Llangattock, and her daughter Eleanor Shelley-Rolls (9 October 1872 - 15 September 1961) was the heir to the Hendre. ==Legacy== The Llangattock Collection, which includes a substantial quantity of letters written by Nelson to his wife, was bequeathed to the town of Monmouth. The letters, bound into five volumes, had been bought at auction in 1914 from the Nelson family by Lady Llangattock at Christie's. The first three volumes contain letters to his wife from his proposal to their separation, and the first volume contains Nelson's wife's wedding ring. The first building which housed the collection, initially a gymnasium on Glendower Street donated to the town of Monmouth by Lady Llangattock, is now known as the Nelson Rooms. The Monmouth Museum has been called The Nelson Museum as it is based on the Llangattock collections. The museum also houses material about the Rolls family and it contains the 1867 portrait of Lady Llangattock created by H.Groves. The local library at the Rolls Hall also holds a full-length portrait of Lady Llangattock. ==LineageReferences External links == Category:1837 births Category:1923 deaths Georgiana ","title":"Georgiana Rolls, Baroness Llangattock"},{"id":"35322188","text":"Commelina welwitschii is an herbaceous plant in the dayflower family found in Southern Africa from Zimbabwe to Angola. A phylogenetic study based on the nuclear ribosomal DNA region 5S NTS and the chloroplast region trnL-trnF, two commonly used gene regions for determining relationships, revealed that Commelina welwitschii forms a clade with Commelina purpurea and Commelina fluviatilis. Both of these relatives are African, share an unusual leaf anatomy, and have linear leaves that are often folded. Although it has yellow flowers, this study did not find a close relationship with Commelina capitata or Commelina africana, the two other African yellow-flowered species. Robert Faden, an expert on the Commelinaceae, points out that Commelina welwitschii is one of only three species in the genus to have bead-like rhizomes along with Commelina crassicaulis and Commelina sphaerorrhizoma. While it is clear that the former species is most likely a close relative given its many other similarities, the latter species is unlikely closely related given major differences in other characters. ==References== welwitschii Category:Flora of South Tropical Africa Category:Plants described in 1881 ","title":"Commelina welwitschii"},{"id":"35322215","text":"Ronald Bladen (1968) Ronald Bladen (July 13, 1918– February 3, 1988) was an American painter and sculptor. He is particularly known for his large-scale sculptures. His artistic stance, was influenced by European Constructivism, American Hard-Edge Painting, and sculptors such as Isamu Noguchi and David Smith. Bladen in turn had stimulating effect on a circle of younger artists including Carl Andre, Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt and others, who repeatedly referred to him as one of the ‘father figures’ of Minimal Art. ==Early life== Charles Ronald Wells Bladen was born on July 13, 1918, to Muriel Beatrice Tylecote and Kenneth Bladen, both British immigrants living in Vancouver, Canada. His mother studied at the Sorbonne in Paris and was active as part of the suffragette movement. In 1922 the family moved to the Washington state before returning to Canada to live in Victoria British Columbia in 1932. The artist displayed his love of and capacity for art at a young age. At ten years old Bladen began drawing intensively, making copies of works by Titian, Picasso and Matisse. In 1937 the artist enrolled in the Vancouver School of Art where he studied until 1939. ==San Francisco== In 1939 the artist moved to San Francisco, where he enrolled in the California School of Fine Arts. In 1941, when drafted and subsequently declared unfit for service, the artist was obliged to work as a ship's welder at the navy dockyards. This training proved invaluable. Using the skills he learned in this capacity the artist supported him for many years as a toolmaker. In 1946 Bladen traveled to Tijuana, Mexico, New Orleans and New York on a grant from the San Francisco Art Association. In 1948 he was married to the actress Barbara Gross. They separated in 1955 and he moved into a communal household with poet Michael McClure, and painter Al Held, who would remain a lifelong friend. During this time he also befriended the writers Jack Kerouac, Henry Miller and Allen Ginsberg. ==New York== In 1956, Bladen moved to New York, where he lived on Houston Street. Through Al Held he met George Sugarman and Nicholas Krushenick and John Krushenick, who together founded the Brata Gallery co-operative in 1957. The artist's paintings from this period mark a departure from his earlier romantic works. They are defined by highly concentrated segments of color set against monochromatic backgrounds. In 1960, he took over Al Held's studio at 5 West 21st Street, where he began to focus on making collages of folded paper and large scale plywood relief paintings. In 1962, he exhibited his plywood paintings for the first time at the Brata Gallery and the Green Gallery in New York. The following year he made his first free-standing, colored sculptures from plywood boards with metal struts. From this time on the artist dedicated himself exclusively to sculpture. In 1964, he showed his first sculpture, White Z, at an exhibition in the Park Place Gallery in New York where he befriended Connie Reyes, who later became his companion. He was awarded the National Medal of Arts by the National Endowment of the Arts. In 1965, Bladen participated in the critically acclaimed Concrete Expressionism show curated by critic Irving Sandler at New York University, which also featured the work of sculptors George Sugarman and David Weinrib and painters Al Held and Knox Martin.Irving Sandler, From Avant-Garde to Pluralism: An On-The-Spot History (Hard Press Editions, 2006). In 1966, Bladen showed a tripartite work made the previous year, Three Elements, at the exhibition, Primary Structures Younger American and British Artists, in the Jewish Museum in New York. A seminal moment in the history of sculpture, this exhibition brought the language of minimal sculpture into the public eye. Artists represented in the exhibition include Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt, Walter De Maria Robert Morris and others. In 1967 he was included in the Scale as Content exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, which brought together important sculptures by Ronald Bladen, Barnett Newman and Tony Smith, he showed his monumental sculpture, The X. Starting in 1967 he received a number of important public commissions, was represented in 1968 at documenta 4 in Kassel, and was among the circle of artists presented to a European art public under the title, Minimal Art, West Berlin. In 1970, he was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship. ==Teaching== From 1974 to 1976, Bladen taught as a guest lecturer at Columbia University in New York and was awarded the Mark Rothko Fellowship in 1975. In 1976, Bladen was appointed teacher at the Parsons The New School for Design, a post he held until 1978 and he also taught at the School of Visual Arts. He was an Artist in Residence in 1981/1982 at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture (Maine), and in 1982-1983 as a guest lecturer at Yale University in New Haven (Connecticut). In 1977, he was once again awarded the National Endowment of the Arts. ==Public commissions== Starting in 1967 Ronald Bladen received a number of important public commissions including: The Cathedral Evening for the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, New York, 1969, Vroom Sh-Sh-Sh for Buffalo, New York, 1974, Raiko I for Galerie Schmela in Düsseldorf, 1975, Cosmic Seed for Des Moines (Iowa), 1977, Kama Sutra for Central Park, New York, New York, 1978, Oracle’s Vision for Springfield, Ohio, Black Lightning for Seattle and the King Faisal University in Riyadh, Host of the Ellipse for Baltimore, Maryland, in 1981, and Sonar Tide for Peoria, Illinois, in 1983. ==Selected exhibitions== *1956 Paintings by Ronald Bladen, Fine Art Gallery, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC *1965 Concrete Expressionism, Loeb Student Center, New York University, New York, NY *1966 Primary Structures.

He is associate professor at Roskilde University in the Department of Society and Globalisation. From 2003-2012 he worked at The American University of Rome where he was Chair of the department of International Relations. ==Education== Thomassen holds BA and MA degrees in Anthropology from the Institute of Anthropology at the University of Copenhagen (1994 and 1997) and a Doctoral Degree (Ph.D.) in Political and Social Science from the Department of Political and Social Sciences (2001), at the European University Institute, Florence, Italy. After his PhD he worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University College of Cork, Ireland. ==Research== Thomassen's scholarly work develops across the disciplines of anthropology, sociology, politics, philosophy and history. His research has been published in a variety of social science journals, including \\"Anthropological Theory, Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Comparative Studies in Society and History, Europæa, Journal des Europeanistes, Journal of Modern Italian Studies, etc. He has written non-scholarly articles for the Danish weekly, \\"Weekendavisen\\". His PhD research related to the anthropology of political borders, with ethnographic focus on the border region between Italy, Slovenia and Croatia known as the “Julian Region”. He examined how cultural and national identities are constructed through conflicting collective memories in a political and cultural environment defined by historically changing borders. He wrote his PhD thesis as a narrative evolving from the life-stories of self- identified Italians from Istria who for various reasons chose to leave Tito's Yugoslavia and moved “back” to Italy.http://www.theslovenian.com/articles/2008/thomassen.pdf After his PhD, Thomassen has engaged various areas of research. He writes and publishes on immigration in Italy.http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_165435_en.pdf Together with colleagues James Walston and Isabella Clough-Marinaro he has organized several conferences on immigration and integration in Italy. In this context he is also engaged in various community projects, including a project launched by the American University of Rome in 2011 to foster immigrant leadership in Italy. Thomassen also teaches and does research related to urban anthropology. In 2010 he co-organized a conference at the AUR in Rome, called “Changing Faces of the Eternal City”, which brought together leading Italian and international scholars dedicated to the study of contemporary Rome. Thomassen is principally interested in how anthropological ideas and approaches can inform political and social theory and the study of contemporary politics. He has in several publications explored the concept of liminality and its potential for understanding change and transition in modern societies. In an article from 2012, “From Liminal to Limivoid: Understanding contemporary Bungee Jumping in a cross-cultural perspective”, co-authored with his cross- cousin Maja Balle, he coined the term “limivoid” to denote liminal experiences that are essentially void of experiential substance and transformative potential. Elaborating Victor Turner's notion of the “liminoid”, he argued that the “limovoid” critically identifies an underlying aspect of the larger (post)modern celebration of boundary experiences. In recent work Thomassen has sought to develop an anthropological approach to political revolutions. Thomassen has also engaged the axial age debate from the perspective of anthropology. This relates to Thomassen's approach to the larger discussion over “multiple modernities”. Another branch of Thomassen's teaching and research focuses on the question of social memory and identity politics. With reference to Italy, he discusses how the past is continuously but variously used in the articulation of people's urban, regional, national and European identities. He employs anthropological approaches to history and politics as produced and reproduced through memory politics via rituals, symbols and collective commemorations. Part of this research is developed with Italian historian, Rosario Forlenza.http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_224792_en.pdf Together with former student, Derrick Fiedler, Thomassen has revisited the work of Arnold Toynbee and argued for its contemporary relevance.http://www.nuovacultura.net/ojs/index.php/processi/article/download/28/38 In an article from 2012, Thomassen critically engaged the political philosophy of John Rawls, arguing from a perspective inspired by political theorist, Eric Voegelin. Via participation in the yearly held “Socrates Symposium” in Florence, Thomassen has also taken an interest in Plato's philosophy.http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/241074/1/BookHorvathIPASzakolczai.Simposio.Ion%5B1%5DISBN%5B1%5D.txt His current research in Denmark involves the history of anthropological thought, and the connections between anthropological and social theory. In an article from 2011, co-authored with Arpad Szakolczai, he argued that Gabriel Tarde should be recognized as a founding figure of political anthropology. Thomassen is a founding editor-in-chief of the peer-reviewed academic journal International Political Anthropology. ==Teaching career== Thomassen taught a broad spectrum of classes at AUR. These included areas such as: anthropology, history, sociology, and politics. Within the framework of International Political Anthropology he co-organises the annual International Political Anthropology Summer School in Florence. This course was designed for post- graduates that work in the cross-roads between anthropology and political affairs. His career includes over ten years of experience in teaching and student advising at institutions in Europe including the University of Copenhagen. == See also == * Liminality == References  External links == * Roskilde Webpage * The American University of Rome * International Political Anthropology Category:University of Copenhagen alumni Category:Danish anthropologists Category:Living people Category:1968 births Category:European University Institute alumni ","title":"Bjørn Thomassen"},{"id":"35322226","text":"The Tswapong Hills are a mountain range in the Central District, Botswana. They rise to an elevation of 300 to 400 m above the hardveld of the almost 900 m high surrounding plateau. Geologically, these flat-topped hills are similar to the Waterberg Massif, located about 100 km to the south. The Tswapong Range receives relatively more moisture than the surrounding sandy plain of Mopane woodland. The rocky cliffs are made of porous rock that absorbs rainwater, which then seeps out forming permanent cascades and pools, such as the Phothophotho Gorge. The Lotsane River flows at the feet of the Tswapong Hills on their northern side.Tswapong Hills One of the main attractions of the hills is the spectacular Moremi Gorge.Moremi Gorge in Tswapong Hills ==Inhabited places== NASA picture of the Tswapong Hills with the Lotsane River flowing along the northern edge The former capital of the Ngwato Kingdom was in Phalatswe, also called Old Palapye, at the western end of the Tswapong Range.Tswapong Hills Cultural Landscape Moeng is a village located in the midst of the range at an altitude of 945 m.

She was most remembered for her extensive work with the HIV/AIDS epidemic, especially throughout Africa. Priscilla Reining was the recipient of three anthropological degrees, from the University of Chicago. Reining's field of specialization was centered mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. During a Sudanese uprising in 1955, Reining and her family fled the country having \\"led a whole convoy of people.\\" She worked for several years with the Haya people located in Tanzania in the early 1950s becoming one of the uppermost authorities on the village life of sub-Saharan peoples. One of her more notable studies was that of the Haya land tenure: > We have examined the two forms of landholding and tenancy in the Haya system > of land tenure. Although they co-exist, they have different bases, the one > as an aspect of the traditional structure and the other as an aspect of the > structure developing at the time of the study. The significance of each > derives from the particular characteristics of Haya land which is valuable > but limited in quantity. In the traditional structure, the land formed the > base or medium through which the institution of clientship was expressed and > some land is still held under this form of tenure. In the developing > structure, the pressure on the land makes for heterogeneous arrangements, > here considered under the rubric of the relatively new form of tenure. Reining also pioneered and implicated the Landsat imagery technology in the field of anthropology and other social sciences. However, it was her work on HIV transmission in Africa that brought her most recognition within the anthropology community. ==HIV/AIDS in Africa and Asia== During the 1980s while on a visit to Tanzania, Reining noted that the people she had been studying, the Haya, were getting sick and the mortality rate within the region was becoming alarmingly high. She began to research into causes and prevention methods of the disease. She found an apparent connection between Circumcision and HIV transmission, as uncircumcised men in Kenya had a much higher risk of being infected. She later found cultural fluctuations in different groups who did not practice circumcision, as compared to the neighboring groups who ritually practiced the act of male circumcision. What she found was there was a \\"correlation between lack of circumcision among some ethnic groups in Africa and increased susceptibility to HIV/AIDS.\\" As a result of her extensive research into peoples of the region and Reining's years of immersion in the cultures of surrounding groups she was able to make the connection that the rate of HIV/AIDS was higher in groups that had a cultural aversion to male circumcision. Her work was never officially validated until shortly before she died, although more than 60 studies over the years supported her findings. In the mid-1990s, John and Pat Caldwell, mapping the progress of the AIDS epidemic in Africa, confirmed that the regions with the highest HIV/AIDS rates were also regions with the greatest number of uncircumcised males. A similar correlation was found in South Asia and Southeast Asia by a United Nations study (UNAIDS). ==Use of Landsat technology== Reining is also responsible for pioneering the use of satellite imagery for social science research, demonstrating in 1973 that Landsat imagery could be combined with field data on villages to produce population and carrying capacity estimates for the Sahel (the arid belt between the Sahara and tropical Africa). While the introduction of Landsat imagery to the field of social science was slow at first due to the fear of satellites replacing researchers in the field, the technology was eventually widely adopted and incorporated into the fields of anthropology and archaeology among other social sciences. This method is still used today, for studying village patterns as well as making the finding and mapping locations of archaeological sites easier. Reining used this technique to help map the HIV/AIDS occurrences in the region where she worked and it was one of the aspects that contributed to her findings involving male circumcision. ==Other works== Reining authored or co-authored over fifty publications. ==Death== Reining died in her home on July 19, 2007, aged 84, from complications due to lung cancer. ==References== Category:1923 births Category:2007 deaths Category:American anthropologists Category:American women anthropologists Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:HIV/AIDS in Africa Category:20th-century American women scientists Category:20th-century American scientists Category:21st-century American scientists Category:20th- century anthropologists ","title":"Priscilla Reining"},{"id":"35322362","text":"Katherine Rake (born 5 May 1968) is director of HealthWatch England, and formerly director of the Family and Parenting Institute, an independent charity that exists to make the UK a better place for families and children.

Applied and/or self-consistent electrostatic and magnetic fields are handled with the Poisson and Faraday equations. The GNU project has announced on May 2012 that the software package Aeneas« Aeneas », gnu.org, May 2012. will be substituted by Archimedes, making this one the GNU package for Monte Carlo semiconductor devices simulations. ==Introduction== Archimedes is the GNU package for semiconductor device simulations that has been released for the first time on 2005 under GPL. It has been created by Jean Michel Sellier who is, since then, the leader of the project and the main developer. It is a Free software and thus it can be copied, modified and redistributed under GPL. This is the one of the big advantages of using Archimedes. Archimedes belongs to the well- known family of TCAD software, i.e. tools utilized to assist the development of technologically relevant products. In particular, this package assists engineers in designing and simulating submicron and mesoscopic semiconductor devices. In a next-future version Archimedes will also be able to simulate nanodevices, using the Wigner Monte Carlo formalismE. Wigner, On the Quantum Correction for Thermodynamic Equilibrium (1932) (an experimental release can be found atJ.M. Sellier, http://www.nano-archimedes.com). Today Archimedes is used in several big companies for simulation and production purposes. Archimedes is also useful for teaching purposes since everybody can access the sources, modify and test them. Today, it is used for teaching courses in several hundreds universities all around the world. Furthermore, a simplified version, developed for students, is available on nanoHUB.org. The Ensemble Monte Carlo method is the method that Archimedes uses to simulate and predict the behavior of a devices. Being the Monte Carlo very stable and reliable, Archimedes can be used to know the characteristics of a device even before this last is built. The physics and geometry of a device is described simply by a script, which makes, in this sense, Archimedes a powerful tool for the simulation of quite general semiconductor devices. Archimedes is able to simulate a plenty of physics effects and transport for electrons and heavy holes in Silicon, Germanium, GaAs, InSb, AlSb, AlAs, AlxInxSb, AlxIn(1-x)Sb, AlP, AlSb, GaP, GaSb, InP and their compounds (III-V semiconductor materials), along with Silicon Oxide, the applied and/or self-consistent electrostatic and magnetic fields by means of Poisson and Faraday equation. It is, also, able to deal with heterostructures. == Boltzmann transport equation == The Boltzmann transport equation model has been the main tool used in the analysis of transport in semiconductors. The BTE equation is given by: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial t} \\\\+ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\hbar} abla_k E(k) abla_r f \\\\+ \\\\frac{qF(r)}{\\\\hbar} abla_k f = \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right]_\\\\mathrm{collision} : v = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\hbar} abla_k E(k) The distribution function, f, is a dimensionless function which is used to extract all observables of interest and gives a full depiction of electron distribution in both real and k-space. Further, it physically represents the probability of particle occupation of energy k at position r and time t. In addition, due to being a seven-dimensional integro-differential equation (six dimensions in the phase space and one in time) the solution to the BTE is cumbersome and can be solved in closed analytical form under very special restrictions. Numerically, solution to the BTE is employed using either a deterministic method or a stochastic method. The deterministic method solution is based on a grid-based numerical method such as the spherical harmonics approach, whereas the Monte Carlo is the stochastic approach used to solve the BTE. == Monte Carlo method == The semiclassical Monte Carlo method is a statistical method used to yield exact solution to the Boltzmann transport equation which includes complex band structure and scattering processes. This approach is semiclassical for the reason that scattering mechanisms are treated quantum mechanically using the Fermi's Golden Rule, whereas the transport between scattering events is treated using the classical particle notion. The Monte Carlo model in essence tracks the particle trajectory at each free flight and chooses a corresponding scattering mechanism stochastically. Two of the great advantages of semiclassical Monte Carlo are its capability to provide accurate quantum mechanical treatment of various distinct scattering mechanisms within the scattering terms, and the absence of assumption about the form of carrier distribution in energy or k-space. The semiclassical equation describing the motion of an electron is : \\\\frac{dr}{dt} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\hbar} abla_k E(k) : \\\\frac{dk}{dt} = \\\\frac{qF(r)}{\\\\hbar} where F is the electric field, E(k) is the energy dispersion relation, and k is the momentum wave vector. To solve the above equation, one needs strong knowledge of the band structure (E(k)). The E(k) relation describes how the particle moves inside the device, in addition to depicting useful information necessary for transport such as the density of states (DOS) and the particle velocity. A Full-band E(K) relation can be obtained using the semi-empirical pseudopotential method.K.

The post-independence structure, which is just behind the Parliament House, was commissioned by Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, the first President of Ghana, in 1965. The building underwent massive renovation to serve as an office complex for Members of Ghana's Parliament and was completed in 2016. ==History== Job 600 was constructed to serve as the venue for the 1965 meeting of the Organization of African Unity. It is estimated to have cost more than £4 million. Dr. Nkrumah believed that the building would showcase Ghana as a country with the potential and ability to host international events, and a demonstration of Africa's growing technical capabilities. ==Renovation== In 2007 the John Kufuor administration secured a loan facility of a 25 million US dollars from the Social Security and National Insurance Trust for the renovation of the structure. The government stated that upon completion the new Job 600 would serve as an office complex to house the Members of the Ghanaian parliament. ==Financial cost== The cost of the project was initially estimated at 62.8 million dollars. In 2011, the estimate for renovating the building was adjusted upwards by 39 million dollars. The increased cost was due to inflation. ==End structure== In addition to the original 1965 structure, the new Job 600 will have two new blocks built behind it. One of the new blocks will serve as an auditorium while the other will house a gym, restaurants, a fire station and banks. The complex will consist of 252 offices for members of parliament and offices for research assistants and secretaries. The entire structure will be completed in August 2012. ==Suggested naming rights== Prior to the completion of the project, Osei Kyei Mensah Bonsu, the minority leader in parliament, proposed the renaming of the main Job 600 building. He suggested the building be named after the first speaker of Ghana's fourth parliament, Justice D. F. Annan, to honour the contribution he made towards the development of parliamentary affairs and democracy in Ghana. He also proposed that one of the two new blocks that were built behind the main Job 600 be named after Peter Ala Adjetey, who succeeded Justice Annan. Opposition to these naming issues was led by members of the Convention People's Party, who believed renaming Job 600 would erase the contributions of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah from Ghanaian history. ==Pre-completion disaster== On Friday, 11 May 2012, months prior to completion, fire broke out on the fifth floor of the building. Witnesses reported that the fire started in the early hours of the morning. It took several minutes before firemen from the Ghana National Fire Service were able to bring it under control. ==Inauguration== The build was official inaugurated by John Dramani Mahama on 6 November 2015 ==Amenities== The building upon its completion had the following amenities: * 300-seater auditorium * Gymnasium * Commercial bank * Clinic * Church * Mosque * Restaurant, * MPs’ dining room * ICT centre ==References== Category:Government buildings in Ghana Category:Buildings and structures in Accra Category:Government buildings completed in 1965 ","title":"Job 600"},{"id":"35322536","text":"200px Arms of Thomas Wale, KG: Argent a cross sable, as blazoned in the Lord Marshal's Roll of Arms, no. 428http://www.briantimms.net/era/lord_marshals/Lord_Marshal09/lord_marshals_roll_9.html Sir Thomas Wale (1303 – 26 October 1352) was an English soldier and founder Knight of the Garter.

As chief constructor for the Bureau of Construction and Repair from 1882 to 1892, he was in charge of all new warship design for the United States Navy. Through his efforts, the Navy began its transition out of a post–Civil War slump to become a modern naval power. Warships he designed include the pre-dreadnought battleship , whose destruction in Havana, Cuba, in 1898 precipitated the Spanish–American War. ==Life and career== Born in New York City, Wilson apprenticed at the Brooklyn Navy Yard under Naval Constructor B.F. Delano. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, he volunteered for U.S. Army service and served as a non–commissioned officer in the 13th New York Regiment. Upon his return from the front in August 1861, he was transferred to the U.S. Navy and was appointed as a carpenter in the construction department. He served on the between 1861 and 1863. On the Cambridge he participated in the first day of the Battle of Hampton Roads against the ironclad CSS Virginia.NY Times Obit. In 1863, Wilson was ordered on special duty to the Brooklyn Navy Yard to help direct the construction, repair and alteration of various vessels. Three years later, he passed the required examination and was commissioned an assistant naval constructor; he eventually served at naval facilities in Pensacola, Philadelphia and Washington DC. Between 1869 and 1873, he taught naval architecture and shipbuilding at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.Encyclopedia Americana In 1870, Wilson was sent on special duty to Great Britain and France. In Britain, he viewed vessels recently completed and under construction and toured shipbuilding and armor rolling mills.RG45 In 1873, he was promoted to naval constructor. After Annapolis, Wilson served at the Portsmouth Navy Yard and in 1881 was appointed onto the first Naval Advisory Board for rehabilitating and modernizing the Navy. However, he, the two other naval constructors on the panel and Chief Engineer Benjamin Isherwood, dissented with the majority on its recommendations. Those were for a renewed construction of warships that would allow the Navy to take advantage of technological advances such as steel construction, help resuscitate the national economy and develop a large domestic industrial base that could support a large fleet. His dissent may have been due to limitations of domestic industry at the time, without taking into account that domestic industrial modernization had become a major goal of the Navy.Friedman, Cruisers, 16–17, Desroyers, 7–8. Promoted to chief constructor of the Bureau of Construction and Repair in 1882, Wilson was placed in charge of naval design for all new warships. Among the ships he planned during his service were the pre-dreadnought battleship USS Maine, the protected cruisers , and and the gunboats USS Bennington, and . Wilson's reputation in foreign naval circles was considerable. Wilson tendered his resignation from the Navy in 1893 due to failing health and was instead granted two years' leave; he resumed his duties at the Boston Navy Yard in 1895. He died of heat stroke the following year while supervising the undocking of the monitor . ==Honors== Wilson was an honorary member of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects in Great Britain. He was the first American to be elected to this organization. He was also a member of several scientific societies, the Loyal Legion, the Grand Army of the Republic and the Naval Order of the United States. ==Patents== In 1870, Wilson patented a marine \\"air port,\\" which became standard use in naval and merchant marine ships. Ten years later, he patented a bolt extractor which also went into general use. ==Ships designed by Wilson (partial list)== File:USS Maine c1897 LOC det 4a25824.jpgUSS Maine (ACR-1) File:USS Chicago (1885).jpgUSS Chicago (CA-14) File:Newark (Cruiser 1).

She was then under contract with Barry White, who produced a 1974 album What Am I Gonna Do, and a single Just as Long as We're Together (In My Life There Will Never Be Another) which reached the top 20 on numerous record charts. She recorded a second album with arranger H. B. Barnum but it was not released. She was a member of The Ikettes, and a background singer for Mary Wilson (of the Supremes). Scott is a regular performer at The Baltic Soul Weekender in Germany. == Musical career == Her first 45 single was written and produced by Sylvester Stewart, better known as Sly Stone : \\"Gospel Singer Gloria Scott and the Tonettes cut I Taught Him with Sly in 1964. Reminiscent of girl groups like Martha and the Vandellas, The Shirelles and The Ronettes, Warner Brothers picked up this single for distribution.\\" In an interview with Christian John Wikane of Popmatters, Scott says : \\"He [Sly] just kind of took me under his wing. I sang at the Cow Palace. Sly and his sister and his cousin LaTanya backed me up and they were called the Tonettes: Gloria Scott and the Tonettes.\\" She then became a member of The Ikettes. Tina Turner says in her autobiography: \\"After [previous Ikettes] Robbie, Jessie and Venetta walked out, Ike had quickly scooped up two inexperienced L.A. girls, Maxine Smith and Pat 'P.P.' Arnold, and a young club singer from Palo Alto named Gloria Scott.\\". She later met and signed a 7-year contract with Barry White. White produced and arranged her only album, What Am I Gonna Do, which was released in 1974. Two tracks were released as singles. The album is notable for being the second released by Casablanca Records—label number NB0002 (NB0001 was by KISS). At that time Warner Brothers distributed the album, in multiple countries. Roshad Ollison, writing in the Virginia Pilot, says \\"What Am I Gonna Do is among Barry's most pop-minded productions. Gloria's lone release, it is also a gem. … What Am I Gonna Do, a classy effort on par with Barry's best albums, soon faded away; Gloria did, too.\\" Her single \\"Just as Long as We're Together (In My Life There Will Never Be Another)\\" was also produced by Barry White. This song peaked at #14 on the Hot Dance charts, #16 on Billboard (Feb 22, 1975) Hot Soul Singles and on the U.S. R&B.; It was played on the famous TV show Soul Train.Various TV Guides listings from 1971 to 1980 -- Season 4 Episode 25 March 8, 1975 Despite her 7-year contract with Barry White, and (indirectly) with Casablanca, her career failed to take off. PopMatters comments : \\"However, a combination of factors, including the growing pains of a new record company and White's focus on his own burgeoning career, ultimately limited the reach of What Am I Gonna Do. Though a follow-up single, 'Just As Long as We're Together', hit the R&B; Top 20 and held the top spot on the Disco Singles chart in early-1975, the second album she recorded with arranger H. B. Barnum was not released. For all his solo success, Barry White was not delivering on his contract with Gloria Scott. He became one of the most seminal figures of the 1970s while Scott faded into obscurity.\\" She is credited as a backup singer on the 1979 self-titled album by Mary Wilson (of the Supremes). Scott has performed every year since 2008 at The Baltic Soul Weekender in Germany. Her performance of Help Me Get Off This Merry-Go- Round, with the Baltic Soul Orchestra, was released as a single. == Personal life == Gloria Scott was born in Port Arthur but was raised in the city of Houston, before moving with her family to northern California when in her early teens. After her musical career in San Francisco and Los Angeles she spent 8 years in Guam. She presently lives in Lake County, California. ==Discography== Albums * What Am I Gonna Do (Casablanca, 1974) Singles {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Title ! colspan=\\"2\\" Chart Positions - style=\\"font-size:smaller;\\" ! width=\\"60\\" U.S. Hot Dance ! width=\\"60\\" U.S. R&B; -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 1974  align=\\"left\\" \\"Just as Long as We're Together (In My Life There Will Never Be Another)\\"  14  14 -  align=\\"left\\" \\"What Am I Gonna Do\\"  --  74 - } * What Am I Gonna Do - (7\\", Single) Casablanca Records 1974 * What Shall I Do - (7\\", Single) Casablanca Records 1974 * Just As Long As We're Together (In My Life There Will Never Be Another) - (7\\", Single) Casablanca Records 1974 * (A Case Of) Too Much Love Makin' - Casablanca Records 1975 * You're Losing Me - Ann Sexton & Baltic Soul Orchestra/ Gloria Scott & Baltic Soul Orchestra - Unique 2009 * Help Me Get Off This Merry-Go-Round - Ann Sexton & Baltic Soul Orchestra/ Gloria Scott & Baltic Soul Orchestra - Unique 2009 * That's The Way Love Is - Sedsoul - 2010 * Can't Keep Running Away - Single - (2013) * It's So Wonderful - Single - (2013) * Never Gonna Let You Go - Single - (2013)  Backing vocal credits  * 1972: Bo Diddley – Where It All Began * 1979: Mary Wilson – Mary Wilson == Covers and Samples == The B.

He was educated at the Protestant school of pastors and teachers in Kimpese. In 1958 he entered the Academy of Fine Arts in present day Kinshasa to study advertising painting and illustrations. After seven years he was awarded a diploma and a scholarship to study graphic arts at the Saint-Luc Higher Institute of Fine Arts in Liège, Belgium. He also took courses at the Liege Graduate School of Business and was a visiting student at the University of Louvain's Institute of Political and Social Science. He then completed his professional development through work in the University of Louvain External Relations department, the Inter Marco Publicem and Publisynthèse advertising agencies in Brussels, and the printers Mambourg in Liege, Acobel in Brussels and Agfa-Gevaert in Mortsel. ==Career== As soon as he returned to Zaire, Lema Kusa took the position of professor and (l'Académie des Beaux-Arts). At the same time he became head of the drawing studio for the leading advertising agency in Congo, then in 1974 launched his own agency, \\"Design Promotion\\". From 1981 he was deputy section chief in charge of teaching at the Academy of Fine Arts. He also became CEO of the National Institute of Arts, Kinshasa, a position he was holding in 2008 while also a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts. ==Work== In his spare time from his different jobs Lema Kusa created strong and moral paintings. He painted drunks, prostitutes, market figures, beggars and idlers with a strong expressionist palette and a distinctive and subtle humor. His paintings are often symbolic and sometimes abstract. Although highly original, his paintings always show the desire to please the public derived from his training in advertising. He has said of his paintings of women that if God created woman last, he must then have found perfection. He paints women as happy, beautiful and opulent, with their beauty providing a doorway for entering into the mystery of creation. His work has been shown at numerous exhibitions including the Third Extraordinary Congress of the International Association of Art Critics at Kinshasa N'Sele (1973), exhibition of avant-garde painters in Paris (1975), Festival of Basel (1978) and solo exhibitions in New York and Atlanta (1980). He participated in the National Symposium on Authenticity in September 1981 at N'Sele held by the Writers' Union of Zaire. He is a member of the National Association of Artists in Fine Arts and an associate member of AICA / Zaire. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1944 births ","title":"Lema Kusa"},{"id":"35322616","text":"Osbeckia chinensis is a plant species in the genus Osbeckia.

It was created on 15 August 1628 for Tiege MacMahon. The title is presumed to have become extinct on the death of the second Baronet sometime after 1683. ==MacMahon baronets, of Clondirrala (1628)== *Sir Tiege (or Teague) MacMahon, 1st Baronet (died ) *Sir Turlough (or Torlogh or Turlough) MacMahon, 2nd Baronet (died after 1683) James Frost's 1893 \\"History and Topography of the County of Clare\\" mentions that in August 1585 Sir John Perrott, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, required the principal gentry of Thomond to sign an Indenture which, among other things, abolished all Irish titles. Among the signatories was Teige MacMahon of Clonderalaw, chief of his name in Corcabaskin East. Teige MacMahon was allowed to hold his castle and lands of Clonderalaw free from Crown rent \\"and from all demands of the Earl of Thomond\\". Under the English policy of surrender and regrant an English title was often given to replace a surrendered Irish title. Frost says that Teige died in 1594 and was succeeded by his son, Turlogh Roe MacMahon. Frost refers to an Inquisition held in Ennis in August 1630 which found that Turlogh Roe died on 9 June 1629, leaving his eldest son, Sir Teige MacMahon, Baronet, as his heir.James Frost's 1893 \\"History and Topography of the County of Clare\\" When Sir Teige died in about 1673, his son and heir Turlough, was put under the guardianship of Honour, Lady Dowager of Kerry and Lixnaw.Grant by Letters-Patent to Honour, Lady Dowager of Kerry and Lixnaw, of the guardianship & tuition of Torlogh MacMahon, son and heir to Teague MacMahon.

Culliford was the posthumous son of Robert Culliford of Encombe, Dorset and his wife Margaret Hyde, daughter of Robert Hyde of West Hatch, Wiltshire. He came into the estate at Encombe, on the Isle of Purbeck, at birth and farmed it. During the English Civil War his actions were mainly directed at safeguarding his property and cattle as he helped the Royalists capture Wareham in 1644 but then raised a force of 250 men in 1646 to blockade the Royalist garrison of Corfe Castle. He was thereby exempted from compounding for delinquency and from the decimation tax in 1656. However he eagerly accepted a post for one of his sons at the exiled Court \\"as attendant to the young gallant there\\". History of Parliament Online - Robert Culliford In 1660, Culliford was elected Member of Parliament for Wareham for the Convention Parliament. He was J.P. for Dorset from July 1660 to June 1688 and commissioner for assessment for Dorset from August 1660 to 1663. In 1661 he was re-elected MP for Wareham for the Cavalier Parliament after a double return with his brother-in-law Robert Lawrence, who had been a commander of the Royalist forces at Corfe Castle. He was Deputy Lieutenant for the Isle of Purbeck from 1661 to about 1676. In 1662 he became a freeman of Lyme Regis and commissioner for corporations for Dorset until 1663. He was a J.P. for Poole in 1665 and commissioner for assessment for Dorset from 1666 to 1680. In 1675 he was commissioner for recusants. He was removed from the commission of the peace in June 1688 and during the Glorious Revolution he protected some Roman Catholic neighbours at Lulworth Castle when they were threatened by a mob. One of these neighbours said of the incident \\"God has been pleased to raise up a friend of almost an enemy\\" . He was reinstated J.P. for Dorset from November 1688 until his death and was a commissioner for assessment for Dorset from 1689 to 1690. Culliford died at the age of 70 and was buried at Corfe Castle on 10 February 1698. Culliford married firstly Elizabeth Lawrence, daughter of Sir Edward Lawrence of Creech Grange, Steeple, Dorset on 14 May 1638 and had six sons and five daughters. He married secondly before 10 October 1676, Jane Lawrence, widow of his brother- in-law Sir Robert Lawrence of Creech Grange and daughter of John Williams of Tyneham, Dorset.

Ground Zero organized a major week-long effort in April 1992, including activities in over 800 U.S. communities, Nightline special with worldwide hookups, and specials on the Today Show and Good Morning America. Ground Zero continued its nuclear war education programs for the next 5 years. From 1989–2012, Molander was employed as a Senior Research Scientist/Policy Analyst at the RAND Corporation, where he developed RAND's “Day After...” strategic planning exercise methodology to major national policy and strategy issues and other studies, leading teams focused on the U.S. response to nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation problems; homeland security challenges (including all aspects of chemical, biological, radiation and nuclear terrorism preparedness); the international security impact of the information technology (IT) revolution; and the terrorism threat to U.S. government continuity of operations.

These machines differ typical four-axis location - average close together, front and rear spaced and managed. In the mid-1960s in the BC plant was begun designing triaxial floating chassis with four-wheel drive. The paper used backlogs and design principles taken from ZIL, such as airborne transmission and extreme steam driven wheels. The result was the design of a family of triaxial chassis BAZ-5937 / 5938/5939 rear raztashuvannyam engine, which became the basis of machines SAM Osa and BAZ-5921 / 5922 mid-engined, which was based missile system \\"Point\\" .

It first aired on March 30, 2012 in the United States on Starz. \\"The Year of the Fin\\" was written by creator Mitch Glazer and directed by Carl Franklin. In the episode, Isaac \\"Ike\\" Evans (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), the owner of Miami's most glamorous hotel, the Miramar Playa, prepares to ring in the new year of 1959 with a concert performance from Frank Sinatra, but must first deal with unrest from his employees, who want to unionize and threaten to derail his plans. Glazer had written different versions of Magic City for years. He originally wrote and sold it to CBS, who eventually let it go to the Starz network. \\"CBS was really nice to me and generous in letting it go to Starz. It’s not a procedural, it’s not a franchise. It needs to be allowed to do the sexuality and violence and the things that were part of Miami Beach in the 1959,\\" he said. Glazer was born and raised in Miami Beach and grew up in hotels, which he bases the series on. According to the Nielsen Media Research, the episode attained over 2.5 million across multiple telecasts. == Plot == Isaac \\"Ike\\" Evans (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), the owner of Miami's most glamorous hotel, the Miramar Playa, prepares to ring in the new year of 1959 with a concert performance from Frank Sinatra, but must first deal with unrest from his employees, who want to unionize and threaten to derail his plans. Evans is forced to make an ill-fated deal with Miami mob boss Ben Diamond to ensure the success of his glitzy establishment. Meanwhile, Ike's son Stevie begins a relationship with Lily, who unknown to him at the time, is the new wife of Diamond. == Production ==  Conception  Magic City was created by Mitch Glazer, a native of Miami. Glazer wrote the series around his experiences growing up in Miami. He once worked as a cabana boy in a Miami Beach hotel and his father was an electrical engineer at the city's grand hotels in the late 1950s. He grew up listening to stories of the exploits of staff and clientele. Many of the incidents that Glazer relates in the series \\"are based on stories that happened, that I saw, or older brothers and sisters or my parents told me.\\" As a journalist, he did extensive research on what was happening in the lobbies of hotels in late 1950s and early 1960s. \\"There’s wiretaps — tapes they’ve made public now — where the CIA gives Sam Giancana and Johnny Roselli $300,000 and poison powder to kill [Fidel] Castro in the Boom Boom Room in the Fontainebleau Hotel,\\" he said. Included in the series, Glazer states, will be Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) activities in Cuba and issues connected to the Civil Rights Movement. He first envisioned \\"Magic City\\" as a feature film, but said he quickly realized he had more stories to tell than would fit in a film. Glazer had written different versions of Magic City for years. He originally wrote and sold it to CBS, who eventually let it go to the Starz network. \\"CBS was really nice to me and generous in letting it go to Starz. It’s not a procedural, it’s not a franchise. It needs to be allowed to do the sexuality and violence and the things that were part of Miami Beach in the 1959,\\" he said. In 2007, president and C.E.O. of the Starz network, Chris Albrecht was fired from HBO and joined Glazer and some of his friends for a research expedition to Havana. \\"It was an insane group,\\" Glazer remembered. \\"Jimmy Caan and Robert Duvall and Benicio Del Toro.\\" They were visiting a Havana hotel designed by the architect Morris Lapidus when Glazer remarked to Albrecht, \\"You know, I grew up in this kind of hotel. My father worked with Morris Lapidus on the Fontainebleu and Eden Roc as an electrical engineer.\\" In 2009, after Albrecht became president and C.E.O. of Starz, Glazer recalled, \\"I sent him a script I had written years before, and he called me literally hours later and said, 'This is amazing, let's do this.'\\" == Reception ==  Ratings  The premiere of Magic City averaged over 2.5 million across multiple telecasts. The multi-platform sampling campaign for the first three episodes delivered more than 1.55 million viewers, including 670,000 on-demand viewers. Its official April 6 premiere garnered 295,000 viewers.  Reviews  The pilot has received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 of reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 56 based on 27 reviews. Glenn Garvin of the Miami Herald said of the series \\"The sordid ugliness that festers inside Magic City's voluptuously beautiful wrappings makes irresistible television.\\" The Contra Costa Times' Chuck Barney praised the cast and visual style. He said in his review \\"Through the early episodes, nothing really happens that you couldn't see coming. Still, the setting is so seductive, the period details so vivid and the acting so stellar, that it's as intoxicating as a potent mojito.\\" ==References== Category:2012 American television episodes Category:American television pilots Category:Magic City (TV series) episodes ","title":"The Year of the Fin"},{"id":"35322900","text":"There have been two baronetcies created for persons with the surname Talbot, both in the Baronetage of Ireland.

The episode is written by series creator Veena Sud and is directed by Agnieszka Holland. In the episode, Sarah remains in Seattle to try to solve Rosie Larsen's case once again, after learning Holder's evidence of Darren Richmond was doctored. Belko Royce is arrested for shooting his mother and Richmond. Gwen and Jamie learn that Richmond has recovered from surgery but is paralyzed below the waist. ==Plot== After learning that Darren Richmond (Billy Campbell) has been shot, Homicide detective Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) and son Jack (Liam James) drive to the home of her boss, Lt. Michael Oakes (Garry Chalk). She tells Oakes that the tollbooth photo of Richmond the night of the murder was faked. He informs her that her partner Stephen Holder was assigned to Homicide by Gil Sloane in the county sheriff's department. She states that the sheriff's department handles bridges and tunnels. At the county records office, she gets differing stories about the bridge cameras that took the photo. When the manager calls her by name, she mentions that she never said who she was. At the county sheriff's office, Sarah asks for Gil only to learn that he has been retired for two months. She spots Gil's photo, recognizing him as Holder's Narcotics Anonymous sponsor. At an NA meeting, Sarah gets Gil's phone number from a sponsor phone list, then calls a colleague to trace it and get Gil's address. Holder (Joel Kinnaman) meanwhile continuously attempts to call Sarah, but she does not answer. At the hospital, Jamie Wright (Eric Ladin), Richmond's campaign manager, tells the press that Richmond is undergoing surgery. Alone with campaign adviser Gwen Eaton (Kristin Lehman), he wonders how the police could have arrested Richmond for the murder if he was with Gwen all night. He also asks her where she was when Richmond was arrested. She replies that she wasn’t feeling well, then admits to Jamie that, on the night Rosie died, she was not with Richmond and that the police have her statement. A surgeon (Andrew Airlie) later tells Gwen and Jamie that Richmond survived his surgery but is paralyzed from the waist down. After Holder learns that Richmond has been shot, he arrives at Belko Royce's house. Belko's mother (Patti Allan) lies dead in the bathtub. Belko had shot her before shooting Richmond. At Stan Larsen’s garage, Holder tells him that Belko, who is Stan's employee, is at police headquarters and adds that Stan’s daughter Rosie met Richmond through an escort agency. Stan (Brent Sexton) insists that the detective is wrong. Later, a police technician (Randall Edwards) gives Holder a stack of enlargements from Rosie's Super 8 mm film. A tattooed arm is reflected in Rosie's bike mirror. Gil Sloane (Brian Markinson) stops by to give Holder his new golden Homicide badge. In the police interrogation room, Stan meets with Belko (Brendan Sexton III), who tells him that he \\"did it.\\" Stan does not reply. Belko later holds a cop hostage in the hallway and then puts a gun into his own mouth and kills himself. At his house, Gil receives a reporter's phone call congratulating him on the evidence that led to Richmond's arrest. Gil hangs up and immediately erases his hard drive, which contains the toll booth photo. Outside, Linden is staking out Gil's house, and the reporter calls her to confirm that Gil has been congratulated. Gil gets into his car, and Linden follows him to the closed-down construction site for the Mayor's waterfront development project. The mayor’s campaign director Benjamin Abani (Colin Lawrence) arrives and Gil demands to know how a reporter got his phone number. In shadow, an unidentified photographer takes photos of Linden in her car. ==Reception== Critical reception \\"Reflections\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Lori Rackl of Chicago Sun-Times stated: \\"This melancholy show isn't afraid to take a break from the sleuthing action to dwell on Rosie's suffering family. It does an exquisite job portraying the crushing grief, pain and anger that can fill the vacuum left by a murder victim.\\" The Washington Posts Hank Steuver called the episode \\"solid and corrective, even stylishly penitential in the way it recomposes itself and gets on with the mystery.\\" Dorothy Rabinowitz of The Wall Street Journal reflected on the episode by saying, \\"Everything that happens—new light cast on the character of a prime suspect, old bonds of love and family sundered by the pain of loss, trust between police partners shattered—gets its due scrutiny. That too is one of the signature qualities of this crime drama and its most important one.\\" New York Magazines Matt Zoller Seitz was a reviewer who panned the episode: \\"The acting, direction, photography, editing, and sound design are so superb that you may momentarily think you're seeing a vastly improved Killing, but after a moment you'll realize that it was always aces in those departments and that the show's weakest link, the writing, hasn't improved all that much.\\" Ratings As the first of a two-part season two premiere, \\"Reflections\\" was watched by 1.80 million viewers, marking the series' fifth-lowest viewership. ==References *\\"Reflections\\" at AMC * * Category:The Killing (American TV series) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ","title":"Reflections (The Killing)"},{"id":"35322969","text":"Shorket-e Zormorgh () is a village in Khorramabad Rural District, Esfarvarin District, Takestan County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

This species lived during the early Cretaceous period in what is now northeastern China. Three fossils of Yutyrannus huali—all found in the rock beds of Liaoning Province—are currently the largest-known dinosaur specimens that preserve direct evidence of feathers. ==Discovery and naming== Fossils on display Yutyrannus huali was named and scientifically described in 2012 by Xu Xing et al. The name is derived from Mandarin Chinese yǔ (羽, \\"feather\\") and Latinised Greek tyrannos (τύραννος, \\"tyrant\\"), a reference to its classification as a feathered member of the Tyrannosauroidea. The specific name consists of the Mandarin huáli (华丽 simplified, 華麗 traditional, \\"beautiful\\"), in reference to the perceived beauty of the plumage. Yutyrannus is known from three nearly complete fossil specimens (an adult, a subadult and a juvenile) acquired from a fossil dealer who claimed all three had their provenance in a single quarry at Batu Yingzi in Liaoning Province, China. They were thus probably found in a layer of the Yixian Formation, dating from the Aptian, approximately 125 million years old. The specimens had been cut into pieces about the size of bath mats, which could be carried by two people. (with illustrations) The holotype, ZCDM V5000, is the largest specimen, consisting of a nearly complete skeleton with skull, compressed on a slab, of an adult individual. The paratypes are the two other specimens: ZCDM V5001 consisting of a skeleton of a smaller individual and part of the same slab as the holotype; and ELDM V1001, a juvenile estimated to have been eight years younger than the holotype. The fossils are part of the collections of the Zhucheng Dinosaur Museum and the Erlianhaote Dinosaur Museum but have been prepared by the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, under the guidance of Xu. ==Description== Size compared to a human Yutyrannus were large bipedal predators. The holotype and oldest-known specimen has an estimated length of and an estimated weight of about . In 2016, Gregory S. Paul gave lower estimations of and .Paul, G.S., 2016, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs 2nd edition, Princeton University Press p. 106 Its skull has an estimated length of . The skulls of the paratypes are and long and their weights have been estimated at and , respectively. The describers established some diagnostic traits of Yutyrannus, in which it differs from its direct relatives. The snout features a high midline crest, formed by the nasals and the premaxillae and which is covered by large pneumatic recesses. The postorbital bone has a small secondary process, jutting into the upper hind corner of the eye socket. The outer side of the main body of the postorbital is hollowed out. In the lower jaw, the external mandibular fenestra, the main opening in the outer side, is mainly located in the surangular. According to a 2018 study, Yutyrannus had a simple hyoid structure, indicating it had a flat tongue, like a crocodile. Based on hyoid bone comparisons between living and extinct archosaurs, it was determined that all archosaurs would have had fixed tongues, with the exception of birds, pterosaurs and certain ornithischians. Feathers Artist's restoration based on ELDM V1001 The described specimens of Yutyrannus contain direct evidence of feathers in the form of fossil imprints. The feathers were long, up to , and filamentous. Because the quality of the preservation was low, it could not be established whether the filaments were simple or compound, broad or narrow. The feathers covered various parts of the body. With the holotype they were present on the pelvis and near the foot. Specimen ZCDM V5000 had feathers on the tail pointing backwards under an angle of 30 degrees with the tail axis. The smallest specimen showed filaments on the neck and feathers at the upper arm. While it has been known since 2004, upon the description of Dilong, that at least some tyrannosauroids possessed filamentous \\"stage 1\\" feathers, according to the feather typology of Richard Prum, Y. huali is currently the largest-known species of dinosaur with direct evidence of feathers, forty times heavier than the previous record holder, Beipiaosaurus. Tail fragment with feather traces Based on the distribution of the feathers, they may have covered the whole body and served in regulating temperature, given the rather cold climate of the Yixian with an average annual temperature of . Alternatively, if they were restricted to the regions in which they were found, they may have served as display structures. In addition, the two adult specimens had distinctive, \\"wavy\\" crests on their snouts, on both sides of a high central crest, which were probably used for display. The presence of feathers on a large basal tyrannosauroid suggests the possibility that later tyrannosaurids were also feathered, even when adult, despite their size. However, scaly skin impressions have been reported from various Late Cretaceous tyrannosaurids (such as Gorgosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus) on parts of the body where Yutyrannus was feathered. Since there is no positive evidence for plumage in tyrannosaurids, some researchers have suggested they may have evolved scales secondarily.Switek, B. 2013. Palaeontology: The truth about T. rex. Nature News, 23 October 2013. If scaly skin was the dominant epidermal trait of later genera, then the extent and nature of the integumentary covering may have changed over time in response to body size, a warmer climate, or other factors. ==Classification== To date, all phylogenetic analyses of Yutyrannus relationships have classified it in the group Tyrannosauroidea. An initial analysis of its relationship to other tyrannosauroids showed that it was more primitive than Eotyrannus in the evolutionary tree, but more advanced than tyrannosauroids such as Dilong, Guanlong and Sinotyrannus. Primitive traits relative to advanced tyrannosaurs included long forelimbs with three fingers and a short foot which was not specialized for running. Advanced traits included a large and deep skull, the outer side of the premaxilla having rotated upwards, a large cuneiform horn on the lacrimal in front of the eye socket, a postorbital process on the back rim of the eye socket, the squamosal and the quadratojugal forming a large process on the back rim of the infratemporal fenestra, short dorsal vertebrae, an ilium with a straight upper rim and an appending lobe, a large pubic foot and a slender ischium. Close-up of snout In 2016, a phylogenetic analysis conducted by Thomas Carr and Stephen Brusatte re-examined the evolutionary relationships of the Tyrannosauroidea. Their analysis found Yutyrannus to be more basal than Dilong, placing it within the family Proceratosauridae.Brusatte, S.L. and Carr, T.D. 2016. The phylogeny and evolutionary history of tyrannosauroid dinosaurs. Scientific Reports, 6(20252). Their cladogram is shown below: ==Paleobiology== Skull of the juvenile specimen ELDM V1001 The knowledge of specimens representing various different ages has allowed paleontologists to determine the ontogeny, or change during growth, of this species. During growth the lower legs, feet, ilia and forelimbs became relatively smaller. The skull, on the other hand, grew more robust and deeper. ==Paleoecology== Illustration showing a pack of Yutyrannus hunting Dongbeititan Because the three known individuals of Yutyrannus were allegedly found together, some paleontologists, including Xu Xing, have interpreted the animal as a pack hunter. Based on the presence of sauropod material in the quarry in which the three specimens were found, Xu has further speculated that Yutyrannus may have hunted sauropods, and that the three known individuals may have died while doing so. In addition, other sauropod hunting theropods such as Mapusaurus are known to have exhibited pack hunting behaviour. The true cause of their death, however, remains unknown. If Yutyrannus did prey on sauropods, it would have been one of two predatory animals known from the Yixian formation capable of doing so, the other being an as-of-yet undescribed large theropod known from a tooth embedded in the rib of a Dongbeititan.Xing L., Bell, P.R., Currie, P.J., Shibata M., Tseng K. & Dong Z. (2012). \\"A sauropod rib with an embedded theropod tooth: direct evidence for feeding behaviour in the Jehol group, China.\\" Lethaia, (advance online publication). . Because the locality of Yutyrannus is uncertain, it is unknown what fauna it coexisted with. Age estimates point towards Yutyrannus originating from the Lujiatun or the Jianshangou beds of the Yixian, meaning it would have been contemporaneous of such dinosaurs as Psittacosaurus, Dongbeititan, Sinosauropteryx, and Caudipteryx. Fish such as Lycoptera would also have been prevalent. Volcanic eruptions and forest fires appear to have been common in the Yixian, and the environment would have been littered with bodies of water and coniferous plants. The environment would have been comparable to the modern day temperate rainforests of British Columbia, and would have experienced significant seasonal changes in temperature. ==See also== * Timeline of tyrannosaur research ==References *T. rex relative is biggest ever feathered animal, from BBC News Category:Early Cretaceous dinosaurs of Asia Category:Feathered dinosaurs Category:Fossil taxa described in 2012 Category:Proceratosaurids Category:Taxa named by Xu Xing Category:Yixian fauna ","title":"Yutyrannus"},{"id":"35323073","text":" Meyer's Little Toot is a homebuilt biplane that was designed by George W. Meyer (1916–1982) of Corpus Christi, Texas. ==Design and development== Design of the original Little Toot was started by George Meyer in 1952. Along with drawings, a scale model was built of the aircraft during the design phase. It was designed with aerobatics in mind and is stressed for 10g+/- loads. The Little Toot is a single seat, open cockpit, biplane with conventional landing gear. Its design accommodates an optional cockpit canopy. The fuselage is welded steel tubing aluminum covering. The original tail section is a metal monocoque truss section from a Luscome 8A. The wings use spruce spars with wooden ribs and are fabric covered. The upper wing is swept back eight degrees. The lower wing has 2.5 degrees of dihedral with nearly full-length ailerons. The landing gear and wheel pants were sourced from a Cessna 140 tail-dragger. The production cost of the original Little Toot aircraft was 2,000 in 1958. The aircraft was named Little Toot after the tugboat that liked doing figure eights in a Disney movie, itself based on a children's story written and illustrated by Hardie Gramatky. ==Operational history== A Little Toot on display at the Frontiers of Flight Museum The Little Toot prototype was first displayed at the 1957 Experimental Aircraft Association convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. At this event, Little Toot, N61G, won the Mechanix Illustrated Trophy for Outstanding Achievement, First Place and Second Place for Outstanding Design.

Tarzan, in response, taunts and teases Tublat from a safe distance. Ultimately, when Tarzan has reached his early teens, Tublat goes mad and attacks Kala. To protect Kala Tarzan fights and kills Tublat.Tarzan of the Apes (1912 novel). Tublat also appears in Jungle Tales of Tarzan, the sixth book of the Tarzan series, which relates episodes from the ape man's youth omitted from Tarzan of the Apes. Chapter 7, \\"The End of Bukawai\\", relates episodes in which Tarzan taunts Tublat with his rope and is later almost killed when he swings so long on the rope that it frays and parts, dropping him to the ground. Tublat is glad to see Tarzan injured, though Kala runs to the boy's aid and he soon revives.Jungle Tales of Tarzan (1919 novel) ==Other versions== The character of Tublat has also appeared in the syndicated comic strip Tarzan and in Tarzan comic books, in a portrayal essentially faithful to Burroughs's conception, generally in adaptations of the original novel. In the 1984 movie Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes Tublat is reimagined as Silverbeard, with a similarly conflicted relationship with his human foster child. Silverbeard is captured and taken to England as a live specimen, where he is later re-encountered by Tarzan. They have a poignant reunion, and Tarzan helps him escape. When Silverbeard is shot soon after, Tarzan is inconsolable. In the 1999 Disney cartoon feature Tarzan, the Mangani are re-envisioned as gorillas, and Tublat's role as mate of Kala and foster father to Tarzan is assigned to Kerchak. The film's Kerchak is essentially a combination of the Kerchak and Tublat of the novel, though with a more benign personality than either. However, in the spin-off television series The Legend of Tarzan, Tublat himself appears as a separate and distinct character, and is one of the main antagonists in the series along with La and Samuel T. Philander, voiced by Keith David. This version of Tublat is a violently aggressive, possibly even carnivorous, former member of the gorilla tribe. Having been cast out of the band many years before after losing a leadership challenge to Kerchak, he seeks revenge against Tarzan, Kerchak's successor. In the episode \\"Tarzan and the Enemy Within\\", Tublat takes over another gorilla family, that of Gobu, killing the group's original leader and banishing the latter into the jungle where he is almost killed by hyenas. Tarzan rescues Gobu, whose family then retaliates against Tublat. In the episode, Tublat is voiced by Keith David and allied with Fungi the monkey, voiced by Max Casella. In the 2013 computer-animated film Tarzan, Tublat is a rogue gorilla who challenges Kerchak, silverback leader of a gorilla troop. Kerchak defeats him, but immediately afterwards Tublat treacherously brains the victor with a rock and takes over the troop. Kala later adopts the young Tarzan to take the place of her deceased child; the growing boy's relationship with Tublat is essentially the same as in Burroughs's original novel. Tarzan grows up to eventually challenge and exile Tublat, thus avenging Kerchak. ==Notes== Category:Tarzan characters Category:Fictional apes Category:Fictional gorillas Category:Fictional murderers ","title":"Tublat"},{"id":"35323192","text":"The Palace of the Goyeneche (Spanish: Palacio de los Goyeneche) is a baroque palace located in Illana, Spain.

He was the grandson of Count Adolph III (d. 1431), who had founded the elder Waldeck- Landau line in 1387 and was the third and only surviving son of Count Otto III (d. 1458 or 1459) and his wife Anna of Oldenburg. His elder brothers John and Henry had died unmarried and childless in 1431 and 1438 respectively.Landau: Geschichte Hessens, p. 210. == Life == Otto resided at Landau Castle in the town of Landau, which is now part of Arolsen. During his reign, he fought a number of armend conflicts. He supported Landgrave Louis II of Hesse during his punitive campaigns against the Hanseatic city of Einbeck in 1461 and 1479Franziskus Lubecus, Reinhard Vogelsang: Göttinger Annalen: von den Anfängen bis zum Jahr 1588, 1994, p. 221 and against the city of Volkmarsen in 1476. From 1464 to 1461, Otto fought on the side of Hesse in the Hesse- Paderborn Feud against bishop Simon III of Paderborn. In 1469, the bishop's brother Bernard VII of Lippe invaded Waldeck. In 1474, a new conflict with Simon III erupted. Troops from Padernborn had devastated Waldeck and in retaliation, Otto took the town of Lichtenau, looted it and took a number of prisoners. Simon III again called in the help of his brother Bernard VII, who marched into Waldeck and besieged the town of Mengeringhausen. Noblemen in Bernard's camp included Count John I of Rietberg and Counts of Hoya, Schaumburg and Diepholz. Otto marched his army to Mengeringhausen to relieve the town. However, his cousin Wolrad I visited Bernard VII in the enemy camp and negotiated a settlement. The siege was lifted and the feud ended. In the same year 1475, Otto IV found himself in a feud against John I of Rietberg and his allies, who invaded Waldeck and captured the small town of Rhoden (now part of Diemelstadt) and took away prisoners and cattle. Otto IV allied himself with the town of Korbach and on Whit Monday 1476, he attacked Erwitte and neighbouring villages and returned home with considerable spoils. In 1482, Otto IV fought a feud against John, Gottschalk and Henry of Harthausen and the Westpahlian allies, and a separate feud against Stephen of Malsburg. In 1484, he fought a feud against Philip of Urff and Eberhard Schenk of Schweinsberg. Otto IV reformed the monasteries in his territories to stop their moral decay: * Between 1461 and 1469, he pushed through a fundamental reform of the monastery at Volkhardinghausen. In 1465, he handed it to the Canons Regular and affiliated it to the Congregation of Windesheim. Canons Regular moved in from Möllenbeck Abbey, which had been reformed itself shortly before. Under their leadership, the monastery experienced a new heyday. * In 1487, Otto IV and his relatives Philip II and Henry VI invited, with papal approval, Franciscan Observants to establish a new monastery at Korbach. * In 1492, he gave Aroldessen Abbey to Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony in Grünberg, which led to a rapid growth of the abbey. == Death == Otto IV died on 14 October 1495 at Wetterburg Castle in Arolsen. He was buried in the chapel of the monastery at Volkhardinghausen (now part of Bad Arolsen). Since he had no sons, the elder Waldeck-Landau line died out with his death. Waldeck-Landau was divided between the two surviving lines, Philip II of Waldeck-Waldeck and Henry VIII of Waldeck-Wildungen. Moreover, Otto had put out money, with Schöneburg Castle and the district of Hofgeismar as securities. If this mortgage was repaid, the money would go to Philip II and he was then required by Otto's will to use it to redeem the mortgage on the village of Ehringen (now part of Volkmarsen). In his will, Otto IV bequeathed 100 gold guilders to the monastery in Volkhardinghausen, another 100 gold guilders for the construction of a church in the monastery at Korbach, 25 guilders to his Chancellor, Volmar Lösten, 300 guilder to his illegitimate son Arndt and 80 guilders to Arndt's mother, Anna of Hohenfeld. His widow, Elisabeth, received Wetterburg Castle as her widow seat. == Marriage and issue == On 17 January 1464, Otto married Matilda of Neuenahr. However, she died the following year. In 1465, he married his second wife, Elisabeth of Tekclenburg (d. 1499). With her, he had a daughter Eva (1466–1489), who was engaged to Bernard of Lippe, but died of the plague before she could marry. Eva was interred in Aroldessen Abbey. Otto IV had an illegitimate son, Arndt, with Anna of Hohenfeld. In his will, he bequeathed Arndt 300 gold guilders. == References == * Gerhard Menk: Waldecks Beitrag für das heutige Hessen, 2nd ed., Wiesbaden, 2001, == External links == * Johann Adolph Theodor Ludwig Varnhagen: Grundlage der Waldeckischen Landes- und Regentengeschichte, vol. 2, Speyer’sche Buchhandlung, Arolsen, 1853, p. 10–17 == Footnotes == Category:Counts of Waldeck Category:1440s births Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1494 deaths Category:15th- century German people ","title":"Otto IV, Count of Waldeck"},{"id":"35323213","text":"Harvey R.

Since 1993 he is principal timpanist and percussionist of the Badische Philharmonie Pforzheim. ==Biography== At the age of twenty, Haerdtner started his musical education at the Badisches Konservatorium in Karlsruhe. With the beginning of his studies at the Robert-Schumann-Hochschule Düsseldorf (1985–92), he concentrated on independent-minded interpretations of demanding concert literature (e.g. the Concerto pour Marimba, Vibraphone et Orchestre, op.278 by Darius Milhaud) and on the arrangement of western cultural sphere’s music for his instruments. Up to now he doesn’t commit himself neither to single epochs in concert literature nor to specific stylistic ways of play. Besides his work as an orchestra musician, he has established himself in the concert business as a soloist for the mallet instruments marimba, vibraphone and xylophone since the 1980s. Meanwhile, his repertoire with hundreds of works, especially in the field of the mallet arrangements, is considered as worldwide unique [1]. The discography of Roland Haerdtner documents this with twelve CD-productions so far, on which he can be heard as a soloist. His repertoire includes various musical styles such as world music as well as pop music and jazz on the one hand, and is leading within classical music from baroque through romanticism up to the contemporary music, on the other hand. On these records he has worked together with the internationally well- respected djembe player Amadou Kienou from Burkina Faso, the Baden-Badener Philharmonie, the Württembergische Philharmonie Reutlingen, the Südwestdeutsches Kammerorchester and the Badische Philharmonie Pforzheim, to name but a few. Besides others, these CDs were created in cooperation with the major label EMI as well as various record labels (e.g. Virgin Classics, ebs, RBM) and broadcasting companies like the SDR - Stuttgart and the SWR Baden- Baden. At the turn of the millennium, a main focus of his present work was the involvement with Johann Sebastian Bach’s musical works with arrangements of more than 40 compositions of the past master. Haerdtner shows on his CD Badinerie from 2000 a high rate of faithfulness to the text in his interpretations. To contrast with this, the jazz arrangements of his quartet Swinging Mallets from the CD AIRevolution (published in 2001) are merely guided, besides some quotations, by the harmonic framework of Bach’s reference. Haerdtner’s arrangement of the Concerto for Violin and Orchestra No.1 by Philip Glass for marimba and vibraphone, which he published with the permission of the composer and his publisher Dunvagen Music Publishers for the 2010 CD Virtuos Mallets, received international attention. Besides arrangements for his instruments, Roland Haerdtner also does recordings originally composed for the mallets which can be considered as a kind of a reference, due to a close cooperation with the composer. An example for this can be the most successful - measured on the number of its presentations - marimba concert of concert literature Concerto for Marimba and String Orchestra No.1 by the Brazilian Ney Rosauro, composed in 1986 [2], which was also recorded for the CD Virtuos Mallets by Haerdtner and is described as “One of the best performances from my concerto that I ever heard.” by the composer himself [1,3]. ==Recorded CDs== Roland Haerdtner on Marimba * 1994 Swinging Mallets with Holger Engel (p), Klaus Dusek (b), Georg Schmid (dr) * 1996 Swinging Mallets II with Swinging Mallets Trio, Nebojša Jovan Živković, u.a. * 1997 Solo Mallets * 1998 Classic Mallets with Badische Philharmonie Pforzheim, Jari Hämäläinen (Conductor)/ Süddeutscher Rundfunk (SDR - Stuttgart) * 2000 Badinerie / Classic Mallets play Bach with Südwestdeutsches Kammerorchester Pforzheim, Rolf Schweizer (Conductor) * 2001 AIRevolution / Swinging Mallets play Bach with Boris Ritter (p), Klaus Dusek (b), Lars Binder (dr) * 2002 Teufelstanz with Baden-Badener Philharmonie, Werner Stiefel (Conductor) * 2005 Percussion Mallets with Amadou Kienou, u.a. * 2006 Mallets Mozartissimo with Badische Philharmonie Pforzheim, Jari Hämäläinen (Conductor) / Südwestrundfunk (SWR - Baden-Baden) * 2007 Entertain Mallets with Boris Ritter (p), Klaus Dusek (b), Eckhard Stromer (dr) * 2008 Mallets for Kids with Boris Ritter (p), Klaus Dusek (b), Eckhard Stromer (dr) * 2010 Virtuos Mallets with Württembergische Philharmonie Reutlingen, Jari Hämäläinen (Conductor), Markus Huber (Conductor), Rolf Schweizer (Conductor) ==References== 1\\\\.

This temple was built in the 12th century AD around the same time as the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura, Mysore district. Map showing the temple and the original site == Original location == Before the Krishna Raja Sagara dam project was conceived by Sir M.Visvesvaraya in 1909, the temple complex was located in the village of Kannambadi. The KRS Dam project meant that Kannambadi and other surrounding settlements would be submerged. The then king of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV ordered the construction of a new village for the residents of Kannambadi and aptly named it Hosa Kannambadi (New Kannambadi). However, the Venugopala Swamy temple complex and 2 other temples namely Kenneshwara (Ishwara) temple and Kalamma (A local deity) temple had to be abandoned. By 1930, the first phase of the dam was completed and all three temples were submerged. The main idol of Venugopalaswamy, Lord Krishna playing on flute as a cow-herd, was shifted to a new temple in the rehabilitated village before the submersion. == Architecture == The temple complex at its relocated site The original temple complex was massive, with an area of around . The complex was a symmetrical building enclosed by two 'prakaras' and the outer gate (Mahadwara) had verandahs on both sides, flanked by the yagasala and the kitchen. This was enclosed by the second mahadwara, which led to the inner enclosure and was akin to the Somanathapura temple. The temple had a garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum), a vestibule, a middle hall and a mukhya mantapa (main hall). The cell opposite to the entrance had a figure of Kesava (Lord Krishna) and the south cell, containing the figure of Gopalakrishna, was a later addition == Submersion and restoration == When the KRS dam was conceived in 1909, the temple was condemned for submersion. By 1930, the entire erstwhile village of Kannambadi was completely buried underwater. However, the temple would resurface whenever the water levels in the reservoir dropped, typically during drought years. This was most evident around the year 2000. For more than 70 years the temple lay underwater, when the Khoday Foundation under the guidance of liquor baron and philanthropist Mr. Sri Hari Khoday took up the task of relocating and restoring the temple. It was initially planned to shift the entire complex to Madhuvana Park in Mysore. However, protests from the villagers of Hosa Kannambadi convinced the foundation to shift it to a place near the rehabilitated village. The cost of the project was estimated to be around 2.5 crore. The new site is about one km to the north of the original site; the backwaters would touch the outer walls of the temple if the water level of the KRS touched 124.80 ft, its maximum capacity. It is 9 km by road from Brindavan Gardens. The in-house architects of the group had shot the original temple on video, taken over 16,000 photographs, and marked each and every slab used in the construction of the original temple. Each and every temple stone was removed and reconstructed at Hosa Kannambadi with trained artisans and sculptors, with half a dozen experts from Tamil Nadu also involved in the reconstruction. As of December 2011, the temple restoration has been completed, but is awaiting an official inauguration. It however has become a tourist hotspot considering its tale of submersion and relocation. == Gallery == File:Venugopalaswamy temple inscription.jpgAn inscription written in halegannada seen at the entrance File:Outer wall of the Venugopalaswamy temple.jpgOuter wall of the Venugopalaswamy temple File:Venugopalaswamy temple East.jpgEntrance to the complex from the East File:Venugopalaswamy temple East side.jpgA View of the KRS reservoir from the temple entrance File:Deepa Sthambha.jpgDeepa Sthambha (Lamp Post) used to light up the entrance at night File:Structure of the Venugopalaswamy temple.jpgTypical Hoysala architecture of the Venugopalaswamy temple File:Venugopalaswamy temple Gopura.jpgVenugopalaswamy temple Gopura File:Venu Gopala Swamy Temple.jpgVenu Gopala Swamy Temple from the front File:Venugopala swamy temple front.jpgVenu Gopala Swamy Temple from the front File:Sunset overlooking KRS.jpgSunset overlooking Krishna Raja Sagara as seen from the Venugopala Swamy temple == References  External links == Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 13th century Category:Submerged places ","title":"Venugopala Swamy Temple"},{"id":"35323284","text":"The Palace of Antonio de Mendoza (Spanish: Palacio de Antonio de Mendoza) is a palace located in Guadalajara, Spain.

The Moors first took the castle until it surrendered briefly to Alfonso III of Asturias from 870 to 874 before it was retaken. In 967, it came under the control of Al-Hakam II before being taken once again by the Christians under García Fernández of Castile until the arrival of Almanzor at the end of the 10th century. In the 11th century, it became an important component of the Muslim defences along the River Duero. After being taken by the Christian troops of Alfonso VI in 1085, it was enlarged on several occasions, maintaining its importance. Under John II, the Navarre troops occupied the castle with 250 horsemen, 500 foot soldiers and artillery. After the castle had lost its strategic importance it became a prison. It was sacked by the French during the War of Independence. ==Description== Today the castle consists of a tower and an inner enclosure 130 m by 30 m.

Gallagher (February 26, 1923 – September 28, 1975) was an American photographer who won the 1953 Pulitzer Prize for Photography for his photograph of presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson II. Gallagher was a photographer for 27 years with the Flint Journal in Flint, Michigan. Adlai Stevenson Gallagher was born in Hiawatha, Kansas. In 1936 he moved to Flint and graduated from St. Matthew's High School in 1943. During World War II he served in the United States Army in the signal corps, medical corps, and air corps. Gallagher earned his first camera while in high school by selling magazines. He began his professional photography career with the Sporting Digest in Flint in 1946. The following year he moved to the Flint Journal and within a few months became a staff photographer, a position he would hold until his death. Gallagher's colleagues described him as \\"a boisterous, flamboyant character\\" who had good relationships with local police and government officials. He was fond of pranks, once lighting a cherry bomb inside the police department and watching the officers scramble, while another time he commandeered a police helicopter while covering a story. Gallagher snapped his Pulitzer-winning photo at a Labor Day rally in Flint Park. Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson was seated on a platform with Michigan Governor G. Mennen Williams. Gallagher, kneeling at the base of the platform, took a photo of Stevenson seated with his legs crossed, which revealed a hole in the bottom of his right shoe. Because of Gallagher's position, he had to take this photo without looking through the shutter first. Gallagher didn't take the photo seriously and didn't think the Journal would publish it since they endorsed Stevenson's Republican opponent Dwight D. Eisenhower, so he gave it to his editor saying \\"I just finished this for the hell of it. I don't suppose a Republican paper would want to use it.\\" However, the Journal ran the photo on the front page. The New York Times wrote that Gallagher's photo was \\"one of the outstanding pictures of the campaign\\", perhaps because it contrasted with Stevenson's serious, patrician image. Stevenson was sent an \\"avalanche\\" of shoes by people who saw the image and when Gallagher won the Pulitzer Stevenson sent him a telegram reading \\"Glad to hear you won with a hole in one.\\" Gallagher died of meningitis at age 52. ==References== Category:1923 births Category:1975 deaths Category:American photojournalists Category:Pulitzer Prize for Photography winners Category:United States Army personnel Category:People from Hiawatha, Kansas Category:People from Flint, Michigan Category:Deaths from meningitis ","title":"William M.

Their line-up consisted of vocalist and rhythm guitarist Laurence Beveridge, vocalist and rhythm guitarist Kier Kemp, bassist Drew Woolnough, lead guitarist Cyrus Barrone (Shane Sumner) and drummer Luke Illingworth (Pilnahn). The name of the band originated from the 1967 Roman Polanski comedy horror film The Fearless Vampire Killers. Kier Kemp: \\"Laurence and Shane were in our tiny flat in London talking into the early hours. They were discussing what a band should be, why it should be and what inspired them. Laurence scrawled the name of a film he’d watched extensively as a child onto a piece of paper... (which we still have). That film was The Fearless Vampire Killers by Roman Polanski.\\" Their debut studio album Militia of the Lost was set for release on 7 May 2012 through Goremount Records, but the physical release was pushed back to 14 May 2012. The digital release went ahead as planned. A deluxe version of the CD, containing more exclusive artwork, was released at the same time. In 2014, they were an opening act for Black Veil Brides' tour. They released their new 'mini-album', Bruises in 2015. The band announced their breakup on July 4, 2016 in a Facebook post, due to Kier Kemp's decision to leave. == Biography == The band's first incarnation was under the name of Remember When back in 2007, consisting of now past members: Laurence Beveridge, Kier Kemp and Shane Sumner as well as their previous drummer Luke Fairhead. Laurence Beveridge: \\"Drew and I were in a weird Weezer/Kinks/Muse band called Self-Titled and Kier and Shane were in a Punk-Rock band called Korze4Koncern, (being from East Anglia they couldn't spell.) After playing anywhere that would have us for two years, I joined K4K when their guitarist left and we changed our name to Remember When.\\" All of the members of Remember When knew each other from growing up in Waveney Valley in Suffolk. Soon after moving to London, Remember When broke up and its former members then came together as FVK in 2008. A short time later they recruited Drew Woolnough, who had previously played with Laurence in a band called Self-Titled, to play bass, and after going through a series of drummers the current line-up was completed in 2011 when Luke Illingworth joined as their final drummer before the split. The band were known for being very hands-on with their work, \\"FVK pay close attention to every detail outside of their music too: From their clothing and make up to the artwork and even their own comic books. Every sketch, painting, and cartoon is created by the band themselves. Right down to printing their own merchandise, everything is a personal hand made artefact.\\" with Shane Sumner producing all of their artwork and merchandise designs. Additionally, Laurence Beveridge wrote a 334-page novel called Ruple & Evelyn to go along with their EP, In Grandomina..., although the events in the story happen roughly 600 years before the events in the songs. Laurence Beveridge: \\"The novel documents the beginnings of the world our songs are set with in. For instance, the cardinal mentioned in \\"Palace in Flames\\" is not the cardinal in the book. Our songs are set like 600-ish years after the novel.\\" Parts of their look, especially Shane Sumner's stage outfit, were influenced by steampunk as well as \\"turn-of-the- century France, late-1800s bohemian ideas, short waistcoats [and] a bit of the old eyeliner\\" according to past vocalist Kier Kemp. Their debut album, Militia of the Lost, was described as a concept record by vocalist Laurence Beveridge; it features themes of \\"love, loss and addiction\\" as well as being \\"an album about the struggle to find a place in society.\\" The songs in the album are about \\"the events in the lead up to, and subsequently the repercussions, of the city’s royal palace being set on fire\\" and \\"five men [that] cross paths and get dragged into this world of monsters and crazed revolutionaries.\\" They recorded their second album in the summer of 2013 with William Control as the producer. The band announced their breakup on July 4, 2016, via a facebook post, due to Kier deciding to leave. The stated in the post that they had \\"come to the conclusion that it would be wrong to continue this band without Kier by our side.\\" They have stated that they will continue to create music (although \\"the specifics are uncertain\\") and The Obsidian Bond will remain active as a place to maintain the community that it had created. ==Musical style and influences== They cite influences such as David Bowie, Queen, Green Day, Cyrus Barrone: \\"However I’d say communally the biggest contributor to our musical bucket would be Green Day.\\" Weezer, Danny Elfman, Iron Maiden, Avenged Sevenfold, Metallica and The Kinks. Drew Woolnough: \\"Death Pop is our tongue cheek name to describe it, and I like to think of it as Danny Elfman turned up to 11.\\" A review by Rock Sound of their first EP, In Grandomina, described the tracks as \\"gothically inclined pop-rock songs\\" that \\"boast some decent hooks, with a new romantic sensibility spliced into the mix in a weirdly effective fashion.\\" Reaction to their second EP, ... The Blood Never Dries, was mixed, with most reviewers offering a score of 3/5 or similar.

Once a track had been online for a week, it was taken down the following Thursday and replaced with the next track on the album. As the weeks went by, the fans were also given a story to go along with the track. The story explained the backstory of the song as well as expanded on the album's concept. ==Discography== Albums * Bruises (2015) * Unbreakable Hearts (2014) * Militia of the Lost (2012)  EPs  * In Grandomina...

The book was published in the United Kingdom by Vintage and in the United States by Viking. The story is a retelling of William Shakespeare's Hamlet, and thus an example of intertextuality. ==Plot summary== The Dead Fathers Club follows the character of 11-year-old Phillip as he is visited by his father Brian's ghost. His father states that he was murdered by his brother Alan and that Phillip must avenge his murder and prevent Alan from taking over the family pub and marrying his widow. Phillip is given three months to avenge his father via the murder of his uncle Alan, lest his father fall prey to the Terrors (the supposed fate for ghosts of murder victims whose deaths are not avenged). Phillip is encouraged by his deceased father to steal a mini-bus to supposedly prevent Alan from breaking into the pub and is shown several chemicals that could potentially kill his father's murderer. During this time Phillip is assigned to therapy sessions and begins a relationship with Leah, the daughter of a business partner in the garage Alan works at, which Brian does not approve of. Phillip eventually tries to murder Alan using the chemicals, but he is forced to abandon his first two attempts. In the third attempt, which involves setting fire to his uncle's car garage, Phillip accidentally causes the death of Leah's father. Phillip's conscience eventually leads him to attempt to confess the arson to Leah, who is depressed and slightly delusional at this point. When attempting to confess, Phillip sees the ghost of Leah's father, who attempts to pressure Phillip and make him feel guilty for his acts. Phillip then attempts to confess to Leah's brother Dane, who pulls a knife on Phillip but does not hurt him and instead tells Phillip not to tell Leah about the arson. Leah later goes missing and Phillip seeks the assistance of other ghosts to find her. Leah is discovered as she is preparing to jump off a bridge, the words \\"dead and gone\\" written on her arms in blood. Despite Phillip’s pleas, she jumps and Phillip jumps in after her in an attempt to rescue her. The pair are swept along the water, but are pulled out by Alan and one of his coworkers. Phillip is taken to the hospital where he discovers a news article that suggests that his father's ghost was lying. Phillip's father is still visible and still attempts to persuade Phillip to murder Alan, who chooses not to listen to his father. Alan eventually dies due to injuries sustained from Phillip's rescue, but it is left unclear as to whether Brian's ghost was saved from the terrors or was simply a figment of Phillip’s imagination. ==Characters== * Phillip The protagonist, Phillip, is assigned to the task of avenging his father’s murder by murdering his Uncle.

The assault on Silva was video recorded by multiple witnesses, although the resultant video was seized by law enforcement on the scene. Silva's autopsy report uses the description \\"acute intoxication\\" to describe Silva's condition when he died. His blood alcohol level was 0.095, over the limit for driving a motor vehicle. The autopsy also found methamphetamine and amphetamine, both stimulants, in Silva's blood. https://www.bakersfield.com/archives/autopsy- answers-many----but-not-all-/article_42e197f3-2d7b-582e-a2d3-a61897eb5871.html In December 2015, press reports indicated Kern County law enforcement officers killed more people per capita than any other county in the United States. In May 2015, it was reported that the Kern Country Sheriff's Department settled two civil lawsuits in five days in misconduct cases. One settlement, reported to be in the amount of $1 million, was paid out to a survivor of a sexual assault committed by Kern County Sheriff's Deputy Gabriel Lopez. The Kern County Sheriff's office has been found to have a longstanding program of attempting cash payoffs to women who have accused deputies of sexual assault. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/09/kern-county-california-deputy- sexual-assault-settlement On May 29, 2019, Chief Deputy Justin Fleeman was fired after having been placed on administrative leave on September 20, 2018. Fleeman unsuccessfully contested Sheriff Donny Youngblood in the June 2018 primary election. Fleeman's campaign made a point to expose corruption and ethics violations by Sheriff Youngblood and the Kern County Sheriff's Office. Youngblood in turn criticized Fleeman for attempting to ruin his reputation and the reputation of the department. In response to his firing, Fleeman filed a wrongful termination lawsuit which he hopes will unfold in court and result in \\"people seeing I was actually truthful during the campaign.\\" ==Weapons== Deputies are allowed to carry the Glock 22 .40 S&W; handgun which is usually equipped with a tactical flashlight and has night sights.

The students are quietly listening to their teacher's explanation during a school museum excursion. Various codes of etiquette in Indonesia govern the expectations of social behavior in the country and are considered very important. Etiquette demonstrates respect and is a key factor in social interactions. Like many social cultures, etiquette varies greatly depending on one's status relative to the person in question. Some conventions may be region-pecific, and thus may not exist in all regions of Indonesia. The following are generally accepted contemporary customs in Indonesia. ==Cultural overview== Indonesia is a vast tropical country of sprawling archipelago with extremely diverse culture and demographic make-up with over 300 ethnic groups,Kuoni - Far East, A world of difference. Page 88. Published 1999 by Kuoni Travel & JPM Publications and speaking more than 700 living languages. Indonesia has the largest Muslim population in the world. Indonesia also has considerably significant numbers of Christian Protestant and Catholics population, also Hindu that mostly inhabit the island of Bali, and Buddhist that are mostly Chinese Indonesians. In some remote areas, tribal animism still survives. Each of these Indonesian ethnic groups has its own culture and tradition and may speak their own mother language. Each of them may adhere to different religions that have their own rules and customs. These combinations made Indonesia a complex mixture of traditions that may differ from one place to another. Some ethnic groups such as the Javanese have a complex set of etiquette behaviors and are rather constrained in expressing their true feelings, while others, such as Batak and Betawi people, are more open and straightforward. Nevertheless, there are some similarities and common traits that can be used as a guide to interact with Indonesians. It is widely felt however, that the highly refined social behaviour of the Javanese as the majority — more or less — sets the social standards throughout the country. ==Common values and practices== Smile Most Indonesians initiate social contact with a smile, it is a sign that you are approachable, such as shown here by military personnel in Aceh. Indonesians smile a lot to initiate contact, it is highly recommended to smile back in return. When interacting with other people, one should avoid expressing negative air of resentment, arrogance or hostility. Smiling, even toward strangers that you are interacting with, or someone that accidentally met your eyes, is considered polite and could be a social ice-breaker and to sign that you are approachable. Probably that is why Indonesians are rated highly as the most smiling people in the world. Communality Indonesians are family and community oriented, where loving and honoring elders is a norm. Indonesians are family and community oriented. Several ethnic group has knit-tight relations that its member are expected to involve actively in many of their community events. Social harmony and spirit of cooperation is nurtured, as embodied in the tradition of decision by consensus (musyawarah-mufakat), and the long-established pattern of mutual assistance (gotong-royong). Senior is expected to make group decisions, although Indonesians are advocates of group discussion and consensus. This ties back to the idea of maintaining strong group cohesiveness and harmonious relationships. Individualism, especially among traditional community is considered arrogance and shunned upon. Politeness as well as respect, modesty and loyalty, is prevalent in the culture. Hierarchy and honoring the elder As with most group-oriented cultures, hierarchy plays a very great role in Indonesian culture. It is important to observe that in Indonesia everyone has a status, no one is equal, and status is situational. This hierarchical relationships are respected, emphasized and maintained. Respect is usually shown to those with status, power, position, and age. Failure to demonstrate proper respect, would be deemed as kurang ajar (Indonesian for \\"lack of education or teaching\\") to denote the lack of good manners. Elders are respected through performing salim, which is a revering handshake by touching the back of the hand to the forehead. For example, when shaking the hand with older persons, such as parents, grandparents and teachers, the younger people or students are expected to touch the back of the elder's palm with the tip of their nose or forehead, this reflects a special respect from the young to the old. This salim gesture is similar to hand-kissing, with exception it is only tip of nose or forehead that touch the hand, not the lips. This can be seen in both the village and families. The ritualized gesture of asking for forgiveness, paying respect and honoring the elders is the sungkem gesture. It is the utmost gesture of respect in Javanese and Sundanese tradition, mostly performed between parents and children. The parents place their hands on their laps and the children hold their parents hands and bow deep to put their nose in their parents hands, almost placing one's head upon the elder's lap. Ritualized sungkem often performed in wedding or during Lebaran or Hari Raya Eid al Fitr. Indirectness Most Indonesians valued social harmony dearly, so direct confrontation is best avoided. With such eagerness to avoid confrontation, indirectness would mostly become the norm. Indonesians might went to such extent to avoid unpleasantness, bad news or direct rejection. A socially refined Indonesians would go to elegant lengths to avoid to directly said \\"no\\"; in Indonesian language there are twelve ways to says \\"no\\" and six ways to says \\"please\\", this describes the complexity of social interaction and manners in Indonesia. Yet today, in the relatively new atmosphere of democracy, expressing disagreement, performing demonstrations, and arguing in open debate are becoming more publicly acceptable. Saving face Saving one's face means one should carefully consider others' dignity and avoid them experiencing shame or humiliation. Openly airing your displeasure at certain circumstances would be considered extremely disrespectful and bad etiquette. In the event that you are disgruntled or angry with a person, it is best to discuss the matter privately. This way you are allowing them to ‘save face’ and retain their dignity and honour amongst their peers. ==Everyday Manners== Greetings Balinese traditionally greets in Añjali Mudrā, a Hindu heritage in Indonesian culture. Greetings in local Indonesian includes selamat pagi (good morning), selamat siang (good afternoon), or selamat malam (good evening), and apa kabar? (how are you?). Saying terima kasih (thank you) after receiving services or favours demonstrate good manner. When greeting or introducing oneself, smiling, handshake (salam) and slightly nod is a good gesture. A medium to soft handshake grip is sufficient, since gripping too hard could be considered rude or an act of aggression. Indonesians may not shake hand as firmly as their Western counterparts. Salam is also a standard greeting between Muslims, and it would perhaps be considered polite to follow this form of salutation. Generally in salam, the equivalent of the handshake is to proffer both hands and gently touch your counterpart’s extended hands, before finally bringing one’s hands back to the chest to demonstrate that you welcome from the heart. In certain cultures with significant Hindu-Buddhist heritage such as Bali, Java and Lombok — it is common to perform sembah; to greet by clasped two hands together in front of the chest while slightly bowing. Traced to Dharmic Añjali Mudrā, it is the same as Indian namaste, Thai wai and Cambodian sampeah gesture, and preferred especially among Javanese and Balinese people. Using hands Both the Muslim and Hindu faiths somewhat abhor the use of the left hand. It is considered 'unclean'; the left hand is traditionally perceived as the hand used to clean yourself in the toilet. So when shaking hands, offering a gift, handing or receiving something, eating, pointing or generally touching another person, it is considered proper etiquette to always use your right hand. Pointing toward someone with forefinger is considered rude. While pointing with the whole open palm or just a thumb (with other fingers folded) are considered most polite. Pointing direction by doing smooth and graceful motion with your chin is quite acceptable, except a sharp and strong movement, which is not polite and considered as an insult. Table manner A banquet in Indonesia, the table top is filled with bowls and plates of steamed rice and various dishes. Indonesian traditional meals usually consists of steamed rice as staple, surrounded by vegetables and soup and meat or fish side dishes. In a typical family meal, the family members gather around the table filled with steamed rice and several other dishes. Each dish is placed in a separate communal large plate or in bowls. Each of these dishes has its own serving spoons, used only to take parts of the dishes from the communal plate into one's own personal plate. Each of the family members has their own personal plate that is first filled with steamed rice. During a dinner or luncheon invitation, the oldest man, most senior family member, or the honored host, has the right to initiate the meal, followed by the rest of the family and guests to help themselves to the dishes. Each of them take some portion of dishes from the communal plates into their own individual plates. On their personal plate, the steamed rice will soon be surrounded by two, three or more dishes; vegetables and fish or meat, and maybe some fried dishes, sambal and krupuk. Indonesian meals are commonly eaten with the combination of a spoon in the right hand and fork in the left hand to push the food onto the spoon. Knife however, is absent from dining table, thus most of the ingredients such as vegetables and meat are already cut into bite-size pieces prior to cooking. In many parts of the country, it is quite common to eat with one's bare hands. In traditional restaurants or households that commonly use bare hands to eat, such as Sundanese and Padang restaurants, they usually serve kobokan, a bowl of tap water with a slice of lime in it to give a fresh scent. This bowl of water should not be consumed, rather it is used to wash one's hand before and after eating. In some restaurants, one may be required to share a table; yet involving in conversation with strangers that shares table is not necessary, a smile and a slight nod during initiate contact is sufficient. Usually the one who does the inviting pays the bill, while going Dutch is not common and often considered as a poor form , though younger people and teenagers often do this. Indonesia is a Muslim majority country, so a majority of Indonesians observe halal dietary law which prohibits the consumption of pork and alcohol. During the days of Ramadhan, one should refrain from eating in front of a Muslim colleague, or avoid inviting them to join for a meal, as Muslims typically fast and refrain from drinking and smoking during the day. ==Dress sense== Wearing modest long-sleeved dress for women, batik shirt or other traditional Indonesian fabrics shirt for men are recommended to attend formal occasions in Indonesia. Overall, conservative and modest dress sense are adopted in Indonesia, however it might differ from one place to another. For example, Aceh that adopt Sharia law are more strict and conservative compared to Bali. Shorts, strapless or sleeveless tops are considered only suitable for sports or worn in private, and are not usually worn in public. Business Business dress code are pretty much the same as international standard. Most of Indonesian offices are air conditioned, so the heat is not a problem on wearing suits indoor. When in Indonesia, by and large a conservative and modest dress sense should be adopted — especially by women. Skirt hemlines should fall below the knee and the shoulders should always be covered. Business attire is generally conservative. Women should dress conservatively ensuring that they are well covered from ankle to neck. Formal events Attending ceremonies, dinner parties, wedding receptions or official events wearing international standard dress-code are acceptable, such as to wear suit, shirt and trousers for men and modest dress for women. Wearing long- sleeved batik shirt for men and long-sleeved batik dress for women is acceptable for most formal occasions. Visiting sacred sites Some sacred place are open for visitors. However, a proper dress etiquette is required, such as wearing sarong to visit Balinese temples. Attending religious events or visiting religious sites require utmost care. When visiting a place of worship, such as candi and pura (temples), mosques, and churches, the proper dress etiquette for such places is of utmost importance — modest dress is required. In temples for example, shorts or mini skirts are not allowed, thus visitors are required to wear sarongs to cover their lower parts. Sleeveless and shoulders exposing clothes are also not allowed, thus clothes covering shoulders is required. Some non-religious sites such as keratons (sultan's palace) and some museums may require modest dress almost similar to religious sites. Shoes or any form of footwears should be removed when entering a mosque. Men and women should both cover as much skin as possible; women are required to cover their heads. Likewise, removing shoes and dress modestly is also expected when visiting Balinese Hindu temples. If wishing to visit a place of worship it should be confirmed prior to entry whether the particular shrine, temple, mosque or church is open to touristic visits or the curious. ==References== Bibliography * Indonesia Etiquette ","title":"Etiquette in Indonesia"},{"id":"35323878","text":"Glasgow First is a political party based in Glasgow, Scotland.

Section 329 stated that: \\"No person shall transmit the result or purported result of the vote in an electoral district to the public in another electoral district before the close of all of the polling stations in that other electoral district.\\"The Canadian Elections Act, Accessed April 13, 2012. But on January 13, 2012, the Canadian government said it planned to repeal Section 329 of the Canada Elections Act due to technological changes and the inability to enforce it. It was just another step in the changing dynamic of journalism, technology, and the democratic process. ==History== The idea of an election in which no one knew the results until voting was over was not present in the 19th century. In 1855, in every province but New Brunswick, voters cast their ballots orally.A History of the Vote in Canada, Elections Canada. Accessed April 13, 2012. This led to a system where information on who voted for who could be used for nefarious reasons. Intimidation and blackmail to force people to vote in a certain way. But another election practice in this time period would not work in later times. This was the practice of holding elections on different dates in different ridings. In this system, knowing or guessing the results of one riding impacted the way the political parties and people acted in the others. \\"The system allowed the party in power to hold elections in a safe riding first, hoping in this way to influence the vote in constituencies less favourable to them. The system even enabled a candidate who lost in one riding to run again in another.\\" In some cases this was drawn out to extremes: the 1872 election was stretched out more than two months by the Conservatives. There was no real effect to the democratic process because of these long, drawn out elections because communication between ridings and provinces was very slow.Duncan, Shelly. Why Vote on a Tuesday? Farmer's Almanca (October 27, 2008). Accessed April 13, 2012. It wasn't until the railroad and the telegraph that technology could interfere. In 1938, a ban was put in place to stop the transmission of results from one area to another before polls were closed. At the end of the 20th century the ban started to feel obsolete in the face of technology, but bigger issues came to the surface. Proponents of the ban stated the need to make sure each poll had the same information when they are voting. Opponents of the ban stated freedom of speech as a right that the ban infringed upon. The ban's main purpose was to compensate for the time gap between Eastern and Western Canada.Harper Government Committed to Repealing Dated Ban on Early Communication of Election Results, Government of Canada: Democratic Reform. Accessed April 13, 2012. Before 1996, there was a four-hour difference between closing polls in St. John's and Vancouver. But in 1996 the government imposed another policy to help this gap. They introduced staggered voting hours. \\"Under staggered voting hours, only results from less than ten percent of ridings could be available to late voters since the majority of polls across Canada open and close at the same time. Despite this, the prohibition on the transmission of election results remains in place.\\" In theory, staggered voting hours has helped the problem of information from other ridings getting out, due to most of the country voting around the same time. \\"10 per cent of the country finishes voting with 2.5 hours remaining in B.C., and 88 per cent of votes are in with only 30 minutes left in B.C. voting. Then the votes have to be counted.\\"Teixera, Dave (May 2, 2011). \\"Reporting the Canadian Election Results\\", BC Business. Accessed April 13, 2012. Dave Teixera suggests that \\"there is no way to mobilize the numbers required to \\"strategically\\" vote (meaning vote in a way you may not traditionally vote in order to topple the sitting government) based on Eastern results with 30 minutes remaining in B.C. voting...sharing the known voting results via social media will have zero motivating effect on voters in B.C. There is simply no time, nor any desire to change one's vote due to the outcome in another part of the country.\\" ==Controversy== Most of the dissent regarding the ban comes from Western Canada. That is where the biggest challenge to Section 329 occurred during the 2000 federal election. British Columbia resident Paul Bryan posted election results in Atlantic Canada before the polls closed in B.C.Supreme Court Upholds Blackout on Early Election Night Results (March 15, 2007), CBC News. Accessed April 13, 2012. He posted the results on his website to deliberately protest against Section 329. The fine for breaking Section 329 was determined to be $25,000 or less. According to Bryan, modern communications made the ban obsolete. When the British Columbia provincial court charged him, Bryan argued that his actions were protected in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Bryan cited two sections of the charter in his defense. Bryan said the charter guaranteed him free expression and free political association and that allowed him to circumvent Section 329. During the legal proceedings, Bryan had cross-country support. He had the support of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the National Citizens Coalition, and the CBC. Bryan even had the support of Stephen Harper. But the B.C provincial court did not agree with Bryan. He was convicted and fined $1,000. In 2003, the British Columbia Supreme Court overturned the ruling. This effectively made Section 329 moot in British Columbia. This had a major impact on the 2004 Federal election in B.C. It allowed the media to inform B.C voters results of the election in Eastern Canada before polls closed in British Columbia. There was no great difference between this election and past ones in terms of the fears of the proponents of Section 329. Once again in 2005, the B.C court of Appeal reversed the provincial's court decision, citing the need of fairness and ensuring all voters receive equality on election day. After the British Columbia court of appeal, Bryan took his case to the Supreme Court of Canada. It was there that the short term fate of Section 329 was decided. On March 15, 2007, the Supreme Court upheld the ban by a vote of 5-4. The key to the Supreme court's decision was what they called, \\"informational equality for all voters.\\"Norris, Gary (May 2, 2011). Canada Election Result Bloggers Face Fines Under 1938 Law, Bloomberg. Accessed April 13, 2012. In the Supreme Court's view, Section 329 \\"contributes in a positive way to the fairness and reputation of the electoral system.\\" ==Tweet the Results== The largest mass scale protest to Section 329 came in the 2011 federal election. In this election many people took to Twitter to disobey the law. Twitter users used proxy names for parties (from fruit and soft drinks) and created fake accounts to get away with sharing the illegal information.Harris, Misty. Twitterverse Rebels Flout Election Canada Ban, The Vancouver Sun (May 2, 2011). Accessed April 13, 2012. One Twitter account in particular was key. The account, Tweettheresults, has been for some time a proponent of changing Section 329. They went offline during the 2011 election, to avoid fines or legal battles.Tweet the Results But they encouraged others to use the #tweettheresults hashtag to share the information.Early Election Results Ban Breached on Twitter, CBC News (May 2, 2011).

NDP █████ ██ ███ ███ seats!\\" During election night, the #tweettheresults hashtags topped Twitter's list of trending topics. ==Repeal== On January 13, 2012 the federal government announced it \\"would end the ban on posting early election results before polls closed across the country.\\"Twitter and Facebook force end to Canada's Election night Internet Gag, The National Post (January 13, 2012). Accessed April 13, 2012 The plans were announced on Twitter by Tim Uppal, minister for democratic reform. At a later press conference, Uppal said, \\"This ban, which was enacted in 1938, is out of place and unenforceable.\\" Elections Canada found the ban impossible to enforce because of social media and the internet. They gave up \\"monitoring premature release of data.\\" The plan is not just supported by the Conservatives, \\"Repealing the ban is consistent with recommendations by the Chief Electoral Officer, who highlighted the difficulties associated with enforcing the ban in his report following the 41st general election.\\" ==Journalism== There were cases of news outlets breaking Section 329. Due to a feed switching error at the network's master control on the night of the 2011 election, CBC Television's live broadcast to the Atlantic Provinces, where the polls had already closed, began broadcasting to the rest of the country in lieu of the prerecorded lead-in special that was supposed to air at that time. After about ten minutes, the broadcast was taken off the air.Boesveld, Sarah. CBC May Have Violated the Elections Canada Blackout Law, The National Post (May 2, 2011). Accessed on April 13, 2012. In its place was a \\"Sorry, we're experiencing technical difficulties\\" message. Once the polls closed in each region, CBC continued their coverage normally. After the incident Election Canada said they would enforce Section 329 based on complaints.

It occurs in shallow water on the eastern coasts of America from Florida southward to Brazil. It is sometimes kept in reef aquaria. ==Description== Dardanus venosus grows to a length of . As a hermit crab, it lives inside the empty shell of a gastropod mollusc and its soft abdomen and most of its limbs are normally hidden with just the dactyls, or claws, projecting. Like other members of its family, it is left-handed, having its main chela or pincers on the left front limb. It uses this to cover the aperture of the shell when it feels threatened. The dactyls are a mauve colour due to the clusters of small bluish bristles that cover them. The crab's common name refers to the fact that when seen at close quarters, its eyes resemble star-bursts, being green or blue with dark pupils.Hermit Crabs, Use in the Marine Aquarium Hobby WetWebMedia. Retrieved 2012-04-02. ==Distribution and habitat== Dardanus venosus is found in Florida, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, the Bahamas, the Antilles, Venezuela and Brazil from low tide mark down to about . It is found on various substrates including rock, gravel, sand, mud, shell, coral and seaweed. ==Biology== Dardanus venosus is a scavenger and consumes detritus and anything edible that it finds on the seabed. The life cycle of Dardanus venosus has been little studied but the eggs are probably brooded attached to the female's abdomen. When the eggs hatch, the larvae are liberated into the water column and pass through several zoeal stages in the plankton before becoming glaucothoë larvae. These are relatively large and have elongated telsons, or rear segments, and characteristic hooks on the dactyls of the walking legs. After some time, the glaucothoë larvae settle out before metamorphosing into juveniles that needs to find shells in which to live. ==Ecology== In a study off the coast of Brazil, Dardanus venosus was found occupying eleven different kinds of gastropod shell including three different species of turban snail, (Astraea sp). Dardanus venosus often has the sea anemone Calliactis tricolor attached to its shell. It actively collects the anemone off a rock or removes it from an outgrown shell when it moves into a larger one. It loosens the grip of the anemone by giving it several taps near the base, causing it to relax. At first the anemone clings to the new shell with its tentacles until its base has a firm grip on the shell. This is a mutualistic arrangement with both crab and anemone deriving benefit. The crab is protected by the stinging cells of the anemone and the anemone gains transport and a greater supply of food comes within its reach. ==References== Category:Hermit crabs Category:Crustaceans described in 1848 ","title":"Dardanus venosus"},{"id":"35323963","text":"Aaron Winsor Levie (born December 27, 1985) (pronounced http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000086538&play;=1) is an American entrepreneur. He is the co-founder and CEO of the enterprise cloud company Box. ==Early life and education== Aaron Levie was born to a Jewish family from Mercer Island, Washington, a small suburb of Seattle. His parents are Ben and Karyn Levie. Levie attended the University of Southern California before taking a leave of absence in 2005 to start cloud storage company Box. ==Career== The idea for Box originated as a college business project that Levie was working on in 2004. The project examined cloud storage options for businesses and after contacting several organizations to ask how they are storing their content and data, Levie came to the conclusion that the market was fragmented. Levie saw an opportunity to build an online file storage business as a way for individuals to access and store documents and files. In December 2005, during his junior year at USC, Levie took a leave of absence to launch Box (originally called box.net) with his friend and Box CFO, Dylan Smith who was attending Duke University. At the time, Box was a storage service where users could pay to store their files in the cloud. Levie and Smith incorporated Box in April 2005 while operating the company out of Smith's parents' house on Mercer Island. Soon after, they moved the company to Berkeley, California. Levie and Smith first secured angel investment for Box from Texas billionaire Mark Cuban after a cold e-mail. In 2007, as the consumer cloud storage marketplace was becoming increasingly crowded, Levie and Smith decided to shift Box from a consumer service to one focused on selling to businesses (cloud storage). Box expanded its operations into Europe in 2012, with the opening of its first office in London, England. As of 2014, Box reported that 40% of Fortune 500 companies are paying Box customers. The company is headquartered in Redwood City and was backed by several venture capital firms and investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Bessemer Venture Partners, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, General Atlantic, Meritech Capital Partners, New Enterprise Associates, U.S. Venture Partners, and Salesforce.com. The company filed for IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in March 2014. Citing market fluctuations the company delayed its IPO until January 23, 2015. Speaking and contributed writing Levie has spoken at industry events such as Fortune Brainstorm Tech, Dreamforce, CxOTalk, LeWeb, RSA, MobileBeat, GigaOm Structure, TechCrunch Disrupt and DEMO. He has also written articles on innovation in the technology industry for publications such as The Washington Post, CNN.com, Los Angeles Times, Fortune, Forbes, ZDNet and Fast Company. ==References== Category:American technology chief executives Category:Businesspeople from King County, Washington Category:Living people Category:People from Mercer Island, Washington Category:1985 births ","title":"Aaron Levie"},{"id":"35324004","text":"The 2010–11 Slovak Women's First League was the 17th edition of the premier category for women's football clubs in Slovakia, running between 28 August 2010 and 7 May 2011.

The architect was Benjamin Lawrence of NewportJohn Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire, Penguin Books, 2000, , p.399 who later designed the church next door. The institute's staircase was made by Macfarlane, Glasgow, Wrought Ironwork was by Cormell Cheltenham and the carvings were by J Willis. The building opened in 1868. A smoking room and lecture room were added in 1897.Keith Kissack, Monmouth and its Buildings, Logaston Press, 2003, , page 146 ==History== Mrs. Matilda Jones (died 1874) of Ancre Hill financed the Institutes construction. It opened its doors on 15 October 1868 following a procession to Ancre Hill, then the home of Matilda Jones, of working men headed by a Military band and accompanied by the friendly Societies with their banners. The purpose of the construction was to provide a library and reading lessons for the working class. The books were transferred from St Johns Street where Matilda Jones had been offering a private room for reading. The building included a Reading room, library, gallery, committee room and lecture hall.Keith Kissack, Victorian Monmouth, The Monmouth Historical and Educational trust, , page 4,55,124,129,132 A song was composed for the workmen to sing during its construction: O may our institute succeed, And prove to men a boon indeed. May many hearts receive the seed Of saving the truth. Another song which was sung at each general meeting was: Hurrah for the men who work According to Keith Kissack some of the lectures may have been hard going with a programme of 1892/3 a selection being Hommer, Drink Work & Wages, Queens English, The Family Circle, The Solar System, French Salons, Fossils, Egypt, The War of The Roses, Cathedrals In Britain Most of the lectures lasted about two hours and were followed by the chairman's remarks and thanks. Many of the lectures made use of Magic Lanterns for their opening. In 1881 a meeting of teachers in the Institute elected to set up a Branch of the National Union of Elementary Teachers because they were unhappy being excluded from decision making in the schools. In 1885 the Church of England Temperance Society had offices in the building. Its members used the building when distributing petitions in favor of Sunday Closing and that flower shows were an antidote to alcohol. In 1890 the winter was particularly harsh with 56 consecutive days of frost. This led to the setting up of a Soup Kitchen in the Institute. In 1907 a series of Saturday Pop Concerts was held in the institute performed by the local regimental band. The building has been Grade II Listed since 8 October 2005 The more recent uses for the premises have been an Art shop, Gallery and Framing Company. ==Notes== Category:History of Monmouthshire Category:Buildings and structures in Monmouth, Wales Category:Grade II listed buildings in Monmouthshire ","title":"1 Monk Street, Monmouth"},{"id":"35324066","text":"The Lordship of Mechelen in 1350 The Lordship of Mechelen was until 1795 a small independent Lordship in the Low Countries, consisting of the city of Mechelen and some surrounding villages. In the early Middle Ages, it was part of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, which was confirmed in 910. In practice, the area was ruled by the local Berthout family, against the will of the Prince- Bishops of Liège. The Duchy of Brabant tried to annex the Lordship, but as a reaction, Liège gave the area in 1333 to the County of Flanders. The Flemish also didn't gain complete and permanent control. Mechelen was therefore later considered as one of the Seventeen Provinces and then as a province of the Southern Netherlands. The Dukes of Burgundy and later the Habsburg Emperors and Kings were personally Lords of Mechelen and for a while turned the city more or less into the capital of the Netherlands. They established here the highest jurisdictional court of the Seventeen Provinces, called the Great Council of Mechelen. Governess Margaret of Austria also held her Court at Mechelen. Later, the capital moved primarily to Brussels. In 1795 the Lordship was abolished by the French revolutionaries and it became part of the French département of the Deux-Nèthes. Today it is part of the Belgian province of Antwerp. == Areas of the Lordship of Mechelen == * the walled city of Mechelen * the hamlets Nekkerspoel, Nieuwland, Pennepoel, Battel, Geerdegem and others * the villages of Hever, Muizen, Hombeek, Leest and Heffen * In a separate enclave, Heist-op-den-Berg and some hamlets like Gestel.

Dr Alford is the Chairman of Alford Technologies Limited, a world-leading provider of explosive engineering and explosive charge technology, that he founded in 1985. In 2015 he was awarded the OBE in Her Majesty the Queen’s Birthday Honours for services to explosive ordnance disposal. Alford is considered the pioneer in water projecting disruptors driven by high explosive. These are used in bomb disposal. He also developed the renowned Dioplex linear cutting charge, and Vulcan shaped charge. Alford's explosive charges are some of the most highly regarded in the industry and are said to have saved many lives. Alford's equipment is currently being used to support operations in Afghanistan in countering the threat from Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). == Early life == Alford was born in Ilford, a suburb of London, and was one of two children. During the early stages of the Second World War he moved with his family to Bournemouth on the south coast where \\"hit and run\\" German aircraft raids introduced him to machine gun fire and air-dropped bombs. Returning to Ilford (1942, aged 7) he experienced more aircraft bombs, usually dropped under cover of night, and he started a collection of fragments of bombs and of anti-aircraft shells. His searches rewarded him with the occasional magnalium incendiary bomb of which the bodies later provided a welcome source of metal for his earliest fireworks. Alford's interest in explosives and pyrotechnics was born. On one occasion Alford found a complete flying bomb engine in Epping Forest. He had the opportunity to hear and observe the V-1 flying bomb (\\"Doodlebugs\\") and V2 rockets and was able to compare and contrast their effects. Fascination with the technology of warfare, its causes and its effects upon the cultures of the people involved, has remained with him. == Career == His professional life began as a chemist and, in 1966, he was awarded a doctorate of the University of Paris (mention très honourable) for research on the chemistry of plant products carried out at one of Europe's oldest organic chemistry laboratories in the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle under Professor Charles Mentzer. The following two years at Tokyo and Waseda Universities gave him some understanding of research in Japan and the language respectively. Returning to England in 1969, he joined a tiny company in Piccadilly organising clinical trials of a diet developed for NASA for astronauts. This work brought him into contact with some prominent physicians, pathologists, surgeons and biochemists and one of the latter, Dr (now Professor) Michael Crawford of the Nuffield Institute of Comparative Medicine, offered him a bench in his department which specialised in the study of the chemistry and nutritional implications of fatty acids in the diet. Unable to raise funds sufficient to enable him to continue his research, Alford moved from central London to Ham in its western suburbs. The \\"Troubles\\" in Northern Ireland awoke Alford's interest in explosives and he began to consider more effective means of defeating improvised devices (IEDs) than such devices as rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) with cement-filled warheads. He experimented with the use of elongate gas cylinders, filled with liquid carbon dioxide and provided with an axial tube containing a small explosive charge, as a penetrative disruptor of potentially buried packages. The use of letter bombs by the Black September Organization (BSO), one of which had killed a diplomat in the Israeli embassy in September 1972, led him to develop blast absorbing vermiculite-based containers for small suspect devices which enabled them to be transported in relative safety. These were purported to be the first blast containers of their kind. In 1974 a visit by the Security Service resulted in Alford being offered a job as a part-time conference interpreter by the MoD using his knowledge of both languages and explosives. This helped sustain him and his young family while he studied for an MSc in Environmental Pollution Science at Brunel University. In 1976 the Royal Armaments Research & Development Establishment (RARDE) at Fort Halstead (later to become DSTL) arranged for Wallop Industries (now Wallop Defence Systems) to provide facilities for him to develop one of his inventions, the water lined and water-filled shaped charge, initially made in his house and tested in his garden, in more orthodox surroundings. Alford's findings were ground-breaking at the time, and were some of the first demonstrations of using water-tamped charges for countering the emerging threat from IEDs. Other inventions were made in the course of this research but eventually Alford received a letter, which he keeps with pride, effectively ordering him to stop having any more new ideas since he did not work for Fort Halstead. Undeterred, Alford moved to Wiltshire in the south west of England and joined Leafield Engineering where he continued to develop novel explosive charges but realised that his future did not lie therein when he was told by the head of sales that his devices worked well enough but some of them, because of their novelty, did not look as if they would work. During this time – in June 1978 – Alford was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Explosives Engineers (IExpE). He accepted an invitation to join Hotforge, a small company which provided explosives services to the petroleum industry, and was offered a directorship. He was thus able to devote himself to the development of explosive cutting charges. Alford designed underwater steel-cutting charges which he used for chain cutting, plate perforating (using his new trepanning charges) and well-head severing operations in the North Sea for the petroleum industry. His first experiments using flexible linear fracturing charges which depended upon the collision of shock waves were demonstrated and patented. In mid-1981 he was approached by a retired army officer and his colleague and they formed a new company, Alflex, whose first operation was participation in the record breaking expedition to the Barents Sea which recovered 93 per cent of the approximately five tonnes of gold ingots from the wreck of HMS Edinburgh. During the next three years he acquired a great deal of experience in demolition, felling numerous brick, concrete and steel chimneys. In 1985, Alford started his own company, Sidney Alford Ltd with his wife, Itsuko as co- director. He carried out many explosive demolition operations on such steel and concrete structures as bridges, industrial buildings and, very sadly from a historical point of view, the blast furnaces at the Consett Iron Company which closed in 1980. The old manually operated iron penstock gates beneath the Royal Dockyard in Portsmouth and Gibraltar Harbour were gently blasted into removable fragments and replaced by modern hydraulic structures. Various other underwater operations were conducted for marine salvage companies. Subsequent operational work carried out by Alford included marine salvage during the \\"Tanker War\\" in the Persian Gulf (1984/8), including the sectioning of large oil tankers whose hulls had been blown open by Iran's Revolutionary Guards and air attacks; this work was carried out under the Iranian flag in the uncomfortably close company of the Revolutionary Guard's speedboats with their heavy machine guns and RPGs. That activity was swiftly followed by the clearance of mines and sub-munitions and aircraft bombs immediately after the repulsed invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in 1992. The former work involved the development of the user-filled linear cutting charge in kit form which became known as Dioplex. Kuwait provided a testing ground for the development of what became the Vulcan, using its water-filled cone and his recently invented magnesium projectile. The Vulcan shaped charge proved paramount in the clearance of large bombs in sea with the Royal Navy off the Scottish coast and of limpet mines and shells with the US Navy off Pearl Harbour in 2002–2003, made possible by the addition of a component which permitted its reliable use under water. In 2002 Sidney's son Roland, a graduate in mechanical engineering, became a director of the family owned company. When the \\"Vietnam\\" war finally stopped, the huge number of bombs which had been dropped on Indo- China became apparent, as did the very high proportion which had not exploded as they hit the trees and soft soil. It was at the invitation of the Mines Advisory Group (MAG) that Alford was enabled, in February 2000, to return to Laos, which he had first visited during the war. Accompanied by his son Roland, they tested the usefulness of the precursor of the Vulcan at rendering safe the larger bombs without destroying for a second or third time the village which had been targeted during the war. This led to the production of the Vulcan itself and further verification and instructional visits to Laos followed and valuable data was gathered which contributed to the device going into use in many countries. In 1987, Alford's invention and ownership of water lined and water projecting shaped charge technology was reluctantly recognised by the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD). A settlement was reached with Alford, enabling UK MOD to legitimately develop their own water-based charge technology which incorporated Alford's ideas. In 2002, Alford's son Roland Alford became managing director, with Sidney Alford becoming the Company's chairman. ==Early Inventions== 1976 – Water Filled & Water Lined Shaped Charge The use of guns using blank cartridges to eject water from the barrel at high velocity was well known as a means of disrupting relatively small and thin- skinned targets with a relatively low probability of causing detonation or ignition. They were, however, easily defeated by the use of more robust cases, such as those made from structural steel tubes. The replacement of the copper liner of conventional shaped charges first by gelled water, then by low melting point salts with high proportions of water of crystallisation and finally with thin-walled plastic containers of water, provided a simple means of generating jets of water of much higher velocity and with correspondingly enhanced penetrating power and disruptive capability than was possible using gun barrel technology. Concomitant experiments demonstrated that, in contrast to metal-lined charges, shaped charges projecting liquids still functioned with their cavities filled rather than just lined with water. One of Alford's early experiments involved a cucumber which was carved into a prism with a longitudinal V-shaped groove with a strip of sheet explosive behind. This generated a crude linear liquid jet capable of cutting steel. From this charge was developed a family of thin-walled plastic containers in which explosive was sandwiched between a grooved, water-filled, projectile and a rear water- filled component which acted as a tamper and flash suppressor. The series of production models derived from this cucumber include the MiniMod, the MLVD (Modular Large Vehicle Disruptor) and the BootBanger. 1987 – Dioplex User- Filled Linear Cutting Charge Kit Alford's work during the \\"Tanker War\\" phase of the Gulf War inspired development of the user-filled linear cutting family of charges which became known as Dioplex. Alford was invited to attempt the cutting operations of the deformed hulls which, by the time he got on the scene were either floating or were run up on the shore of Sirri Island. For this he designed linear cutting charges which consisted of strips of plywood, which were glued into elongate rectangular boxes, with a 90-degree steel liner inside. Each charge was closed with glued-on end pieces with holes for detonators or detonating cord and with a plywood lid. The primitive, user- filled charges proved themselves in cutting the substantial steel hull in air and under water and, not surprisingly, requirements for larger quantities for further wrecked tankers soon arrived and were flown out. Soon demand exceeded supply and so a quicker way of manufacturing was required. The early Dioplex used a flat-packed, foldable plastic body and it went at once into service with the British army. The models which we know today are made of aluminium, extruded in square U configuration and with nominal widths of 20, 40 and 80mm. Subsequently a 30mm model was introduced. These are now among the tools of choice for the explosive demolition of large steel framed and reinforced buildings. The name Dioplex was an abbreviation of Do It Oneself (a bit more up-market than DIY), Pliable Explosive. Patent protected. 1987 – The Vulcan Point Focal Shaped Charge The need for point-focal penetration led to the development of the Vulcan shaped charge system. After initial experiments using the precursor of the Vulcan to inject liquids which reacted hypergolically with the explosive fill of steel cased munitions, Alford realised that a magnesium cone, which was much manageable than the liquids required for hypergolic reaction, formed a jet which ignited as it was formed. This was quickly shown to provide a simple and reliable means of bringing about relatively gentle deflagration of small and large steel cased munitions with only a low probability of causing detonation. Since then a range of projectiles has been developed for the Vulcan for various other applications. Patent protected. 2002 – The Vulcan Counter Limpet Mine System (VCLMS) Shaped Charge Based on the Vulcan shaped charge, the VCLMS provides the means of deploying the Vulcan quickly for reliable use under water. VCLMS was developed to support Mine Countermining (MCM) activities and the safe disposal of such conventional munitions found on the sea bed as World War II bombs. ==Recent Inventions== 2012 – Alford Strip The Alford Strip is a high-efficiency tamped strip charge used by police breachers to split and blow open wooden doors and to cut laminated glass windows. Alford Strip is a lightweight low- fragmentation plastic strip filled with an inert water-based gel which acts as the tamping medium. Present models of the Alford Strip were designed by Dr Alford's son Roland Alford. ==Awards== In 2004 his Company, under its new name of Alford Technologies, won a Queen's Awards for Enterprise: Innovation for the Vulcan shaped charge system. This was followed by a second Queen's Award for Outstanding Innovation in 2009 for the development of User-Filled High Explosive Charges for the Neutralisation of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). In July 2020, he was informed that he would be receiving the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award by the US Navy's Admiral Ver Hage. The receiving of the award has been put on hold due to Covid-19 restrictions. ==TV Programmes== Kaboom, Windfall Films (TV Documentary), 1995 D-Day: The Ultimate Conflict (TV documentary), 2004 The Gunpowder Plot: Exploding the Legend (TV), 2005 Weaponology (TV Documentary), 2007 • Fire Weapons (TV Documentary), 2007 • Frags, Pineapples, and RPGs (TV Documentary), 2007 • Bomber (TV Documentary) Future Weapons (TV Documentary), 2007 • No Escape featuring GateCrasher – wall breaching charge • The Protectors featuring BootBanger – car boot opening charge • Mission Invisible featuring Krakatoa – shaped charge Generals at War, 2009 Explosions: How We Shook the World (TV Documentary), 2010 The Passenger in Seat 19A (TV Episode), 2010 Bang Goes the Theory, 2011 Dambusters: Building the Bouncing Bomb (TV Documentary), 2011 Bombing Hitler’s Dams (TV Episode), 2012 Gallileo (TV Current Affairs), 2012 Kevin McCloud’s Manmade Home, 2012 Kevin McCloud's Manmade Home, 2013 Bloody Tales: Napoleon Plot, 2013 ==References== Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:English engineers Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:People from Ilford Category:Explosives engineers ","title":"Sidney Alford"},{"id":"35324153","text":"Punicalin is an ellagitannin.

The episode is written by series producers Dawn Prestwich and Nicole Yorkin and is directed by Dan Attias. In the episode, Rosie Larsen's bloody backpack is dropped off at the garage's doorstep—a sign to her father Stan that the police arrested the wrong person. Gwen provides more information to Sarah about Richmond and the night he was suspected of killing Rosie. Holder begins to realize that he is a pawn in a bigger conspiracy. Richmond wakes up to learn that he is no longer a suspect but is paralyzed. The episode features a cameo from Sofie Gråbøl, the protagonist of the original Danish version of the series, Forbrydelsen. ==Plot== Stan Larsen (Brent Sexton) wakes in the middle of the night to learn that his son Denny (Seth Isaac Johnson) thinks he heard someone outside. Upon investigation near the front door, Stan trips over a pink backpack with the initials \\"RL\\". Detective Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman) arrives to seal the backpack's contents in evidence bags. Stan confirms that the backpack belongs to his daughter, Rosie. After realizing that the bag was placed outside after a suspect had been arrested, Stan demands protection for his family. Holder does not respond. On the phone, Lt. Michael Oakes (Garry Chalk) orders Holder to bring the backpack to the station immediately and give it to a technician named Stu (Darren Moore). Holder says that evidence in the past had normally been given to Gary, another tech. Oakes stands firm with his order. Holder turns in his own blue backpack. Oakes later tells Holder that forensic results only revealed Rosie's fingerprints on the backpack and insists that he drop the case. Holder ponders his boss' lies and Gil Sloane (Brian Markinson) tells him to stop speculating, adding that any blame on the case belongs to Sarah. Detective Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) visits Richmond's campaign adviser Gwen Eaton (Kristin Lehman). Again, she asks Gwen about Richmond's location on the night of Rosie's murder. Gwen remembers that Richmond smelled of saltwater that night—as he always does after kayaking. Sarah asks her for a key to Richmond's apartment. There, Sarah finds a photo of Richmond hugging his late wife Lily. An inscription on the back lists the photo as being taken in Tacoma, Washington on October 5, 2002. At the hospital, the doctor recommends to Jamie Wright (Eric Ladin), Richmond's campaign manager, that someone close to Richmond be present when he is to be told about the paralysis. By phone, Jamie fails to reach Richmond's sister. In the room, Darren Richmond (Billy Campbell) wakes to realize something is wrong with his leg. Instead of telling Richmond himself about his paralysis, Jamie leaves. Richmond later tells Jamie that his doctor has informed him. Sarah visits the inn where Richmond and Gwen stayed the night of Rosie's murder. The innkeeper (Sheelah Megill) gives directions to the location in Richmond's photo, then speaks of Richmond's love for wife Lily. After looking around the photo’s location, Sarah talks with a fisherman (Doug Abrahams) who spends a lot of time on the nearby river. Sarah later calls District Attorney Christina Nilsen (Sofie Gråbøl) to request a meeting regarding Richmond. Visiting Richmond, Sarah tells him she knows that he proposed to his wife on October 5, that each year was their anniversary, and that a fisherman had pulled him out of the water on the night of Rosie's murder. Richmond threatens to sue if the story gets out. She tells Nilsen that a witness can verify where Richmond was the night of the murder. Nilsen agrees to drop the charges and reopen the case. At the station, Sarah finds that Lt. Erik Carlson (Mark Moses) has taken Oakes' place due to his early retirement after Sarah’s sloppy police work. He gives her another chance with the Larsen case, after Nilsen insisted. Carlson orders Linden to work with Holder, even though she preferred to work alone. Later at Sarah's motel room, Holder repeatedly knocks on the door, wishing to explain. After getting no response from Sarah, who is listening inside, he drops his badge at her door and leaves. After repeated attempts to get police protection, Stan arrives home to see a stranger approach his son Tommy outside. The man is a reporter who asks how Stan feels about the charges being dropped against Richmond. Stan then drives to a restaurant and asks Janek Kovarsky, an old mob acquaintance, to find and kill Rosie's murderer. ==Reception== Critical reception Paired as a season premiere with the previous episode, \\"My Lucky Day\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Lori Rackl of Chicago Sun-Times stated: \\"This melancholy show isn't afraid to take a break from the sleuthing action to dwell on Rosie's suffering family. It does an exquisite job portraying the crushing grief, pain and anger that can fill the vacuum left by a murder victim.\\" The Washington Posts Hank Steuver called the episode \\"solid and corrective, even stylishly penitential in the way it recomposes itself and gets on with the mystery.\\" Dorothy Rabinowitz of The Wall Street Journal reflected on the episode by saying, \\"Everything that happens—new light cast on the character of a prime suspect, old bonds of love and family sundered by the pain of loss, trust between police partners shattered—gets its due scrutiny. That too is one of the signature qualities of this crime drama and its most important one.\\" New York Magazines Matt Zoller Seitz was a reviewer who panned the episode: \\"The acting, direction, photography, editing, and sound design are so superb that you may momentarily think you're seeing a vastly improved Killing, but after a moment you'll realize that it was always aces in those departments and that the show's weakest link, the writing, hasn't improved all that much.\\" Ratings As the second half of a two-part season two premiere, \\"My Lucky Day\\" was watched by 1.80 million viewers, marking the series' fifth-lowest viewership. ==References *\\"My Lucky Day\\" at AMC * * Category:The Killing (American TV series) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ","title":"My Lucky Day (The Killing)"},{"id":"35324227","text":"Evan Frankfort (born December 13, 1970) is an American television music producer.

Retrieved 2012-04-03. This is a symbiotic relationship; the anemone benefits from greater access to food as its host moves around, and the host benefits from the protection from predators provided by the anemone's stinging cells. The shell occupied by the thinstripe hermit crab (Clibanarius vittatus) often carries a tricolor anemone. This is usually quite small but may be several centimetres in diameter. The crab actively collects the anemone from a base on a rock and places it on its shell. It later transfers it to a new shell when it has outgrown the present shell and needs to move into larger quarters. Calliactis tricolor is often found attached to a gastropod shell occupied by another hermit crab, Dardanus venosus. On finding an anemone, or after moving into a new shell, this hermit crab taps the edge of the base of the anemone several times with its claw. This causes it to relax and the crab can then lift it off the surface to which it was attached and place it onto its new home.

The novel was Ninh's graduation project at the Nguyen Du Writing School in Hanoi. It tells the story of a soldier who is collecting dead bodies after a battle and then begins to think about his past. The novel won the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize. ==Original version and English version== Bảo Ninh achieved prominence in Hanoi with the first version of the novel, Thân phận của tình yêu (English: The Destiny of Love), which was published in roneo form (similar to photocopying) before 1990. Soon afterwards Phan Thanh Hao translated it into English and took the manuscript to the British publishers Secker & Warburg. Geoffrey Mulligan, an editor there, commissioned Frank Palmos, an Australian journalist who had reported on the Vietnam War and written about it in his book Ridding the Devils (1990), to write an English version based on the raw translation. Bao Ninh had read Phan Thanh Hao's Vietnamese translation of Ridding the Devils and willingly agreed to this suggestion. After several meetings with both the author and the translator, Hao, in Hanoi, and journeys throughout Vietnam to check details, Palmos wrote the English version over seven months in secret in his home in Warwick, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. It was published in 1994 under the title The Sorrow of War. Counterfeits of the English version became widely available in Vietnam, aimed at the tourist trade. Counterfeit sales have reportedly far exceeded sales of the original edition. In November 2017 the Book Distributors Guild of Vietnam named the English version of Sorrow as the biggest selling Vietnamese book in the country's history. The Sorrow of War was not published in Vietnamese, under the title Nỗi buồn chiến tranh, until at least 10 years after its publication in English. It has since been translated into 14 other languages, most from the Palmos English version. The versions directly translated from the Vietnamese include the French version by Phan Huy Đường in 1994, the Japanese version by Okawa Hitoshi() in 1999 and the Chinese version by Xia Lu() in 2019. ==Overview== The Sorrow of War, written in the stream of consciousness style,Bookrags. \\"The Sorrow of War: A Novel of North Vietnam Summary & Study Guide Description\\". Retrieved on July 2 2015. opens with a depiction of soldiers on a postwar mission to collect the bones of fallen comrades for reburial. Thus begins the non-linear narrative by Kien, a North Vietnamese soldier during the Vietnam War, chronicling his loss of innocence, his love, and his anguish at the memories of war. Kien rides in the truck searching for the remains of fallen soldiers in the Jungle of Screaming Souls and recalls that this is where the 27th Battalion was eliminated except for him. He then undergoes a series of flashbacks that tie the novel together. The main theme tying these flashbacks together is the love affair between Kien and his childhood sweetheart, Phuong. Kien writes a novel about it, but decides to burn it. Then a mute girl whom Kien has begun seeing when drunk, and has been bouncing his ideas off, obtains the text after he left. Throughout the book, Kien also reflects on the many unacknowledged sacrifices, such as Hoa giving up her life to save Kien and his comrades from American soldiers, and acts of immorality and desecration, such as the objectification and treatment of a dead woman in the airport, that he experienced in the war. The climax of the novel is when Kien reflects on his first personal kill in the novel, which occurs after he witnesses Phuong get raped. The novel ends with a passage by a new narrator, who explains that he has received Kien's novel from the mute girl . ==Reception== Michael Fathers of The Independent noted how both American and Vietnamese cultural depictions of the Vietnam War had tended to be full of romanticisation and stereotyping, and wrote: \\"The Sorrow of War soars above all this. ... It moves backwards and forwards in time, and in and out of despair, dragging you down as the hero-loner leads you through his private hell in the highlands of Central Vietnam, or pulling you up when his spirits rise. It is a fine war novel and a marvellous book.\\" The British author-photographer Tim Page and others have compared the novel favorably to Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front. The British newspaper The Independent judged The Sorrow of War the Best Foreign Book of 1994. The prize money was equally shared by the author, Bao Ninh, the translator, Phan Thanh Hao, and Frank Palmos, the author of the English version for publication. In 2010, the British Society of Authors listed the translation as one of the Best 50 Translations of the previous century. ==See also== * 1990 in literature * Vietnamese literature ==References== Category:1990 novels Category:Vietnamese novels Category:Novels set during the Vietnam War ","title":"The Sorrow of War"},{"id":"35324310","text":"Mikhail Mamiashvili (born 1963 in Konotop, Ukrainian SSR) is a Russian wrestler of Georgian origin.

It is found in the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the western Atlantic Ocean. ==Description== Like other hermit crabs, Clibanarius vittatus lives inside the empty shell of a gastropod mollusc. This protects its soft abdomen and normally only its head and limbs project through the aperture of the shell. The chelipeds (claw-bearing legs) and claws of Clibanarius vittatus are small, both the same size, and covered in short bristles. When threatened, the animal retreats into the shell and the chelipeds block the aperture. The outside of the claws bear small blue tubercles. The body and legs are dark green or brown; the body is faintly streaked with white and the legs have more distinct white or grey stripes. Adult crabs often occupy shells of over in length. ==Distribution and habitat== Clibanarius vittatus is found in shallow parts of the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the western Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends from Virginia in the eastern United States southwards as far as Brazil. It is plentiful in the Indian River Lagoon in Florida. It is more resistant to desiccation than many hermit crabs and is found in the intertidal zone as well as at depths down to about . It can be found on sand or mud, in seagrass meadows, on rock jetties, in oyster beds and in other inshore habitats. ==Biology== Clibanarius vittatus is a scavenger and mostly feeds on detritus that it finds on the seabed. Reproduction in Clibanarius vittatus is initiated by the passing of spermatophores from a male crab to a female. The egg mass of several thousand eggs is brooded by the female on her abdomen. After a few weeks the eggs hatch and the larvae are released into the water column and become planktonic. They pass through four or five zoeal stages and one post- larval, glaucothoe stage before sinking to the bottom and metamorphosing into juveniles. The free-living glaucothoe larvae sometimes find a suitable sized shell before metamorphosis, otherwise the juveniles need to find suitable new homes before they are consumed by predators. An adult female has several broods each year and may produce 180,000 eggs during the reproductive season. ==Ecology== At a beach, Cape Hatteras National Seashore, NC As it grows, Clibanarius vittatus periodically needs to change the shell in which it lives. At this stage it is at its most vulnerable to predators. If a suitable vacant shell cannot be found, crabs may fight each other for shells or even kill living molluscs. The shells chosen by Clibanarius vittatus are usually whelks or conches. Species selected include the lightning whelk (Sinistrofulgur sp.), the knobbed whelk (Busycon carica), the giant triton (Monoplex parthenopeus), the moon snail (Neverita duplicata) and the Florida rocksnail (Stramonita haemastoma). The sea anemone, Calliactis tricolor, is often found attached to the shell that is occupied by Clibanarius vittatus. This seems to be a mutualistic arrangement in which the crab benefits from the fact that potential predators are deterred by the anemone's stinging cells while the anemone gains a greater access to food as the crab moves around. ==References Category:Hermit crabs Category:Crustaceans of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Crustaceans described in 1802 ","title":"Thinstripe hermit crab"},{"id":"35324362","text":"Schweigger is a German surname.

His father, a shepherd, died in 1754. On 1 December 1755 he was admitted to membership in a religious society at Chirnside, Berwickshire; it was one of several \\"fellowship societies\\" formed by James Fraser of Brae. They had joined the Reformed Presbytery in 1743, but separated from it in 1753, as holders of the doctrine of universal atonement (this split occurred at the death of John Macmillan, and they were without a fixed ministry). Purves in 1756 bound himself apprentice to his uncle, a wright in Duns, Berwickshire. He read Isaac Watts's Dissertation on the Logos, 1726, and adopted the doctrine of the pre- existence of the human soul of Christ. In 1763 the Berwickshire societies sent him as their commissioner to Coleraine, County Londonderry, to consult with a branch of the Irish secession church holding similar doctrines. A minute expressing concurrence of doctrine was signed at Coleraine by John Hopkins, Samuel Lind, and Purves. In 1769 the Berwickshire societies decided to qualify one of their members as a public preacher. Three candidates delivered trial discourses on 8 June 1769; one of these withdrew from membership: of the remaining two, Purves was selected by lot (27 July), and sent to Glasgow College. Here he learned some Latin, and Greek and Hebrew so as to read the scriptures in the originals. In 1771 a statement of principles drawn up by Purves was adopted by the societies. Its theology was high Arian, but its distinctive position was the duty of free inquiry into the scriptures, unbiassed by creed. This document led to controversy with ministers of the Reformed Presbytery. In 1776 several members of the Berwickshire societies, headed by Alexander Forton or Fortune, migrated to Edinburgh and established a religious society, calling themselves \\"successors of the remnant who testified against the revolution constitution\\". Purves joined them on their invitation. he supported himself by teaching, and on 15 November 1776 was elected pastor. The site of his school and place of worship at Broughton, then near Edinburgh, was later taken by St. Paul's episcopal chapel, York Place, Edinburgh. In 1777 hemoved his residence to Wright's Houses, Bruntsfield Links, Edinburgh. Purves came to know Thomas Fyshe Palmer in 1786, sharing his politics, but not his theological positions. In 1792 the worship of the society, in the Barbers' Hall, Edinburgh, was made public, and the name \\"universalist dissenters\\" was adopted, and a declaration of opinions was issued. From 1793 the reading of scripture lessons was made a part of the public services, a practice not then common in Scotland; members were at the same time encouraged to deliver public exhortations, preliminary to the minister's discourse. Purves's congregations were very small; but he preached three time every Sunday, and advocated his views through the press. His earlier tracts were printed with his own hand, and he cast the Hebrew type for them. In the autumn of 1794 Purves ceased to preach. He died on 1 February 1795 and was buried in the Calton cemetery. His grave was in a portion of the cemetery removed in the construction of Regent Road. His congregation was without a minister till the appointment (November 1812) of Thomas Southwood Smith; it later moved to St. Mark's Chapel, Castle Terrace, Edinburgh. ==Works== Purves published: * A Short Abstract of the Principles … of the United Societies in Scotland. … By the said Societies, &c.;, no place or printer 1771. * An Inquiry into the Institution and End of Civil Government, &c.;, no place or printer, 1775, * Observations on Prophetic Time and Similitudes, &c.;, Edinburgh, pt. i. 1777; pt. ii. no place, 1778. * Observations on the Conduct of … the Reformed Presbytery, &c.;, Edinburgh, 1778; this includes A Short Letter to Mr. Fairly (24 April 1772), An Extract from a Letter to Mr. Thorburn (July 1777), and A Copy of the Letter sent to Mr. John M'Millan (24 October 1777, by Alexander Forton). * The Original Text and a Translation of the Forty-sixth Psalm, with Annotations, &c.;, Edinburgh, 1779. * A Hebrew Grammar without Points, &c.;, Edinburgh, 1779. * An Essay toward a … Translation of some parts of the Hebrew Scriptures, &c.;, Edinburgh, 1780, (anon.; three numbers issued). * An Humble Attempt to investigate … the Scripture Doctrine concerning the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, &c.;, 2nd edit.

It was originally operated by the Cambrian Railways, connecting with it at the former Oswestry and Newtown Railway station in the town of Welshpool. The line was built through difficult country, having a great number of curves in order to reach the summit of . This meant that the engines had to be built to a compact and sturdy design capable of handling trains on the steep gradients. The engines built to these specifications were No.1 The Earl and No.2 The Countess. They were both delivered new, to the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway. The locomotives were named in honour of the Earl and Countess of Powys as the Earl did much to support the construction of the railway. In the Great Western era, The Countess had its name shortened to Countess. The Earl and Countess ran the line from 1903 until closure of the railway in 1956. The engines were overhauled at Oswestry Works and were sent there on closure of the railway. Preservation Cyfronydd By 1959 negotiations had begun with British Railways and the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway Preservation Company had leased the line from British Railways by the end of 1962. On 28 July 1961, The Earl returned after storage and overhaul at Oswestry Works, with Countess following not long after. They have continued to work on the line ever since. ==Design== The two locomotives are almost identical engines with side tanks and Walschaerts valve gear. During their lifetime they have had many modifications, particularly after the takeover of the Great Western.

Donka is the largest public hospital in Guinea. Guinea faces a number of ongoing health challenges. == Health infrastructure == Guinea has been reorganizing its health system since the Bamako Initiative of 1987 formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population, in part by implementing user fees. The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services. A comprehensive strategy was extended to all areas of health care, with subsequent improvement in health indicators and improvement in health care efficiency and cost. Ethnographic research conducted in rural and urban areas of the Republic of Guinea explored perceived distinctions between biomedical and traditional health practices and found that these distinctions shape parental decisions in seeking infant health care, with 93% of all health expenditure taking place outside the state sector. In June 2011, the Guinean government announced the establishment of an air solidarity levy on all flights taking off from national soil, with funds going to UNITAID to support expanded access to treatment for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria.UNITAID.

Ebola  Ebola outbreak as of 18 June 2014. In 2014 there was an outbreak of the Ebola virus in Guinea. In response, the health ministry banned the sale and consumption of bats, thought to be carriers of the disease. Despite this measure, the virus eventually spread from rural areas to Conakry. HIV/AIDS An estimated 170,000 adults and children were infected at the end of 2004. Surveillance surveys conducted in 2001 and 2002 show higher rates of HIV in urban areas than in rural areas. Prevalence was highest in Conakry (5%) and in the cities of the Forest Guinea region (7%) bordering Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. HIV is spread primarily through multiple-partner heterosexual intercourse. Men and women are at nearly equal risk for HIV, with young people aged 15 to 24 most vulnerable. Surveillance figures from 2001–2002 show high rates among commercial sex workers (42%), active military personnel (6.6%), truck drivers and bush taxi drivers (7.3%), miners (4.7%), and adults with tuberculosis (8.6%). Several factors are fueling the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Guinea. They include unprotected sex, multiple sexual partners, illiteracy, endemic poverty, unstable borders, refugee migration, lack of civic responsibility, and scarce medical care and public services. Malaria Guinea’s entire population is at risk of malaria. According to the Ministry of Health, malaria is the primary cause of consultations, hospitalizations, and deaths in the general population. Among children less than five years of age, malaria accounts for 31 percent of consultations, 25 percent of hospitalizations, and 14 percent of hospital deaths in public facilities. Transmission is year-round with high transmission from July through October in most areas. The majority of infections are caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Between 2011 and 2018, Guinea’s malaria program achieved many major milestones: two universal coverage campaigns with long- lasting insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), decreased stockouts of artemisinin- based combination therapies, the rollout of rapid diagnostic tests, and the recent parasitemia estimates that noted a significant decrease of the prevalence of malaria in children under 5 years of age between the 2012 Demographic and Health Survey (44 percent) and 2016 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (15 percent). The national malaria strategy involves free continuous distribution of ITNs through antenatal care, vaccination clinics, schools, and mass campaigns. Malnutrition Malnutrition is a serious problem for Guinea. A 2012 study reported high chronic malnutrition rates, with levels ranging from 34% to 40% by region, as well as acute malnutrition rates above 10% in Upper Guinea’s mining zones. The survey showed that 139,200 children suffer from acute malnutrition, 609,696 from chronic malnutrition and further 1,592,892 suffer from anemia. Degradation of care practices, limited access to medical services, inadequate hygiene practices and a lack of food diversity explain these levels. Maternal and child healthcare The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Guinea is 680. This is compared with 859.9 in 2008 and 964.7 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 146 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 29.

TB treatment success rate is 77% (2016). TB mortality rate is 46 per 100,000 people (2017) . Approximately 70% of TB patients in Lesotho are co-infected with HIV . HIV/AIDS Lesotho is severely afflicted by HIV/AIDS and has one of the highest infection rates in the world.\\"The World Factbook\\" . cia.gov. The rate has hovered around 25 percent since 2005, although recent trends show new infections decreasing. In 2005 there were 30,000 new infections compared to 21,000 new infections in 2016. In urban areas, about 50 percent of women under 40 have HIV. The country regards HIV as one of its most important development issues, and the government is addressing the pandemic through its HIV/AIDS National Strategic Plan. Coverage of some key HIV/AIDS interventions has improved, including prevention of mother to child transmission and antiretroviral therapy. Prevention of mother to child transmission coverage increased from about 5 percent in 2005, to 31 percent in 2007. The roll-out of antiretroviral therapy has made good progress, with 38,586 people receiving treatment by 2008. The \\"Know Your Status\\" campaign boosted the number of people being tested for HIV to 229,092 by the end of 2007, 12 percent of the population and three times the number tested in 2005. The program is funded by the Clinton Foundation and started in June 2006. Bill Clinton and Microsoft chairman Bill Gates visited Lesotho in July 2006 to assess its fight against AIDS. As a result, the annual rate at which adults in the population who are HIV-negative become HIV-positive declined from 2.9 percent in 2005 to 2.3 percent in 2007, lowering the estimated annual number of new infections from 26,000 to 21,560. These are the first signs of a decline in the HIV epidemic. The Apparel Lesotho Alliance to Fight AIDS is an industry-wide program providing prevention and treatment, including ARVs when these are necessary, for the 46,000 mainly women workers in the Lesotho apparel industry. It was launched in May 2006. The program is helping to combat two of the key drivers of the HIV/AIDS epidemic: poverty and gender inequality. Surveys within the industry by ALAFA show that 43 percent of employees have HIV. Prince Harry of UK co-founded the charity Sentebale in Lesotho, for children with HIV/AIDS. The other co-founder is the Prince of Lesotho. ==References== ","title":"Health in Lesotho"},{"id":"35324582","text":"Manhan folk songs (漫瀚调; transliterated from Mongolian means “folk songs in desert areas” in Chinese) are very popular in Zhunger Banner (Ordos).Ma, Liqing (2005). The Original Xiongnu, An Archaeological Exploration of the Xiongnu's History and Culture. Hohhot: Inner Mongolia University Press. Dalate Banner(Ordos)(Banner is a Mongolian administrative unit which equals a county), and Tumote Banners(covering the borderland of Huhhot.Walther Heissig, Mongolische Literatur, in Michael Weiers (editor), Die Mongolen, Beiträge zu ihrer Geschichte und Kultur, Darmstadt 1986, p. 70-85 and Baotou3) of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in China. Melody and lyrics are its two principal features. In melody, it primarily bases on boginoduu(short-tune Mongolian song of Erdos), taking merits of Mountain-climbing Song at the same time; in lyrics, it largely relies on Mandarin Chinese, emphasizing the combination of Chinese and Mongolian language as well. Several masterpieces are “Wang’ai Lama Temple”, “Planting a Willow”, “Chairman Mao brings us Happiness”. ==History== The word “Manhan” originates from Mongolian, meaning “touradon” “sand beaches” or “desert”, a kind of typical landscape of Zhunger Banner (Ordos) which is also the birthplace of the Manhan Folk Song In 1996, Zhunger Banner was named the “Hometown of Manhan Folk Song of China” by the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China. In 2008, Manhan folk song was listed into the Intangible Cultural Heritage. The Ordos were predominantly Mongoloid The 19th century, during which period the two emperors Jiaqing and Daoguang of Qing dynasty were in their rein, witnessed the flooding of Han Chinese into the Zhunger area where Mongolians gather due to the imperial edict that more people should be reared on that land. The complexity of population and production modes (agriculture and animal husbandry) jointly promoted the flourishing of folk arts and thus gives birth to Manhan Folk Song. In Mongolia's time under the Qing dynasty, a number of Chinese novels were translated into Mongolian Traditionally, Ordos territory has been divided into seven banners. It can be safely concluded that Manhan Folk Song is peculiar to Zhunger Banner for two major reasons. For one thing, many songs are named after places and persons in Zhunger. For example, “Shuangshanliang Song”, “Heyanliang Song”, “Heidaigou Song”, “Jvhetan Song”, “Deshengxi Song” etc. are all named directly from some villages of Zhunger. For example, “The Coquettish Woman”, “A Playboy to Recruit Soldiers” are all famous songs of the second kind. There are several singing styles of Manhan Folk Song, such as solo, love duet and unison. And the love duet is the most popular one. Usually the woman raises a question and the man answers, or vice versa. They make impromptu lyrics and often tell a story about their daily life through performing. When a man and a woman sing in duet with co-tune cavity, the man side often employs falsetto. ==Melody== Ordos plateau is vast in territory which helps to nurture the kind of personality of generosity and enthusiasm, and in turn influences the melody of Manhan Folk Song. The Song bases its tuning on a pentatonic (five-note) scale, with great turnings and intensity of emotions. The intervals of octave or even over octave are used frequently in the melody of Manhan Folk Song, which shows the dynamic combination of multi-timbre, but also fluency and integrity. ==References== Category:Chinese folk songs Category:Mongolian music ","title":"Manhan folk song"},{"id":"35324583","text":"The Atwater Tract Office is a historic train station located in Glendale, California.

Before the Mozambican Civil War, healthcare was heavily influenced by the Portuguese. After the Civil War, the conflict affected the country's health status and ability to provide services to its people, breeding the host of health challenges the country faces in present day. Mozambique faces a number of ongoing health challenges including both infectious and chronic disease. Limited access to quality food and water, high levels of poverty and inaccessible health services influence health and prevalence of disease among people in Mozambique. Through national and international organizations, public programming, clinical work, and education, Mozambique is working tto remedy these risk factors and to improve the health and wellbeing of its population. == Health conditions == Mozambique is plagued by a series of health conditions, both communicable and chronic. The most prevalent diseases in Mozambique include perinatal disorders, HIV, and malaria. Many of said conditions in Mozambique are a result of similar risk factors, including the leading risk factor of malnutrition.Rufina Koreia (96 years old) in front of her house in Zembe village, Manica province of Mozambique, struggling with malaria.  Communicable diseases   Malaria  In Mozambique, malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially among children and relating to maternal mortality. Mozambique, Disease prevention and control, Malaria. World Health Organisation, Accessed 26.06.14 For instance, a study in the early 1990s found that 15.5% of all maternal moralities in the Mozambican capital of Maputo were due to malaria. Malaria represents approximately 45% of all outpatient cases, 56% of inpatient cases at pediatric clinics, and 26% of all hospital deaths in Mozambique. According to the Demographic Health Survey of 2011, the prevalence of malaria among children under the age of five years old is 46.3% in rural areas and 16.8% in urban areas of Mozambique. This fact is supported by a study conducted by Ricardo Thompson et al. and published by the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, which found that malaria is more prevalent in suburban areas than in urban areas due to a higher dispersal of infection, more nesting sites, and a less dense population, making disease control more difficult. Malaria is endemic throughout Mozambique with seasonal peaks during and after the rainy season. The seasonal intensity of transmission varies depending on the amount of rain and the air temperature.  HIV/AIDS  In 2011, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Mozambique was 11.5% for civilians between the ages of 15 and 49.UNAIDS World AIDS Day Report 2011. UNAIDS.org The distribution of HIV/AIDS throughout the country is not even, with certain provinces, including the provinces of Maputo and Gaza, having incidence rates twice as high as the national average. In 2011, health authorities estimated that 1.7 million Mozambicans were HIV-positive, of whom 600,000 were in need of anti-retroviral treatment. However, as of December 2011 only 240,000 Mozambicans were receiving this treatment. In response to high rates of HIV incidence and low rates of treatment in Mozambique, the government implemented a national initiative to combat HIV/AIDS with anti-retroviral treatments at the day clinic level. According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report, the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Mozambique appears to be slowing, as evidenced by the fact that in March 2014 over 416,000 Mozambicans were receiving anti-retroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS continues to maintain a high incidence rate in females in Mozambique due to gender norms and religious involvement. According to a 2005 study by Victor Agadjanian published in the Journal of Social Science and Medicine, women are deficient as compared to men in both knowledge of HIV/AIDS infection and prevention of the disease. In the future, Mozambique may look towards religious institutions for public health campaigns related to HIV/AIDS in order to mitigate these disparities.  Chronic diseases   Malnutrition  Mozambican children - often bloated bellies are a sign of malnutrition. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), malnutrition affected 43.7% of Mozambican children between the years of 2005 and 2011. The primary causes of malnutrition in Mozambique are poor diets, insufficient food intake, and multiple and/or reoccurring infectious diseases. Similarly, in 2007 study by Cambridge University, it was found that over 2 million children suffer from Vitamin A deficiency, the most prevalent pediatric nutrient deficiency in the country. There has been steady progress over the past 20 years with declining rates of underweight children and deaths by malnutrition and its related consequences. According to a study by Jan Low et al. published in the Journal of Nutrition, Mozambique is combating this deficiency using an integrated approach of both food and supplements. Maternal malnutrition is also a primary concern for Mozambique, as it has direct consequences on fetal and infant growth and disease prevalence. Additionally, a 2003 study by Francesco Burchi published in the Journal of Economics and Human Biology found that an increase in maternal schooling, especially when supplemented with nutritional education, significantly decreases childhood malnutrition rates of those children raised by educated mothers. Current public health interventions in Mozambique seek to reduce rates of malnutrition by studying risk factors of malnutrition and food insecurity in urban and rural areas, as well as addressing historical and current social determinants of health at the primary health care level.  Maternal and child health  One of few delivered successfully at a health post in a rural Mozambican village. According to a USAID report, there has been significant expansion in maternal and child health programming since the turn of the century. For example, the report cites that 97 percent of pregnant women in Mozambique now have access to pre- natal care. Additionally, the Overseas Development Institute has stated that infant mortality and child-under-five mortality rates in Mozambique have both been reduced by over 50% between the years of 1997 and 2011. Per the same source, maternal mortality rates also declined faster during this 14-year period than in any other sub-saharan country – falling from 692/100.000 to 408/100.000 between 1997 and 2011. Health resources for pregnant women in Mozambique have also been improving in order to be more accessible in recent years thanks to overarching government initiatives in human rights, which influence access to information, education, and resources to women in need. In Mozambique 23% of women are of reproductive age and 46% are younger than 15. Because of this large proportion of women potentially requiring access to sexual, reproductive, and maternal healthcare, domestic and international initiatives have been in the works since 2000 to remove legal barriers to women’s access to these services. == References == ","title":"Health in Mozambique"},{"id":"35324602","text":"There was a resurgence of malaria in São Tomé and Príncipe in 2010, but the exact cause is unknown.

Part of the Harz National Park, it runs from the town of Ilsenburg at the foot of the mountain range up to the source region near the summit of the Brocken massif, the highest mountain of the range. The scenic valley is a popular hiking area. As one approaches the steep northwestern edge of the Harz, one can see its more prominent peaks. Between Goslar and Wernigerode, the mountains are especially striking, where their slopes rise steeply from the northern foothills. Between the mountains of the Harz rim run deep gorges. These include those of the Ilse river as well as the parallel valleys of the Oker, Ecker and Bode (Bode Gorge). Heine memorial tablet Heinrich Heine, the famous German writer, described the Ilse valley with its little river and the rocks of the Ilsestein enthroned above it. In the 1830s, a country road was built from Ilsenburg through the Ilse valley running past the Brocken massif up to Schierke, paid for by Count Henry of Stolberg-Wernigerode (1772–1854). The road made it much easier for tourists to reach the higher mountain regions; today it is closed to public traffic. The Brocken () can be climbed from Ilsenburg () via the 'Heinrich Heine Way' and the Plessenburg lodge on a long hiking trail.

The organization is credited with defeating as much as $47.5 billion in proposed taxes since it began in 1982, although critics say some of the tax initiatives the group fought against would have been defeated anyway. Ax the Tax was founded by Doug Guetzloe, a political consultant and owner of a public relations and marketing firm. He has led the organization to 17 successful anti-tax battles. Guetzloe has been described as having “a sharp sense of humor, an acerbic tongue and a populist message,” according to a reporter for the Orlando Sentinel, which “has built Ax the Tax into a small but highly motivated grass-roots force.” Opponents of the organization claim its anti-tax crusades have taken funding away for environmental lands, schools and roads, but supporters have described many of the tax proposals as “boondoggles,” including multibillion-dollar rail projects that have been rejected by Florida voters four times. The organization was formed following an attempt to construct a downtown Orlando sports arena in 1982 at a cost of $110 million with a sales tax increase. The tax proposal was rejected by 62 percent of the voters. Among the group’s other victories was the defeat of an $8.8 billion road and transportation plan in Orange County in 2003. The group’s effort to defeat an education tax a year earlier failed. Ax the Tax helped in defeating property and sales tax increases in Orange, Seminole, Osceola, Leon, and Broward counties, forming Ax the Tax affiliates in those areas.

The country have major socioeconomic and health inequalities between the country’s urban and rural populations, further, the indigenous population lives in more disadvantaged conditions and experiences greater vulnerability in health. In general, the population living in more marginalized areas has less service coverage and less access to health care.https://www.paho.org/salud-en-las-americas-2017/?page_id=145 ==Burden of disease== The burden of disease in Panama consists mainly of non-communicable diseases (76,99% of total deaths). Communicable diseases stands for 13,17% of total deaths, and injuries 9,84% of total deaths.https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/.

There was a 9 year gap in 2014 between Panama City with the highest life expectancy, 79 years, and the indigenous reservation Ngäbe-Buglé Comarca the lowest at 70 years. ==Maternal mortality== Maternal mortality remained at 58.5 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2014, with major differences between urban areas (30.6 deaths per 100,000) and rural areas (110.8 per 100,000). The disparity was particularly acute in indigenous territories (303.4 per 100,000 in the Ngäbe Buglé region). Thus, Panama did not meet the goal for reduction of maternal mortality set by the Millennium Development Goals, which called for no more than 12.5 deaths per 100,000 live births. ==Child health== In 2014, the infant mortality rate was 13.8 per 1,000 live births in Panama, while neonatal mortality was 7.9 per 1,000 live births, up from 6.8 in 2010. Thus, the infant mortality target (for the first year of life) of 6.3 per 1,000 live births was not achieved. There are inequalities, as evident in the disparity between the country’s highest infant mortality rate (21.0 per 1,000 live births in Guna Yala) and the lowest (6.6 in Los Santos).https://www.paho.org/salud-en-las-americas-2017/?p=4289.

In 2013, 15.9% of school-age children suffered from chronic malnutrition, and 3.4% had serious stunting. Chronic malnutrition is more prevalent in areas with indigenous populations. 33.8% of children aged 6 and 59 months and 23.2% of pregnant women suffer from anemia. In 2008, an increase in overweight was observed at the national level, with a prevalence of 10% in pre-schoolers, 30% in schoolchildren, 25% in adolescents, and 57% in adults.https://www.paho.org/salud-en-las-americas-2017/?page_id=145 ==HIV/AIDS== Panama has a concentrated HIV/AIDS epidemic, with adult prevalence rates estimated at 0.92%.https://www.who.int/hiv/HIVCP_PAN.pdf In 2016, there were 21.000 people living with HIV in Panama, 54% were accessing antiretroviral therapy.

Since 2010, new HIV infections have increased by 9% and AIDS-related deaths have increased by 20%. The key populations that are most affected are transgender people (15%), gay men and other men who have sex with men (13,06%), Prisoners (6,4%) and sex workers (2%) https://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/panama. ==Neglected Tropical Diseases== Panama has a range of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) such as Malaria, Dengue, Chikungunya, Leishmaniasis, Soil-transmitted helminthiasis, Hookworm, Chagas disease, and more recently also the Zika virus. Most of the NTDs are present in the country’s rural regions.https://www.iamat.org/country/panama/risk/malaria The indigenous populations are especially vulnerable to neglected tropical diseases.Hotez, Peter J, Woc-Colburn, Laila & Bottazzi, Maria Elena, 2014.

However, the distribution of health workers is inequitable (in 2011, only 12.3% of doctors were serving in the country’s rural areas, where 33% of the population lives).

There were high rates of infant mortality, malaria, and water-borne diseases. ==Healthcare== The public healthcare system consists of *Ministry of Health which provides free health services to 79.5% of the population *Salvadoran Institute for Social Security, which provides health insurance for 18.4% of the population *Teacher’s Welfare *Military Health *Higher Council for Public Health *Salvadoran Institute for the Rehabilitation of Disabled Persons In 1984 there were ten general hospitals and twelve health centers in the country. The Medical School of the National University was closed in 1980. There are now 30 public hospitals in El Salvador, plus various primary care facilities and 27 basic health care systems. Before 2009 a “voluntary” donation was demanded to access a public hospital or clinic. Clinics staffed by Community Health Teams have been established in the rural areas. Although services are supposed to be a free, a shortage of funds means that people may have to pay for supplies. Emergency services are very basic. The private health sector offers care in medical facilities concentrated in urban areas.

Guatemala’s Constitution states that every citizen has the universal right to health care. However, this right has been hard to guarantee due to limited government resources and other problems regarding access. The health care system in place today developed out of the Civil War in Guatemala. The Civil War prevented social reforms from occurring, especially in the sector of health care. == Health Care System == Today, there have been many reforms to the health care system, but the current system continues to have significant problems. The country is on its way to develop a solid health care system, and is working toward achieving many of the Millennium Development Goals in place. However, the inequalities that are associated with outcomes and access have not been addressed, making it difficult for Guatemala to move forward in the field of health care. The ratio of doctors to residents is low, at .9 doctors per 1,000 citizens. The system requires a lot of change in order to serve the whole Guatemalan community.  History  When the Civil War broke out in Guatemala, social improvements in health care were brought to a halt. The period of the 34-year Civil War (from 1954-mid 1980s) resulted in many changes within the health sector. The focus on health care was generally abandoned throughout the period of war when the country experienced a period of \\"privatization through attrition,\\" which generated poor service and low health care coverage for decades to follow. As Verduga mentions, the total GDP expenditures on health was only about 1 to 2 percent during this period of war. Therefore, it was the emergence of NGOs and other community organizations that allowed for basic health care to be provided to the general population. Once the Guatemalan Civil War ended in 1996 with the signing of the Peace Accords, health care was placed in the hands of a new democratic government. Immediately after the war, Guatemala saw little change in the healthcare sector. However, starting in 1999, the health care system was improved with increased government spending and aid. Although this was a drastic improvement from the times of war, the system was still insufficient and did not come close to meeting all of the needs of the Guatemalan people.  Structure and Coverage  Today, the Guatemalan health care system is split into three separate divisions: the public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit sectors. Within the public sector, there is the Ministry of Health and Social Security (MOH), the Guatemalan Social Security Institute (IGSS), and the Military Health Service. This sector of the health care system formally covers about 88% of the population. The private sector, which accounts for about 12% of the population, includes many for-profit providers, non-profit entities, and traditional local providers. The public sector works to provide care through hospitals, health facilities, and various health centers, whereas the private sector allocates resources within private offices, clinics, and hospitals. Very few funds are allocated to health care within Guatemala. As a share of GDP, health care spending in Guatemala is one of the lowest in Central America (2.6 percent). The GDP expenditure shows that few funds are allocated to the health care system in Guatemala. In total, the Guatemalan government's expenditures on health were about $196 US dollars in 2010. This amount was significantly less than the total Central American average ($350) and the average Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) expenditures ($672). The health care system requires more funds to improve the coverage and overall health care system in Guatemala. The Peace Accords, which were signed in 1996, called for a change in health provision goals. In 1997, the MOH established a program called the Expansion of Coverage Program (PEC), which worked to improve the availability of health and nutrition services to young children and women in rural areas of Guatemala. As Pena explains, current MOH services do not cover the poor, rural population of Guatemala, making the PEC critical to the rural population. Ever since its creation, the PEC has expanded immensely, now covering about 54% of the health and nutrition needs of rural Guatemalans. The coverage program works with NGOs in the area to promote good health and nutrition to populations who lack sufficient health care. However, important accountability systems regarding transparency and progress were not installed, limiting the program's effectiveness. The services covered by the PEC include care for women and infants, illnesses and emergency care, and environmental care. There is also an informal sector of healthcare that is often overlooked. Termed the \\"Maya Mobile Clinic\\" or the \\"Other Public Health\\", traveling salespeople (often men) are a medical resource for Guatemalans living in the highlands. These salespeople offer raw and natural ingredients to mainly indigenous populations and give talks about their health qualities. Maya Mobile Clinics act as a midpoint between the physical distance of the Guatemalan highlands and public clinic locations, and as a midpoint between the cultural gap that separates Maya medicinal norms and values from Guatemala's public health sector's medicinal norms and values. == Conditions == There are many communicable diseases and conditions that threaten the livelihood of the Guatemalan people on a day-to-day basis. Infectious diseases are still the number one cause of death for people in developing countries, whereas in the developed world, infectious diseases are no longer a significant problem. Furthermore, in Guatemala, parasites, diabetes, and malnutrition are huge health problems. Diabetes threatens development in many rural Mayan communities within Guatemala. In order to attack this problem head-on, “health service efforts must be culturally appropriate and emphasize awareness, prevention, early detection, and universal treatment”. Also, malnutrition remains a huge problem among children and adults in Guatemala. Given the prevalence of poverty, many residents have limited access to quality nutrition, limited education, and higher rates of disease. Even though there have been improvements, Guatemala is still characterized by high infant and maternal morbidity and mortality rates, pervasive malnutrition, and high incidences of infectious diseases.\\"Poverty in Guatemala: Guatemala poverty assessment. Poverty reduction and economic management unit for the Latin American and the Caribbean region.\\" World Bank. 1995. Washington, DC: World Bank. p. 64 http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1995/04/697460/guatemala-assessment- poverty Also, in Guatemala, the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes and obesity has risen. An image of a rural village in the highlands of Guatemala  Communicable Diseases  In Guatemala, communicable diseases for which treatment exists are still one of the major causes of death. Wealthy, more industrialized developed nations have been able to eliminate communicable diseases due to an epidemiological transition, in which death rates due to degenerative diseases have surpassed those of communicable and infectious diseases. The opposite is apparent in Guatemala. The high mortality rate for infants is a direct result of communicable and infectious diseases. Similarly, the epidemiological profile of Guatemala shows that some of the most prevalent infectious diseases, like diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, are a direct result of poverty. In Guatemala, 56 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Poverty levels are greatest in the indigenous communities of Guatemala, which account for about 81 percent of those living in poverty, and make up about 43 percent of Guatemala's total population. High levels of poverty make the population more vulnerable to communicable diseases, which is why government funding of health care is necessary for the rural areas of Guatemala. Even though Guatemala has improved its health care system substantially since the end of the Guatemalan Civil War, mortality rates for communicable diseases still show that considerable progress needs to be made to remove the burden of infectious diseases on the population. In a country like Guatemala, water is poor and frequently contaminated. In order to decrease common communicable diseases like diarrhea, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and respiratory disease, clean water and sanitation are necessary. With the health care system's provision of both clean water and food, the incidence of infectious and communicable diseases will decrease.  Parasites  Parasites present one of the biggest threats to health in Guatemala. Many of the common parasites in developing countries like Guatemala are spread through contamination of both water and food. Some of the effects of parasites include intestinal obstructions, which can hinder the body from absorbing nutrients, lead to a loss of appetite, impair long term growth, induce vomiting, cause anemia and anorexia, and in severe cases, cause death. Symptoms can also include intense abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, diarrhea, and fever. E. histolytica, a parasite that is very common among children in Guatemala It has been seen that the prevalence of parasites is significantly higher among younger children and those who are malnourished. Parasites are usually transferred through contaminated water, making them dangerous because they are able to induce malnutrition by consuming the body's nutrients, thus impeding a child's physical development. For school children who are infected with parasites, cognitive functioning can drastically decrease, directly impacting their education. School children who have been treated for parasites immediately perform significantly better in school settings. Parasite infections can also vary based on access to clean water and whether or not sewage disposal is present. The Millennium Development Goals discussed the importance of deworming to help meet the goals set by the United Nations. Parasites can have serious long-term consequences in that they directly affect development and health for decades after. However, inexpensive, single-dose medications exist that can fully treat these parasitic infections.  Diabetes  Diabetes is a significant problem within the Guatemalan population. As a rising public health concern, diabetes largely threatens the indigenous population of Guatemala. Because this population frequently has limited access to the Guatemalan health care system, knowledge about the emergence of diabetes is also incredibly limited. Indigenous areas are particularly under-resourced with respect to doctors and overall health care programs. A risk factor for diabetes within the indigenous population is dietary change over time. Changes in indigenous diets were a result of structural and economic changes, which forced the rural population to resort to energy-dense foods that are extremely high in saturated fats and simple carbohydrates. These simple carbohydrates can be found throughout Guatemalan cuisine, especially corn, which is one of the staple foods of the Guatemalan diet. This in turn leads to the higher prevalence of Type 2 diabetes, because the entire population has added more fats and sugars into their diets. A large issue for the indigenous population and the greater Guatemalan population in general is access to medication. Medication used to treat diabetes is very expensive and would require the Guatemalan government to devote significant resources to provide medication for every diabetic. However, diabetes is a manageable disease, and can also be treated with frequent physical activity and a change in diet, focused on management and healthy choices.  Pesticide Poisoning  Due to farming conditions and yield pressures in Guatemala, many agricultural workers are at high risk of pesticide poisoning. People often handle pesticides without protective clothing or gear, soaking it in through their skin and inhaling it into their lungs. A large black market and lack of oversight over legal pesticide use in Guatemala also contributes to its rampant and unsafe use. Pesticide poisoning most likely disproportionately affects indigenous farm workers. == Mayan Health == One aspect of the Guatemalan health care system is its focus on Mayan health. Because the Mayan population is so prevalent in Guatemala, it is necessary to consider their barriers to quality health care. Taking into account the language barriers, diet, and living conditions, the Mayan population suffers enormously when it comes to proper health care. The life expectancy for Mayans can be up to 10 or 15 years lower than other Guatemalans. Since the Civil War, the Mayan population generally resides in poverty stricken areas, and therefore has limited access to the healthcare that is available to the Ladinos, or non- indigenous population. Variations of maize that are a staple food in the Mayan diet  Medical Pluralism  Indigenous Guatemalan communities deal with medical pluralism, or the intersection of beliefs and uses regarding traditional and biomedical healthcare. Traditional Maya medical care involves plant medicine and ethnomedical practitioners who learn in one-on-one or self- taught settings. Western medical systems and the Guatemalan public health system have been criticized for not considering ethnomedical practices to be legitimate, and interest among indigenous Guatemalans in taking on ethnomedical apprenticeships has been declining, resulting in tension between practices.  Language and Diet  In Guatemala, about 45% of the Ladino population lives in poverty, while about 91% of the indigenous population succumbs to extreme poverty levels. This large difference appears in other aspects of life as well, like family planning, susceptibility to disease, education level, and access to health care. Such inequalities can largely be attributed to a large language barrier between the indigenous population and the non-indigenous peoples. Generally, the indigenous people of Guatemala speak only a variety of local Mayan languages. In relation to health care, these language barriers can be significant. Most of the medical professionals that serve the indigenous communities are Ladino, and speak Spanish only. Communicating health related issues to a patient under these conditions becomes an obstacle, which in turn causes indigenous people to avoid health care centers altogether. The indigenous population is unable to communicate with the doctors directly, which is both difficult and embarrassing. Ishida et al. discovered that the combination of poverty and language barriers made indigenous women less likely to seek services from health care providers. The Mayan diet is different from the diet of non-indigenous Guatemalans. Throughout their history, the Maya have used maize as a principal crop. Staple foods of the Mayan diet today are corn and beans. The better cash crops like greens, tomatoes, fruits, eggs, and poultry are mainly sold to Ladinos and are not purchased by Mayans. Therefore, Mayan nutrition is very poor because it includes little besides starches and protein. Corn has a significant amount of carbohydrates, which in turn increases blood sugar levels. This increase in blood sugar makes diabetes a very common disease within the Mayan population. Also, with this lack of crucial nutrients, malnutrition is very prominent in the indigenous population.  Living Conditions  The Mayan people frequently live in rural villages of Guatemala, which are generally known to be impoverished areas. About 80% of indigenous Guatemalans live below the \\"international poverty line.\\" Very few Mayan families have the economic stability to devote money towards health care. With the high prices of medications and the poor quality of health posts, impoverished patients refuse to use or trust the westernized health care system. For centuries, the relationship between the Ladinos and the Mayans has been antagonistic. Throughout the period of the Guatemalan Civil War, Mayans were excluded from land and water resources as well as educational, health care, political, and economic resources. Even in today's modern age, the effects of exclusion and deprivation from the war are still felt my many indigenous Mayans. This directly affects health care because the Mayan population does trust Western medicine and hospitals. Similarly, the Ladino doctors that work in the health field make the indigenous people feel powerless and guarded instead of supported. Many indigenous Guatemalans survive on below-subsistence agriculture. Farms are not large enough to sustain large-scale subsistence farming, making the overall yield exceptionally low. Because of the limited amount of farmland, its unequal distribution, and the growing population, poverty continues to ravish the Mayan civilizations. The concrete living distance also plays a role in health care accessibility for indigenous population. More than likely, these rural villages where the Mayans reside are located close to an hour walk away from any health clinic or post. The inaccessibility of the clinics leads to fewer visits and more health complications in the indigenous population. Government run hospitals are located in the main cities of several provinces. Indigenous peoples' highland locality - often distant from main cities - makes travel to these hospitals expensive, further limiting access. Taking advantage of the importance of midwifery in many indigenous traditional medicinal systems, the Ministry of Public Health decided to better reach indigenous populations through midwife training programs in the 1980s. However, the quality, efficacy, and cultural sensitivity of these programs has been brought into question. == Children and Women's Health == For women and children, the health discrepancies are very visible. In children, infant mortality and malnutrition are rampant. Severe health and nutritional deficiencies are associated with deaths of children under the age of 5. Similarly, physical and mental development can be severely impacted by malnutrition in children. On the other hand, women’s health focuses on preventable deaths related to pregnancy, delivery, and post- pregnancy complications. Most of the time, services that are provided for contraceptive health do not reach the at-risk population. At-risk women and infants frequently die because of their limited access to quality health care, as well as their perilous living conditions. Many programs have been implemented to try and incorporate all levels of reproductive health in order to improve care for these populations.  Infants  In Guatemala, infant mortality continues to be a big problem. As of 2015, it is estimated that Guatemala's infant mortality rate is 22.73 for every 1,000 live births. As mentioned, rural areas of Guatemala exhibit the highest levels of morbidity and infant mortality because health care in those areas is largely inaccessible. Generally, infant mortality rates are used as an indicator of general health levels in a particular country. Infants are more susceptible to infectious diseases and conditions like malaria, which can cause severe morbidity, and even death. For infants, physical growth is critical to proper and successful development. Therefore, if there are insufficient nutrients being provided to the infant during this period of growth and cell proliferation, the number of neurons will be permanently reduced. In Guatemala, this issue is particularly prominent. Nutrition and proper health care is crucial in early infant development in order to insure that these infants will thrive and grow into strong children. Therefore, the nutritional deficiencies, infectious diseases, and parasitic diseases directly lead to higher mortality rates for children under the age of 5 in Guatemala. These higher mortality rates are prominent in both rural and urban areas of Guatemala when diseases are present. However, these rates are significantly higher in rural areas where limited access to health care, high levels of illiteracy, poor sanitation, and nutritional deficiencies are factored into the rate.  Malnutrition in Children  Malnutrition is a serious condition that threatens the health and well-being of many people in developing nations. In Guatemala, nutritional deficiencies have been shown to severely impact the growth and development of children both physically and mentally. Stunting and underweight are both common physical indicators for acute and chronic malnutrition in children. According to Gragnolati and Marini, over 44 percent of the Guatemalan child population is chronically malnourished. However, these numbers are even higher for indigenous populations of Guatemala (58 percent) in comparison to the non-indigenous population. Although the incidence rate of stunting has decreased in Guatemala, the rate of decline is minuscule compared to other countries in the LAC region. The high incidence of malnutrition within indigenous populations is a direct result of poor water sanitation and limited access to clean water. According to the MOH, about 98% of the water sources in Guatemala are contaminated. Disease and malnutrition are highly correlated with one another; both are causes and consequences of each other. In order to improve the health system and reduce the prevalence of malnutrition, easy availability of safe drinking water, together with disease treatment and prevention, are critical for the survival of Guatemalan children. Improvement must be implemented at the community level, by renovating infrastructures in order to provide piped water and sanitary operations for the residents. One consequence of malnutrition and undernourishment is the degradation of cognitive performance, which can be studied and observed through schoolchildren and their performance in an educational setting. This can generally be observed in poorer settings. In poverty stricken areas of Guatemala, inadequate nutrient intake can lead to higher disease rates, which can in turn expedite the poverty cycle. Breastfeeding is also critical for infants to obtain sufficient nutrients and antibodies. Malnutrition severely weakens children who are already weaker to begin with, making them more vulnerable to life-threatening illnesses. Similarly, civil conflict (from the Guatemalan Civil War period) has left the indigenous population with many barriers to combat malnutrition, which has only prevented positive outcomes of health within the population through social, political, and economic exclusion. An image of Lake Atitlán, which is a major water source in Guatemala  Reproductive Health  Reproductive health focuses on the health of infants as well as mothers. Guatemala is only beginning their transition into a more health-centered nation. The overall Guatemalan population is very young, which not only affects infant mortality rates, but significantly impacts both reproductive age and fertility rates. In Guatemala, the fertility rate is almost 5 children per mother, the highest in all of Latin America. When the reproductive age is young, there can be many catastrophic effects. The maternal mortality rate for younger mothers is much higher. Guatemala is the country with the highest rate of maternal death related to pregnancy and delivery. This high rate is the result of many different factors, but mainly, it is a consequence of the scarcity of health care services, increased prevalence of illnesses, and the marginalization of women. Similarly, with a younger reproductive age, the chances of young mothers acquiring illnesses and transferring contaminants to their infants is very high. Maternal health problems affect women throughout Guatemala, but are significantly more prevalent in poorer, more rural areas. Indigenous women frequently have unsafe living conditions, which makes them more susceptible to health related problems. This population has the highest fertility rates in Guatemala, as well as a significantly higher maternal mortality rate than the non-indigenous population. Very few births are attended by either doctors or nurses, making the indigenous population much more prone to complications related to pregnancy, delivery, or postpartum. In Guatemala, knowledge and education about contraceptives and family planning is incredibly low, especially within the indigenous population. More education about the implications of reproduction can reduce population growth while simultaneously improving both maternal and infant health. Since the end of the Civil War, the indigenous population of Guatemala had turned to traditional practices for maternal deliveries because this group distrusted modern health care facilities and services provided by non-indigenous personnel. There is very little knowledge about health care services related to pregnancy and abortions. Abortions are illegal in Guatemala, and are only permitted if it will save the mother's life. The Guatemalan government is working to address maternal mortality by increasing public spending on health care to gain a greater understanding of \\"comprehensive reproductive health.\\"  Family Planning  Typically, in Guatemala, the general population is poor and has little access to quality health care services. The indigenous population and the Ladinos generally use traditional and formal health practices respectively. In both of these practices, family planning is very different. Differences in economic and social influences determine contraceptive use, child immunizations, prenatal care, and childbirth or delivery. For the two populations within Guatemala, there are many large disparities between family planning actions. Family planning services are as scarce as health care services in the rural areas of Guatemala. Indigenous people in Guatemala are more likely to have little to no education and are often living in poverty. High poverty and illiteracy rates directly correlate with lower rates of contraceptive use. This lower rate is both a result of limited contraceptive knowledge and also the negative social stigma behind contraceptives. Guatemala's high fertility rate is a result of poor family planning initiatives, which result in young pregnancies, large families with many children, shorter birth intervals, and deficient growth within children. Similarly, breastfeeding plays a huge role in family planning, both as a nutrient and antibody source for infants, as well as a way to inhibit immediate fertility (because of the absence of menstruation) and allow for greater birth spacing. Family decisions about health care depend on many factors. Specific family dynamics, individual beliefs and decisions of the mother, and direct community influences are all aspects to take into consideration when looking at family choices. The Guatemalan government has worked to implement family education centers within its poorer populations. A family life education class provides information pertaining to sex education, as well as reproductive health. == Education == Education is an aspect of health that is generally ignored by the Guatemalan health care system. Proper education on nutrition and contraceptives has proven to impact both education levels and survival. In children, proper nutrition has been shown to accelerate development, both mentally and physically. Also, there is a large association between maternal education and a lower mortality rate of infants as well as healthier habits while pregnant. Education can also reinforce preventive measures. There is a relationship between poverty and education, but there are many possibilities within Guatemala that will allow education to prosper and serve a larger community. The lack of health education is one reason why many children and adults, through simple illnesses and pregnancies, end up dying prematurely. Health education provides mothers with resources to handle health issues and gives them access to knowledgeable sources outside their specific communities. An image of public health education, focused on hygiene, being implemented in an elementary school in rural Guatemala  Health Education  Many Guatemalans do not have enough knowledge about health care to make concrete health decisions and know the results of outcomes. Education is required in order to provide both indigenous and non- indigenous Guatemalans with the understanding to make personal health choices. The education of school children and quality nutrition status have both shown to affect adult education levels. With the implementation of nutrition interventions as children, these adults were more likely to be more educated than others in the population. Similarly, Desai and Soumya discovered that there was a great relationship between child health and maternal education; therefore, the greater the mother's education, the healthier the child. Within the Mayan population of Guatemala, education is not as accessible. However, it has also been observed that the indigenous population does not utilize health care services as readily. Delgado et al. discovered that the indigenous mothers actually did have a significant affinity for health seeking behaviors. Specifically, mothers determined which health services to frequent based on the illness of their child. However, many mothers explained that they would \\"normally not attend a medical service when their children presented the symptoms,\\" for a variety of reasons including accessibility and dissatisfaction. Education and accessibility are required in order to expand health care into the more rural areas of Guatemala and implement health care planning techniques.  Preventive Measures  Preventive measures, in the form of health care, work to improve the basic health services so that individuals can easily access them. Guatemala has shifted its focus onto preventive care, in order to serve the poorer communities that are more disadvantaged in health care. Especially in the field of Children and Women's Health, education on preventive measures can result in great health outcomes. In considering hygiene and sexually transmitted diseases, preventive education can alone hinder the onset of disease. Mothers are more likely to use health services, both as a preventive and medicinal tool, when they are educated. In the field of education, knowledge about health outcomes is necessary, as well as poor health origins. The causes of illnesses are largely unknown or completely wrong. In considering the effects of hygiene on health, education is very limited. The indigenous population of Guatemala knows little about the transmission of disease or easy, hygienic techniques that can reduce severe health problems. Even with few years of education, women in the indigenous communities were more likely to understand and adopt different hygienic beliefs in order to prevent poor health outcomes. However, because of past experiences in which Ladino communities tried to assimilate into indigenous societies, the indigenous people of Guatemala resist the idea of adopting \\"western\\" or \\"Ladino\\" health behaviors. Therefore, the implementation of education into these communities would allow for increased preventive measures as well as overall health benefits. Many of the deaths that occur frequently in Guatemala are a result of preventable and treatable diseases. Different preventive measures including sanitation, hygiene, vaccines, and education work to improve the health outcomes for many people in developing countries. There is a large discrepancy between those who are receiving preventive care and those who are not. In Guatemala, doctors only treat 24% of indigenous people, whereas they treat almost double that amount for non-indigenous Guatemalans. This statistic shows that more money can be spent working to provide preventive care services to the indigenous population of Guatemala. Preventable diseases can be eliminated with the implementation of these services and with the influence of education. == See also == *Guatemala *Education in Guatemala == References == ","title":"Health in Guatemala"},{"id":"35324972","text":"The fertility rate was approximately 3.7 per woman in Honduras in 2009.

In 2015, 91.2% of the population had access to clean drinking water, while 82.6% had access to basic sanitation. People over 60 tend to suffer from poorer social and health conditions as well as loss of functional abilities that prevent further action to good health and well-being . Approximately 46.6% do not have any formal schooling, and 79.7% lack social security coverage. Some 44.5% of the population aged 60–69 live in extreme poverty, a figure that increases to 51.2% among people aged 70–79.  Health Situations  In 2007–2012, the infant mortality rate was 24 deaths per 1,000 live births. The leading causes of death were perinatal disorders, congenital malformations, pneumonia, diarrhea, and child malnutrition. The under-5 mortality rate was 29 deaths per 1,000 live births. In 2011–2012, the prevalence of chronic malnutrition was 23% in children under 5, with higher rates in the children of mothers without schooling and from poor households. Some 34% of the population over 20 is overweight and 21% is obese, while 18.7% of adolescents aged 13–15 are overweight and 5.4% are obese. The prevalence of disability in the population was 4.4% in people over 10 years of age in 2012. In 2013–2014, 6.4% of disabilities were severe. In 2013, the reported maternal mortality ratio was 86 deaths per 100,000 live births. Institutional delivery coverage was 83%. In 2013, 19% of deaths were caused by perinatal disorders, 18% by circulatory system diseases, and 10% by respiratory system diseases. Immunization coverage in the population under 1 year in 2015 was 100% for BCG, 99% for poliomyelitis, 100% for rotavirus, 99% for the pentavalent vaccine, and 99% for pneumococcus. In the population aged 12–23 months, measles immunization coverage was 98%. Dengue is endemic in Honduras, and the largest outbreak in the past 10 years occurred in 2010. Chikungunya virus was introduced in 2014, causing an epidemic that peaked at 1,057 cases per 100,000 population in 2015. Zika virus was introduced into the country at the end of that year. Malaria transmission has fallen sharply in Honduras over the past decade. However, 921 cases were reported in 2015, a 56% increase over the previous year. A total of 2,060 cases of leishmaniasis were reported in 2015. In 2014, there were 48 reported cases of Chagas disease transmitted by trypanosoma cruzi in children under 15 and 58 cases in the population aged 15 and over. In 2015, the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was 0.4% in the population aged 15–49, transmitted mainly by heterosexual contact. The reported tuberculosis rate was 32 cases per 100,000 population. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the adult population is 7.4%, and the prevalence of hypertension is 22.6%.  Challenges  The Government has identified the following health challenges: (i) restructuring the MoH to strengthen its steering role and implement the separation of functions; (ii) implementing the Results-based Management Monitoring and Evaluation System, thereby strengthening the Integrated Health Information System; (iii) developing public policies that promote healthy habits and lifestyles; (iv) implementing the International Health Regulations; (v) monitoring compliance with the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control; (vi) retrofitting infrastructure to achieve optimal operation of the health services network; (vii) conducting research on indigenous and Afro-descendant populations to learn about evidence-based interventions; (viii) hiring relevant, high quality human talent in the necessary numbers, especially to strengthen the first level of care and ensure the continuity of the model; and (ix) strengthening activities to ensure quality care and patient safety in health facilities. ==Healthcare== Expenditure on health was 8.7% of GDP in 2014. Only 2.9% of the population is covered by private health insurance. The health system consists of a public and a private sector. The former includes the Ministry of Health and the Honduras Social Security Institute . The Ministry serves the entire population in its own facilities staffed by its own physicians and nurses, but it is estimated that only 50%-60% of Hondurans regularly use these services. The Institute covers 40% of employed economically active individuals and their dependents, using its own and contracted facilities. The private sector serves some 10%-15% of the population: those who can afford to pay or are covered by private insurance. An estimated 17% of Hondurans do not have regular access to health services. Total per capita health expenditure was US$212 in 2014, representing 8.72% of GDP. Public spending amounted to 4.4% of GDP whilst out- of-pocket spending made up 50% of total health expenditure. The National Health Model, approved in 2013, emphasizes primary health care. The Directorate-General of Human Resources Development, also created that year, is responsible for health worker development. In 2013, the country had 10.0 physicians, 3.8 nurses, and 0.3 dentists per 1,000 population. In 2015, health services management was decentralized in 82 municipalities across 15 departments in the country, covering a population of 1,337,874. The National Health Model has guided the implementation of 500 primary health care teams serving rural and remote areas of the country. The teams, each consisting of a physician, a nurse, and a health promoter, give priority to communities living in extreme poverty, environmentally vulnerable conditions, and situations of violence. By mid-2015, a total of 367 teams were already working in the field and serving 1.4 million people, promoting qualitative improvements in their attitudes and habits. In 2014, the MoH created the Information Management Unit, which is responsible for ensuring that information is accurate, timely, and appropriate for health planning, organization, direction, control, and evaluation.  Achievements and Perspectives  Prior to 2015, there was no law that legally defined the national health care model or mechanisms for regulating it. That year, the National Congress approved the Framework Law on Social Protection, which establishes a new modality for social protection. The law envisages a unified universal public health insurance system with coordinated benefits and services provided by the contributory and subsidized systems. The new model encourages a diversity of participating sectors and entities, with clear separation of the system's functions. This will require a new and improved organizational structure for social security that strengthens its steering role, the creation of a health oversight agency, and designation of the IHSS as the insurer of the national health system. More effective application of the model also requires further improvement of public health service management and greater human resource development. Efforts are being made to promote and strengthen multisectoral partnerships and the generation of evidence for the Health in All Policies approach, especially in relation to noncommunicable diseases and injuries due to external causes. Further development of national capacity and competencies for measuring equity and inequalities in health is also necessary, as is effective implementation of the human rights and gender/ethnic equality approaches. The Honduran Social Security Institute which runs the national public health system was established in 1959. People generally had to travel to Tegucigalpa to access services. In the 1970s a medical center in San Pedro Sula was opened. Services were not available until 1992 in El Progreso. The Ministry of Health in Honduras provides care to almost 90% of the population, but there is still little provision for the rural population, and there is a serious shortage of doctors. The ratio of doctor to population in 1984 was one to 1,510. In 2015, there were 10,995 registered doctors. From 2013 there was a new focus on providing more coverage to rural and poor areas and emphasized preventative care and maintenance as a way to improve public health and this has produced some improvement. Facilities There are now 7 national hospitals, located in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, 6 regional hospitals, 16 area hospitals, 436 Rural Health Centers (CESAMO), 1,078 Health Centers with Physician and Dentistry (CESAR), 74 maternal and child clinics, 3 peripheral emergency clinics (CLIPER) and 15 dental school centers (CEO).

While communicable diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika continue to persist as national health concerns, there is a rising public health threat of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, which were diseases previously thought to be more relevant and problematic for more developed nations. Additionally, in the women's health sector, high rates of adolescent pregnancy and cervical cancer continue to persist as national concerns. ==Chronic diseases== There has been an observed increasing prevalence of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. This increase in prevalence of chronic diseases has been attributed to lifestyle changes and increased urbanization. Improved access to processed foods has led to higher consumption of highly processed snacks and sugar-containing drinks in rural areas of Nicaragua, and raw sugar cane is often freely available. Complementary feeding practices involving breastfeeding paired up with supplementation of artificial snacks were frequently observed amongst 6-to 8-month-olds. These early introduction to highly processed foods leads to increased risk of infections and impaired developmental growth. In 2008, WHO reported that 55.5% of the population was overweight and 22.2% classified as obese,World Health Organization. (2011). Noncommunicable diseases country profiles 2011: Nicaragua. WHO, 139. and trends reveal that obesity rates are steadily rising. Hypertension and pre- hypertension are significant national medical concerns. Studies conducted in rural communities of Nicaragua that have revealed that 41.1% of their residents have hypertension. Beyond these patients who have met this traditional hypertensive minimum cut-off, there is also a large population of pre-hypertensive patients. Health promotional efforts that focus on preventative measures have been proposed to address this pre-hypertensive sub- population. ==Communicable diseases==  Tuberculosis  In Nicaragua, 48% of tuberculosis (TB) patients have encountered issues with employment and 27% had reported social problems because of stigma associated with the disease. In order to reduce false community beliefs and fears about tuberculosis that could be feeding into this social stigma, various solutions have been proposed and attempted in communities throughout the country. In order to increase local awareness of this disease and improve TB control, volunteer-run TB clubs have been created in municipalities across Nicaragua to facilitate the creation of supportive community networks and lead educational workshops for citizens. These TB clubs have been reported to be a cost-effective strategy for controlling the spread of TB in Nicaragua; however, some have argued that they lack sustainability in funding. Outside of the educational realm, a team of researchers found that they could reduce internalized social stigma of TB patients in rural Nicaragua by pursuing patient-centered care that allowed for medical professionals to see patients at their homes and gain a better understanding of the support given to them by their social networks.  HIV/AIDS  Though the prevalence of HIV/AIDS amongst Nicaraguan adults was estimated to be 0.3% by UNAIDS in 2015,UNAIDS (2015). Nicaragua Report. Available from: http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/country/documents/Nicaragua%20NCPI%202013.pdf in the past UNAIDS' numbers have been claimed to be grossly underreported due to data collection issues. Nicaragua's high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), high risk sexual behaviors associated with the culture of machismo, low prevalence of condom usage, and the early age of first sexual intercourse of its citizens all contribute to concerns about rising HIV/AIDS rates. In Latin America, stigma and discrimination against HIV/AIDS serve as barriers to effective responses and are linked to social inequalities associated with gender, living status, and sexuality. One study found that while 90% of Nicaraguan adolescents would accept and care for a family member with HIV/AIDS, only 69% would tell anyone else if they got diagnosed as HIV- infected and only 46% would share food with someone who was infected. Nine years following the detection of the first HIV case in Nicaragua, the Nicaraguan government instituted Law 238 to protect the rights of those infected with HIV/AIDS in regards to confidentiality, access to healthcare, and nondiscrimination,National Assembly of Nicaragua. (1999). Ley 238: Promoción, Protección y Defensa de los Derechos Humanos ante el SIDA [Law 238: For the promotion, protection, and defense of human rights of people living with HIV/ AIDS]. setting the precedent for future intervention strategies focused on decreasing AIDs stigma amongst various professionals, including health care workers.  Mosquito-transmitted diseases  The chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses co-circulate in Nicaragua, and those infected with one or multiple of these viruses can present with similar clinical symptoms, making clinical treatment and diagnosis more difficult. Co-infections are common in endemic areas in Nicaragua. Malaria has also been a historically major health issue in Nicaragua, and during the 1930s up to 60% of the population had malaria. Usage of bed-nets protecting against mosquitos have been reported to be 25.3% amongst all Nicaraguan households. Within these households, it was found that children were more often protected than adults with 46% of bed-net coverage of infants under 1 year. == Infant health == A study conducted in 2000 revealed that poverty of Nicaraguan families heightened the risk of infant mortality. Its findings also showed that social inequity, or the contrast in wealth between a household and its surrounding neighborhood, further increased this risk. In addition to income levels, it has been shown that violence against mothers increases the risk of infant and child mortality. Intimate partner abuse also contributes to low birth weight of infants. Overall decreasing national infant mortality trends correspond with higher educational levels of mothers and lower fertility rates. ==Violence against women== Out of Nicaraguan women married or previously married women of childbearing age, 52% have identified having had experienced physical violence by an intimate partner at least once. Additionally, 21% of these women report having experienced a full combination of physical, emotional, and sexual violence at one or more points in their lives. Domestic violence has immediate and lasting effects on its victims. An overwhelming majority of emotional distress cases amongst every-married Nicaraguan women is attributable to current or former experiences of domestic abuse. Domestic abuse is also correlated with higher incidence of unintended pregnancies in Nicaragua.

Founded in 1900, it is the oldest active orphanage in Israel. ==History== The orphanage was founded near the Bukharim quarter in 1900 by Rabbi Abraham Yochanan Blumenthal (1877–1966), a native of Jerusalem, who led the orphanage for 50 years. Blumenthal's wife, Shaina, served as a director for 40 years. By 1920, the Blumenthal Orphanage was home to 85 orphans. It absorbed many orphans from World Wars I and II and the Israeli War of Independence. The Blumenthal Orphanage was known for creating a family-like home environment for youth from many different religious communities – Sephardi, Ashkenazi, Hasidic, etc. The use of Hebrew as the official language of instruction further served to unite children of different countries and languages. For many decades, the orphanage was a popular site for large events. It was the venue for the inauguration of the Chief Rabbi of Israel in 1921; the first tish of the Belzer Rebbe in Jerusalem after his escape from Nazi-occupied Europe in 1944; and the wedding of Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik, rosh yeshiva of the Brisker yeshiva in Israel, in 1946. As the Geula neighborhood developed around the site of the orphanage, the institution became part of the Geula quarter. It is located two blocks north of the central intersection of Kikar HaShabbat. Its corner lot on Hoshea and Yechezkel Streets has been named Kikar Blumenthal (Blumenthal Square) in honor of the founder, Rabbi Abraham Yochanan Blumenthal.Inscription on plaque in front of building. ==Clientele== In its early years, the orphanage accommodated children whose parents had been killed by Arab marauders. Others were placed here by their poverty-stricken parents. Today, most of the residents are not orphans, but children whose parents have mental illness or addictions, or who are severely impoverished. Some are victims of physical or emotional abuse.Gordon, Rabbi Arye D. “LA Reception for Zion Blumenthal Orphanage”. ‘’Hamodia’’, 2 June 2010, p. C18. The orphanage also accepts Jewish immigrant children from Russia and Ethiopia. By the end of 2011, the orphanage houses 100 children ages 7 to 18. An additional 120 youth attend an on-site yeshiva high school named Yagdil Torah. ==Current activities== The orphanage building is constructed around a central courtyard. An outdoor playground, fully equipped gym, library and petting zoo are available to the residents.Friedman, Hadassah. \\"My Home Away From Home\\". Binah Bunch, 18 July 2011, pp. 18–19. The orphanage provides afternoon extracurricular activities such as volleyball, gymnastics, music lessons, computer room, and gardening. In 2004 the orphanage introduced the concept of mishpachtonim, or family units, for boys aged 7 to 14. There are currently five family units on the premises, where groups of 12 boys live in private apartments together with a young couple and their small children. The couple serve as dorm parents, serving and eating meals with the boys and looking after their daily needs. ==Faculty== Rabbi Baruch Rakovsky, great-grandson of the founder, is executive director. His mother, Mrs. Rivka Rakovsky, a granddaughter of the founder, is director. ==Notable alumni== Over the years, residents of the orphanage have gone on to become \\"rabbis, attorneys, accountants, clerks, teachers, and professional tradesmen\\". Notable alumni include Moshe Abutbul, mayor of Beit Shemesh, and David Azulai, member of Knesset for the Shas party since 1997. ==See also== *Education in Israel ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * Category:Orphanages in Jerusalem Category:Jewish community organizations Category:Organizations established in 1900 Category:Charities based in Israel ","title":"Zion Blumenthal Orphanage"},{"id":"35325001","text":"Khosrow IV was a Sasanian claimant to the throne who ruled Susa and its surroundings from ca. 630 to 636.

Healthcare exists to provide healthiness to people and maintain their ideal conditions. In the Dominican Republic, health haphazardness has resulted in economic disgrace. It was because of the rising of infectious health disparities. Although healthcare institutions work tirelessly for the welfare of citizens, it is essential to note the prevalence of contagious diseases influences the Dominican economy. Life expectancy in the Dominican Republic was 71 years for men and 77 years for women in 2016. In 2007 the Dominican Republic had a birth rate of 22.91 per 1000 and a death rate of 5.32 per 1000. Youth in the Dominican Republic is the healthiest age group. == HIV/AIDS == The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the Dominican Republic in 2011 stood at approximately 0.7%, which is relatively low by Caribbean standards, with an estimated 62,000 HIV/AIDS-positive Dominicans.Prevalence of HIV, total (% of population ages 15–49)  Data  Table. Data.worldbank.org. Retrieved on April 2, 2014. In contrast neighboring Haiti has an HIV/AIDS rate more than double that of the Dominican Republic. A mission based in the United States has been helping to combat AIDS in the country. Dengue fever has become endemic to the republic, cases of malaria, and Zika virus. The implementation of the siren nominal electronic testing kit was observed. However, further inventions considered, for example, the first pre-exposure prevention introduced in the critical population. The action has registered a positive impact on the economic structure of the Dominican Republic. Approximately, more than 550 people have graduated from the faculty of epidemiology owing a 38% improvement to the viral load and preparedness to deal with the pandemic (Pan American Health Organization n.p). Thus, strengthening the lab of National Public health where all samples tested has a positive deviation to the economy. == Abortion == The practice of abortion is illegal in all cases in the Dominican Republic, a ban that includes conceptions following rape, incest, and situations where the health of the mother is in danger, even if life-threatening.Romo, Rafael (August 18, 2012) Pregnant teen dies after abortion ban. CNN This ban was reiterated by the Dominican government in a September 2009 provision of a constitutional reform bill. Furthermore, issues of abortion endanger the lives of teenagers. The exercise of abortion was unlawful in the Dominican Republic: the decree was to govern and protect the life of the innocent and the mother. For example, the mortality ratio has an estimate of 92 deaths per 100000 live births in 2015 (UNICEF n.p). Adolescents with low levels of education in rural areas are categorized to harbor such risks. To add on, an increase in female unemployment rates posed a hazard to the economy. Therefore, strict laws stipulated to reiterate abortion. == Healthcare == There are three tiers of healthcare in the country: *Subsidized regime, which is financed by the government for unemployed, poor, disabled and indigent people. *Contributive regime, which is financed by workers and employers *Contributive subsidized regime, which is financed by independent workers, technical workers, and self- employed people, but subsidized by the state Even those for whom care is supposedly provided may have to pay for medical supplies. However, considerable progress in health and overall development was experienced in the country. For instance, there is a substantial increase in health coverage in the nation that is the health insurance coverage from 23% in 2011 to 65% in 2015 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention n.p). Significantly, updating the list of beneficiaries was the major challenge since the list based on disease prioritization and financial sustainability. Therefore, the first fitness elements, such as migration, poverty education, and gender-based, should be considered in the strategy of hindrance suites. Government expenditure on healthcare is about $180 per person per year, slightly more than half the average for the Latin American and Caribbean region. Essentially, there are steps considered by healthcare in the Republic. Firstly, the sponsored organization that caters to the poor, unemployed, and disabled people. Also, the active personnel contained a contributive establishment. Though the low- classes are dependents, the majority of the population is independent on matters of health, according to the Dominican Republic (World Health Organization n.p). Therefore, government expenditure per person is slightly higher in the Dominican Republic compared to other states. Furthermore, coronavirus pandemic is a threat to the economy. The fixed budget placed for the control of the virus shake the fragile economy of the republic (United Nations n.p). Hence economic retardation experienced having negative implications. Finally, it is essential to improve certification and registration systems in areas with higher levels of poverty in the Republic of Dominican. It has a positive impact on the economy of this country. Therefore, based on the World Health Organization, essential solutions rendered to stabilize the economy of the Republic should be embraced. ==References== Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \\"CDC Global Health - Dominican Republic.\\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 18 Dec. 2019 Pan American Health Organization. \\"Dominican Republic.\\" 23 www.paho.org/salud-en-las-americas-2017/?page_id=115.

Written by Ryan Murphy and directed by Eric Stoltz, the episode aired on Fox in the United States on May 8, 2012, and features McKinley High's senior prom. Prom-asaurus attracted 6.67 million American viewers during its initial airing and received a 2.7/8 Nielsen rating/share in the 18–49 demographic, up significantly from the 2.5/8 rating/share and 6.01 million viewers of the previous episode, \\"Choke\\", which was broadcast on May 1, 2012. ==Plot== McKinley High Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) has a talk with Brittany (Heather Morris) for being an ineffective senior class president, and tells her that he is considering abolishing the position. As a result, Brittany vows to make the upcoming senior prom a memorable one. She decides that the prom will have a dinosaur theme and imposes a ban on hair gel at the prom, which upsets Blaine (Darren Criss), an extensive user of hair gel. Sue (Jane Lynch) announces the three finalists for prom king and prom queen, which include Finn (Cory Monteith) and Brittany for prom king, and Santana (Naya Rivera) and Quinn (Dianna Agron) for prom queen. Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter) is very upset that she was not nominated. Rachel (Lea Michele) is surprised to see a poster touting Finn and Quinn's joint candidacy and confronts him, upset that her fiancé will be dancing at the prom with Quinn—his ex-girlfriend—instead of with her. Meanwhile, Quinn has made progress in her physical therapy, with Joe's (Samuel Larsen) aid, and has regained some of her ability to walk. She asks Joe to keep it a secret until after the prom. Later, after seeing the wheelchair- bound Quinn successfully using her recent disability to gain a sympathy vote from a student, Finn starts to have misgivings about their joint campaign. After discussing her own misgivings about the prom with Blaine and Kurt (Chris Colfer), Rachel decides to throw an anti-prom party at a hotel. Puck (Mark Salling), still dejected after failing an exam he needed to pass in order to graduate, agrees to go, as does a still-angry Becky. The party starts off awkwardly, and Becky calls it \\"the worst anti-prom ever\\". Meanwhile, at the prom, Finn walks in on Quinn standing up in the restroom and is upset that he chose her over Rachel because of her disability. Quinn begs Finn to stay for their mandatory dance, which he agrees to, but during the dance he tries to get her to stand up. Joe confronts Finn and Sue threatens to kick him out of the prom, but Finn leaves voluntarily. He arrives at the anti-prom party and urges Rachel and the others to return to the prom with him. Rachel agrees to go, as do Kurt and Blaine, but Puck and Becky stay behind. Becky tells Puck about her desire to become a prom queen, and he decides to crown himself and Becky as the king and queen of the anti-prom, fashioning crowns out of a beer box, after which the two also return to the prom. At McKinley, Rachel apologizes to Quinn and tells Quinn that she voted for her, and is happy that they became friends. Santana and Quinn count the prom king and queen votes, only to discover that four people voted for Brittany for king and Finn won, while Quinn has defeated Santana by a single vote. Despite the title being what both wanted, Santana realizes she didn't want to win unless Brittany did as well, and Quinn's victory leaves her feeling empty. She conspires with Santana, and after Finn is announced as prom king, Rachel is declared the write-in winner for prom queen. Finn and Rachel dance to \\"Take My Breath Away\\", sung by Quinn and Santana, and Quinn surprises the crowd by shakily standing during the performance. ==Production== The episode was directed by Eric Stoltz and written by co-creator Ryan Murphy.

The administration is headed by a governor directly elected by the people every four years in first- past-the-post elections. Legislation, the budget and the approval of personnel appointments, including the vice governors, are handled by the prefectural assembly that is directly elected by the people every four years by single-non transferable vote. Political debate in Osaka has in recent years been dominated by the Osaka Metropolis plan, a plan to transform Osaka – similarly to Tokyo – into a to, a metropolitan prefecture in which Osaka city, Sakai city and possibly other municipalities of Ōsaka are dissolved and subdivided into special wards like those of Tokyo city. The main proponent of the plan is the Osaka Restoration Association (Ōsaka Ishin no Kai, lit. \\"Osaka renewal assembly\\") of former governor and current Osaka city mayor Tōru Hashimoto; by 2012, the party controls the governorship, a majority in the Osaka assembly, and several municipal institutions including the Osaka city mayor and Osaka city assembly. Osaka is one of the most urbanized and economically developed prefectures; with a fiscal strength index of around 0.8Osaka Prefectural Government: Fiscal strength index its fiscal strength is well above the national average; but unlike Tokyo and Aichi which have fiscal strength indices above 1, Osaka is not able to fully cover its budget with prefectural revenues. == National representation == Osaka's directly elected delegation to the National Diet currently consists of 19 members of the Lower house of Japan (House of Representatives) and currently seven members (eight after 2016 when a reapportionment from three to four seats per election becomes effective in both halves of the chamber) of the Japanese Senate (House of Councillors). Additionally, the prefecture is part of the Kinki proportional representation block for the House of Representatives and the nationwide proportional election to the House of Councillors. In the 2005 Representatives election, the centre-right Liberal Democratic–Kōmeitō coalition had won 17 of Osaka's districts, Democrats only held onto the 11th and 19th districts. In the 2009 election, the landslide was reversed with the centre-left Democratic-Social Democratic opposition winning 18 districts of Osaka and the Liberal Democrats only successfully defending the 13th district. In the 2012 Representatives election, the Japan Restoration Party (JRP) and New Komeito (NK) which had a regional cooperation agreement with the JRP in Kinki won a landslide victory, Liberal Democrats (L) won three seats, Democrats (D) none. The directly elected Representatives and Councillors from Osaka are currently (as of December 16, 2012): * Representatives ** 1st district: Hidetaka Inoue (JRP) ** 2nd district: Akira Satō (L) ** 3rd district: Shigeki Satō (NK) ** 4th district: Masatoshi Murakami (JRP) ** 5th district: Tōru Kunishige (NK) ** 6th district: Shin'ichi Isa (NK) ** 7th district: Naomi Tokashiki (L) ** 8th district: Tomohiko Kinoshita (JRP) ** 9th district: Yasushi Odachi (JRP) ** 10th district: Kenta Matsunami (JRP) ** 11th district: Nobuhisa Itō (JRP) ** 12th district: Tomokatsu Kitagawa (L) ** 13th district: Kōichi Nishino (JRP) ** 14th district: Takashi Tanihata (JRP) ** 15th district: Yasuto Urano (JRP) ** 16th district: Kazuo Kitagawa (NK) ** 17th district: Nobuyuki Baba (JRP) ** 18th district: Takashi Endō (JRP) ** 19th district: Hodaka Maruyama (JRP) * Councillors (Osaka At-large district) ** Class of 2010 (term ends 2016) *** Hirotaka Ishikawa (NK) *** Issei Kitagawa (L) *** Motoyuki Odachi (D) ** Class of 2013 (term ends 2019) *** Tōru Azuma (JRP) *** Takuji Yanagimoto (L) *** Hisatake Sugi (NK) *** Kōtarō Tatsumi (JCP) == Governor == Osaka's current governor is Osaka Restoration Association secretary-general Ichirō Matsui who defeated Kaoru Kurata (supported by Democrats and Liberal Democrats), a Communist and four other candidates in the November 2011 early election triggered by Tōru Hashimoto's resignation. Previous elected governors of Osaka were: # Bunzō Akama (JLP/LP/JDP), 3 terms, 1947–1959, # Gisen Satō (L), 3 terms, 1959–1971, # Ryōichi Kuroda (I – S, JCP; only JCP support in his second election), 2 terms, 1971–1979, # Sakae Kishi (I), 3 terms, 1979–1991, # Kazuo Nakagawa (I), 1 term, 1991–1995, # Knock Yokoyama (I), 2 terms, 1995–1999 (resigned), # Fusae Ōta (I – L, D, Kōmeitō, LP; additionally SDP support in her second election), 2 terms, 2000–2008, # Tōru Hashimoto (I – L, Kōmeitō; formed Restoration Association in 2010), 1 term, 2008–2011 (resigned). == Assembly == The Prefectural Assembly has currently 109 members, elected to four-year terms by single non-transferable vote in 62 multi- and single-member districts which correspond to the wards of designated cities, independent cities and counties of Osaka. Regular elections have been held as part of the unified regional elections (last round: April 2011) in postwar Japan; by- elections are scheduled as necessary. In the 2011 election the Osaka Restoration Association won an outright majority. == Regional cooperation == Osaka joined in the Kansai regional cooperation (Kansai kōiki rengō, \\"Union of Kansai Governments\\") together with Shiga, Kyōto, Hyōgo, Wakayama, Tottori and Tokushima in December 2010. For the time being, the cooperation is limited to few areas of administration such as tourism promotion or disaster prevention; but an expansion of responsibilities both from the prefectural level and the central government is planned.The Japan Times, December 2, 2010: Prefectures launch regional alliance. Kansai group wants power from central government The regional cooperation is considered a one potential step towards the possible implementation of a system of larger states (dō-shū-sei) as a replacement for the current prefectures as proposed by some local and national politicians and loosely planned by the central government since the early 2000s.Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication: System of statesCabinet Secretariat: Advisory council on the system of states == External links == * Osaka Prefectural Government * Osaka Prefectural Assembly * Union of Kansai Governments ==References== ","title":"Politics of Osaka Prefecture"},{"id":"35325398","text":"Yengejeh-ye Qaqazan (, also Romanized as Yengejeh-ye Qāqāzān) is a village in Qaqazan-e Gharbi Rural District, in the Central District of Takestan County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

One of the first rappers who popularized this style of rap, Twista, in a song with Tech N9ne entitled \\"Worldwide Choppers\\" implied this in his lyrics, \\"I'm finna be usin' it as energy, watch how radiant I'ma be / Like a helicopter when the words fly\\"Lyrics of \\"Worldwide Choppers\\" was used to loosely describe the style of fast-paced rap, but the usage of the term was made more widespread when rap artist Tech N9ne released a series of posse cuts with other chopper-style rap artists from around the world in 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2015 including \\"Midwest Choppers\\" and \\"Midwest Choppers 2\\", \\"Worldwide Choppers\\" and \\"Speedom (Worldwide Choppers 2)\\".Tech N9ne gathers the fastest rappers for Worldwide Choppers The trend of naming songs in this fashion spread, with examples such as DCVDNS & Tamas's track \\"German Choppers\\" and the Undaground Choppers series produced by DJ Lil Sprite, which currently includes ten installments. The word \\"chopper\\" can simply be used for any rapper that uses a fast-paced style in his or her lyrics.Lyrics of \\"Midwest Choppers 2\\" The word is also used as a verb, as in \\"chopping\\" or \\"to chop\\", in describing the action of rapping at high speeds. == Characteristics == Chopper rap is typically characterised by the inclusion of twice or three times as many syllables to each bar and line as would be found in most other forms of rap. Sophisticated rhyme schemes are also an important element of the style. The inclusion of two or three times as many syllables in the bars causes the lyrics to be described as being in \\"double-time\\" or \\"triple-time\\". The beat tempo of chopper songs, particularly from the Midwest, tends to range from 90 BPM to 180 BPM, a much higher range than most other rap genres. Maintaining the quality of lyrics in terms of rhyming and substance while increasing speed of delivery is one of the key aspects of the style. The term \\"chopper\\" does not imply any thematic characteristics, and songs in the style touch on a wide range of subjects. One subgenre chopper rappers often cross into is horrorcore, seen in Tech N9ne's \\"Am I a Psycho?\\" featuring Hopsin and B.o.B or the rapper Twisted Insane's albums. Midwest rapper Prozak explained that the style often revolves around \\"dark beats and lyrics\\" in the DVD The Hitchcock of HipHop. ==History== 1980s – Origins of fast rapping Although the subgenre of chopper-style hip hop did not achieve broad mainstream appeal until the early–mid 1990s through artists such as Bone Thugs-n-Harmony and Twista, the style has been around for decades. The first group to rap at high speeds on record were the Treacherous Three with the release of \\"New Rap Language\\" in 1980.http://www.discogs.com/Spoonie-Gee-Treacherous-Three-The- New-Rap-Language-Love-Rap/release/202044 Throughout the lyrics of the song, member Kool Moe Dee is continually referred to as the originator of the fast style: Kool Moe Dee went on a year later to use one of the verses in this song to demolish Busy Bee in the famous New York rap battle in 1981. The style of rapping fast was also popular with Jamaican rappers in the early 1980s with releases by Daddy Freddy (\\"Joker Lover\\"), Shinehead (\\"Rough and Rugged\\") and Peter King (\\"Me Neat, Me Sweet\\").https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGFhP_bmsMo \\"Supersonic\\" by J. J. Fad was a popular song released in 1987 that featured fast double time rapping at the end that was so innovative that it would later be referenced in the fast-style Eminem song \\"Rap God\\" released in 2013. In the 1990s, the style spread to the West Coast, with artists at \\"The Good Life\\" such as Ellay Khule, Freestyle Fellowship, CVE, Riddlore, Chubb Rock, Mikah 9 and many other Project Blowed affiliates adopting the style. 1990s – Emergence of chopper rap as a distinct and popular style Although the style of rapping at high speeds had existed in both the East Coast and West Coast scenes as well as abroad, it was not until the 1990s that the style began to emerge as a distinct and popular form of hip-hop. The Dayton Family and Twista were active in the Midwest in the early 1990s and developed the use of chopper rapping as their main style. This ushered in a wave of chopper acts from the Midwest that began to receive attention, such as Twista in Chicago and the group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony from Cleveland. Bone Thugs-n-Harmony signed to Eazy-E's Ruthless Records in 1993 and their 1994 EP Creepin on ah Come Up reached #12 on the Billboard 200 charts. Their next albums E. 1999 Eternal (1995) and The Art of War (1997) both reached #1 on the Billboard 200 chart and also produced the 1996 single \\"Tha Crossroads\\" which reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. This success helped to popularize the chopper style across the United States and beyond. During this period, many other rappers in the Midwest that would go on to become highly successful began their rapping careers as underground artists releasing songs in the chopper style, such as Eminem and Tech N9ne. At the same time Twista and The Dayton Family were popularising the style in the Midwest, New York emcee Jaz-O (also known at the time as The Jaz) was using the fast-paced chopper rap style in his music, releasing his debut album Word to the Jaz in 1989 and To Your Soul in 1990. Jaz-O was the mentor of the then-unknown Jay-Z, and these albums included the first songs Jay-Z was ever on, \\"Hawaiian Sophie\\" and \\"The Originators\\". In this way Jay-Z began his career in the chopper style of rap before moving into slower forms, and in the liner notes of Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life he describes this, saying of \\"The Originators\\" that \\"we was using that fast style that everybody seems to be using now\\". Vol 2... Hard Knock Life also included the single \\"Nigga What, Nigga Who (Originator 99)\\" as a sequel to their previous chopper-style collaboration. Also active in New York in the late 1990s was Latino rapper Big Pun, who was known for his fast-paced, witty lyrics and ability to rap for long periods of time without taking a breath,Top 50 MCs of Our Time: 1987 - 2007 - 50 Greatest Emcees of Our Time.

In 1999, Missouri rapper Tech N9ne and his business partner Travis O'Guin founded the independent record label Strange Music. Anghellic, Tech N9ne's first album released through Strange Music, sold 278,000 copies and marked his breakthrough from an underground artist to a commercial success. He continued to release albums on the independent label regularly, with six further albums in the 2000s alone, and became established as one of the major chopper artists. His \\"Tech N9ne Collabos\\" series, so far consisting of eight albums released between 2007–2017, is a collection of albums featuring other artists on every track, through which Tech N9ne has introduced a wide range of artists to his substantial fanbase. The albums include collaborations from fellow Strange Music artists such as Krizz Kaliko, Yukmouth and Kutt Calhoun; as well as other chopper rappers, other rappers who do not normally rap in chopper style, and some rock artists. Due largely to the success of Tech N9ne's career Strange Music has become a major independent record label and hosts a sizeable roster of artists including many in the chopper genre. The 2000s also saw mainstream success come for some of the earliest choppers. Twista's fourth studio album, Kamikaze, topped the Billboard 200 chart in 2004, and his next three albums all reached the chart's top 10. Bone Thugs-n-Harmony released five albums from 2000–2010, all of which charted in the top 50 positions of the Billboard 200. Throughout the 1990s, New York rapper Busta Rhymes had been creating music, first as a part of the group Leaders of the New School from 1989–1993 and then as a solo artist from then onwards. Beginning with his 1998 album E.L.E. (Extinction Level Event): The Final World Front he began to rap at faster speeds on some songs, and throughout the time since then he has incorporated chopper-style rapping on several of his successful tracks, such as 2001's \\"Break Ya Neck\\" and his guest verse on Tech N9ne's 2011 single \\"Worldwide Choppers\\", leading many to consider Busta Rhymes a chopper rapper. Rhymes' music was highly successful throughout the 2000s, and his unorthodox style is considered by some to be one of the most significant developments in the style in recent times. The 21st century has seen chopper rap spread from its roots in the Midwest and in New York across the world of hip hop. In the South, rappers such as Chamillionaire and Yelawolf have utilised the style, while on the West Coast rappers such as San Diego-born rapper Twisted Insane and Snow Tha Product from San Jose regularly rap in the chopper style. The style has also spread to Europe, with Danish rapper U$O and Turkish rapper Ceza both featuring on Tech N9ne's aforementioned single \\"Worldwide Choppers\\", and particularly to Germany. German rappers such as Samy Deluxe, , Kollegah, , and . featured American choppers Twisted Insane and Wrekonize on his single \\"Thron\\". The style has also been adopted in Asia, with Korean rapper Outsider being known for his very high speeds rapping in the Korean language. ==See also== * Alternative hip hop * List of hip hop genres * Scat singing * Trap * Footwork ==References== Category:1990s in music Category:2000s in music Category:2010s in music Category:American hip hop genres ","title":"Chopper (rap)"},{"id":"35325472","text":", Denmark had a life expectancy of 79.5 years at birth (77 for men, 82 for women), up from 75 years in 1990.

These two counties are located in the northernmost region of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. Since 1985, the Burt Lake Band has petitioned the Bureau of Indian Affairs for re-recognition as a federally acknowledged band, a recognition first achieved in the 1830s.\\"Political Status of Cheboygan Band (Burt Lake Band, Dr. Alice Littlefield, Central Michigan University, 3-27-2002. ==History== The Ottawa people participated in the wars against Great Britain, the United Kingdom, and the United States in the 18th and early 19th centuries. By the mid 1830s the Ottawa and Chippewa people of the Michigan Territory sought negotiated treaty agreements with the United States. As a result, the Treaty of Washington was signed in the fall of 1836.Dunbar, Willis F. & May, George F. Michigan: A History of the Wolverine State, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1995. The 1836 Treaty of Washington was signed between the Anishinaabe of the Michigan Territory ceding some 13,000,000 acres of land to the US federal government. The ceded Anishinaabe land was located in the western two-thirds of the Lower Peninsula and the eastern half of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In all, it was almost a third of the state of Michigan's total land. In exchange, the Anishinaabeg were to receive annuity payments, supplies and a guarantee they could hunt and fish for perpetuity.Treaty of Washington, 1836-Treaty with the Ottawa & Chippewa. As part of the treaty agreement, the Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians were set aside a 1,000-acre reservation on Lake Cheboigan. The reservation was to last for 5 years. However, the United States failed to set aside the promised land. Beginning in February 1848 and ending in April 1850, the members of the Burt Lake Band used their annuity money from the 1836 treaty to buy six separate parcels of land totaling 375 acres. This was land on Indian Point along the shoreline of Lake Cheboigan.\\"White Man's Treachery,\\" The Detroit News, 7 October 1969 A second treaty, the Treaty of Detroit, was signed in 1855 between the Anishinaabe of Michigan and the United States. The Chippewa and Ottawa people of the Burt Lake Band were provided land in two townships of land in Cheboygan County. These two townships were where the Band had earlier purchased six parcels of land. The treaty also specified that individual Anishinaabeg could select land allotments within the reservation. However, these individual holdings were not granted until 1875, some 3 years after an 1872 Act of Congress had been passed.Treaty of Detroit, 1855-Treaty with the Ottawa & Chippewa Nations, During the years after the 1855 treaty, local officials of Cheboygan County imposed property taxes on the land parcels at the Indian Village settlement on Indian Point. As a result, the band had to sell land in order to pay back taxes. After buying the \\"tax titles,\\" Cheboygan banker and land speculator John W. McGinn obtained a \\"writ of assistance\\" from the Circuit Court of Cheboygan in 1898. In October 1900, he used the writ to demand that Sheriff Fred Ming remove the residents of Indian Village. After Ming and his deputies did so, McGinn burned the village to the ground, an act that became known as the Burt Lake Burn-Out. The Chippewa and Ottawa people who lived there were forced to relocate to Indian Trail (now Indian Road), where other Burt Lake Chippewa and Ottawa people owned land. The Burt Lake Band was previously known as the Cheboiganing Band of Ottawa & Chippewa Indians. This historic recognition existed before the 1836 Treaty of Washington and continued through 1917 when a lawsuit involving the Burt Lake Band was decided by federal Judge Clarence Sessions.Department of Justice File No. 158012-The Burt Lake Band, National Archives, Chicago, Ill. After the burn-out, the Burt Lake Band, historically recognized by the federal government, became landless and lost its federal acknowledgment.

The company cooperates with NGOs and schools to train teachers and health workers in theatre-based techniques for teaching children. In 2005, Bond Street Theatre created Beyond the Mirror, a physical-visual depiction of Afghan history in collaboration with Exile Theatre of Kabul, a theatre group the company had met in a refugee camp in Pakistan. The two groups presented the play in Afghanistan, Japan, Baltimore and New York.Jefferson, Margo (2005). \\"Telling Tale of Afghan Wars by Any Means Necessary\\", New York Times The project was the first US-Afghan theatre collaboration, and Exile Theatre is the first Afghan theatre group to perform in the USA. In 2009, Exile Theatre returned to the US for its second tour and the two companies presented Beyond the Mirror at the San Francisco International Arts Festival and the Fury Factory Festival in California. This arts exchange program was sponsored with the aid of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters and the US Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. In 2010, the company initiated a Theatre for Social Development program, building the capacity of Afghan theatre groups to develop productions that address social issues such as gender violence, health issues, conflict resolution, and other topics. In addition to theatre training, the program includes business training for local theatre groups to improve sustainability. Through this program, Bond Street Theatre has created four all-female theatre groups in Afghanistan, a first in the country. These companies allow live theatre to reach women in isolated communities, women's prisons, women's shelters, and other all-female domains. The United States Institute of Peace sponsored this innovative program along with the US Embassy in Kabul. Bond Street Theatre's Voter Education and Fraud Mitigation Project prepared the Afghan population for the Presidential elections on April 5, 2014 and the subsequent run-off election on June 14. The project built on ongoing programs with four Afghan theatre groups to bring civic information to hard-to-reach places with a focus on reaching women and youth. The project was supported by the United States Institute of Peace, and reached over 200,000 Afghans. The company's current Youth Engagement Project has brought young Afghans together from 25 provinces for leadership training and cross-cultural exchange. Youth from each province successfully implemented community service projects in their region, focusing on themes ranging from environmental conservation, to domestic violence, to child labor.  Myanmar  Myanmar is the focus of a broader artistic initiative by Bond Street Theatre involving ongoing creative work with Burmese refugees in Bangladesh and Thailand. Prolonged conflict between the Myanmar government and many internal ethnic groups has resulted in mass-migrations to neighboring countries. Bond Street Theatre created a play with the Gitameit Music School combining traditional and modern forms of Burmese theatre with its own physical-visual theatre style to perform in Myanmar and in the surrounding refugee areas. In 2009–2010, Bond Street Theatre worked as US State Department Cultural Envoys in Burma with Thila Min of Thukhuma Khayeethe (Art Travelers) Theatre. They created and performed The Handwashing Show, a show that creatively stressed the importance of hygiene. The show traveled to monastery schools and jungle villages near the Thai border. The company returned in the Spring of 2011 to continue their theatrical programming, and further develop a full-length production with Thukhuma Khayeethe about current issues facing Myanmar. This production will tour throughout the region in 2016/17.  Haiti  In the spring of 2011, Bond Street Theatre brought a three-week program of performances and workshops to the displaced population living in tent camps in Port-au-Prince and applied theatre-based methods toward post-crisis healing, empowerment and improved life skills as a means of community education and development. They worked in conjunction with the all-female theatre group FAVILEK (Women Victims Get Up, Stand Up), which was founded in 1991 by ten survivors of domestic and political violence. Bond Street Theatre focused on issues facing women and girls in the camps while also developing a supportive and constructive environment for the male population in order to combat the rising rate of gender and sexual violence. The company drew upon its vast experience of theatrical techniques to create a comprehensive, enriching program to address and develop positive group dynamics, build self-esteem, address trauma, stimulate imagination, create hope and cultivate empowerment and leadership.  India  Bond Street Theatre collaborated on a theatre-based project for populations in India in collaboration with the Indian theatre group, Purvabhyas Theatre, and Exile Theatre of Afghanistan. The three-country team (US-Afghanistan-India) worked with rural women to encourage self-expression and confidence, with street-working children to initiate non-violent \\"life skills,\\" and with youth to explore the nature of ethnic and religious disputes. The multi-year project was sponsored by the US Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (US Department of State). In cooperation with UNICEF, Bond Street Theatre created the South Asia Social Theatre Institute (SASTI) at the Gandhi Center in Delhi as a center for study and training in theatre-based approaches to leadership, conflict prevention, healing, and the transfer of information. The Balkans In the summer of 2000, one year after the war which devastated Kosovo, Bond Street Theatre collaborated with Theatre Tsvete, an award-winning puppet theatre company from Bulgaria, to create a non-verbal version of Romeo & Juliet. Both companies met while performing in the Kosovar refugee camps the prior year. The two companies performed their collaborative \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" in war-torn theatres across Kosovo in 2000, and in Serbia, Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Macedonia, Romania, Croatia and Bulgaria in the following years.Simpson, Daniel (2003). \\"Ambassadors for Peace, Armed With Slapstick\\", New York Times Performing Artists for Balkan Peace In 2005, Bond Street Theatre and Theatre Tsvete initiated Performing Artists for Balkan Peace, an ongoing and expanding network of professional theatre companies, individual performing artists, and other theatre practitioners devoted to the active pursuit of peace, social progress and artistic cooperation through the performing arts, and placing an emphasis on strengthening the role of artists in the community. Performing Artists for Balkan Peace includes theatre practitioners from 10 companies from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Serbia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Greece, England and the United States. Their first collaborative production, Honey and Blood, performed in Blagoevgrad and Sofia, Bulgaria in 2005 and at the International Festival of Authorial Poetics in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2006.  Israel  As a resident company at the 1984 Israel Festival, Bond Street Theatre brought together 60 Palestinian, Kurdish, and Jewish actors of all ages to create an expansive street theatre spectacle and Jerusalem's first professional street theatre company, which continued for many years. Young Audiences Program The company's programs for young audiences illuminate world arts and cultures, historical figures, the relationship between math and music, and other curricula topics. The Young Audience Program is presented in New York City public schools, New York City libraries, and city parks. ==Productions== Since 1977, the Bond Street Theatre ensemble has developed 19 original productions, 4 adaptations of classic plays, 9 shows for young audiences, and one film, all of which have been presented in major festivals and theatres in the US and abroad. These productions have reflected the social issues of their times: pollution, nuclear waste, war, consumerism, guns, working, inter-ethnic conflict, homelessness, religion and science. Internationally, the company presented the first political street theatre in East Berlin in 50 years (1990), created programs for street children in Brazil (1992, 1996), established Jerusalem's first street theatre company with Arabs, Kurds and Jews together (1984), taught Catholic and Protestant children side by side in Belfast (1990), worked with refugees from 60 countries in Montreal (1987), Kosovar refugees in Macedonia (1999), and Afghan refugees in Pakistan (2002). Selected Productions: * Nightmare on Wall Street – the first legal political street theatre in East Berlin in 50 years, performed to an amazed crowd in Alexanderplatz, East Berlin. * Werk – a production centered on labor which does not get acknowledged, and paying homage to human self-sufficiency and resourcefulness, Werk was presented in Beijing, China for the 1995 UN Conference on Women, and in Brazil in 1996. * Cozmic Jazz – a satiric and humorous story about humanity and a comic commentary on \\"the meaning of life.\\" * Beyond the Mirror – created with Exile Theatre of Kabul, Afghanistan in 2005, Beyond the Mirror is the first ever US-Afghan theatre collaboration. * The Mechanical – a production transplanting the outcast creature from Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein into the true story of a sensational chess- playing robot built in the late 18th century. ==History== Founded in 1976 by a group of physical actors dedicated to innovative theatre and motivated by a passion to be useful in the world, in its early years the company used a diverse physical, visual and musical vocabulary to create entertaining and relevant performances exemplifying theatre's ability to illuminate social and environmental issues. In 1983, Bond Street Theatre established the Palenville Interarts Colony, an artists' retreat in upstate New York that fostered interdisciplinary collaboration and reached underserved rural audiences. The Colony also produced a community arts project and a Presenting Program, which presented artists such as Dave Brubeck & sons, Eiko & Koma, Bread & Puppet, Talking Band, and others. As a way to bring the community and the Colony closer together, the group created a Children's Circus – complete with Circus Band – that toured the county with their colorful circus tent, snappy costumes, and amazing feats of physical prowess! The Circus delighted audiences in New York for five years and encouraged the circus arts to thrive across three counties. The Governor of New York named a day in our honor, Palenville Circus Day. Dave Brubeck and his sons gave the Palenville Interarts Colony and the Palenville Children's Circus two fantastic benefit concerts in the Theatre on the Colony grounds. The Shinbone Alley Stilt Band emerged as the live band accompanying the street theatre shows in the early 1980s that were performed in New York City. Originally, the performers would parade and play music, while characters on stilts would parade around before the show. Eventually, all the company members learned to walk on stilts. The Shinbone Alley Stilt Band was named after the alley next to the theatre on Bond Street, and made its debut with its new name in 1988 at a performance in Nagasaki, Japan. The Band still plays frequently at events in and around New York City. As the company developed more international ties and incorporated more intercultural studies, the group began touring international festivals and theatres on a regular basis. In 1984, Bond Street Theatre traveled to the Israel Festival, where its members were exposed to peacebuilding work firsthand. Over the last two decades, the need for cross-cultural understanding has been magnified and Bond Street Theatre has shifted in light of that change. To date, the company has initiated innovative theatre and theatre-based programs in over 40 countries worldwide, and reached populations in refugee camps, schools, shelters, prisons, rural villages and urban centers. Today, the company focuses on using the performing arts as a form of humanitarian outreach and as a tool for education and healing in refugee camps, areas of conflict and post-war environments. The ensemble collaborates with local artists to enjoy the mutual benefits of artistic exchange, and to promote the value of the arts in advancing peace and shaping our collective future. In addition, the company finds the means to bring our collaborators to the US to bring the issues of the world closer to our local communities, to dispel misunderstandings about other cultures, traditions and religions, and to facilitate effective cross-cultural communication. Bond Street Theatre continues to present innovative work in venues around the world. They initiate theatre programs for diverse community populations and collaborate with artists globally. In the US, the company maintains an active Arts-in-Education program in schools and a popular Internship program that answers the growing interest among young artists in social theatre and internationally responsive arts programming.A Brief History of Bond Street Theatre , Retrieved April 4, 2012 ==Awards== Bond Street Theatre received an award from The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation (1990), presented at the United Nations Conference on Women in Beijing (1995), traveled as US State Department Cultural Envoys to Burma (2009), presented at the Arts in One World Conference (2010), won first prize at the Meppel Festival in Netherlands, and won Best Show at the KimTom Festival in Shanghai. ==References== Category:Theatres in Manhattan Category:1976 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Bond Street Theatre"},{"id":"35325666","text":"Alexander Burns (12 August 1834 - 22 May 1900) was born in Northern Ireland and became a minister and educator in Canada. == References == * Category:Canadian Protestant ministers and clergy Category:1834 births Category:1900 deaths Category:Irish emigrants to Canada (before 1923) ","title":"Alexander Burns (minister)"},{"id":"35325667","text":" The Daiichi Kosho Whisper is a Japanese paramotor that was designed and produced by the Daiichi Kosho Company for powered paragliding.Cliche, Andre: Ultralight Aircraft Shopper's Guide 8th Edition, page D-23.

ISSN 0891-1851 ==Design and development== Daiichi Kosho, a Japanese electronics company, specializing in Karaoke equipment, decided to enter the paramotor market in circa 1993, expecting that it would become immensely popular and result in a mass market. As a result, they designed and manufactured their own engine, the DK 472 and even created their own line of canopies. The aircraft was designed to comply with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules. It features a paraglider-style high wing, single-place accommodation and a single Daiichi Kosho DK 472 engine in pusher configuration. As is the case with all paramotors, takeoff and landing are accomplished on foot. The company invested heavily in research and development, producing a whole line of paramotoring equipment including a twin-cylinder and single-cylinder engine. In addition to the two different engines they also produced a trike carriage, the DK Sky Trike, that could be mated to the backpack engine. The company created a distributor network, notably in the US where they were represented by Paraborne Aviation, who created a dealer network. In the US the aircraft is often referred to as the Paraborne DK Whisper. The mass market the company hoped for never appeared and with a high degree of competition from European manufacturers the company ceased all production of the line circa 2003. The line was sold to Giles Cardoza of the United Kingdom who developed it into the Parajet. ==Variants== ;Beat :Initial model, powered by a twin-cylinder, horizontally opposed, air- cooled, two-stroke custom designed Daiichi Kosho DK 472 engine driving a direct-drive propeller and producing . ;Whisper :Also called the Beat Whisper.

The Constitution of Albania establishes the right to health insurance of Albanian citizens. Total health care expenditure in 2013 was 5.9% of GDP, about 48.4% of that was government expenditure. According to the survey conducted by the Euro health consumer index in 2015, Albania was the European country in which unofficial payments to doctors were most commonly reported. The Albanian Health Insurance Institute which was established in 1994 covers primary care and some of the cost drugs in the reimbursement list and some of the costs of hospital care. Copayments on both were introduced in 2008. It is funded by a 3.4% charge on gross salaries and supplied 74.1% of the public expenditure on health in 2013, the balance being funded from general taxation. Health care in Albania declined steeply after the collapse of socialism in the country, but a process of modernization has been taking place since 2000. In the 2000s, there were 51 hospitals in the country, including a military hospital and specialist facilities. Albania has successfully eradicated diseases such as malaria. Alternative medicine is also practiced among the population in the form of herbal remedies as the country is a large exporter of aromatic and medicinal herbs. ==Staffing== The Faculty of Medicine of the University of Tirana is the main medical school in the country. There are also nursing schools in other cities. Newsweek ranked Albania 57 out of 100 Best Countries in the World in 2010. It has the lowest proportion of doctors for its population in Europe - 115 per 100,000 in 2015. Recently, the system is experiencing a brain drain as qualified doctors are emigrating to Germany for better salaries and working conditions. ==Primary care== Patients must choose a primary care physician with whom they register. Basic supplies lack in public hospitals and doctors tend to refer patients to either their private practice or to nearby pharmacies. They have also become the targets of assaults from frustrated patients who are confronted with their lack of accountability and rampant corruption. Specialists encourage patients to go to them directly, rather than by a referral, because they want underhand payments. Some doctors do not have the required accreditation and pose a hazard to the general public by prescribing the wrong medication or performing unsuccessful surgeries resulting in unnecessary deaths. ==Hospitals== The public hospitals are owned and managed by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection. The government is investing in modern equipment at Mother Teresa Hospital and the Trauma Center. As a result, a number of successful surgeries have been performed which previously required hospitalization overseas. A new state of the art National Emergency Center equipped with GPS systems has opened in Tirana in an effort to efficiently coordinate 112 calls nationwide. Dozens of new ambulances have been introduced and the concept of paramedics is starting to get hold when responding to emergencies. Further, free universal healthcare is being employed in the form of check ups for middle aged women and men. Many foreign private hospitals have been opened in Tirana employing foreign staff and offering advanced services for an expensive fee. ==References== Category:Health in Albania Albania ","title":"Healthcare in Albania"},{"id":"35325703","text":"Life expectancy in Andorra was 79.8 for men and 85.2 years for women in 2010. A new measure of expected human capital calculated for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016 and defined for each birth cohort as the expected years lived from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational attainment, learning or education quality, and functional health status was published by The Lancet in September 2018. Andorra had the eighteenth highest level of expected human capital with 24 health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years. Andorra became a member of the World Health Organization on January 14, 1997. ==Healthcare== The Andorran health care system was set up on 24 September 1918 in response to the Spanish flu pandemic. Before that each commune was responsible for contracting physicians and for such regulation on health care issues as they chose. Under the Health Care Administration Ordinance of 9 May 1931 the parish health boards were given statutory status. In The Lancet's Healthcare Access and Quality Index, which ranked 195 countries' healthcare systems between 1990-2015 the country scored 95/100, the best in the world. Healthcare in Andorra is provided to all employed persons and their families by the government-run social security system, Caixa Andorrana de Seguretat Social, which is funded by employer and employee contributions in respect of salaries. The cost of healthcare is covered at rates of 75% for outpatient expenses such as medicines and hospital visits, 90% for hospitalisation, and 100% for work-related accidents. The remainder of the costs may be covered by private health insurance. Other residents and tourists require full private health insurance.Travailler en Andorre (May 2006), Govern d'Andorra, Servei d'Ocupació, p.30. The main hospital, Nostra Senyora de Meritxell Hospital, is in Escaldes-Engordany.

For specialist treatment patients may be sent to Barcelona or Toulouse. ==References== ","title":"Health in Andorra"},{"id":"35325706","text":"After significant decline in earlier decades crude birth rates in Armenia remained at 13.0–14.2 per 1000 people nearly constant in the years 1998–2015. In the same period the crude death rate went from 8.6 to 9.3 per 1000 people. Note that crude rates are not age-adjusted. Life expectancy at birth at 74.8 years was the 4th highest among the post-USSR countries in 2014. ==Healthcare system and funding== At the time of independence in 1991 no traces of pre- Soviet healthcare traditions were discernible. The soviet healthcare system was highly centralized. The entire population was guaranteed free medical assistance, regardless of social status, and had access to a comprehensive range of secondary and tertiary care. After independence Armenia was not in a position to continue to fund it. Following the reform program all the hospitals and polyclinics, rural health units (including village health centers), and health posts from the previous system continue to function. Hospitals which were formerly accountable to the local administration and ultimately to the Ministry of Health are now autonomous and increasingly responsible for their own budgets and management. A Basic Benefits Package was established in 1999. This provided provides free specific health-care services, including medicines, to vulnerable segments of the population, including children, the elderly and disabled, impoverished people and injured military personnel. Since 2006, primary health care services have been free of charge. In 2009 more than 50% of the national health budget was spent on hospitals. At the local community level the system was weak and in rural areas often non-existent. Vast improvements of health services in Armenia occurred in the twenty-first century, principally easier accessibility to health-care services and an Open Enrollment program which allows Armenians to freely choose their healthcare service provider. Health expenditures, as percentage of government spending were 4th lowest for the same group in 2008–2014, but beat peers in South Caucasus. Health expenditures in per capita terms (at PPP at constant 2005 USD) were nearly permanently 5th lowest in the above group in years 1999–2014. Out-of-pocket health expenditure were 4th highest in the same group in years 2003–2006 and 2010–2014. In 2014 4.3% of health expenditures came from sources outside of Armenia. In 2015 current health expenditures as percentage of GDP reached 10.1% while 81.6% of all health spendings were paid out-of-pocket, both values record high since data became available in year 2000. In 2019, the government of Armenia has made healthcare free for all under the age of 18. ==Corruption in the healthcare system== Since independence, Armenia's national health system faced criticism because of widespread corruption among doctors and other hospital workers. Because of reduced public funding after the economic collapse of the 1990s, many employees were forced to take bribes and take advantage of their position of power within their workplace in order to make a living. This problem still persists as of today and is one of the main concerns of elected officials.https://www.azatutyun.am/a/29938027.html ==Specific diseases==  HIV  Certified by World Health Organization Armenia was the first in the European region and as of October 2017 is one of 10 countries worldwide (7 of which are islands) which proved to have eliminated mother-to-child HIV transmission. In 2010 HIV prevalence was estimated at 0.2% among adults aged 15 to 49.  Poliomyelitis  There were no recorded cases of Poliomyelitis since data became available in year 2002.  Malaria  There were no new cases of Malaria since year 2006. ==Mortality==  Infants  According to WHO data infant mortality rate nearly halved from 2002 to 2015. It dropped to 11.3 (0.1%) in 2017 - best ever rate since WHO records began in 1990.  Children aged 5 to 14  Mortality rate for children aged 5 to 14 was in range of 0.18% - 0.21% in years 1997-2017.  Adults  Probability of dying aged 15–60 was estimated at 11.6% in year 2016, nearly unchanged since year 2000. ==Malnutrition and obesity== According to the survey conducted in 2015-16, 9% of children in Armenia are stunted and of those, 4% are severely stunted, while in 2005-2010 18-19% of children were stunted. The survey also found that four percent of Armenian children are wasted (low weight for height) and two percent severely wasted. Survey also found was that Armenian children tend to be more overweight than stunted due to improper diets. Fourteen percent of children under five years of age are overweight. Undernourishment at 6.3% in 2014 of population remained nearly unchanged since 2007. Obesity rate is 19.5% in Armenia in 2017, which is lower than in all regional countries and nearly all European countries. ==Smoking== Tobacco policy in Armenia is as of February 2018 still very permissive with almost no enforcement of any smoke-restricting laws. == See also == * Armenia * Education in Armenia * World Health Organization * Children of Armenia Fund * World Food Programme == References == ","title":"Health in Armenia"},{"id":"35325707","text":"Latvia had the fourth highest mortality in Europe, at 704 per 100,000 population in 2015, the third highest rate of male smokers - 49%, and the second highest rate of death from injury (55 per 100,000). A new measure of expected human capital calculated for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016 and defined for each birth cohort as the expected years lived from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational attainment, learning or education quality, and functional health status was published by The Lancet in September 2018. Latvia had the twentyfirst highest level of expected human capital with 23 health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years. As of 2009, there were approximately 8,600 inhabitants of Latvia living with HIV/AIDS, accounting for a 0.7% adult HIV prevalence rate. There were 32,376 (1.44%) individual instances of clinically reported alcoholism in Latvia in 2008, as well as cases of addictions to other substances. The annual number of births per 1,000 adolescent women aged 15 to 19 has declined from 49.9 in 1990 to 17.9 in 2007. In 2005, Latvia had a suicide rate of 24.5 per 100,000 inhabitants (down from 40.7 in 1995), the 7th highest in the world. Latvia achieved a remarkable improvement in infant mortality from 6.2/1000 births in 2012 to 3.9/1000 in 2014. In 2018, the health among Latvian and international medical students studying in Riga was assessed. Latvian students displayed a higher prevalence of anxiety, depressive symptoms and physical symptoms. Latvian students displayed troubles adjusting to stressful life events. Further research to identify whether Latvians have a lower threshold for stressors or whether they are exposed to more stressors than international students should be performed. These stressors could be influenced by the growing social inequality within Latvia. ==Healthcare== The Latvian healthcare system is a universal programme, largely funded through government taxation. It was among the lowest-ranked healthcare systems in Europe, due to excessive waiting times for treatment, insufficient access to the latest medicines, and other factors. There were 59 hospitals in Latvia in 2009, down from 94 in 2007, and 121 in 2006. Since 2012 performance has improved considerably, with a reduction in infant mortality from 6.2 per thousand births to 3.9 in two years. Corruption is relatively widespread in the Latvian healthcare system, although the situation has improved since the early 1990s. It has been noted that an environment conducive to corruption has been promulgated by low salaries and poorly implemented systemic reforms. This also results in brain drain, mostly to Western EU nations. According to the survey conducted by the Euro health consumer index in 2015 Latvia was among the European countries in which unofficial payments to doctors were reported most commonly. ==Vaccination== The notion of mandatory vaccination in Latvia differs from that of other nations. Latvia appears unique in that it compels health care providers to obtain the signatures of those who decline vaccination. Individuals have the right to refuse a vaccination, but if they do so, health providers have a duty to explain the health consequences. Vaccines that are not mandatory are not publicly funded, so the cost for those must be borne by parents or employers, she adds. Funded vaccinations include tuberculosis, diphtheria, measles, hepatitis B, human papilloma virus for 12-year-old girls, and tick-borne encephalitis until age 18 in endemic areas and for orphans. ==See also== List of hospitals in Latvia. ==References== ","title":"Health in Latvia"},{"id":"35325710","text":"As of 2012 Lithuanian life expectancy at birth was 70.7 years for males and 80.7 for females, and the infant mortality rate was 6.2 per 1,000 births. This was the lowest average of any European country, according to the OECD. The difference between male life expectancy and female is unusually large. Since 1990 most other European countries have increased their life expectancy by more. The annual population growth rate increased by 0.3% in 2007. At 30.4 people per 100,000, Lithuania has seen a dramatic rise in suicides in the post-Soviet years, and in 2008 had the third highest suicide rate in the world. Lithuania also has the highest homicide rate in the EU, and the highest rate of death from injury in Europe (76 per 100,000). In 2018, Lithuania ranked 28th in Europe in the Euro health consumer index, a ranking of European healthcare systems based on waiting time, results and other indicators. ==Healthcare== After independence in 1918 a health care system on the Bismarck model began to develop but in 1949 when it was absorbed into the USSR, it was reorganized according to the centralised Semashko system. It was relatively well funded and the population’s health status was better than in other parts of the USSR. Lithuania moved away from a system funded mainly by local and state budgets to a mixed system, predominantly funded by the National Health Insurance Fund in the late 1990s. The deterioration in health which occurred during the first phase of social reforms was halted in 1994 and the standardized death rate decreased from 12.06 (per 1000 population) in 1994 to 10.16 in 1998. The National Health Concept was adopted in 1991 by the Supreme Council – Reconstituent Seimas. It introduced health insurance, and prioritised disease prevention and primary care. In 1998 the Lithuanian Health Programme was adopted by the Seimas. This set as priorities the reduction of mortality and increased life expectancy, improvements in the quality of life, and increases in health equity. The National Health Insurance Fund was established. By 2000 the vast majority of Lithuanian health care institutions were non-profit-making enterprises and a private sector developed, providing mostly outpatient services which are paid for out-of-pocket. The Ministry of Health also runs a few health care facilities and is involved in the running of the two major Lithuanian teaching hospitals. In 2012 there were 52 fewer hospitals than there had been in 1990. There were 66 general hospitals, 26 secondary hospitals, 49 nursing hospitals, and 4 rehabilitation hospitals. The ministry is responsible for the State Public Health Centre which manages the public health network including ten county public health centres with their local branches. The ten counties run the county hospitals and specialised health care facilities. Total expenditure on healthcare per head of the population was $1,579 in 2013, 6.2% of GDP. There were 12,191 physicians in the country in 2009, 36.14 per 100,000 population. There is now Compulsory Health Insurance for Lithuanian residents. There are 5 Territorial Health Insurance Funds, covering Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipėda, Šiauliai and Panevėžys. Contributions for people who are economically active are 9% of income. In 2016 225,510 people, about 8% of the population, had not paid their contributions to the National Health Insurance fund, but it was thought many were actually not in the country. The insurance scheme does not cover adult dentistry or, for most people, outpatient prescription medicines. Only about 1% take out additional voluntary health insurance. Emergency medical services are provided free of charge to all residents. Access to hospital treatment is normally by referral by a General Practitioner. Prescribable medicines are listed in the Lithuanian State Medicines Register. ==See also== *Ministry of Health (Lithuania) ==References== ","title":"Health in Lithuania"},{"id":"35325713","text":"14 Hospitals like the Luxembourg City St. Zita Convent facility provide a wide range of healthcare services for Luxembourg's citizens. Healthcare in Luxembourg is based on three fundamental principles: compulsory health insurance, free choice of healthcare provider for patients and compulsory compliance of providers in the set fixed costs for the services rendered. Citizens are covered by a healthcare system that provides medical, maternity and illness benefits and, for the elderly, attendance benefits. The extent of the coverage varies depending on the occupation of the individual. Those employed or receiving social security have full insurance coverage, and the self-employed and tradesmen are provided with both medical benefits and attendance benefits. That is all funded by taxes on citizens' incomes, payrolls and wages. However, the government covers the funding for maternity benefits as well as any other sector that needs additional funding. About 75% of the population purchases a complementary healthcare plan. About 99% of the people are covered under the state healthcare system. == Funding Luxembourg's Health System == According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), healthcare spending on behalf of the government of Luxembourg topped $4.1 Billion, amounting to about $8,182 for each citizen in the nation. The entirety of funding comes from domestic sources, where the government covers about 84% of healthcare funding with household expenditures covering the remaining costs. With the allocation of about 15% of total government expenditures toward health programs, the nation of Luxembourg collectively spent nearly 7% of its Gross Domestic Product on health, placing it among the highest spending countries on health services and related programs in 2010 among other well-off nations in Europe with high average income among its population. As a whole, health expenditures take up a share of total GDP at 1.8 percentage points under the average across OECD nations. Before healthcare reform took place in 1992, payment for healthcare services was based on a fee- per-service requirement, whereas now it is based on individual budgets negotiated between health insurance agencies and the hospitals at the nationwide level. The state role at most consists of working with care providers for accreditation, and management of contracts. Citizens pay at most 5% of their annual wage into the nationwide coverage program. Mutual Medico- Surgical Fund (CMCM) As Luxembourg's primary voluntary health insurance program, the Cause Médico-Chirurgicale Mutualiste (Mutual Medico-Surgical Fund) covers a wide range of services for citizens such as * hospital costs not covered by statutory insurance * additional charges for private hospital room * pre-operative and post-operative treatment costs * dental prostheses not covered by the statutory insurance * diagnostic, medical, operative and hospitalization costs for a surgical intervention abroad * partial reimbursement where no agreement exists on the cost of a treatment == Healthcare Organization and Access == Social Care Currently in place is a law passed on September 8, 1998 between the state and non-governmental organizations, (NGO's) working in social care. Independent NGO's work alongside the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Family and Social Welfare as one of the widest sectors in government assistance, extending social care in Luxembourg to include services such as drug prevention activities, shelter for the country's homeless and resources for single parents, such as childcare and recreational-type activities. Coverage for services deemed nonessential as part of compulsory health insurance frameworks is not only available, but widely utilized, with over 75% of the national population purchasing complementary health insurance to extend the range of care to non-useful services addressing non-threatening conditions. Insurance The Statutory health insurance system in Luxembourg is responsible for the healthcare of 99% of its residents. This compulsory system of health insurance is managed and provided by the Union of Sickness Funds alongside 9 separate agencies among which the general population is distributed and allocated on the basis of the professional occupation they hold. All services rendered by professionals are defined and assessed under the Ministers of Social Security and Health. The Voluntary health insurance program has typically been limited as a direct result of the compulsory public system that covers the majority of the population' debts for medical services. ==Primary Challenges to National Health == The EU's \\"Alcohol Belt\\" where Alcohol transport policies have made Luxembourg a top consumer and hotspot for alcohol sales in the region Across Luxembourg one of the greatest problems to the nations's health has been the high number of deaths from non-communicable diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory diseases, arising from a variety of factors, though most notably from substance abuse. Premature mortality as a direct result of NCD's has been a primary cause of death nationwide, with the probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years at 11%, with cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer claiming the most lives among the middle-aged group . EU conference assessing cross-border alcohol transport policy. Alcohol Luxembourg boasts one of the highest levels of alcohol consumption among European nations, showcasing an average consumption rate of over 60% above the European average. Alcohol policy within the EU has promoted high levels of consumption through low prices and wide availability.The mortality rate from alcohol-related causes is one of the highest among other European nations such as Slovenia, Croatia, and Finland, evidently a direct result of high levels of consumption as part of harmful drinking patterns among people in Luxembourg. Contributory to high consumption is a relatively cheaper cost of strong alcohol items such as grain alcohol.According to OECD data, 35% of adults in Luxembourg in 2014 consumed large quantities of alcohol in one sitting. Alcohol abuse and dependency have accounted for a considerable share of the alcohol-related diseases observed in the cause of death among citizens . ==References== Category:Health in Luxembourg Lux ","title":"Healthcare in Luxembourg"},{"id":"35325715","text":"Binghamton University School of Management building Binghamton University School of Management is the business school of Binghamton University in Binghamton, New York, one of five professional schools on campus.

Malta has a good overall quality of health and has seen rapid growth and improvement in key health indicatorsAzzopardi Muscat, N., Calleja, N., Buttigieg, S., & Merkur, S. (2017). Malta: health system review. Health systems in transition, 19(1), 1-137..Malta has seen significant development in the practice of mental health which has been supported by new infrastructure and increased government health spending. The introduction of health focused government initiatives, particularly around nutrition, alcohol, smoking and eHealth will likely contribute to the further improvement of overall health nationwide. However, there is also a persistence of negative health trends within the Maltese islands. The Maltese diet has shifted away from the traditional Mediterranean diet to include a higher intake of fats and sugars Tessier, Sophie; Gerber, Mariette (2005-12). \\"Factors determining the nutrition transition in two Mediterranean islands: Sardinia and Malta\\". Public Health Nutrition. 8(8): 1286–1292. doi:10.1079/PHN2005747. ISSN 1368-9800.. This is attributed to factors such as increased access to processed foods and the diversification of food preparation methods. Alcohol consumption and smoking prevalence remain average for the region however the occurrence of teenage alcohol abuse and passive smoking in children is an area of health concern. As well as this, an abnormally high instance of childhood and adult obesity poses a large issue for the Maltese health system . These risk factors within the population have resulted in a large occurrence of Ischaemic Heart Disease, the highest occurrence rate of the disease in the European Union. == Health Indicators == The life expectancy at birth in Malta is 82.4 years which is 1.5 years higher than the average life expectancy of 80.9 across the European Union\\"Malta: Country Health Profile 2017\\". www.oecd-ilibrary.org. doi:10.1787/9789264283497-en. Retrieved 2020-05-29.. The life expectancy in Malta has also increased by more than 4 years since 2000, indicating improvements in health in Malta overall. Life expectancy at birth varies between males and females with a life expectancy of 84.1 for females and Malta and 80.5 for males in Malta . 23.5% of the population were over 60 years old in 2013. Infant health in Malta also indicates sound overall health with high infant immunisation rates, with only 1% of one-year-old children lacking immunisations. Malta has a low infant mortality rate, with 5.6 deaths per 1000 live births . Environmental contribution to health in Malta is also minimal with mortality rate as a result of ambient air pollution being 20 per 100,000, placing Malta in the ‘Very High Human Development’ category as defined by the WHO. The mortality rate as a result of unsafe water and sanitation services is 0.1 per 100,000, again placing Malta in WHO’s ‘Very High Human Development’ category in relation to environmental demographics. ==Diet and Nutrition== The traditional Mediterranean diet which had been consumed in Malta before the mid to late 20th century was rich in fruits, vegetables, olive oil and fish. The Maltese diet now includes a larger amount of sugar, fats and meat products . Cheeses and desserts were two categories in which an increase in consumption has been seen . There are also a large number of traditional Maltese desserts which are consumed widely across Malta. Malta has also seen an increase in the consumption of processed foods, particularly within younger demographics. This increase in the consumption of fats, sugars and processed foods in Malta is aligned with global shifts in food consumption in recent history. The movement away from a traditional Mediterranean diet is a result of multiple factors. These include increased disposable income within the population and improved living conditions overall, as well as the development of commercial trade with other nations and increased diversity in foods and food preparation methods available . Although a Mediterranean diet is considered healthy, reducing the chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke by a third the Maltese diet, said to be influenced by the 200-year British rule and the proximity to Italy does not have the same beneficial effects. Biscuits, chocolates and sweets are more popular than nuts and fruit and in general the population follows a more Westernised diet than geography might indicate. == Health Issues == Obesity Over the past decade, incidences of both childhood and adult obesity have risen in Malta, and are now the highest in the European Union . These unusually high obesity rates have been attributed to a sedentary lifestyle, with greatly below average levels of physical activity in both children and adults, as well as the movement away from a traditional Mediterranean diet towards manufactured and packaged foods . In 2015 the World Health Organization reported that Malta had the highest overweight and obesity rates in the European Union, and third in the whole of Europe, after Andorra and Turkey.Cauchi, Daniel; Rutter, Harry; Knai, Cecile (December 2015). \\"An obesogenic island in the Mediterranean: mapping potential drivers of obesity in Malta\\". Public Health Nutrition. 18 (17): 3211–3223. doi:10.1017/S1368980015000476. In 2011 it was reported that 21.1% of women and 24.7% of men were obese and 29.5% of Maltese children aged 11–15 were either overweight or obese. It was suggested that this was a result of increased trade and urbanisation, and an associated decrease in physical activity and increase in consumption of oil and sugar based foods. Education Minister Evarist Bartolo established a programme of screening and testing school children to establish their body mass index in June 2015. School tuck shops will not sell soft drinks, but only water.  Ischaemic Heart Disease  Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in Malta for both males and females. Ischaemic Heart Disease is the most prevalent cardiovascular disease in Malta and was responsible for one in every five deaths in Malta in 2016. Diabetes is a significant risk factor in the development of Ischaemic Heart Disease. Malta’s high incidence of obesity and diabetes, the third highest in the European Union, are both risk factors for Ischaemic heart disease and are thought to be a contributing factors to the prevalence of Ischaemic Heart Disease.  Transmissible Diseases  Despite good overall health, incidences of infectious diseases such as HIV and Tuberculosis have risen in Malta . The majority of HIV and Tuberculosis cases in Malta are foreign-born. Screening undertaken on undocumented immigrants upon entry into Malta showed that Tuberculosis prevalence was 390 per 100,000 people. In comparison, the incidence of Tuberculosis in the Maltese born population is 2.1 per 100, 000 people. In 2016 Malta recorded the third highest number of new HIV cases in the European Union. A similar upward trend has been seen in Tuberculosis cases however this growth has stabilised . Throughout Malta’s history it has been affected by large global outbreaks of transmissible disease, such as the Cholera outbreak of 1837 and the Spanish Flu epidemic which was present in Malta from 1918-1919. Malta has also been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak with the first confirmed case of Coronavirus in Malta on March 7th 2020\\\\.  Smoking and Alcohol Consumption  20.1% of the Maltese population aged 15 years and over are categorised as daily smokers. When divided by gender, 23.3% of males aged over 15 are considered daily smokers while 17% of females over the age of 18 are considered daily smokers. However, whilst the number of male daily smokers is decreasing, the number of female daily smokers is increasing. Europe has the highest proportion of smokers when compared to other regions globally with 28% of European adults considered smokers. Passive smoking in children is also an issue of prevalence in Malta with 31% of 5-8 year old children considered passive smokers. This high rate of passive smoking as well smoking uptake in young teens has resulted in an increase in the rates of asthma diagnosis in children in Malta. A ban on smoking in all enclosed public places came into force in January 2013. An earlier law of 2004, the second in Europe, had restricted smoking to designated areas, ventilated and totally cut off from the rest of the establishment. The EU anti-smoking campaign HELP: A Life Without Tobacco had found the earlier ban had beneficial effects. The government offers Tobacco Dependence Support Classes at clinics around the island and a Quit Line and Free phone service for those who want to stop smoking. On average, an adult in Malta consumes eight litres of pure alcohol annually. This is below the European average of eleven litres per year. However, a 2019 WHO report indicated that Malta’s growth in alcohol consumption is one of the largest in the European Union. Whilst current levels of consumption for adults remains within average range, the consumption of alcohol in Malta has been linked as a contributing factor to the high occurrence of ischaemic heart disease. Whilst alcohol consumption quantities in adults are not considered high, there is a high instance of alcohol abuse and binge drinking among teens. The legal age to drink and purchase alcohol in Malta is 17, raised from 16 in 2009. Diabetes Diabetes is a significant health issue within Malta. Estimates show that 10% of the adult population in Malta (those aged above 18) currently have the condition, with a large number of these cases likely undiagnosed. It is predicted that cases of diabetes in Malta are likely to rise. Many of the risk factors associated with the development of Type 2 diabetes are prevalent in Malta, including obesity, low levels of physical activity, unhealthy eating habits and smoking. Specialist diabetes services and care is provided at Mater Dei Hospital in Msida. In 2015 it was estimated that $2113 was spent by the Maltese government on each person suffering with diabetes. ==Exercise and Physical Activity== The Today Public Policy Institute described the population as \\"one of the fattest, laziest and most car-dependent nations on the planet\\" in December 2015. Physical laziness was said to be legendary. Their report condemned the government's approach to public health, and to encouraging activity in particular, saying that the \\"living and transport environment has been systematically degraded to the extent that people are not inclined to opt for active mobility options but use their car as default transport, even for short journeys\\". Malta is the least physically active country in the world, with 71.9% of the population inactive. A very high proportion of children are inactive, watching three hours of television or more per night. Less than 1% cycle regularly and the country is reckoned to be the worst and most dangerous country for cycling in the EU. In Malta, only 39% of young males and 10% of young females are meeting the recommended one hour of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day. A quarter of young males and females also exceeded the recommended screen time on weekends and weekdays. In the adult population, 72% of people are classed as physically inactive . One reason for the lower than recommended levels of physical activity, especially in children, is the high population density and division of land use within Malta. 29.7% of land area in the Maltese islands is urban or industrial with a further 51% dedicated to agricultural use . This has left little area for the development of outdoor spaces devoted to physical activity, especially in urban residential areas. ==Mental Health== Whilst there has been minimal reporting on the state of mental health in Malta, statistics indicate that in 2014, 4.3% of deaths were the result of mental health and behavioural disorders. Outpatient and inpatient mental health services are available through both public and private health providers and community based mental health clinics have been growing. Malta also has a very high ratio of psychiatric beds per 100,000 people in the population. Malta has previously had only a small number of mental health professionals as a result of a lack of academic capability within the country. Malta is continuing to undergo development in the area of mental health. The Mental Health Act was introduced in 2014 and outlined plans to fortify existing facilities and services as well as to drive the growth of community centred outpatient clinics. == Health Infrastructure ==  Hospitals and Public Health Facilities  Mater Dei Hospital in Msida The Maltese healthcare systems consists of both public and private streams of health service facilities. The public, tax- funded channel of healthcare is free for Maltese residents at the point of service and provides a large scope of high quality facilities .The Mater Dei Hospital located in Msida is the primary hospital nationally and also functions as a training hospital. It was established in 2007, up until which St Luke’s in Pieta was the nations primary public hospital. Both hospitals provide a full range of services and serve a large proportion of the nation’s population. There has been recent growth in Malta’s private healthcare system with an increased number of individuals residing in Malta purchasing insurance through private providers . Private hospitals provide treatment using advanced technologies with a number of smaller private hospitals providing specialised care for a broad range of health conditions .  Government Initiatives  Government health expenditure per capita in Malta has increased steadily in the past decade with per person spending increasing by 60% to EUR 2732 per person. The European Structural Investment Fund has allocated an additional EUR 19, 000, 000 in its 2014-2020 program to assist in the development and up skilling of health workers as well as to contribute to the establishment of eHealth programs in Malta. Public health policies and initiatives in Malta have had a focus on reducing tobacco and alcohol consumption and have been successful with Malta recording the third lowest rate of death from preventable disease in the European Union . The Maltese Government, specifically the Parliamentary Secretariat for Health, has also released recommended dietary guidelines in order to promote healthier eating. These were published in 2016 and are aligned with the 2015-2020 Food and Nutrition Action Plan for Malta . The guidelines encourage the consumption of foods from all six food groups, and recommend minimising the consumption of saturated and trans fat, salt and sugar. ==See also== Healthcare in Malta ==References== ","title":"Health in Malta"},{"id":"35325731","text":"Mark Samuel Weinberg (born 13 May 1948) was a judge of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria from July 2008 to May 2018.

He left to become a mariner and spent many years at sea, returning home for brief family visits. He came to America in 1836 and located in St. Louis, Missouri, where in 1837 he met Matilda Alexander Cail, a native of Scotland, born in Edinburgh, May 19, 1816, the daughter of widowed Sarah Alexander.Genealogical records of the pioneers, etc., by Charles E. Harrison, pub. 1915 Some historians claim that James met Matilda in Scotland but her mother refused the marriage due to her young age, so she left with Matilda to St. Louis, Only to have James pursue her there. Two notable Tampa historians specifically state they never met before St. Louis. Matilda’s mother, a wealthy widow, disapproved at first of the match because of McKay’s hazardous occupation and because Matilda was young of age. In St. Louis, Sarah Alexander married a Mr. Cail, an Englishman who had large investments in western lands. Mr. Cail disappeared while exploring the western wilderness, and left Madam Sarah Alexander Cail a widow once again, but much richer. In St. Louis, the over 6 feet tall, broad-shouldered and persuasive young Scot continued his courtship of Matilda.\\"James McKay, Sr. The Scottish Chief Sixth Mayor of Tampa\\" at www.tampapix.com/mckay.htm Finally, the mother consented to their marriage. McKay was 27 years old and the bride 17. In 1838 James and Matilda, along with her mother, moved to Mobile, Alabama, where the couple had their first four children: George, Sarah I., James Jr. and John Angus. In Mobile, Captain McKay met the Rev. Daniel Simmons, the Baptist minister who had established a mission in Hillsborough County in 1828 and had lived there until the Seminole War started, when he went to Alabama. Reverend Simmons was an ardent Florida booster and never ceased singing the praises of the Tampa Bay region. Captain McKay did not need much selling on the future prospects of the bay section. He knew that because of its geographical location, Tampa Bay was destined to become one of the leading ports of the nation. So in the early fall of 1846 he decided to go to Tampa. Chartering a schooner, Captain McKay left Mobile with his family in September, 1846. Reverend and Mrs. Simmons went with him, and so did Madame Cail and Mitchell McCarty and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of the Simmonses. The schooner never reached Tampa. As the McKay schooner sailed south along the Florida coast, a violent storm drove the vessel upon a reef near the mouth of the Chassahowitzka River. Captain McKay, a brawny man, repeatedly swam through the rough surf to carry his wife, the children, and Madam Cail ashore. The slaves also survived the shipwreck, but the entire cargo was lost. They tarried at Chassahowitzka for a time where Donald S., their fourth son, was born August 8, 1846. The Simmons and McCarty families went on to Brooksville but the McKays soon afterward made their way to Tampa, arriving in November. Madame Cail came with them.Tampa-A history of the city and the Tampa Bay region of Florida, by Grismer, Karl H, edited by Mckay, D. B, 1950 p. 109-110 == Tampa == On Oct. 13, 1846, the McKays entered the little village of Tampa which numbered less than two hundred inhabitants, exclusive of the soldiers in Fort Brooke. The village consisted of a few crude log huts thatched with palmetto fronds, with wooden shutters to keep out the cold and rain. The cottages were scattered over a sea of white sand. Cattle and pigs roamed at will.THE SUNLAND TRIBUNE, Journal of the TAMPA HISTORICAL SOCIETY, Volume VIII Number 1 November 1982 - JAMES McKAY, I, THE SCOTTISH CHIEF OF TAMPA BAY By Tony PizzoJames McKay Jr. in \\"Reminiscences - History of Tampa in the Olden Days\\" Dec. 18, 1923 Upon moving to Tampa, McKay opened a general store on Franklin Street (Tampa), invested in real estate, and operated a sawmill on the Hillsborough River.

He and his wife had five more children in Tampa (Donald, Marion, Almeria, Matilda and Charles).http://www.tampapix.com/mckayfamily.htm Mayor McKay was elected mayor on February 12, 1859, serving until February 1, 1860.James McKay Sr. previous mayors Tampa City Clerk Department His accomplishments include the establishment of standard procedures and forms for licenses, ordinances and legal notices; regulation of the Jackson Street ferry service, and a rental agreement for the Fort Brooke military reservation after purchase attempts failed. The rental deal lasted 18 months until April 1861 when Confederate troops occupied the fort and declared martial law. McKay was a citizen of the United Kingdom throughout his life and is the only non-U.S. citizen to serve as Mayor of Tampa. Captain McKay In 1858 McKay made a contract with the Morgan Line allowing him to use USS Magnolia (1854) twice a month at a price of $1,500 each run in order to ship cattle to Cuba. This established the Magnolia as the first of many ships to be used in the same way, and the introduction of Spanish doubloons to Florida can be traced back to the trading trips made by Magnolia. Civil War During the Civil War McKay used his ships to run the Union naval blockade and brought guns, ammunition, foodstuffs and other merchandise for the Confederate army and civilians. McKay Bay In late 1861, the Union navy set up a blockade near the mouth of Tampa Bay as part of the overall Anaconda Plan, which sought to squeeze the Confederacy off from outside sources of money and supplies. Local blockade runners continued to slip out undetected to the Gulf of Mexico. Most notable (though not most successful) among these was McKay who delivered Florida cattle and citrus to Spanish Cuba in exchange for gold and supplies before being captured and imprisoned by Union forces. McKay Bay, the portion of Tampa Bay adjoining the port, is named in his honor. On October 14, 1861, McKay was caught. He and his and vessel were seized and he was imprisoned in Key West until March 1862 when he took an oath of allegiance to the United States. In 1863, McKay was appointed Commissary Agent for the 5th District of Florida by Confederate Major Pleasant W. White. He stymied Confederate army attempts to ship beef, employing a series of excuses.

However like other wealthy countries, New Zealand suffers from high rates of obesity and heart disease. ==History of New Zealanders' health== Māori life expectancy was about 30 years in the 18th century, similar to that of Western Europe. After Europeans brought new diseases, and loss of land impoverished many Māori, the childhood mortality rate was very high and Māori life expectancy dropped to 25 years for men and 23 years for women by the end of the 19th century. Pre-contact Māori viewed disease as a punishment for breaking tribal tapu but also recognised that some families were prone to certain disease. The standard practice of tohunga was to isolate the victim in a small shelter. The most common serious disease was tuberculosis (kohi). However, Māori did not recognise the symptoms as being from one disease. Kohi was considered the work of demons and caused by makutu (witchcraft). ==Public health programs== There are public health campaigns for obesity, drinking, smoking and various vaccines. == Health care == The health care system has undergone significant changes throughout the past several decades. From an essentially fully public system based on the Social Security Act 1938, reforms have introduced market and health insurance elements primarily since the 1980s, creating a mixed public-private system for delivering healthcare. In 2012, New Zealand spent 8.7% of GDP on health care, or US$3,929 per capita. Of that, approximately 77% was government expenditure. In a 2010 study, New Zealand was shown to have the lowest level of medication use in 14 developed countries (i.e. used least medicines overall), and also spent the lowest amount on healthcare amongst the same list of countries, with US$2510 ($3460) per capita, compared to the United States at US$7290. == Mental health == Mental health in New Zealand generally follows the trends of mental health in other OECD countries. New Zealand's outdoor life style and high standard of living are balanced by isolation and a self-reliant culture, which discourages asking for help. Historically, people with mental health problems were institutionalised, whereas now the focus is on care in the wider community. The stigma around poor mental health has been lessened in recent years as a result of this change and public education campaigns. However, New Zealand's Māori people, other minorities, and youth continue to be over- represented in the negative mental health statistics. ==Health statistics== OECD member countries in the years 1996–2003.

Born in Kraków, she survived the Holocaust with the help of Oskar Schindler, who was credited with saving the lives of nearly 1,200 Jewish forced laborers. After the war, Jonas-Rosenzweig emigrated to the United States. She resided in Boca Raton, Florida. Jonas- Rosenzweig met the daughter of Amon Göth, , and together they were featured in the 2006 documentary, Inheritance, made for PBS by James Moll. ==Life== Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig was born Helena Sternlicht in Kraków, Second Polish Republic in 1925, to Szymon and Lola Sternlicht. She remembered her early life as happy. She had two sisters, Bronisława and Sydonia. When Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, she and her family were forced to relocate to the Kraków Ghetto.  Płaszów Concentration Camp  Płaszów, from which Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig said Göth would shoot at prisoners. Later, he used to step outside to hunt humans, with his Tyrolean hat marking his intentions. It was the signal for seasoned prisoners to attempt to hide. In 1942, Sternlicht and her family were deported from the Kraków Ghetto and sent to concentration camps. Her father died at the Bełżec extermination camp. She, her mother, and two sisters were sent to Kraków-Płaszów, an arbeitslager (forced labor camp). On the third day of her internment at Płaszów, Sternlicht was washing windows in a barracks when Göth, the camp commandant, entered the room. He commented on the job she was doing and ordered her to go to his villa on the grounds of the camp to work as a housemaid. She moved from the barracks to Göth's residence, where she was forced to work as a maid. She shared a room in the basement with another woman, Helen Hirsch (portrayed in the novel Schindler's Ark and its film adaptation Schindler's List), who was also forced to work for Göth. The two women shared the household duties at the commandant's home for the next two years, where they lived in constant fear for their lives. While working for Göth, Sternlicht saw his notorious sadism firsthand. She said that he would shoot prisoners from the balcony of his villa, and she saw him murder several people and order the deaths of many more. He also beat her. She said that while Göth as depicted in Schindler's List appeared to be interested sexually in his maid, he was not attracted to her in real life. She later recalled that shortly after she moved to Göth's home, she saw him suddenly, and without provocation, shoot to death a young Jewish man who worked for him as a valet. During this period Sternlicht had a boyfriend at the camp, Adam Sztab, who was part of a resistance group inside the camp. She stole some papers from Göth that she gave to Sztab. Göth was told of Sztab's activities by a guard. Göth shot Sztab to death within earshot of Sternlicht, and she was certain that he would kill her too, but he never mentioned it to her. Göth had Sztab's body hung publicly for other prisoners to see, along with a warning about trying to escape. Oskar Schindler Helena Sternlicht and her two sisters' names on Schindler's famous list Oskar Schindler was a frequent guest at Göth's home and he often had encouraging words for Sternlicht, who recalled his saying to her, \\"Remember the people in Egypt? They were freed. So you will be, too.\\" After Göth's arrest for embezzling Jewish property from the German government, she later recalled, \\"Like magic, all of a sudden the doorbell rings – Schindler is standing there in his coat and saying, 'You're coming with me'\\". Schindler, who saved about 1,200 Jews from Auschwitz by claiming he needed them to work in his factory, added Sternlicht and her sisters, Bronisława and Sydonia, along with Helen Hirsch, to his list of workers who later became known as the Schindlerjuden. By that time, their mother had died from pneumonia due to the poor conditions at the camp. As the Red Army approached Kraków in late 1944, Płaszów was closed, and the inmates were sent to camps around Poland, including death camps like Auschwitz. Schindler made plans to open a munitions factory in Brněnec, Czech Protectorate, using the workers he had in Kraków. The men on Schindler's list traveled safely by train to Brněnec, but Schindler's 300 female workers, including Sternlicht and her sisters, were sent to Auschwitz. After a few weeks of negotiations and bribes by Schindler, the women were sent to Brněnec as well. Sternlicht and her sisters spent the remainder of the war in the relative safety of Schindler's camp until they were liberated by the Red Army in May 1945. After the war, Sternlicht testified against Amon Göth at his trial in Kraków, where he was sentenced to death and executed. She met Joseph Jonas two days after liberation, married him and emigrated with her family to the United States in 1946.Płaszów Memorial, where Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig and met for the first time. In The Film Inheritance In 2004, Jonas-Rosenzweig met with , Amon Göth's daughter. Hertwig had requested the meeting, but Jonas-Rosenzweig was hesitant because her memories of Göth and the concentration camp were so traumatic. She eventually agreed after Hertwig wrote to her, \\"We have to do it for the murdered people.\\" Jonas-Rosenzweig felt touched by this sentiment and agreed to meet her at the Płaszów Memorial Monument in Poland and tour Göth's villa with her for the 2006 documentary Inheritance. The documentary's director, James Moll, an associate of Steven Spielberg, helped bring the two women together to make the film for PBS. ==Personal life== Two days after they were liberated from the Nazis, she met her first husband, Joseph Jonas. They married in 1946 and emigrated to the United States. They lived in the Bronx, raising three children: a son and twin girls. In 1980, Joseph, who suffered from survivor's guilt, committed suicide. She then married a philanthropist and real-estate developer, Henry Rosenzweig (born 5 September 1917). She was widowed a second time in 2007.

Snowstorms in March 1927 completely cut off Silverton, Colorado from outside contact. Although the town had ample food and water, a pandemic outbreak of typhoid fever had stricken the town, and medicine was desperately needed. The 120th was called upon to deliver vaccines to Silverton. On March 7, 1927, Kearns and fellow guard pilot Clyde Plank set off from Lowry Field at 8:30am in a Douglas O-2C to deliver the desperately needed vaccines. Kearns and Plank flew over dangerous mountainous terrain to Silverton and arrived shortly after noon. The pair dropped the supplies from the aircraft to the snow-covered town below; the supplies landed unharmed in a snow drift. With the mission complete the pair then refueled at Pueblo and returned to Lowry Field at 4:55pm to a crowd of local reporters.Whitley, 1988, p.36 The mission was widely covered by local press, making Kearns a local celebrity. The flight also brought attention to the wide variety of uses for civil aviation in the United States at the time.Whitley, 1988, p.36 == Later life == During his final years in Colorado Kearns wrote aviation columns for the Denver Post, promoting the development and expansion of general aviation.

In mid-1950, Moghioroș replaced Pauker to become party supervisor of the Agriculture Ministry's agrarian section. A year earlier, at a politburo discussion, he was the only member who did not grant even token acknowledgment to the idea that collectivization should happen gradually or cautiously, condemning the \\"opportunist-conciliatory line\\" as \\"non-Leninist, because we can't build socialism without collective farms\\". Once in charge, he sharply criticized Pauker's more lenient approach, holding nightly meetings with officials to decide on new collective farms and ordering a scaled-down plan for the spring be accelerated during the summer of 1950.Robert Levy, Ana Pauker: the Rise and Fall of a Jewish Communist, p.104. University of California Press, Berkeley, 2001, Around 1957, Moghioroș decided that Romania did not have more cattle because the best hay was fed to horses. Consequently, he ordered a horse slaughter that claimed some 800,000 animals, which had disastrous consequences in agriculture. At the time, horses were still the predominant means of rural transport, and tractors could not be used on farms with clay soil because they became stuck. In addition, by closing the stables at Mangalia, Făgăraș, Bonțida and Rușețu, he sharply reduced the country's variety of horse breeds.

Constantinescu approached Moghioroș in an attempt to enlist him on his side, which prompted Moghioroș to go to Gheorghiu-Dej immediately and inform him that an \\"antiparty platform\\" had arisen.Vladimir Tismăneanu, Stalinism for All Seasons: A Political History of Romanian Communism, p. 146–47. University of California Press, 2003, As with Borilă, Gheorghiu-Dej's successor Nicolae Ceaușescu removed Moghioroș from the party's top body, the permanent presidium, under the pretext of his disease.

Moghioroș died in Bucharest in 1969 and was buried in one of the crypts of the chamber surrounding the \\"Monument of the Heroes of the Struggle for the Freedom of the People and the Fatherland, for Socialism,\\" now known as the Carol Park Mausoleum. In 1991, after the Romanian Revolution, his remains were exhumed and interred elsewhere. ==Notes * Category:1911 births Category:1969 deaths Category:People from Salonta Category:Romanian politicians of Hungarian descent Category:Romanian communists Category:Inmates of Doftana prison Category:Deputy Prime Ministers of Romania ","title":"Alexandru Moghioroș"},{"id":"35325927","text":"The Sichuan tit (Poecile weigoldicus) is a species of bird in the tit family Paridae.

Earlier, the predecessor of Marumitsu Mining Company, Takasaki Mining Company was established in 1924 by Kōichirō Noda, a contractor with 50 workers, Kimiichi Oguri, an accountant general, and Shōsaburō Takasaki, a money lender in Naha.Sato[1980:61-116]Miki[2003:47-57] The company changed their name to Marumitsu Goumei Company in 1933. First, they mined coal along Nakara River but then they investigated other areas and found good layers of coal along Utara River in 1935. In 1936, they started to mining there with a large lodging house for 400 single workers and more than 10 houses for couples. There were two thick layers of coal in the Utara Mine; one was 60 cm thick and the other 40 cm thick. Coal was sent first by Minecart and later by boat on the Utara river carrying 20 to 30 tons each. In 1938, the mine was producing 2,500 tons monthly. Facilities for workers were extraordinarily good, compared with other mines. Sanitary conditions were greatly improved; glass was used for the prevention of mosquitoes and hence malaria. There were large bathrooms, good water supplies and a doctor's office. There was a 300-seat theater for movies; and dramas were played by workers there. There were three festivals for the workers. Children were educated at a school called Midori Gakuen (Green School). However, the involvement in the Pacific War in 1941 increased the demand for coal, leading to a worsening of mining conditions; men were drafted into military service and the mining operation was discontinued in 1943. The buildings of the mine were destroyed by American air raids. The president of the company, Kōichirō Noda gave up the mine and was engaged in agriculture. The Midori School was made a forerunner to Uehara Elementary School, Taketomi, Okinawa.Taketomicho [1974:457-459] ==Cultural heritage== In 2007, the ruins of the Utara Mine were designated as a Heritage of Industrial Modernization in Japan and a road was improved. ==See also== *Iriomote Coal Mine ==References== *Taketomichōshi Editing Committee, Records of Taketomi Town 1974, Taketomi, Okinawa *Kin-ichi Satō, Iriomote Coal Mine Memorandam 1980, Hirugi Shobō, Naha. *Kei Higa, Okinawa Encyclopedia 1983 jō chū ge, Okinawa Times Sha, Naha. *Takeshi Miki, A Collection of Documents of Iriomote Coal Mines, 1985, Honpō Shoseki. *Takeshi Miki, History of Okinawa Iriomote Coal Mines 1996, Nihon Keizai Hyōronsha, Tokyo. *Takeshi Miki, Photo Album of Iriomote Coal Mines 2003, Nirai Sha, Okinawa. ==Footnotes== Category:Buildings and structures in Okinawa Prefecture Category:Coal mines in Japan Category:Yaeyama Islands ","title":"Utara Coal Mine"},{"id":"35325942","text":"The 1995–96 North West Counties Football League season was the 14th in the history of the North West Counties Football League, a football competition in England.

It grows in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution mapSEINet, Southwestern Biodiversity, Arizona chapter Quercus hypoleucoides, though usually seen as a shrub, can be found to be a full-sized tree, 30 feet (9 meters) tall in areas where it receives sufficient water. Quercus hypoleucoides can be distinguished from other oaks by its lanceolate leaves which are dark green on top but silver white on the lower surface. == Description == Quercus hypoleucoides produces its flowers in the spring as most plants do. It grows in warm regions and is used as an ornamental due to its unusual foliage. Its species name, hypoleucoides, means \\"white underneath\\" and also happens to be the main way that it is distinguished from other oak trees. This species has acorns which are eaten by both squirrels and birds and even at times by humans. However, before it is safe for people to eat, the tannic acid must first be leached out due to its toxic qualities. * Bark: Is dark gray in color. It is thin with shallow, lighter-colored fissures and narrow ridges. * Twig: Reddish brown in color and are broadly triangular with a sharp point. Are slender to moderate, generally with white fuzz. The end buds are clustered. * Leaves: Are alternate, evergreen, simple, and narrowly oblong to lanceolate. They are usually 2 to 4 inches (5–10 cm) long, with edges revolute. Occasionally there are a few shallow teeth, a narrow pointed tip, and a leathery texture. They are usually a shiny yellow-green on top and white or silvery on the bottom. * Fruits: Oblong acorn that is 1/2 to 3/4 inch long. The cap is scaly bowl-shaped and covers 1/3 of the nut which ripens in 1 (or 2 seasons), maturing in early fall. * Flowers: Quercus hypoleucoides is a monoecious plant and therefore both male and female flowers grow on the same plant. This is opposed to dioecious plants where male flowers and female flowers grow on separate trees. The male flowers form long drooping catkins that are yellow-green in color. The female flowers have very small spikes in leaf axils that appear with the leaves. * Form: Though usually found as a shrub, given enough moisture it can become a medium-sized tree that reaches up to 60 feet (18 meters) tall with a spreading round crown. == Distribution == Quercus hypoleucoides is commonly found in moist canyons and on ridges. It also is found in coniferous forests and high elevated lands from 5,000 to 8,000 feet (1500–2400 meters) above sea level. Mountains of southern Arizona and New Mexico such as the Santa Catalina Mountains and the Chiricahua Mountains, for example, have a pine-oak woodland at an elevation of roughly 5700 to 7200 feet (1710–2160 meters). Here, Quercus hypoleucoides can be found as well as other species of oak trees such as the Quercus arizonica, Q. emoryi, and Q. rugosa. Specimens have also been collected south of the international frontier, in Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Sinaloa. == Fire ecology == Quercus hypoleucoides is a vigorous post-fire resprouter and will form a multi-stem shrub in areas of repeated fire. Quercus hypoleucoides resprouting following fire == Uses == Quercus hypoleucoides has been used for ornamental purposes. Its leaves have a unique contrast due to the very white, silver color of the bottom. Its acorns are a source of food for squirrels and birds. The taller trees also help to provide shade for animals below who need to get away from the strong rays of the sun. == References  *photo of herbarium specimen at Missouri Botanical Garden, collected in Arizona in 1851 hypoleucoides Category:Trees of Northeastern Mexico Category:Trees of Northwestern Mexico Category:Trees of the South-Central United States Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States Category:Flora of Arizona Category:Flora of New Mexico Category:Flora of Texas Category:Plants described in 1876 ","title":"Quercus hypoleucoides"},{"id":"35325977","text":"Life expectancy in Vanuatu is 67 years for men, and 70 years for women.

Just as the desire for the superseding, of war by arbitration to straightening out international complications had its birth in the grief and tears of the widow and the fatherless, so does the above question owe its origin to those who have been seen promising young men cut off in the prime or their youth, or maimed for life by the disparate struggle for football honors. Year after year the list of victims grow, until the matter has at last attracted national attention and in the absence of laws, declaring that young men may not risk life and limb in the gridiron contests some college authorities are forbidding the students to play football, and thus it comes about that institutions that have been prominent in this branch of sport will not be heard of during the present season. \\"A study of the casualties of the football fields proves that those who oppose the game on account of its brutality and danger are justified in their views. Here are a few of the causes of death on the football field or injuries received that resulted in death later: \\"Two opposing players running.

In the struggle one lashed out with his foot, catching another on the head with the heel of his heavy shoe. Kicked man died three days later. \\"The list could have been extended halfway down the column, and a perusal of the news pages of the daily journals will show that deaths or injuries, broken bones, dislocated shoulders, smashed noses and sprained ankles are of daily occurrence among football players. \\"Were it not for the fact that football men of the colleges are young giants who have hardened their muscles and rendered themselves proof against lighter injuries by reason of the fact that they are trained athletes, and have practiced falling and tackling so as to reduce the possibility of accident to a minimum, the list would be much larger.

Roosevelt urged them to curb excessive violence and set an example of fair play for the rest of the country. The schools released a statement condemning brutality and pledging to keep the game clean. President Roosevelt was also concerned about the deaths and serious injuries football was recording.

Because the Nurse Corps met its recruiting quotas, it was not necessary for the US to draft nurses in World War II. She was the first woman and the first nurse to be appointed as Assistant Surgeon General of the United States Public Health Service. ==Biography== Lucile Petry completed a double major in chemistry and English at the University of Delaware in 1924. She received a nursing degree from Johns Hopkins School of Nursing in 1927, and a master's degree from Columbia Teachers College in 1929.\\" She became a clinical nurse instructor at Yale University, and then spent 11 years at the University of Minnesota School of Nursing, where she became an associate professor and Assistant Dean. From 1941 until 1966 Leone worked at the United States Public Health Service. In 1943, Petry became the founding director of the Cadet Nurse Corps. > From July 1943 to October 1945, about 132,000 women were admitted to > colleges across the country under the act. In exchange for federal funding, > participating colleges were required to establish a 24- to 30-month > accelerated education program for nurse candidates. And the women who > enrolled had to pledge to \\"engage in essential nursing, military or > civilian, for the duration of the war. > > In return for that pledge, the government paid all tuition fees and a > monthly stipend that ranged from $15 to $30, depending on the seniority of > the nurse candidate, and supplied distinctive uniforms by fashion designer > Molly Parnis. Lucile Petry Leone The program was a success, training 124,000 nurse cadets in basic schools, making it unnecessary to draft nurses for war service. Petry became the first nurse and the first woman to be promoted to Assistant Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service. She married Nicholas C. Leone in 1952. They divorced in 1967. When she retired from government service in 1966, Lucile P. Leone was the Assistant Surgeon General and Chief Nurse Officer. Leone went on to serve as Assistant Dean and a teacher of nursing at Texas Woman's University until 1971. During the 1960s, she served as President of the National League for Nursing. ==Awards== Leone received the Florence Nightingale Medal of the International Red Cross, the Distinguished Service Award of the United States Public Health Service, and the Lasker Award. She was named by the University of Maryland School of Nursing \\"as one of seven who significantly impacted the nursing profession.\\" She was elected a member of the Institute of Medicine in 1970. The Lucile Petry Leone Award was established by 2,500 members of the Public Health Service to honor Leone upon her retirement, and to encourage nursing leadership. It is presented biennially by the National League for Nursing \\"to an outstanding nurse educator.\\" ==Works== * * ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Bullough, V., Sentz, L., & Stein, A, eds. (1992).

He settled in a small coastal town in the Côte-Nord region of Quebec, which was later renamed Baie-Johan-Beetz in his honour, along with the nearby bay, known as the baie Johan-Beetz. He was born in Boortmeerbeek, Belgium, in the château d'Oudenhouven, to an aristocratic family. His father Johannes Beetz died when he was two years old and his mother Céline Verzyl (or Versyl) remarried an English major named Walter Turner. He had a privileged childhood and the future King Albert was among his childhood acquaintances. In his youth, he participated in hunting in Morocco, Algeria and Congo, and took part in archeological digs. He studied medicine and biology. However, his fiancée (and cousin) Marthe Versyl died of pneumonia. Apparently seeking a change in his life, he considered moving from Belgium to Africa, but then he happened to converse with a certain Monsieur Warner, who talked about the hunting and fishing in Pashti-Baie (or Piastrebaie) along the north shore of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in Quebec, Canada, where Warner had a house. Beetz bought Warner's house on the spot, and moved there in May 1897. Within this year, Beetz meet Henry de Puyjalon, a pioneer in Canadian ecology who was among the first to suggest wildlife conservation areas. Beetz married a local girl named Adéla Tanguay on September 27, 1898, and constructed a very large house, today known as the Maison Johan-Beetz and classified as a historic monument by the Quebec government. The imposing 12-room wooden house was built on a rocky prominence looking over the Piashti River. They eventually had 11 children. Beetz hunted, fished, and trapped with the local villagers, and raised foxes for their fur. He was a naturalist and ornithologist, and made numerous studies and hand drawings. He also invented a mummification process for preserving animal bodies; however, the technique was lost when he died. From 1903 to 1913 he was the local postmaster, and he often served as a sort of doctor. He was credited with sparing the village from the Spanish influenza in 1918–1919 by restricting external contact and disinfecting mail. In 1922 the Beetz family moved to Saint-Laurent, then a suburb of Montreal and today a borough of the city. He bought a house there at 54 rue Saint-Germain. In July 1924, he was made a chevalier in the Order of Leopold II by the Belgian government. He later lived at 322 avenue Laurier, in Quebec City, which has a plaque mentioning that fact. In 1931 he founded a zoo in Charlesbourg (today part of Quebec City), later known by the name Jardin zoologique de Québec (it closed in 2006). He continued to raise foxes at a farm in Vaudreuil. When the business was badly affected by the 1929 stock market crash, he was named director of the fox furring department at the Service de l'élevage des animaux à fourrure of the Quebec government. He wrote a book on the subject entitled \\"L'Indispensable\\" à l'éleveur de renards argentés; it was published in English translation as \\"The Indispensable\\" for Fox Breeders, translated by Thos. J. Carbray. The Université de Montréal wished to give him an honorary doctorate; however, he preferred to deliver an oral thesis presentation, for which he was granted a Doctor of Science degree (Docteur ès Science agricole (vulpiculture)). The fox breeding industry in Quebec did not survive long after the death of its founder, however. In 1965, the village where he spent many years of his life was renamed Baie-Johan-Beetz. There are streets named after him in both Baie-Johan-Beetz and Sept-Îles. There is also a lake, Lac Beetz, in the Lac-Jérôme unorganized territory, which may be named for him, although the Commission de toponymie du Québec does not attest this. ==References* Johan Beetz: Naturaliste * * * Category:People from Montreal Category:Canadian naturalists Category:Knights of the Order of Leopold II Category:1874 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Belgian emigrants to Canada Category:People from Côte-Nord ","title":"Johan Beetz"},{"id":"35326225","text":"Jeffrey Ernest John Spender QC is a former Judge of the Federal Court of Australia that served from 17 May 1984 to 19 July 2010.

The CCD is a national human rights organization of people with disabilities working for an accessible and inclusive Canada. In the 1970s, the CCD became a permanent part of the disability rights movement and it became a fluid entity that includes people with a range of different disabilities. To manage the work that will lead to the achievement of this goal, CCD established the following Committees to guide their activities in key areas: # Human Rights Committee: Identifies Human Rights Committee issues of concern to persons with disabilities that could be addressed through law reform initiatives. # Social Policy Committee: Identifies Social Policy Committee issues of national concern to persons with disabilities. # Transportation Committee # International Development Committee: Provides advice to CCD National Council on reforms that would improve the effect of Canada's foreign aid and policy on persons with disabilities. # Access to Technology Committee. ==Laws and Standards== Since the spring of 2009, the CCD Human Rights Committee has been involved in legal cases involving the interpretation of equality for people with disabilities . The committee seeks to achieve a fair and equal legal system by promoting the adoption of disability-related policy. The CCD has been a clear voice for the dignity and equality of people with disabilities. The CCD has played a key role by bringing disability issues before Parliament and the Supreme Court of Canada. CCD National Action PlanThe CCD National Action Plan; which was review by provincial and federal governments, highlights the importance of employment, adequate income and disability-related support. The Action Plan covers four areas: disability-related supports and deinstitutionalisation, poverty, unemployment and exclusion. The CCD's Nation Action Plan seeks to maximize opportunities for Canadians with disabilities by highlighting the importance of deinstitutionalization and, disability-related support. The disability-related support team is formed by technical aids, sign interpreters, support network and job coaches. Disability support is exclusively for the individual with disability and it contains pertinent information that encourages inclusion and awareness. One of the most important advances for Disability-Related Policy in Canada was the constitutional recognition of the rights of people with disabilities in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Section 15 guarantees equal benefit and protection of the law to people. The charter states that every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, or mental or physical disability. Educational authorities in Canada affirmed that education is essential to enable a person with disability to function in society and that all people, regardless of their handicap, should benefit from it. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Article 24 of the Convention requires States Parties \\"to recognize the right of persons with disabilities to education. With a view to realizing this right without discrimination and on the basis of equal opportunity, States Parties shall ensure an inclusive education system at all levels. The mission of the National Action Plan is to make people realize that society should meet every educational need of a handicapped people. Social JusticeTo most disability rights movement \\"disability\\" is not an inherent trait of the \\"disable\\" person. Rather it is a condition that results from the interaction between physical or mental characteristic labeled \\"impairment\\". The World Health Organization issued a widely definition that distinguishes among impairment (\\"any loss of psychological, physiological, or anatomical function\\"), disability (\\"any restriction of ability to perform an activity within the range considered normal for a human being\\"), and handicap (\\"a disadvantage for a given individual, resulting from an impairment that limits the fulfillment of a role that is normal for that individual.) The social model of disability sees disability as a socially created problem and not at all an attribute of an individual. On the social model, disability demands a political response, since the problem is created by an unaccommodating physical environment brought about by attitudes and other features of the social environment. Social movements for people with disabilities seek to remake society to eliminate \\"disability\\" as a disadvantaged group status. The social right activists seek this result through the means of civil rights. The goal of the Council for Canadians with Disabilities is to have an effective action plan in order to change a social system where handicap people are discriminated. The CCD social justice movement also addresses the high rates of poverty facing Canadians with disabilities and its causes and the lack of access to disability supports that perpetuate barriers and exclusion and keep people with disabilities and their families invisible and marginalized. CCD Social Justice Movement believes in: * Citizenship—People with disabilities have the same rights and responsibilities as Canadians without disabilities. Socially made barriers, which prevent participation and discriminate against people with disabilities, must be eliminated. * Consumer Control—People with disabilities must be involved in all stages of the development of disability services and policies and in all decision-making that affects their lives. * Equality and Human Rights—the Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees equal benefit and protection under the law and the Canadian Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination based upon physical or mental disability. All legislation must conform to the demands of the Charter. * Universal Design—the environment should be designed to be usable by people with various disabilities.] ==CCD Current activities== CCD's current activities seek to provide people with disability with the opportunity to develop self-awareness and appropriate social skills. In 2011, the CCD created a social participation and activity called \\"On the Home Front\\" which highlights the legal efforts to rescue disable people from second-class citizenship. It also provides information about people with disabilities who live on low incomes. The CCD is leading a unique research alliance, focusing on poverty and people with disabilities. “On the Home front” is a strategic initiative that leads a team of disability community and academic researchers dedicated to front bringing forward recommendations and plans for alleviating the disproportionate poverty of Canadians with disabilities, such as poverty, disability, living arrangements and residential needs. The CCD's disability-related support team provides solutions for social exclusion and unemployment. The World Health Assembly has unanimously adopted a resolution that could substantially improve the lives of people with disabilities. The Resolution adopted by the World Health Assembly draws attention to people living with physical, sensory and mental disabilities of various types, their health and rehabilitation needs, and the cost of their exclusion from society. CCD's activists affirmed that the very term \\"disability\\" is often used to describe a condition that prevents an individual from working. People with disabilities living in low-income households are more likely than their counterparts with higher incomes to indicate that they receive only some of the help they need (27.1% vs. 21.3%) or none of the help needed (10.2% vs. 4.7%, respectively.) Therefore, the identity created for people with disabilities is widely perceived as incompatible with the assumption that they should work. The CCD \\"on the Home Front\\" project seeks to prove that attaining employment is a crucial step for people with disability because they will achieve recognition as independent and active participant in society. Organization structure Overall management and administration of the organization takes place in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Council for Canadian with Disabilities refers to its Board of Directors as the National Council of Representatives which consists in seven Directors and officers or members. CCD's members are provincial/territorial cross- disability, consumer-controlled, human rights organizations and national uni- and cross-disability, consumer-controlled, human rights organizations. Every year the National Council of Representatives elects the CCD Executive Committee which has four Honorary Members and an executive board which establishes policies, approves programs and oversees administrative and financial plans. ==References== # Bagenstos, S.R (2009).

It was developed by X (previously Google X) with the mission of producing a ubiquitous computer. Google Glass displays information in a smartphone-like, hands-free format. Wearers communicate with the Internet via natural language voice commands. Google started selling a prototype of Google Glass to qualified \\"Glass Explorers\\" in the US on April 15, 2013, for a limited period for $1,500, before it became available to the public on May 15, 2014. It had an integral 5 megapixel still/720p video camera. The headset received a great deal of criticism amid concerns that its use could violate existing privacy laws. On January 15, 2015, Google announced that it would stop producing the Google Glass prototype, to be continued in 2017 tentatively. In July 2017, Google announced the Google Glass Enterprise Edition. In May 2019, Google announced the Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2. == Development == Google Glass was developed by Google X, the facility within Google devoted to technological advancements such as driverless cars. The Google Glass prototype resembled standard eyeglasses with the lens replaced by a head-up display. In mid-2011, Google engineered a prototype that weighed ; by 2013 they were lighter than the average pair of sunglasses. In April 2013, the Explorer Edition was made available to Google I/O developers in the United States for $1,500. A Glass prototype seen at Google I/O in June 2012 The product was publicly announced in April 2012. Sergey Brin wore a prototype of the Glass to an April 5, 2012, Foundation Fighting Blindness event in San Francisco. In May 2012, Google demonstrated for the first time how Google Glass could be used to shoot videos. Google provided four prescription frame choices for $225 and free with the purchase of any new Glass unit. Google entered in a partnership with the Italian eyewear company Luxottica, owners of the Ray-Ban, Oakley, and other brands, to offer additional frame designs. In June 2014, Nepal government adopted Google Glass for tackling poachers of wild animals and herbs of Chitwan International Park and other parks listed under World heritage sites. In January 2015, Google ended the beta period of Glass (the \\"Google Glass Explorer\\" program).  Release date  In early 2013, interested potential Glass users were invited to use a Twitter message, with hashtag #IfIHadGlass, to qualify as an early user of the product. The qualifiers, dubbed \\"Glass Explorers\\" and numbering 8,000 individuals, were notified in March 2013, and were later invited to pay $1,500 and visit a Google office in Los Angeles, New York or San Francisco, to pick up their unit following \\"fitting\\" and training from Google Glass guides. On May 13, 2014, Google announced a move to a \\"more open beta\\", via its Google Plus page. In February 2015, The New York Times reported that Google Glass was being redesigned by former Apple executive Tony Fadell, and that it would not be released until he deemed it to be \\"perfect\\". In July 2017, it was announced that the second iteration, the Google Glass Enterprise Edition, would be released in the US for companies such as Boeing. Google Glass Enterprise Edition has already been successfully used by Dr. Ned Sahin to help children with autism learn social skills.Sahin NT, Keshav NU, Salisbury JP, Vahabzadeh A Second Version of Google Glass as a Wearable Socio-Affective Aid: Positive School Desirability, High Usability, and Theoretical Framework in a Sample of Children with Autism JMIR Hum Factors 2018;5(1):e1 https://humanfactors.jmir.org/2018/1/e1/ In May 2019, Google announced the Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2. Google also announced a partnership with Smith Optics to develop Glass-compatible safety frames. == Features == Google Glass can be controlled using the touchpad built into the side of the device * Touchpad: A touchpad is located on the side of Google Glass, allowing users to control the device by swiping through a timeline-like interface displayed on the screen. Sliding backward shows current events, such as weather, and sliding forward shows past events, such as phone calls, photos, circle updates, etc. * Camera: Google Glass has the ability to take 5 MP photos and record 720p HD video. Glass Enterprise Edition 2 has an improved 8MP 80° FOV camera. * Display: The Explorer version of Google Glass uses a liquid crystal on silicon (based on an LCoS chip from Himax), field-sequential color system, LED illuminated display. The display's LED illumination is first P-polarized and then shines through the in-coupling polarizing beam splitter (PBS) to the LCoS panel. The panel reflects the light and alters it to S-polarization at active pixel sensor sites. The in-coupling PBS then reflects the S-polarized areas of light at 45° through the out-coupling beam splitter to a collimating reflector at the other end. Finally, the out-coupling beam splitter (which is a partially reflecting mirror, not a polarizing beam splitter) reflects the collimated light another 45° and into the wearer's eye. == Software == A Google Glass with black frame for prescription lens.  Applications  Google Glass applications are free applications built by third-party developers. Glass also uses many existing Google applications, such as Google Now, Google Maps, Google+, and Gmail. Many developers and companies built applications for Glass, including news apps, facial recognition, exercise, photo manipulation, translation, and sharing to social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. Third-party applications announced at South by Southwest (SXSW) include Evernote, Skitch, The New York Times, and Path. On March 23, 2013, Google released the Mirror API, allowing developers to start making apps for Glass. In the terms of service, it was stated that developers may not put ads in their apps or charge fees; a Google representative told The Verge that this might change in the future. On May 16, 2013, Google announced the release of seven new programs, including reminders from Evernote, fashion news from Elle, and news alerts from CNN. Following Google's XE7 Glass Explorer Edition update in early July 2013, evidence of a \\"Glass Boutique\\", a store that will allow synchronization to Glass of Glassware and APKs, was noted. Version XE8 made a debut for Google Glass on August 12, 2013. It brings an integrated video player with playback controls, the ability to post an update to Path, and lets users save notes to Evernote. Several other minute improvements include volume controls, improved voice recognition, and several new Google Now cards. On November 19, 2013, Google unveiled its Glass Development Kit, showcasing the translation tool Word Lens, the cooking program AllTheCooks, and the exercise program Strava among others as successful examples. Google announced three news programs in May 2014—TripIt, FourSquare and OpenTable—in order to entice travelers. On June 25, 2014, Google announced that notifications from Android Wear would be sent to Glass. The European University Press published the first book to be read with Google Glass on October 8, 2014, as introduced at the Frankfurt Book Fair. The book can be read as a normal paper book or—enriched with multimedia elements—with Google Glass, Kindle, on Smartphone and Pads on the platforms iOS and Android.  MyGlass  Google offered a companion Android and iOS app called MyGlass, which allowed the user to configure and manage the device. It was removed on February 22, 2020 from the Play Store.  Voice activation  Other than the touchpad, Google Glass can be controlled using just \\"voice actions\\". To activate Glass, wearers tilt their heads 30° upward (which can be altered for preference) or simply tap the touchpad, and say \\"O.K., Glass.\\" Once Glass is activated, wearers can say an action, such as \\"Take a picture\\", \\"Record a video\\", \\"Hangout with [person/Google+ circle]\\", \\"Google 'What year was Wikipedia founded?'\\", \\"Give me directions to the Eiffel Tower\\", and \\"Send a message to John\\" (many of these commands can be seen in a product video released in February 2013). For search results that are read back to the user, the voice response is relayed using bone conduction through a transducer that sits beside the ear, thereby rendering the sound almost inaudible to other people. == Use in medicine ==  In hospitals  Augmedix developed an app for the wearable device that allows physicians to live-stream the patient visit and claims it will eliminate electronic health record problems, possibly saving them up to 15 hours a week and improving record quality. The video stream is passed to remote scribes in HIPAA secure rooms where the doctor- patient interaction is transcribed. Ultimately, allowing physicians to focus on the patient. Hundreds of users were evaluating the app as of mid-2015. In July 2013, Lucien Engelen commenced research on the usability and impact of Google Glass in the health care field. As of August 2013, Engelen, based at Singularity University and in Europe at Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, was the first healthcare professional in Europe to participate in the Glass Explorer program. His research on Google Glass (starting August 9, 2013) was conducted in operating rooms, ambulances, a trauma helicopter, general practice, and home care as well as the use in public transportation for visually or physically impaired. Research included taking pictures, videos streaming to other locations, dictating operative log, having students watch the procedures and tele-consultation through Hangout. Engelen documented his findings in blogs, videos, pictures, on Twitter, and on Google+, with research ongoing as of that date. In June 2014, Google Glass' ability to acquire images of a patient's retina (\\"Glass Fundoscopy\\") was publicly demonstrated for the first time at the Wilmer Clinical Meeting at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine by Dr. Aaron Wang and Dr. Allen Eghrari. This technique was featured on the cover of the Journal for Mobile Technology in Medicine for January 2015. Doctors Phil Haslam and Sebastian Mafeld demonstrated the first application of Google Glass in the field of interventional radiology. They demonstrated how Google Glass could assist a liver biopsy and fistulaplasty, and the pair stated that Google Glass has the potential to improve patient safety, operator comfort, and procedure efficiency in the field of interventional radiology. In 2015, IOS Press published \\"Clinical and Surgical Applications of Smart Glasses\\" a research article written by a team at the Columbia University Medical Center Department of Neurosurgery's Cerebrovascular Laboratory. Under Neurosurgeon Dr. Sander E. Connolly, Stefan Mitrasinovic, Elvis Camacho, Nirali Trivedi, and others analyzed Google Glass's useful applications including hands-free photo and video documentation, telemedicine, Electronic Health Record retrieval and input, rapid diagnostic test analysis, education, and live broadcasting. In 2017, Swiss researchers assessed in a randomized controlled trial the adherence of emergency team leaders to the American Heart Association's (AHA) Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) guidelines by adapting and displaying them in Google Glasses during simulation-based pediatric cardiac arrest scenarios.  In surgical procedures  On June 20, 2013, Rafael J. Grossmann, a Venezuelan doctor practicing in the U.S., was the first surgeon to demonstrate the use of Google Glass during a live surgical procedure. In August 2013, Google Glass was used at Wexner Medical Center at Ohio State University. Surgeon Dr. Christopher Kaeding used Google Glass to consult with a distant colleague in Columbus, Ohio. A group of students at The Ohio State University College of Medicine also observed the operation on their laptop computers. Following the procedure, Kaeding stated, \\"To be honest, once we got into the surgery, I often forgot the device was there. It just seemed very intuitive and fit seamlessly.\\" On June 21, 2013, Spanish doctor Pedro Guillen, chief of trauma service of Clínica CEMTRO of Madrid, also broadcast a surgery using Google Glass. In July 2014, the startup company Surgery Academy, in Milan, Italy, launched a remote training platform for medical students. The platform is a MOOC that allows students to join any operating theater thanks to Google Glass worn by surgeon. Also in July 2014, This Place released an app, MindRDR, to connect Glass to a Neurosky EEG monitor to allow people to take photos and share them to Twitter or Facebook using brain signals. It is hoped this will allow people with severe physical disabilities to engage with social media. Two participants in the Google Glass Breastfeeding app trial.  In lactation consultation  In Australia, during January 2014, Melbourne tech startup Small World Social collaborated with the Australian Breastfeeding Association (ABA) to create the first hands-free breastfeeding Google Glass application for new mothers. The application, named Google Glass Breastfeeding app trial, allows mothers to nurse their baby while viewing instructions about common breastfeeding issues (latching on, posture etc.) or call a lactation consultant via a secure Google Hangout, who can view the issue through the mother's Google Glass camera. The trial lasted 7 weeks, commencing on March 1 and ending on April 13, 2014. There were five mothers and their newborn babies in the trial, fifteen volunteer counselors from ABA, and seven project team members from Small World Social. The counselors were located in five States across Australia. The counselors were certified in lactation consultation, and located as far from the mothers as Perth, Western Australia, 3,500 kilometres away. While physically distant from the mothers, the counselors provided support using video calls with Google Glass, live on demand. According to media commentary, the breastfeeding project demonstrated the potential of wearable devices to provide ways for communities to deliver health and family support services across vast distances. The demonstrated positive uses of such devices contrasted widespread criticism over privacy concerns which such devices. An article in the motherboard magazine Vice stated, \\"Google Glass, whether warranted or not, endures its fair share of criticism, largely because a lot of initial use cases have been, well, kinda creepy. So it's great to instead see Glass being used for uniquely positive ends, as it is with the Australian Breastfeeding Association's Breastfeeding Support Project.\\" Other journalists and commentators also called the trial beneficial and an innovative application wearable technologies. Australian Broadcasting Corporation journalist/presenter Penny Johnston of the Babytalk radio program remarked, \\"The Google Glass if you think about it, is perfect to coach someone in breast feeding: if you are holding or feeding a baby, imagine a camera mounted on your glasses and look down. There you have the world's best view for checking the baby's latch and your breastfeeding technique!\\" In May 2014, Small World Social and ABA won the Gold Questar Award in the Emerging Media: App section, for the Breastfeeding with Google Glass App. In June 2014, Small World Social's Breastfeeding Support Project was awarded the Questar Best of Category Grand Prize For Emerging Media, which is given to the top 5% of entries. ABA is optimistic about the future of wearable technologies supporting their work. Small World Social is planning to commence a trial in the US in June 2014. == Autism ==  Brain Power  Brain Power, LLC, is a neuroscience technology company located in Cambridge, MA. It is software that transformed Google Glass into the world's first wearable AI system for autism. Brain Power was founded by Dr. Ned T. Sahin. After years of research and clinical trials, Brain Power's Empowered Brain system was created to allow people with autism to teach themselves life skills crucial to self- sufficiency, e.g. emotion decoding, eye contact, language, social engagement, conversation skills, control of behaviors, etc. Orders for the Empowered Brain system were placed in 2018, during a crowdfunding campaign.  Helping children with autism  In July 2019, a New York Times article featured 12-year-old Esaïe Prickett, a child with autism. The article describes Esaïe as the only one wearing Google glass as he sits in the living room with his mother, father and four older brothers. Esaïe's father Jeffrey Prickett said that Esaïe enjoys using iPad apps and watching DVDs and that it could help autistic children such as Esaïe understand emotions and engage in more direct ways with those around them. == Media coverage ==  Journalism  In 2014, Voice of America Television Correspondent Carolyn Presutti and VOA Electronics Engineer Jose Vega began a web project called VOA & Google Glass, which explored the technology's potential uses in journalism. This series of news stories examined the technology's live reporting applications, including conducting interviews and covering stories from the reporter's point of view. On March 29, 2014, American a cappella group Pentatonix partnered with Voice of America when lead singer Scott Hoying wore Glass in the band's performance at DAR Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., during the band's worldwide tour—the first use of Glass by a lead singer in a professional concert. In the fall of 2014, The University of Southern California conducted a course called Glass Journalism, which explored the device's application in journalism. The WWF as of mid-2014 used Google Glass and UAVs to track various animals and birds in the jungle, which may be the first use of the device by a non-profit, non-governmental organization (NGO).  Public events  In 2014, the International Olympic Committee Young Reporters program took Google Glass to the Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games and put them on a number of athletes from different disciplines to explore novel point of view filmmaking. A visually impaired dancer, Benjamin Yonattan, used Google Glass to overcome his chronic vision condition. In 2015, Yonattan performed on the reality television program America's Got Talent. == Criticism ==  Privacy concerns  Concerns have been raised by various sources regarding the intrusion on privacy, and the etiquette and ethics of using the device in public and recording people without their permission. Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, claims that Glass could be seen as a way to become even more isolated in public, but the intent was quite the opposite: Brin views checking social media as a constant \\"nervous tic\\", which is why Glass can notify the user of important notifications and updates and does not obstruct the line of sight. Additionally, there is controversy that Google Glass would cause security problems and violate privacy rights. Organizations like the FTC Fair Information Practice work to uphold privacy rights through Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPS), which are guidelines representing concepts that concern fair information practice in an electronic marketplace. Privacy advocates are concerned that people wearing such eyewear may be able to identify strangers in public using facial recognition, or surreptitiously record and broadcast private conversations. The \\"Find my Face\\" feature on Google+ functions to create a model of your face, and of people you know, in order to simplify tagging photos. However, the only current app that can identify strangers is called MORIS (Mobile Offender Recognition and Identification System), and is a $3,000 iPhone app used by police officers. Some companies in the US have posted anti-Google Glass signs in their establishments. In July 2013, prior to the official release of the product, Stephen Balaban, co-founder of software company Lambda Labs, circumvented Google's facial recognition app block by building his own, non-Google-approved operating system. Balaban then installed face-scanning Glassware that creates a summary of commonalities shared by the scanned person and the Glass wearer, such as mutual friends and interests. Also created was Winky, a program that allows a Google Glass user to take a photo with a wink of an eye, while Marc Rogers, a principal security researcher at Lookout, discovered that Glass can be hijacked if a user could be tricked into taking a picture of a malicious QR code, demonstrating the potential to be used as a weapon in cyberwarfare. In February 2013, a Google+ user noticed legal issues with Glass and posted in the Glass Explorers community about the issues, stating that the device may be illegal to use according to the current legislation in Russia and Ukraine, which prohibits use of spy gadgets that can record video, audio or take photographs in an inconspicuous manner. Concerns were also raised in regard to the privacy and security of Glass users in the event that the device is stolen or lost, an issue that was raised by a US congressional committee. As part of its response to the committee, Google stated that a locking system for the device is in development. Google also reminded users that Glass can be remotely reset. Police in various states have also warned Glass wearers to watch out for muggers and street robbers. Lisa A. Goldstein, a freelance journalist who was born deaf, tested the product on behalf of people with disabilities and published a review on August 6, 2013. In her review, Goldstein states that Google Glass does not accommodate hearing aids and is not suitable for people who cannot understand speech. Goldstein also explained the limited options for customer support, as telephone contact was her only means of communication. Several facilities have banned the use of Google Glass before its release to the general public, citing concerns over potential privacy-violating capabilities. Other facilities, such as Las Vegas casinos, banned Google Glass, citing their desire to comply with Nevada state law and common gaming regulations that ban the use of recording devices near gambling areas. On October 29, 2014, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO) announced a ban on wearable technology including Google Glass, placing it under the same rules as mobile phones and video cameras. There have also been concerns over potential eye pain caused by users new to Glass.Google’s Eye Doctor Admits Glass Can Cause Pain Betabeat.com Jack Smith May 2014 These concerns were validated by Google's optometry advisor Dr. Eli Peli of Harvard, though he later partly backtracked due to the controversy that ensued from his remarks. Concerns have been raised by cyber forensics experts at the University of Massachusetts who have developed a way to steal smartphone and tablet passwords using Google Glass. The specialists developed a software program that uses Google Glass to track finger shadows as someone types in their password. Their program then converts the touchpoints into the keys they were touching, allowing them to catch the passcodes. Another concern regarding the camera application raises controversy to privacy. Some people are concerned about how the product has the capability of recording during events such as conversations. The device sets off a light to indicate that it is recording but many speculate that there will be an app to disable this. Users have been derisorily referred to as \\"Glassholes\\".  Safety considerations  Concerns have also been raised on operating motor vehicles while wearing the device. On July 31, 2013 it was reported that driving while wearing Google Glass was likely to be banned in the UK, being deemed careless driving, therefore a fixed penalty offense, following a decision by the Department for Transport. In the US, West Virginia state representative Gary G. Howell introduced an amendment in March 2013 to the state's law against texting while driving that would include bans against \\"using a wearable computer with head mounted display\\". In an interview, Howell stated, \\"The primary thing is a safety concern, it [the glass headset] could project text or video into your field of vision. I think there's a lot of potential for distraction.\\" In October 2013, a driver in California was ticketed for \\"driving with monitor visible to driver (Google Glass)\\" after being pulled over for speeding by a San Diego Police Department officer. The driver was reportedly the first to be fined for driving while wearing a Google Glass. While the judge noted that \\"Google Glass fell under 'the purview and intent' of the ban on driving with a monitor\\", the case was thrown out of court due to lack of proof the device was on at the time. In November 2014, Sawyer et al., from the University of Central Florida and the US Air Force Research Laboratory, published the results of comparative study in a driving simulator. Subjects were asked to use either Google Glass or a smartphone- based messaging interface and were then interrupted with an emergency event. The Glass-delivered messages served to moderate but did not eliminate distracting cognitive demands. A potential passive cost to drivers merely wearing the Glass was also observed. Messaging using either device impaired driving as compared to driving without multi-tasking.Sawyer, B.D., Finomore, V.S., Calvo, A.A. and Hancock, P.A., “Google Glass: A Driver Distraction Cause or Cure?” in ‘’Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society’’, November 2014, 56: pp. 1307–1321, In February 2014, a woman wearing Google Glass claimed she was verbally and physically assaulted at a bar in San Francisco after a patron confronted her while she was showing off the device, allegedly leading a man accompanying her to physically retaliate.

Terms of service  Under the Google Glass terms of service for the Glass Explorer pre-public release program, it specifically states, \\"You may not resell, loan, transfer, or give your device to any other person. If you resell, loan, transfer, or give your device to any other person without Google's authorization, Google reserves the right to deactivate the device, and neither you nor the unauthorized person using the device will be entitled to any refund, product support, or product warranty.\\" Wired commented on this policy of a company claiming ownership of its product after it had been sold, saying: \\"Welcome to the New World, one in which companies are retaining control of their products even after consumers purchase them.\\" Others pointed out that Glass was not for public sale at all, but rather in private testing for selected developers, and that not allowing developers in a closed beta to sell to the public is not the same as banning consumers from reselling a publicly released device. == Technical specifications ==  Google Glass Explorer   Explorer Version 1  LCoS display is illuminated using sequential color LEDs that pass through a polarization conversion system, a polarizing beam splitter, a half-silvered mirror, and an anastigmat, collimating reflector formed on the nose end of the optical assembly.

Basic health services in the interior are primitive to non-existent, and some procedures are not available at all. Although Guyana's health profile falls short in comparison with many of its Caribbean neighbours, there has been remarkable progress since 1988, and the Ministry of Health is working to upgrade conditions, procedures, and facilities. Many Guyanese seek medical care in the United States, Trinidad and Tobago or Cuba. == Health infrastructure == The delivery of health services is provided at five different levels in the public sector: * Level I: Local Health Posts (166 in total) that provide preventive and simple curative care for common diseases and attempt to promote proper health practices. Community health workers staff them. * Level II: Health Centres (109 in total) that provide preventive and rehabilitative care and promotion activities. These are ideally staffed with a medical extension worker or public health nurse, along with a nursing assistant, a dental nurse and a midwife. * Level III: Nineteen District Hospitals (with 473 beds) that provide basic in-patient and outpatient care (although more the latter than the former) and selected diagnostic services. They are also meant to be equipped to provide simple radiological and laboratory services, and to be capable of gynecology, providing preventive and curative dental care. They are designed to serve geographical areas with populations of 10,000 or more. * Level IV: Four Regional Hospitals (with 620 beds) that provide emergency services, routine surgery and obstetrical and gynecological care, dental services, diagnostic services and specialist services in general medicine and pediatrics. They are designed to include the necessary support for this level of medical service in terms of laboratory and X-ray facilities, pharmacies and dietetic expertise. These hospitals are located in Regions 2, 3, 6 and 10. * Level V: The National Referral Hospital (937 beds) in Georgetown that provides a wider range of diagnostic and specialist services, on both an in-patient and out-patient basis; the Psychiatric Hospital in Canje; and the Geriatric Hospital in Georgetown. There is also one children’s rehabilitation centre. This system is structured so that its proper functioning depends intimately on a process of referrals. Except for serious emergencies, patients are to be seen first at the lower levels, and those with problems that cannot be treated at those levels are referred to higher levels in the system. However, in practice, many patients by-pass the lower levels. The health sector is currently unable to offer certain sophisticated tertiary services and specialised medical services, the technology for which is unaffordable in Guyana, or for which the required medical specialists are not available. Even with substantial improvements in the health sector, the need for overseas treatment for some services might remain. The Ministry of Health provides financial assistance to patients requiring such treatment, priority being given to children whose condition can be rehabilitated with significant improvements to their quality of life. There are 10 hospitals belonging to the private sector and to public corporations, plus diagnostic facilities, clinics and dispensaries in those sectors. These ten hospitals provide for 548 beds. Eighteen clinics and dispensaries are owned by GUYSUCO. The Ministry of Health and Labour is responsible for the funding of the National Referral Hospital in Georgetown, which has recently been made a public corporation managed by an independent Board. Region 6 is responsible for the management of the National Psychiatric Hospital. The Geriatric Hospital, previously administered by the Ministry of Labour, became the responsibility of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of Guyana in December 1997. The US State Department Consular Information Sheet warns \\"Medical care is available for minor medical conditions. Emergency care and hospitalization for major medical illnesses or surgery is limited, because of a lack of appropriately trained specialists, below standard in-hospital care, and poor sanitation. Ambulance service is substandard and may not routinely be available for emergencies.\\" Many Guyanese seek medical care in the United States, Trinidad and Tobago or Cuba. == Health status ==  Life expectancy  In 2012, life expectancy at birth was estimated at 71.0 years.  Diseases  The leading causes of mortality for all age groups are cerebrovascular diseases (11.6%); ischemic heart disease (9.9%); immunity disorders (7.1%); diseases of the respiratory system (6.8%); diseases of pulmonary circulation and other forms of heart disease (6.6%); endocrine and metabolic diseases (5.5%); diseases of other parts of the Digestive System (5.2%); violence (5.1%); certain condition originating in the prenatal period (4.3%); and hypertensive diseases (3.9%). The ten leading causes of morbidity for all age groups are, in decreasing order: malaria; acute respiratory infections; symptoms, signs and ill defined or unknown conditions; hypertension; accident and injuries; acute diarrhoeal disease; diabetes mellitus; worm infestation; rheumatic arthritis; and mental and nervous disorders. This morbidity profile indicates that it can be improved substantially through enhanced preventive health care, better education on health issues, more widespread access to potable water and sanitation services, and increased access to basic health care of good quality. A number of non-governmental organisations, including Health and Educational Relief for Guyana (HERG, INC) and Guyana Medical Relief (GMR, INC) are currently working to address these issues by improving healthcare access and educational infrastructure.  Suicide  Suicide is a leading cause of death in Guyana.WHO Report 2014 Preventing suicide: A global imperative. Guyana suffers from the highest suicide rate of any South American country. In 2008 it was estimated that at least 200 people commit suicide each year in Guyana, or 27.2 people for each 100,000 people each year.  Murder  In 2008 Guyana had a murder rate of 26 per 100,000. Maternal and child health care The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Guyana is 260. This is compared with 143.1 in 2008 and 162.3 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 36 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 60. In Guyana the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is unavailable and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is 1 in 150. == References == ","title":"Health in Guyana"},{"id":"35326454","text":"Clara C.

He served with the Durham Light Infantry, Royal Flying Corps, and Royal Air Force. The observer ace scored his last victory shortly before his death at age twenty in aerial combat over France. ==Background== George Hubert Kemp, son of George and Margaret Kemp, was born in 1897 in Harrow, Middlesex, England. He was the second of three sons. In 1901, his family lived in Willesden, Middlesex, England. By 1911, the family resided at 30 Wyndcliff Road in Charlton, London, England. He was educated at The John Roan School in Greenwich. Prior to joining the military, George, Jr. was employed at the Port of London Authority. His father was a metal manufacturer's clerk. In 1918, his brothers William and Leslie were both in military service, one in active service in France, and the other a prisoner of war in Germany. ==Military career== In 1917, George Kemp received a commission in the 15th Battalion of the Durham Light Infantry. While serving with that regiment, he was wounded at Chérisy, Pas-de-Calais, France. His rank was that of second lieutenant, which he again had when he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1918. He was posted to No. 20 Squadron of the Royal Air Force. Kemp was credited with twelve aerial victories as an observer, all from the Bristol F.2b and with William McKenzie Thomson as his pilot. On 9 May 1918, observer Kemp and pilot Thomson, in Bristol F.2b (C4851) were cut off from their formation by an Albatros D.V. Kemp emptied a drum into the Albatros which side-slipped and nose-dived, and was destroyed, crashing between Comines and Wervicq. This was Kemp's first victory. His next four were all from Bristol (C859). On 14 May 1918, Kemp scored his second aerial victory. He and his pilot followed an Albatros D.V down to 4,000 feet and fired about 100 rounds at it over the Wervicq and Zillebeke, West Flanders. The enemy plane crashed and the crew was captured. While on a patrol with other Bristol Fighters on 17 May 1918, Kemp and Thomson engaged a formation of enemy aircraft. They dived on an Albatros D.V, and fired a burst of about 200 rounds into it. It went down in a vertical dive and was destroyed, crashing between Armentières and Lille. Kemp scored a double victory that day, as another Albatros D.V was sent out of control over Armentières. On 18 May 1918, Kemp scored his fifth victory when a Pfalz D.III was sent out of control south of Merville, Nord. All seven of Kemp's remaining aerial victories (6–12) were from Bristol F.2b (C843). On 19 May 1918, Kemp and Thomson were on a patrol with No. 20 Squadron when they engaged about twenty enemy aircraft. As Thomson dived on a Pfalz D.III, Kemp fired three drums into it. The Pfalz was destroyed, crashing into a house at Estaires. Kemp racked up his seventh win on 21 May 1918 when an Albatros D.V was destroyed in flames over Warneton. His eighth was the result of an Albatros D.V that was sent out of control over Bac St Maur on 29 May 1918. Two days later, on 31 May 1918, Second Lieutenant Kemp scored a double victory when a Pfalz D.III was destroyed over Bois-Grenier and, minutes later, an Albatros D.V was sent out of control over Armentières. On 1 June 1918, Kemp earned his final two victories (11 and 12) when two Albatros D.V aircraft were destroyed over Comines. ==Death== Second Lieutenant Kemp and Lieutenant Thomson were cut off from their patrol and attacked by four enemy planes on 1 June 1918. Thomson turned and fired 200 rounds into an Albatros D.V, which crashed. Observer Kemp shot down another over Comines. They were then attacked by an Albatros scout from above. During that encounter, Kemp, age 20, was fatally wounded. Pilot Thomson spun down to 2,000 feet, and then turned and fired upon the Albatros, driving it off. Thomson successfully flew his aircraft home. A portion of the letter from No. 20 Squadron commanding officer to Kemp's parents reads: \\"You have no doubt been advised by the War Office that your son has unfortunately been killed in action. It happened during a fight with about 15 enemy machines. One enemy machine with the sun behind him surprised your son and his pilot and dived on them before anything could be done. Before your son was killed however he had shot down one of the enemy machines and his pilot eventually shot down another. He and his pilot have done excellent work together and both have been recommended for awards. I am particularly sorry to lose your son as he was just the type of conscientiously brave officer that one looks forward to having. He was extraordinarily keen on his work and looked forward to the day when he could learn to fly himself. Death must have been instantaneous as he was hit in the head and heart...\\" Second Lieutenant George Hubert Kemp was interred at Longuenesse (St. Omer) Souvenir Cemetery at Rue Louis Delattre, between that road and Route des Bruyères in Longuenesse, Pas-de-Calais, France. His grave reference is V. B. 56. The inscription on his headstone reads: \\"Second Lieutenant George Hubert Kemp, Durham Light Infantry, Attd. Royal Air Force, 1st June 1918 Age 20, To A Cheery, Loving, Loyal Son, Brother, Friend, Let This Bear Tribute.\\" ==War memorabilia== In 2002, an auction of Lieutenant Kemp's war memorabilia was held. The items included his British War and Victory medals, his memorial plaque, and photocopies of original documents, research materials, and photographs, as well as the British War and Victory medals of his brother, Private Leslie Newton Kemp. Despite twelve aerial victories, having been wounded twice, the second time fatally, and a recommendation for an award, George Hubert Kemp was not decorated. Lieutenant Thomson received the Military Cross shortly after the encounter. Later that year, he received the Distinguished Flying Cross. He died 9 July 1987. ==Gallery of aircraft== Image:ZK-DVA2 IMG 3492-Edit.jpgAlbatros D.V Victories 1–4,7,8,10–12 Image:Pfalzdiiia.jpgPfalz D.III Victories 5,6,9 Image:Bristol F2B D8096 flying 1.jpgBristol F.2b Kemp's aircraft ==References External links == * Photograph of headstone at Find A Grave Category:1897 births Category:1918 deaths Category:Durham Light Infantry officers Category:Royal Flying Corps officers Category:Royal Air Force officers Category:Royal Air Force personnel of World War I Category:British World War I flying aces Category:British military personnel killed in World War I Category:People from Harrow, London ","title":"George Hubert Kemp"},{"id":"35326487","text":"Ruby Sakae Hirose (1904–1960) was an American biochemist and bacteriologist. She did research on blood clotting and Thrombin, allergies, and researched cancer using antimetabolites. ==Family and early life== Ruby Hirose was born to Shiusaka (father) Hirose and Tome (née Kurai) in Kent, Washington, on August 30, 1904. She was the second child of seven children in the family, but because the first child died very young, grew up as the oldest child of six in the family. She had four sisters and one brother, and they lived in the White River (Shirakawa) area around Seattle. The second child in the family was Fumiko, two years younger than Ruby. Fumi, as she was called, contracted tuberculosis as did her mother. Fumi died in 1925 and her mother Tome died in 1934. The third child in the family was brother Kimeo, who was two years younger than Fumi and excelled in sports in high school, lettering in three sports, and was named football captain and class treasurer. He lived until 1991. Mary, the next sibling, was a year younger than Kimeo. The last two children were twin girls: Toki and Tomo, born in 1912, were three years younger than Mary and 9 years younger than Ruby. Sister Tomo died in 1928 at age 16. Ruby's father was born in a Tokyo suburb, only had a middle school education, and according to Ruby, was in some type of manufacturing in Japan, but it failed. Ruby's mother Tome's family were dry goods merchants. After Shiusaka's business failed, they decided to come to America, settle in the Seattle area, and try farming for a living. Because the Naturalization Act of 1870 only extended citizenship rights to African Americans, Asians were deemed \\"aliens ineligible for citizenship\\". Several states, but specifically Washington, used this status to deny Asians from owning property because they were \\"aliens ineligible for citizenship\\", which was a way to discriminate without reference to particular racial categories. These provisions were not held unconstitutional until 1952. Thus, the lease for the Hirose land and some later land purchases were in Ruby's name because she was a natural-born American. In high school, Ruby said she felt no particular prejudice, but that later Japanese American children did. She said that the teachers showed prejudice in favor of the white pupils. Still, Ruby was popular and took part in athletics and sang in the glee club and in the operetta. Ruby said her preference was to associate with white students in high school as well as college, as opposed to associating with the Japanese children. Ruby was somewhat religious, attending Sunday School at the First Methodist Church and also taking part in the Japanese Students Christian Association which met at the University YMCA. She also helped at the Japanese Baptist Church in Seattle, but preferred to attend the American churches. ==Education at University of Washington== The Issei, or first generation, were the first people to immigrate to the U.S. from Japan. Because of this, they wanted their children, the Nisei (of which Ruby was one), to learn Japanese language, culture, and religious traditions. The White River Buddhist Church was the second Buddhist church in King County In 1912, the White River Japanese Language School (\\"Nihongo Gakko\\") was opened at and under the auspices of the White River Buddhist Church. The area of White River was called Shirakawa, which literally means White River in Japanese. Shirakawa included the areas of Auburn, Thomas, and Christopher. In 1929, Ruby's father, Shiusaku Hirose, was the president of the Thomas Japanese Association. Under his leadership, they purchased the \\"Yank Hotel\\" and refurbished it to become the Thomas Japanese Language School. This building had twice the space for classrooms and was much closer to Thomas Grade School, that most students, including Ruby attended. However, after a few years, Shiusaku had a falling out with others in the organization and quit. Sadly, he was widowed in 1934 and moved to Los Angeles in 1936. When the war broke out in 1941, he was working in a hotel in Los Angeles and requested a permit to return to Seattle to join with his daughter Mary before the evacuation and internment process began. In April, 1942, after Executive Order 9066 had been issued, the FBI began rounding up people that were active in the Japanese American community, including Shiusaku. He was detained by the FBI and was given a hearing at the INS in Seattle in May and was paroled, probably because there was little or no evidence of any espionage or crimes. Ruby attended Thomas Grade school, and would have walked to attend the Thomas Japanese Language School. She was the first Nisei (2nd generation) Japanese American to graduate from Auburn High School in Auburn, WA in 1922. Ruby was admitted to the University of Washington and would have entered in fall of 1922. Hirose earned her bachelor's degree in 1926 (in pharmacy) and her master's degree in pharmacology from the University of Washington in 1928. Women had just achieved the right to vote in 1920 and prohibition had just gone into effect the same year (and would not be repealed until 1933). While she was earning her master's degree at University of Washington, she was living in the Catherine P. Blaine Home in Seattle, sponsored by the Woman's Home Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The Blaine Home was part of the Japanese and Korean section in Seattle of Woman's Home Missionary Society. ==Second-generation problem== In December of in 1925, the Japanese Students' Christian Association (JSCA) held a conference in Asilomar, California. Ruby had been an active member of the JSCA and attended the conference. A major topic at this conference was something called the \\"second- generation problem\\", which, briefly stated, resulted from the cultural differences between the Issei (first generation) from Japan and the Nisei (second generation) born in America. Although both the Issei and Nisei had a common cultural heritage, the Nisei were native English speakers and for the most part lived their day-to-day lives immersed in American, not Japanese culture. The conference created a Committee On Second Generation Problem, led by Roy Akagi, a PhD student and JSCA leader which included Ruby Hirose, who would have been entering her Senior year at University of Washington, as well as students from Stanford, Caltech, and Occidental College, and produced a report about this problem. They outlined the situation as having several aspects from the viewpoint of the Nisei: (1) Relation to First Generation, (2) Relation to American Society, (3) Vocational and Employment Guidance, (4) Standard of Social Conduct, and (5) Religious Life. These young people were having identity issues, although in 1925, they didn't call them that. They were worried about how to respect and carry on their culture, but also wanted to be full-fledged Americans in an environment that was racially prejudiced and had a real lack of job opportunities. Japanese Americans were excluded from owning land, but agriculture was a big part of the Japanese American experience in those days. It would turn out later when they were incarcerated due to World War II, many of the successful Issei and Nisei lost all of the businesses that they had built. One of the proposed strategies for handling the vocational problem was to emphasize higher education, which Ruby certainly did, becoming one of the earliest Japanese American PhDs in the United States. Other strategies included cooperating with other American organizations such as churches, YMCA and YWCA. ==PhD at University of Cincinnati== Hirose received a fellowship and moved to Cincinnati and the University of Cincinnati where she worked on her PhD in Biochemistry. While at the University of Cincinnati, in 1931, Ruby received the Moos Fellowship in Internal Medicine. She was elected to membership in 1931 and was an active participant in Sigma Xi, an honorary fraternity for the advancement of research. Ruby was also active in the Cincinnati chapter of Iota Sigma Pi, a national honorary women's chemical fraternity, serving as Vice President in 1931 In 1932, she graduated with her PhD and her thesis was entitled \\"Nature of Thrombin and Its Manner of Action\\". A paper based on this thesis was later published in the American Journal of Physiology in 1934 with the title \\"The Second Phase of Thrombin Action: Fibrin Resolution\\". ==Career== She worked at the University of Cincinnati until being hired by the research division of the William S. Merrell Company where she researched serums and antitoxins. In 1940, the American Chemical Society held its meeting in Cincinnati during April 8–12. A report to the meeting indicated that there was increasing opportunity for women in the industry. It noted that in the Cincinnati section of the American Chemical Society, out of 300 members, there were ten women members and Dr. Ruby Hirose was listed as one of the ten members.The Cincinnati Enquirer (newspaper), \\"Increasing Need Seen for Women Chemists\\", 18 March 1940, page 11 During World War II, Ruby was connected with the Kettering Laboratory of Applied Physiology, University of Cincinnati. She also taught microbiology and did research on cancer at the Indiana University and did cancer research using antimetabolites. In 1946, she published a paper called \\"Diffusion of sulfonamides from emulsified ointment bases\\", which concerned the characteristics of diffusion of sulfa drugs in various types of bases. In 1958, she joined the Lebanon (Pennsylvania) Veterans Administration Hospital as a bacteriologist. Prior to this, she was affiliated with the Ft. Benjamin Harrison Hospital in Indianapolis and the VA Hospital in Dayton, OH.The Cincinnati Enquirer, \\"Joins Staff\\", 13 October 1958 ==Japanese American concentration camps== Three of Ruby's family members were incarcerated in the U.S. Government's concentration camps for Japanese Americans. Mother Tome and sister Fumi were already deceased by the time WW II started and Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066. Sister Toki lived in Hawaii and so was not interned. Ruby was living in Cincinnati and so therefore was not interned either. Brother Kimeo was interned at Poston War Relocation Center, while sister Mary and her father Shiusaku were sent to Minidoka, which is now Minidoka National Historic Site. Ruby Hirose died of acute myeloid leukemia in West Reading, Pennsylvania, on October 7, 1960,Ruby Hirose, Certificate of Death, File #091494-60, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Health and was survived by sisters Mary and Toki, and brother Kimeo. Her surviving family buried her at the Auburn Pioneer Cemetery in Auburn, Washington. ==References * Category:American women chemists Category:University of Washington School of Pharmacy alumni Category:1904 births Category:1960 deaths Category:Place of birth missing Category:University of Cincinnati alumni Category:American women of Japanese descent Category:20th-century American women scientists Category:20th-century American chemists Category:American scientists of Japanese descent ","title":"Ruby Hirose"},{"id":"35326492","text":"Poisson Volant (Flying Fish), was a popular name for French vessels, including naval vessels and privateers. Between 1760 and 1814, warships of the Royal Navy captured numerous privateers named Poisson Volant. *In April 1760 the frigate was on patrol in the Caribbean and captured an 8-gun French privateer named Poisson Volante. The captured vessel and her crew were delivered to British authorities in the Leeward Islands. *On 10 December 1782, the cutter Speedwell, Captain Wesson, sank the French privateer Poisson Volant in an engagement off Portland. He landed her crew at Weymouth. Poisson Volant was three days out of Dunkirk and had taken nothing.Lloyd's List, no. 1422. This Speedwell was probably a revenue cutter, and not ; HMS Speedwell was at Gibraltar and under the command of Lieutenant Gibson. *In June 1795, and captured the 10-gun Poisson Volante in the Channel. *On 30 September 1795, captured the brig Poisson Volant on the Jamaica station. *On 4 May 1796 was sailing in company with and when they sighted a suspicious vessel. Spencer set off in chase while shortly thereafter Esperance saw two vessels, a schooner and a sloop, and she and Bonetta set off after them. Spencer sailed south- southeast and the other two British vessels sailed southwest by west, with the result that they lost sight of each other. Spencer captured the French gun- brig Volcan, while Bonetta and Esperance captured the schooner Poisson Volant. Poisson Volant was sailing from Aux Cayes to New York and turned out to be the former that two French privateers had captured in June 1795 while she was on her way to Jamaica. Flying Fishs crew had cut down her gunwales and thrown some of her guns overboard, presumably during the chase. At the time of the recapture Poisson Volant had some eight or ten days earlier met with the French ship Concorde. Poisson Volant was under the command of a sub-lieutenant from Concorde and had a crew of 38 men. *In early 1797, captured two privateers named Poisson Volant. One was armed with 12 guns and had a crew of 80 men, and the other was armed with five guns and had a crew of 50 men. One was captured on 13 January, and the other on 16 February. Bounty bills (head money) was paid in September 1827. A later account narrates that Poisson Volant was a Dutch privateer, out of Curacao, and that Magicienne sent her into Jamaica to be condemned as a prize. *On 4 April 1797, was escorting a convoy from Barbados to Martinique when she encountered the French privateer Poisson Volant, of Guadeloupe. Poisson Volant was armed with four guns and had a crew of 40 men. Tamer brought her into Martinique. Sir Thomas Byam Martin was captain of Tamar and in his biography reports that earlier that year Tamar had captured the same vessel and sent her into Antigua, where she had been condemned as prize, sold and sailed to a neutral island. There a company of speculators had bought her and taken her to Guadeloupe to be commissioned as a privateer.Hamilton, ed., (1901), Vol. 3, p.289. *On 5 June 1797, the revenue cutter Lively captured the small (12 tons burthen) Poisson Volant, of Nantes, armed with two swivel guns and having a crew of 25 men. Poisson Volant was three days out of Morlaix and Lively captured her between Shoreham and the Isle of Wight. Mr. Dubois Smith of the customs service reported that Poisson Volant had not taken any prizes. *On 27 June 1797, was 10 leagues east of Yarmouth when she captured the French privateer lugger Poisson Volant. Poisson Volant was armed with 14 guns that she threw overboard during the chase. She had a crew of 50 men, but 28 were away in a brig and a ship that she had taken as prizes off \\"Buckiness\\" a few days earlier. Poisson Volant was quite new and had left Havre de Grace, France, some 18 days earlier. *On 24 July 1797 captured the 4-gun letter of marque Poisson Volant, Captain Latarte, off Cape Finisterre. She was bound from Bordeaux to Guadeloupe carrying wines and merchandise. Latarte's intent was to deliver his cargo after which he intended to cruise as a privateer in the West Indies. Captain Roberts of Concorde was of the opinion that Poisson Volant might well have done \\"considerable mischief\\" as she was faster in light winds than Concorde, which had only captured her because she was under the reach of Concordes guns when first seen. *On 9 April 1801, His Majesty's Hired armed cutter Stag was 10 or 11 leagues south of Beachy Head when she sighted a lugger and a brig. She gave chase and after an hour-and-a-half, captured both. The lugger was the French privateer Poisson Volant, of Boulogne. She was armed with 14 guns and had a crew of 55 men under the command of Citizen Jacque Antoine Hedd. He was four days out of Dieppe and had captured only the brig. On her previous cruise Poisson Volant had captured six vessels, four of which British vessels had recaptured. Before surrendering, Poisson Volant lost two men killed and four wounded. *In mid-1803, a squadron under Captain Henry William Bayntun, consisting of , , , , and captured Poisson Volant, an American-built French privateer schooner of 12-guns.

These posts contain fiber-optic cables and water jets that, when illuminated, emit green, blue and white lights. ==References== Category:Living people Category:American sculptors Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Steven Dickey"},{"id":"35326534","text":"Susie Snowflake is a lostThe Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog:Susie Snowflake American silent film released by Paramount Pictures on June 25, 1916.

On 19 March the Central Election Commission announced that the rerun would be held on 6 May. The rerun was won with 1932 out of 3413 votes (56.61%) by businessman Beslan Eshba, who had not participated in the original election. On 10 May, Eshba was registered as deputy by the Central Election Commission. Rerun in constituency no. 21 On 29 March, the Supreme Court of Abkhazia invalidated the election in constituency no. 21 and ordered a rerun. The original count had given Aida Ashuba a slim first round majority of 401 votes out of 795 (50.44%), but after a complaint by the campaign team of runner up Valeri Kvarchia, the election commission of precinct 1 held a recount. In the recount, 46 more ballots were found to be invalid, causing Ashuba's vote share to fall below 50% and making a second round run-off between Ashuba and Kvarchia necessary. Ashuba then issued a complaint with the Central Election Commission as his observers had not been present during the recount. The Central Election Commission agreed with the complaint and requested the precinct and constituency election commissions to uphold the original count. When the local election commission refused to comply, the Central Election Commission brought the matter to the Supreme Court. Neither Ashuba nor Kvarchia managed to gain enough votes to win an outright majority in the first round of the repeat election on 20 May. In the run-off on 4 June, Kvarchia defeated Ashuba with 679 votes against 623. ==By-elections== Constituency no. 26 (first time) On 25 May 2012, only two months after the election, Temur Logua, Deputy for constituency no. 26 in Chlou, was found dead in his apartment in Moscow. The by-election was set for 22 July, with the nomination period running from 2 to 22 June and the registration period from 22 June to 12 July. On 4 June, an initiative group nominated Beslan Tarba. On 7 June, the Forum for the National Unity of Abkhazia held an extraordinary congress and unanimously nominated Appollon Shinkuba. On 12 June, Chairman of the Party for the Economic Development of Abkhazia Beslan Butba was nominated by an initiative group. All three were successfully registered. In the first round, on 22 July, no candidate received an absolute majority. Out of 2804 registered voters, 2040 turned out to vote. Of the votes cast, 32 were deemed invalid, Beslan Butba received 920 votes, Beslan Tarba 647 and Appolon Tarba 441. The second round, held on 5 August, was won by Butba with 1125 votes over 1026 for Tarba and 42 invalid votes. 2193 out of a total 2841 registered voters participated in the second round. Constituency no. 1 (first time) On 30 April 2013, President Ankvab appointed Member of Parliament Beslan Eshba as Vice-Premier. The first round of the by-election for his successor was held on 29 June. A run-off between opposition leader Daur Arshba and former Vice Speaker Irina Agrba was held on 13 July, and won by Arshba. Candidates were to be nominated from 10 until 30 May. On 14 May, Daur Arshba, who had been a member of the 4th convocation but had failed re-election in Constituency no. 25, was nominated by an initiative group. On 16 May, Roland Gamgia was nominated by an initiative group. During the 2012 election, Gamgia had won a plurality in the first round, which was invalidated due to a large turn-out, and ended second to newcomer Eshba in the rerun. On 21 May, former Interior Minister Leonid Dzapshba was nominated by an initiative group. On 22 May, Apsnypress reported that Roman Tskua, Lyuba Ashuba, Nadir Bitiev and Irina Agrba had also been nominated by initiative groups, the latter two of which had failed to be elected in Constituency no. 6 in 2012, with Agrba having been Vice Speaker of the 4th convocation. On 27 June, two days before the election, Bitiev withdrew his candidacy. No candidate received a first-round victory. Arshba finished in first place, with 1043 out of 3228 votes cast, and Agrba in second place, with 650 votes. Dzapshba received 601 votes, Tskua 509, Gamgia 319 and Ashuba 22. 84 votes were ruled invalid by the Election Commission. In the second round, 3372 votes were cast, 1974 for Arshba and 1325 for Agrba (and 73 invalid). The Central Election Committee officially registered Arshba as a Member of Parliament on 19 July. Constituency no. 26 (second time) On 13 June 2014, following the 2014 Abkhazian political crisis, Beslan Butba was appointed as acting Vice Premier. Accordingly, his membership of Parliament was terminated on 18 June. On 12 July, an initiative group nominated Almas Japua, and on 14 July another initiative group Amiran Kakalia. Both candidates were formally registered by the Central Election Commission on 1 August. The election, held on 31 August, was won by Japua with 889 votes to 848, out of 1761 votes cast. On 1 September, Japua was registered as a member of Parliament. Constituency no. 30 Following his inauguration as President of Abkhazia, Raul Khajimba's Membership of Parliament was formally terminated on 7 October 2014. On 22 October, the Central Election Commission registered the candidacy of Georgi Kharchilava, followed on 23 October by Taifun Ardzinba, and on 29 October by Marat Kvitsinia and Beslan Emurkhba, all through initiative groups. The by- election was held on 7 December. Out of 4464 registered voters, 1726 participated, of which 769 voted for Ardzinba, 564 for Emurkhba, 215 for Kharchilava, 136 for Kvitsinia and 44 votes were deemed invalid, necessitating a run-off between Ardzinba and Emurkhba. On 15 December, the Coordinating Council of Political Parties and Public Organisations resolved to support Ardzinba's candidacy. The run-off was won by Ardzinba. Constituency no. 24 On 22 October, newly elected President Raul Khajimba appointed Adgur Kharazia as Acting Mayor of Sukhumi. Accordingly, the People's Assembly resolved to terminate his mandate as MP from that day onwards, and on 31 October, the Central Election Commission set a by-election for 21 December. On 3 November, the Central Election Commission registered the candidacy of former Prime Minister Sergei Shamba, followed on 12 November by Tengiz Agrba and on 14 November by Beslan Kamkia, all through initiative groups. On 22 December, the CEC announced that no candidate had obtained an absolute majority, and that run-off would be held between Shamba and Agrba on 28 December. The run- off was narrowly won by Shamba, who received 1109 votes to Agrba's 1091. Constituency no. 11 On 22 October, newly elected President Raul Khajimba appointed Beslan Bartsits as Acting Governor of Gagra District. Accordingly, the People's Assembly resolved to terminate his mandate as MP from that day onwards, and on 31 October, the Central Election Commission set a by-election for 21 December. On 11 November, the Central Election Commission registered the candidacy of Grigori Enik (who had been dismissed as governor by Khajimba in favour of Bartsits), followed on 12 November by Samson Demerjiba and Temur Gulia and on 17 November by former MP Galust Trapizonyan (who had lost the run-off in constituency no. 20 in the 2012 Parliamentary election), all through initiative groups. On 21 November, Aruaa resolved to support Gulia's candidacy, followed on 1 December by Young Abkhazia, on 3 December by United Abkhazia, on 10 December by the Russian Citizens Union and on 15 December by the Coordinating Council of Political Parties and Public Organisations. On 8 December, the CEC accepted Trapizonyan's withdrawal from the election race. On 22 December, the CEC announced that the election had been won by Gulia. Constituency no. 6 On 20 March 2015, Artur Mikvabia was appointed prime minister by President Khajimba. On 1 April, his membership in Parliament was terminated. A by-election was scheduled for 24 May. On 6 April, the Central Election Commission registered the candidacy of Tengiz Agrba (who had narrowly lost the December 2014 by-election in Constituency no. 24), followed on 9 April by former Sukhumi City Council Chairman Givi Gabnia. The election was won by Agrba, who gained 961 votes, to Gabnia's 431 and 58 invalid votes. Constituency no. 2 On 16 August 2016, Aslan Kobakhia was appointed Vice Premier and Interior Minister in the cabinet of newly appointed Prime Minister Beslan Bartsits. On 10 October, Parliament in its autumn session terminated Kobakhia's membership. There was only one candidate to succeed Kobakhia, history teacher Eduard Khashba, who was nominated by an initiative group on 7 November and registered by the Central Election Commission on 18 November. The election on 10 December was declared invalid due to low turnout, with only 298 votes cast. Constituency no. 1 (second time) On 10 October, Daur Arshba was appointed Head of the Presidential Administration. That same day Parliament in its autumn session terminated Arshba's membership. There was only one candidate to succeed Kobakhia, Akhra Avidzba, businessman and leader of a fifteenth brigade of the Donetsk People's Republic in the Donbass War, who was nominated by an initiative group on 7 November and registered by the Central Election Commission on 18 November. The election on 10 December was declared invalid due to low turnout, with only 337 votes cast where more than 1800 would have been necessary to pass the 25% hurdle. ==Speaker and Vice Speakers== The first session of the 5th convocation of the People's Assembly was held on 3 April 2012. It was opened by the oldest deputy, Artur Mikvabia and attended by President Alexander Ankvab, Vice President Mikhail Logua, Prime Minister Leonid Lakerbaia, Supreme Court Head Rauf Korua, Arbitration Court Head A. Gurjua, the deputies of the previous convocation, the members of the Cabinet and regional Administration Heads. During the first session, Valeri Bganba was elected speaker, defeating Raul Khajimba by 21 votes to 11 (with one invalid vote). The number of Vice Speakers was expanded from three to four, so as to better entertain foreign relations. Adgur Kharazia, Otari Tsvizhba, Emma Gamisonia and Vagarshak Kosyan were elected Vice-Speaker. Following the appointment of Kharazia as acting Mayor of Sukhumi on 22 October 2014, Daur Arshba was unanimously elected to succeed him as Vice Speaker on 12 November. Arshba's membership of Parliament was terminated on 10 October 2016 due to his appointment as Presidential Administration Head, and he was in turn succeeded by Valeri Kvarchia, who, as the sole candidate, was elected on 2 November by 26 or 27 of the 27 deputies in attendance. ==Committees== On 10 April, the deputies of the People's Assembly formed the following eight committees (three less than before): #Legal Policy, State Building and Human Rights #Budget, Credit Institutions, Tax and Finance #Economic Policy, Reform and Innovation #Defence and National Security #Social Policy, Labour and Health #Education, Science, Culture, Religion, Youth and Sport #International and Inter-Parliamentary Relations and Relations with Compatriots #Agrarian Policy, Natural Resources and Ecology Except for the second and third committee, all committee chairmen were elected on 10 April. A three-membered counting commission was installed, chaired by Dmitri Gunba, who thence refused to stand in the chairmanship elections of the Committees for International and Inter-Parliamentary Relations and Relations with Compatriots and Agrarian Policy, Natural Resources and Ecology. Deputy Fazilbei Avidzba nominated Raul Khajimba for the Chairmanship of the Committee for Defence and National Security, but he refused the candidacy, saying that he had indicated his unwillingness to become Chairman of any Committee during consultations with the Assembly's leadership. Avidzba was then himself nominated by Mikhail Sangulia, while Kan Kvarchia nominated Aslan Kobakhia. However, Kobakhia also refused the candidacy, saying that he did not want to engage in any backroom games and that Avidzba was highly qualified and deserved the chairmanship. Avidzba was elected with 28 votes against 2. Artur Mikvabia failed to be elected as Chairman of the Committee for Economic Policy, Reform and Innovation. He stood unopposed, but while 15 deputies supported his candidacy, 15 deputies opposed it. On 11 April, the election was repeated, with Guram Barganjia as second candidate, who defeated Mikvabia with 19 votes to 11. In the election for the chairmanship of the Committee for Budget, Credit Institutions, Tax and Finance, no candidate received a majority, with Beslan Tsvinaria receiving 14 and Georgi Agrba 15 votes and one abstention. Tsvinaria refused a proposal by Speaker Valeri Bganba to run for the chairmanship of the Committee for Economic Policy, Reform and Innovation instead, and so the election was repeated the following day. During the repeat election, Tsvinaria was again nominated by Raul Khajimba, who praised him as an experienced economist, but Tsvinaria withdrew his candidacy and requested that he become a member of the Committee for Social Policy, Labour and Health instead. Agrba was then elected chairman with 28 out of 30 votes. On 7 October 2014, Kan Kvarchia was elected with 27 to 4 votes (out of 31 present) as chairman of the Committee for Agrarian Policy, Natural Resources and Ecology. ==Factions== On 7 August 2015, Georgi Agrba, Fazlibei Avidzba, Guram Barganjia, Anzor Kokoskeria and Akhra Pachulia established a faction, led by Agrba, called Apsadgyl and representing the eponymous socio-political organisation. On 5 September Sergei Shamba, Taifun Ardzinba, Levon Galustyan, Beslan Gubaz, Temur Gulia, Mikhail Sangulia and Robert Yaylyan established a faction, led by Shamba. ==List of Members== { class= style=text-align:left !# !!

It is the follow-up to the company's mobster- themed Empire City: 1931. In Dead Angle, players take control of the game's protagonist, who must rescue his girlfriend from a mob boss. A port of the game was released by Sega for its Master System. ==Gameplay== The player character is represented by a silhouette, which turns red when in the line of enemy fire and is filled with bullet holes as it is shot. Like Empire City: 1931 before it, players use a joystick to move a crosshair along the screen and shoot enemies. Dead Angle adds an onscreen representation of the player's character in the form of a silhouette.\\"Dead Angle review.\\" July 1988. Advanced Computer Entertainment. p. 27. Multiple enemies now run in front of the player - the silhouette turns red when in the line of fire and is filled with bullet holes as it is shot. Just as in Empire City, players can defend against shots, this time by pressing the duck button, which renders the player invulnerable for a very short period of time. Players start the game out with a standard pistol, but can pick up a tommy gun or a shotgun and use grenades as well. Many of the objects in the background can be damaged or destroyed.St. John, Seamus. \\"Dead Angle.\\" June 1988.

The player must then fight the boss of that level. The final boss must be defeated with one precise shot while he uses his hostage as a human shield. == Reception == Seamus St. John complimented Dead Angle's graphics and animation in the June 1988 issue of Computer and Video Games and compared the game favourably to its contemporary Operation Wolf. In Japan, Game Machine listed Dead Angle on their August 15, 1988 issue as being the fifth most-successful table arcade unit of the year.

The player character is private investigator George Phoenix, his girlfriend is Jane and the mob leader is named Robert King. The port omits several levels, including the entire Kansas stage. The shotgun and grenades are not available and background objects can no longer be damaged. Graphics are less detailed, with fewer frames of animation and most of the voice clips and in-game cinematics are not included. The port was faulted for jerky scrolling in the January 1990 issue of Computer and Video Games.

The film had its world premiere at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, garnering positive first reactions. It was shown at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival, and it had a limited theatrical North American release from October 16, 2013. Kill Your Darlings became available on Blu-ray and DVD, March 18, 2014 in the US, followed by its UK release on April 21, 2014. The story is about the college days of some of the earliest members of the Beat Generation (Lucien Carr, Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, and Jack Kerouac), their interactions, and Carr's killing of his long-time friend David Kammerer in Riverside Park in Manhattan, New York City. ==Plot== As a young man in the 1940s, poet Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe) wins a place at Columbia University in New York City. He arrives as a very inexperienced freshman, but soon runs into Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan), who is very anti- establishment and rowdy. After a while, Ginsberg discovers that Carr only manages to stay at Columbia thanks to a somewhat older man, a professor, David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall), who writes all of his term papers for him, and has a predatory relationship with Carr. It appears that Kammerer is still in love with Carr, and is revealed to be pressuring Carr for sexual favors, in exchange for assuring that he cannot be expelled. Ginsberg soon meets, through Carr, William S. Burroughs (Ben Foster), already far into drug experimentation. The writer Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston), who was a sailor at that time and expelled from Columbia, also meets and spends time with them. Carr eventually tells Kammerer he is done with him, and recruits Ginsberg (who has a crush on him) to write his term papers instead. After a while, Kerouac and Carr attempt to run off and join the merchant marine together, hoping to go to Paris. There is a confrontation between Carr and Kammerer, during which Kammerer is killed by stabbing (and perhaps also by drowning). Carr is arrested, and asks Ginsberg to write his deposition for him. Ginsberg is at first reluctant to help the unstable Carr, but after digging up more crucial evidence on Kammerer and his past relationship, he writes a piece entitled \\"The Night in Question\\". The piece describes a more emotional event, in which Carr kills Kammerer who outright tells him to after being threatened with the knife, devastated by this final rejection. Carr rejects the \\"fictional\\" story, and begs a determined Ginsberg not to reveal it to anybody, afraid that it will ruin him in the ensuing trial. From Carr's mother, it is revealed that Kammerer was the first person to seduce Carr, when he was much younger and lived in Chicago. After the trial, Carr testified that the attack took place only because Kammerer was a sexual predator, and that Carr killed him in self- defense. Carr is not convicted of murder and receives only a short sentence for manslaughter. Ginsberg then submits \\"The Night in Question\\" as his final term paper. On the basis of that shocking piece of prose, Ginsberg is faced with possible expulsion from Columbia. Either he must be expelled or he must embrace establishment values. He chooses the former, but is forced to leave his typescript behind. A week or two later he receives the typescript in the mail with an encouraging letter from his professor telling him to pursue his writing. ==Cast== *Daniel Radcliffe as Allen Ginsberg *David Cross as Louis Ginsberg *Dane DeHaan as Lucien Carr *Ben Foster as William S. Burroughs *Michael C. Hall as David Kammerer *Jack Huston as Jack Kerouac *Jennifer Jason Leigh as Naomi Ginsberg *Elizabeth Olsen as Edie Parker *John Cullum as Professor Harrison Ross Steeves *David Rasche as Dean of Columbia University *Kyra Sedgwick as Marian Carr *Zach Appelman as Luke Detweiler ==Production== In 2008, while performing Equus on Broadway, Daniel Radcliffe auditioned and got the part of Ginsberg. Radcliffe went on to film the last two Harry Potter films, Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Part 2, and with him unavailable for filming, Chris Evans, Jesse Eisenberg, and Ben Whishaw were cast without Radcliffe. Shortly after, financing for the film fell through. When director John Krokidas started production on the film again, he offered the role of Ginsberg back to Radcliffe. ==Release== Critical reaction , Kill Your Darlings holds a 77% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 149 reviews with an average rating of 6.59/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Bolstered by the tremendous chemistry between Daniel Radcliffe and Dane DeHaan, Kill Your Darlings casts a vivid spotlight on an early chapter in the story of the Beat Generation.\\" On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 65 out of 100, based on 36 reviews, indicating \\"Generally Favorable\\" reviews. The film earned $1,030,064 in limited release. The Daily Telegraph granted the film a score of three out of five stars, stating that, \\"Unlike Walter Salles's recent adaptation of On the Road, which embraced the Beat philosophy with a wide and credulous grin, Kill Your Darlings is inquisitive about the movement's worth, and the genius of its characters is never assumed\\". Reviewing Kill Your Darlings after its showing at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, critic Damon Wise of The Guardian lauded the film for being \\"the real deal, a genuine attempt to source the beginning of America's first true literary counterculture of the 20th century\\". Kill Your Darlings, wrote Wise, \\"creates a true sense of energy and passion, for once eschewing the clacking of typewriter keys to show artists actually talking, devising, and ultimately daring each other to create and innovate. And though it begins as a murder- mystery, Kill Your Darlings may be best described as an intellectual moral maze, a story perfectly of its time and yet one that still resonates today.\\" Wise awarded the film four out of five stars. Justin Chang of Variety wrote, \\"A mysterious Beat Generation footnote is fleshed out with skilled performances, darkly poetic visuals and a vivid rendering of 1940s academia in Kill Your Darlings. Directed with an assured sense of style that pushes against the narrow confines of its admittedly fascinating story, John Krokidas' first feature feels adventurous yet somewhat hemmed-in as it imagines a vortex of jealousy, obsession and murder that engulfed Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs and Jack Kerouac in the early days of their literary revolution.\\" Historical inaccuracies or questionable assertions Ginsberg's \\"long-time confidant and secretary, head of the Allen Ginsberg Trust,\\" Bob Rosenthal, argues that the film is \\"a superb evocation of young college students in the midst of World War II finding their unique means of expression in the world.\\" However, he states, it also contains a number of inaccuracies: \\"The large fabrications in the film are not so worrisome as the small ones. In any case, when the truth is stepped on and the nuance of truth is denied, the message becomes moribund.\\" Caleb Carr went on to describe Kammerer as a sexual predator 14 years older than Lucien Carr, who first met Lucien when the latter was pubescent and had repeatedly taken advantage of the younger man's naivete and desperation for a strong male influence after being abandoned by his natural father. Furthermore, Kerouac, who wanted only platonic friendship from Lucien, provoked the jealousy of Kammerer. In contrast, according to Jack Kerouac's biographer Dennis McNally's account, Lucien Carr had always insisted, which William Burroughs (a childhood friend of Kammerer in St. Louis) believed, that he never had sex with Kammerer.McNally, Dennis, Desolate Angel, Da Capo Press edition, 2003, p. 67 ==Accolades== - ccc; text-align:center;\\" + style=\\"background: LightSteelBlue;\\"Awards - ccc; text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Award ! scope=\\"col\\"  Date of ceremony ! scope=\\"col\\"  Category ! scope=\\"col\\"  Recipients ! scope=\\"col\\"  Result -  BFI London Film Festival  October 19, 2013  Sutherland Trophy  John Krokidas  -  Gotham Awards  December 2, 2013  Breakthrough Actor  Dane DeHaan  -  rowspan=\\"2\\" Hamptons International Film Festival  rowspan=\\"2\\" October 12, 2013  rowspan=\\"2\\" Breakthrough Performer  Dane DeHaan  -  Jack Huston  -  Palm Springs International Film Festival  January 5, 2013  Directors to Watch  John Krokidas  -  Sundance Film Festival  January 26, 2013  Grand Jury Prize   -  Venice Film Festival  September 7, 2013  The Venice Days International Award   } ==See also== *And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks, a collaborative novel by Burroughs and Kerouac inspired the events depicted in the film. ==References * Official website * * Category:2013 films Category:2013 biographical drama films Category:2013 LGBT- related films Category:2010s romantic drama films Category:2010s thriller films Category:American films Category:American biographical drama films Category:American independent films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Films about the Beat Generation Category:Films set in 1944 Category:Films set in the 1940s Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in New York City Category:LGBT-related drama films Category:LGBT-related films based on actual events Category:Films produced by Christine Vachon Category:Killer Films films Category:Sony Pictures Classics films Category:William S.

In 1987 there were seven major public hospitals in Montevideo. About half the interior departments had a hospital; the others had a centro auxiliar. Altogether there were about 9,505 hospital beds in the public a monthly membership fee and a small co-payment payable to see a doctor or have a test. There may be age and pre-existing condition guidelines for accepting or not accepting non-employed members. 58.9% of the inhabitants of Montevideo were covered by mutualistas in 1971 and 11.8% had the official health card from the Ministry of Public Health which entitled them to free health care. 16.6% had no coverage of any kind. The current Uruguayan healthcare system is the State Health Services Administration (ASSE) created in 1987. The National Healthcare Fund (FONASA) is the financial entity responsible for collecting, managing and distributing the money that the state has destined for health in the country. It was created in 2007 to entitle all employees and pensioners to health care outside of the public health system. Latest government figures state that there are 2.5 million people registered with Fonasa – out of a total population of just over 3 million. This would mean only 500,000 people are left using the public system or having to pay the full amount for private health care. ==References== ","title":"Health in Uruguay"},{"id":"35326760","text":"Gallery of Modern Art.

There are several local landmarks on Ingram Street itself, such as the Italian Centre, the old Sheriff Court, Ramshorn Theatre, the Hutcheson Hall and the Corinthian club amongst others.

Eric Williams, former Prime Minister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, made official visits to Japan in 1974 and 1975. The Embassy of Japan at Port of Spain was opened in 1979. In 2014, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan paid a visit to Trinidad and Tobago as part of his wider visit to CARICOM nations. On July 27, the Prime Minister held a bilateral meeting with The Hon. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, Prime Minister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. This was the first-ever visit to the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago by a Japanese Prime Minister. Abe stated that it was his honor to make the first-ever visit to the Caribbean region by a Japanese Prime Minister during the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and Trinidad and Tobago. Prime Minister Abe also expressed his intention to deepen friendly relations through various exchanges. Prime Minister Persad-Bissessar welcomed the visit by Prime Minister Abe and Japanese business leaders. The two leaders shared views that they would further develop the bilateral relationship, marking the visit as a new page in the history of both countries. Prime Minister Abe offered his belief that assistance from a perspective other than those based on per-capita income would be important in light of the fact that “vulnerability particular to small island states” created greater economic structural problems than per-capita income would suggest, and stated that Japan would conduct field surveys for future cooperation. Prime Minister Persad-Bissessar offered to fully discuss the issue in the Japan-CARICOM Summit Meeting scheduled for the next day. The Japan Maritime Self Defense Forces made a call on a port of Trinidad and Tobago prior to Prime Minister Abe's visit to commemorate the 50th anniversary of bilateral relations and cooperation between the two countries' navies.

Some Japanese major trade firms have engaged in joint activities with local firms. Trade between TT and Japan has expanded significantly in recent years. In 2014, Trinidad and Tobago's primary export products to Japan were liquified natural gas and cacao, comprising approximately 11.28 billion yen (US$91.5 million) of trade revenue. Japan's primary exports to Trinidad and Tobago, including automobiles, power generation units and parts, and rubber tires, constituted 21.84 billion yen (US$177.2 million) worth of trade revenue for Japan. During the 2014 visit by Prime Minister Abe to Trinidad and Tobago, Prime Minister Persad-Bissessar expressed her expectation for further investment from Japanese enterprises. Persad-Bissessar also expressed her interest in triangular cooperation with CARICOM and Japan in order to provide Japanese technical and economic assistance to other CARICOM member states through Trinidad and Tobago. ==Cultural ties== * 1992 – Japan provided cultural grants to preserve and display artifacts and works of art for the National Museum and Art Gallery in Port of Spain. * 1996 – House of Representative Member Horoshi Mitsuzuka was promoted by Trinidad and Tobago as the candidate of Japan for World Cup 2002. * 2001 – Trinidad and Tobago celebrated \\"Japan Week\\" in honor of more than thirty years of relations with Japan. * 2012 – The 11th annual \\"Animation and New Media Festival\\" at Animae Caribe in Trinidad and Tobago underwent a massive expansion, including a sister event in Jamaica, with the support of the Japanese animation industry. * 2014 – Japan helped organize a Martial Arts Lecture and Demonstration at Port of Spain. ==References== Additional sources * * * ==External links== * Embassy of Japan in Trinidad and Tobago * Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan Category:Bilateral relations of Trinidad and Tobago Trinidad and Tobago ","title":"Japan–Trinidad and Tobago relations"},{"id":"35326870","text":"The 1995 Trans-Am Series was the thirtieth season of the Sports Car Club of America's Trans-Am Series. ==Results== {  style=\\"font-size: 90%;\\" - !

Michel Pintoin (c. 1350 – c. 1421), commonly known as the Monk of Saint-Denis or Religieux de Saint- Denis was a French monk, cantor,Meron, Theodor. Henry's Wars and Shakespeare's Laws: Perspectives on the Law of War in the Later Middle Ages. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993, pp. 5–6 and chronicle writer best known for his history of the reign of Charles VI of France.Curry, 100 Anonymous for many centuries, in 1976 the Monk was tentatively identified as Michel Pintoin, although scholars continue to refer to him as the Monk or the Religieux.Veenstra, 22 == The Monk of St Denis == Michel Pintoin has been identified as a monk at the Basilica of St Denis, an abbey which had a reputation for writing chronicles. The monks at St Denis were considered the official chroniclers of the Valois kings and were given access to official documents. Because he witnessed many of the events of the Hundred Years War, the Monk of St Denis is considered a valuable chronicler of this period. His history of the reign of Charles VI, titled Chronique de Religieux de Saint-Denys, contenant le regne de Charles VI de 1380 a 1422, encompasses the king's full reign in six volumes. Originally written in Latin, the work was translated to French in six volumes by L. Bellaguet between 1839 and 1852. Pintoin, considered to be the most well- informed of the chroniclers in the court of Charles VI, wrote about events such as the English Peasants' Revolt in the 1380s and the Harelle and Maillotins revolts in France during the same period.Cohn, Samuel. Lust for Liberty: The Politics of Social Revolt in Medieval Europe, 1200–1425 Italy, France, and Flanders. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. 2006. 2, 39.

Olivier de Clisson and Political Society in France under Charles V and Charles VI. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. 1996. 134. and the disastrous Bal des Ardents in 1393. == Style == Because he was cleric, the Monk wrote about the Hundred Years War from a perspective that differed from secular or \\"chivalric\\" chroniclers such as Jean Froissart. Writing in Latin, his tone was frequently similar to a sermon. He sympathized with the commoners during the war and chastised the knights, who he believed behaved as poorly as common soldiers, to the point that they even caused harm.Le Brusque, 82-83 His opinion of knightly valour is summed up in this passage: > Knights without courage, you who take pride in your armour plate and plumed > helmets, you who glory in looting....you who boasted with so much arrogance > about the feats of valour of your ancestors, now you have become the > laughingstock of the English and the butt of foreign nations.qtd. in Le > Brusque, 82-83 Of the French defeat at the Battle of Agincourt, he wrote that it was caused by the arrogance of the French knights, who charged the English, with the result that \\"The nobility of France was captured and ransomed like a vile herd of slaves, or else it was slaughtered by an obscure soldiery\\". == Influence == 20th-century historians have determined that Pintoin was responsible for the vilification of Isabeau of Bavaria that has persisted since the time of his writing. A passage in his chronicle suggests she was the lover of her brother- in-law Louis I, Duke of Orléans, an allegation perpetuated in other chronicles and writing of the early 15th century. Historian Rachel Gibbons believes Pintoin's writing may have been pro-Burgundian propaganda; Tracy Adams writes that Pintoin's allegation of an incestuous union with the Duke of Orléans led her detractors not only to believe but to fabricate additional untruths about the queen.Adams (2010), xiii-xiv, Gibbons (1996), 62 == References  Sources == * Adams, Tracy.

The organization consists of victims, witnesses, representatives of ethnic communities, marginalized youth, small political groups, the homeless, sex workers, gay, lesbian, and transgender people, youth, drug users, or ordinary citizens who have questions about police authority. == History== The C.O.B.P was formed in 1995 in response to a protest that occurred on August 19, 1995 when Human Life International (HLI) a Catholic pro-life organization made a visit to Montreal. The anti-HLI demonstration was organized by a coalition of nearly 80 organizations and 2500 people. The protest resulted in numerous arrests. It was in fact two of the protestors who were arrested that decided to create the C.O.B.P. C.O.B.P's committee concentrates its efforts in the Montreal region and the collective's work includes: informing people of their rights, lending support to victims of police brutality by helping them file complaints in the police ethics system and dealing with wrongful accusations. The collective also denounces the harassment, violence, intimidation, arrests and abuse of power by police. C.O.P.B has a history of particularly rife with police repression due to their hard-line stance against police brutality, as well as their refusal to denounce the varied ways that victims of police violence express their resistance. ==Mission statement== Raising Awareness of Rights The C.O.B.P does regular workshops and discussions on rights and police abuse. Since 1998 the organization has distributed over 35 000 of their booklets entitled 'Guess what! We've got Rights?!', which lists the rights a person has when dealing with police officers of the SPVM (Service de Police de la Ville de Montreal). The information contained in the booklets is based on Canadian laws as well as on the rules and regulations applying to police forces in Quebec. Support Victims C.O.B.P intervenes when people are unaware of their rights and support the necessary steps required in obtaining justice in cases of police brutality. The group encourages victim testimonials to illustrate how people have suffered from police brutality, so other victims know they are not alone. The victim testimonials which are in video or written format can be helpful in providing justice to the victims of police brutality. The testimonials also serve to expand support for the organization in making police brutality a global issue. Denouncing harassment, violence, intimidation and abuse Another objective of the organization is to monitor the occurrence of violence. The C.O.B.P launched a copwatch program in 1997. The program provides the necessary knowledge and rights that individuals and groups have while in the presence of police forces. The C.O.B.P copwatch programs intentions are to document police misconduct in the hopes that general awareness will reduce the risk of police violence. The C.O.B.P offers copwatch workshops where they recommend tips for beginner, intermediates and advanced copwatchers, while also explaining the rights people have when copwatching, as well as what behaviour is considered abusive. These workshops are free to the public and intend to promote rights that are available when confronted with police brutality., ==Current Activities== International Day Against Police Brutality  The International Day Against Police Brutality is the main initiative put forth by the COBP. It was first introduced in 1997 in conjunction with the Black Flags organization in Switzerland. The events take place on March 15 of each year in commemoration of everyone who has suffered at the hands of police brutality. The 2002 Montreal protest resulted in over 350 arrests. This constituted one of the largest mass arrests in Quebec history.Patrick Rafail, \\"ASYMMETRY IN PROTEST CONTROL? COMPARING PROTEST POLICING PATTERNS IN MONTREAL, TORONTO, AND VANCOUVER, 1998-2004,\\"Mobilization: An International Quarterly, 15, no. 4 (2010): 489-509, http://mobilization.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&backto;=issue,5,7;journal,5,48;linkingpublicationresults,1:119834,1 The Canadian cities that take part in the IDAPB (International Day Against Police Brutality) demonstrations are Belleville, Calgary, Guelph, Trois- Rivières, Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg and Vancouver. Outside of Canada, IDAPB events have taken place in Argentina, France, Mexico, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States amongst other countries. The C.O.B.P organizes the protest in Montreal every year. Out of the 1500 protests that take place each year in Montreal, the March Against Police Brutality is one of many in which organizers refuse to inform the police of their demonstration route beforehand. Key events in recent years that have influenced C.O.B.P organizers of the IDAPB protest in Montreal include: * Shooting of Fredy Villanueva by a Montreal police officer in August 2008. * Farshad Mohammadi, a 34-year-old homeless man was shot by a Montreal police officer at the downtown Bonaventure metro station on the afternoon of Friday, Jan 6th 2012. * Shooting of mentally ill Mario Hamel and passerby Patrick Lemoges. * On February 16, Jean-François Nadreau was killed by a Montreal police officer in an apartment on Nicolet street. His girlfriend had called 911 because he was in crisis. * 60 people who lost their lives during police interventions in Montreal since 1987. ==Mainstream Media IDAPB== When considering the International Day Against Police Brutality, mainstream media offers event based news coverage and editorial content, focusing on arrests, disorders, accounts of the day's actions. It also provides many stories from primary definers, such as police and municipal officials who often project a seeming and somewhat self- sustaining public consensus which casts the protest as airing a valid concern but as incoherent and misguided in its tactics., ==Alternative Media IDAPB== Alternative coverage tends to be more sympathetic to the aims of the C.O.B.P, with reports on their efforts more often found within activist blogs, social networks, video and picture uploads and both student run and local weekly newspapers. Student run newspapers are viewed as alternative by providing factual reporting otherwise unavailable, as well as furnishing efforts at interpretation indicating an examination of power dynamics. The alternative viewpoint is more often aligned with the goals and objectives of the organization than mainstream accounts., ==Organization== Funding The COPB is funded by donations made by its members and anyone who wishes to donate to the cause of eliminating police brutality. The organization is not a registered charity within the federal or provincial charity act. The group officials work secretively and do not release personal information to the public. This information remains secretive due to the violent outcomes of many of the organized protests, such as the IDAPB protest, as well as the fear of criminal repercussions against the initiative and its members. == References  External links == *Collective Opposed to Police Brutality Category:Organizations based in Montreal Category:1995 in Canada Category:Organizations established in 1995 Category:Crime in Montreal Category:Police misconduct in Canada Category:Human rights in Canada ","title":"Collective Opposed to Police Brutality"},{"id":"35327043","text":"Macrophycis malazella is a species of snout moth in the genus Macrophycis.

It was launched on Jan. 26, 1995 by a Long March 2E launcher from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in China, but was destroyed 50 seconds after liftoff when the rocket exploded. The failed rocket also veered off course after launch and killed at least six people on the ground. The Hughes Failure Investigation Team found that excess vibration had caused a rocket fairing to fail due to a structural deficiency. However, the Chinese blamed the rocket- satellite interface for the failure. The two sides agreed that the fairing and the satellite interface would both be improved. The Long March 2E rocket would be retired at the end of 1995. == Political effects == The Apstar 2 failure investigation caused great political controversy in the United States. The export of satellite technology had previously been controlled by the State Department under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, but it was being transferred to the Commerce Department under the Export Administration Regulations. Hughes had received a license from the Commerce Department in 1993 to export the satellite temporarily to China for launch. Hughes also gave the Commerce Department a copy of the failure investigation report and received Commerce approval to export it to China. However, the Commerce Department had noted that some areas still required State Department approval, and Hughes lawyers had also questioned whether they needed a State Department license. The U.S. government launched an inquiry into the Apstar 2 and Intelsat 708 launch failure investigations. In 1998, the U.S. Congress reclassified satellite technology as a munition and returned it to the control of the State Department under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. No export licenses to China have been issued since 1996, and an official at the Bureau of Industry and Security emphasized in 2016 that \\"no U.S.-origin content, regardless of significance, regardless of whether it’s incorporated into a foreign-made item, can go to China.\\" The Justice Department launched a criminal investigation in 1999 of export violations by Hughes. In 2003, Boeing paid $32 million in fines to settle the case, having acquired Hughes in 2000. ==References *APSTARII Category:Communications satellites of China Category:Spacecraft launched in 1995 Category:Satellites using the BSS-601 bus Category:1995 in China ","title":"Apstar 2"},{"id":"35327096","text":"Macrorrhinia endonephele is a species of snout moth in the genus Macrorrhinia.

It was pivotal in redirecting the Indonesian national revolution. In his pamphlet Sjahrir addressed all crucial spearheads of the still ongoing revolutionary struggle for Indonesia's independence. His target audiences are firstly and primarily the Indonesian masses and their leaders involved in the revolution, secondly public opinion in the colonial metropolis of the Netherlands, home of the adversary and thirdly international public opinion. The Dutch-language editions of 1946 contain opening words by Perhimpoenan Indonesia and were used to sway Dutch public opinion during the Linggadjati negotiations. Its English translation was distributed at Westminster Hall to the British delegates to the United Nations.Bayly, Christopher Harper, Tim Forgotten Wars, Freedom and revolution in Southeast Asia (Publisher: Harvard University Press, 2006) P.185 Googlebooks Sjahrir's writings successfully countered the myth that the Indonesian republic was the brainchild of the fascist imperial Japanese forces and not a deep national desire. ==Context== After the defeat of the Japanese Empire and de facto end of World War II, the capitulated and disillusioned Japanese Army and Navy in the former Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies retreat to their barracks and await relief by Allied forces. Before the postponed arrival of Allied forces and their demobilisation the Japanese troops remain responsible to guard their former Allied POW's and European civilian prisoners. August 1945 Indonesian leaders are pressured by revolutionary youth groups, to unilaterally declare the independent Republic of Indonesia. Within a few months the power vacuum left by retreating Japanese forces and the gradually arriving Allied forces explodes into full scale revolutionary tension. Social outgroups that next to Dutch people, include Chinese Indonesians, Dutch-Indonesian Eurasians, and Christian Indonesians such as the Depok, Ambonese and Menadonese people fall victim to violent atrocities. A chaotic time of extreme aggression erupts that is remembered by the Dutch and Indo European victims as the Bersiap period. Sjahrir was the first leader to strongly oppose and condemn the violence committed against (fellow) citizens. ==Author== Public speaker Soetan Sjahrir After writing this pamphlet Sjahrir joined Sukarno and Hatta, the president and vice-president of the unilaterally declared republic of Indonesia as their first prime-minister. While Sukarno and Hatta were accused of having collaborated with the Axis forces and being puppets of the Japanese military, Sjahrir's reputation as anti-fascist and resistance leader enabled him to engage in the original negotiations with the returning Dutch colonial administration as well as the later Linggadjati negotiations. \\"Perhaps the high point of his career was the publication of his pamphlet 'Our Struggle'. Whoever reads that pamphlet today can scarcely comprehend what it demanded in insight and courage. For it appeared at a moment when the Indonesian masses, brought to the boiling point by the Japanese occupation and civil war, sought release in racist and other hysterical outbursts. Sjahrir's pamphlet went directly against this, and many must have felt his call for chivalry, for the understanding of other ethnic groups, as a personal attack.\\" Sol Tas. Tas, Sol Souvenirs of Sjahrir P.150 ==Content== The pamphlet's content consists of a level headed analysis of the early situation of the revolution and clear recommendations for its successful continuation. Sjahrir warns against the negative effect the extreme violence has on the goodwill of international public opinion. Sjahrir clarifies the intense impact Japanese indoctrination has had on the Indonesian people, especially the youth (Indonesian: Pemuda). To deflect the ever growing hatred of the Japanese by the Indonesian people, the Japanese propaganda singled out ethnic target groups for persecution: westerners, Chinese Indonesians, Indo people (Eurasians), Menadonese people and Ambonese people. By the end of the Japanese occupation practices such as mandatory forced labour (Japanese: Romusha), that on average killed 80% of the Indonesian coolies, caused Indonesias rural and urban communities to become impoverished, dislocated, in uproar and disarray. Sjahrir explains Indonesians will never accept any form of colonisation ever again. ==Publications== In 1945 the Dutch-language pamphlet was originally written by Sjahrir in Jakarta, immediately thereafter translated into the Indonesian language as 'Perdjoeangan Kita' (Our Struggle). A Dutch-language book with his preliminary thoughts named \\"Indonesische overpeinzingen\\" (Indonesian musings) was published that same year by publisher Bezige Bij, Amsterdam. In 1946 a first edition of 9,000 pamphlets and second edition of an additional 8,000 pamphlets was printed in the Netherlands by 'Cloeck & Moedigh', published in the Dutch language by Uitgevery 'Vrij Nederland' Amsterdam under the auspices of Perhimpoenan Indonesia.Sjahrir, Soetan Onze Strijd (Publisher: Vrij Nederland, Amsterdam, 1946) P.4 In 1949 his book was translated into the English language by Charles Wolf Jr. and named 'Out of Exile' published by John Day, New York.

The rate of suicide has not been investigated, according to Dr Hilda Ho, as a taboo subject. ==Obesity== 7.5% of the population are obese, the highest prevalence rate in ASEAN. Also, studies by the Ministry of Health show that at least 20% of schoolchildren in Brunei are either overweight or obese. ==Healthcare== There are four government-run hospitals in Brunei, one for every district. There are also 16 health centres and 10 health clinics. Healthcare in Brunei is charged at B$1 per consultation for citizens and is free for anyone under 12 years old. A health centre run by Brunei Shell Petroleum is located in Panaga. For medical assistance not available in the country, citizens are sent overseas at the government's expense. In the period of 2011–12, 327 patients were treated in Malaysia and Singapore at the cost to the government of $12 million. Brunei has 2.8 hospital beds per 1000 people. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS is currently at 0.1%, and numerous AIDS awareness campaigns are currently being held. The largest hospital in Brunei is Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Hospital (RIPAS) hospital, which had 550 beds in year 1992, is situated in the country's capital Bandar Seri Begawan. There are two private medical centres, Gleneagles JPMC Sdn Bhd . and Jerudong Park Medical Centre. The Health Promotion Centre opened in November 2008 and serves to educate the public on the importance of having a healthy lifestyle. There is currently no medical school in Brunei, and Bruneians wishing to study to become doctors must attend university overseas. However, the Institute of Medicines had been introduced at the Universiti Brunei Darussalam and a new building has been built for the faculty. The building, including research lab facilities, was completed in 2009. There has been a School of Nursing since 1951. Fifty-eight nurse managers were appointed in RIPAS to improve service and provide better medical care. In December 2008, The nursing college merged with the Institute of Medicines at the Universiti Brunei Darussalam to produce more nurses and midwives. It is now called the PAPRSB (Pengiran Anak Puteri Rashidah Sa'datul Bolkiah) Institute of Health Sciences. == References == ","title":"Health in Brunei"},{"id":"35327203","text":"Lebanon is a small middle-income country on the Eastern Mediterranean shore with a population of around 4 million Lebanese citizens, 1.2 million Syrian refugees, and half a million Palestinian refugees.

Available from: http://www.who.int/gho/countries/lbn.pdf.[Accessed on September 8, 2018]. This high cardiovascular disease incidence can be attributed to several risk factors. For example, 42% of the Lebanese people are smokers, 29.4% are obese, 22.8% are diabetic, and 29.8% suffer from hypertension.Fahs I, Khalife Z, Malaeb D, Iskandarani M, Salameh P.

Lebanon’s Major Causes of Death in 2014 ==Cancers== Data from World Health Organization (WHO) Globocan 2012 have shown that in the Arab world, Lebanon has the highest lung cancer incidence in females and the third highest in males, with an age-standardized incidence rate among the world population (ASR(w)) per 100,000 person-years of 30.2% in men and 11% in women. Similarly, it has been reported that Lebanon has one of the highest ASR(w) of bladder cancer worldwide, with 29.1 as estimated ASR(w) of bladder cancer among males, thus falling second after Belgium (31.0).Ferlay J, Soerjomataram I, Ervik M, et al. GLOBOCAN 2012 v1.0, Estimated Cancer Incidence and Mortality Worldwide: IARC CancerBase No. 11. Lyon, France: International Agency for Research on Cancer. 2013. Available from: http://globocan.iarc.fr.[Accessed on September 8, 2018]. Trends in high lung and bladder cancer incidence are largely the product of changing smoking prevalence and patterns of tobacco consumption. Smoking is very prevalent and culturally ingrained into Lebanese society, with the most common forms of tobacco smoking in Lebanon being cigarettes or waterpipe smoking, which is gaining popularity, particularly among females.Salameh P, Khayat G, Waked M. Lower prevalence of cigarette and waterpipe smoking, but a higher risk of waterpipe dependence in Lebanese adult women than in men. Women Health 2012;52:135-50. Relative to a single cigarette, a single waterpipe use episode is associated with similar peak plasma nicotine levels and three times greater peak levels of blood carboxyhemoglobin. The first five minutes of waterpipe smoking produce more than four times the increase in blood carboxyhemoglobin as smoking an entire cigarette.Eissenberg T, Shihadeh A. Waterpipe tobacco and cigarette smoking: direct comparison of toxicant exposure. Am J Prev Med 2009;37:518-23. Adult smoking in Lebanon is estimated at 46% for males and 31% for females. Smoking prevalence among the youth is estimated to be among the highest worldwide (65.8% for boys and 54.1% for girls), with waterpipe smoking the major form of smoking (33.9%) followed by cigarette smoking (8.6%).Saade G, Warren CW, Jones NR, Asma S, Mokdad A. Linking Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) data to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC):the case for Lebanon. Prev Med 2008;47(Suppl 1):S15-9. In addition to smoking, urban air pollution measured by concentrations of particulate matter <10 mm in size exceeds the levels set by the WHO (20 mg/m3) in most urban Lebanese cities.Saliba NA, El Jam F, El Tayar G, Obeid W, Roumie M. Origin and variability of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) mass concentrations over an Eastern Mediterranean city. Atmos Res 2010;97:106-14. A) Example of smoking culture in Lebanon around 1800s among both the rich and the poor. With the former seemingly about to singe the other's turban ==Refugees== In 2015, there were 452,669 registered Palestinian refugees in the country; more than half live in 12 Palestinian refugee camps. They are ineligible for state social services, including health care. Further adding to the issue is the amount of Syrian refugees, totalling almost one for every four Lebanese. These people are often forced to live in squalid conditions due to a lack of government resources. More often than not, these people are also subject to discrimination in certain aspects of life. This includes medical treatment, to which they have no legal right to according to Lebanese law. ==Mental Health== Lebanon, a society of people generally wrought by war and loss, is currently plagued with mental health issues where a staggering 17% of citizens suffer from some form of non-war related mental illness. Having only three dedicated psychiatric facilities, but frequent access to psychiatrists and therapy, means that Lebanese has somewhat lacking access to psychiatric treatment by Western standards, but still better access than the rest of the Middle East and the Levant. Cultural stigma, however, often prevents sufferers from receiving the proper care they require and more often than not ends badly.http://odihpn.org/magazine/addressing-mental-health-needs-in- lebanon/https://www.who.int/mental_health/who_aims_report_lebanon.pdf. A horrendously troubling statistic by the WHO indicates that 49% of Lebanese are afflicted with some form of war-related trauma. This often includes former combatants, as well as many victims of the combat, suffering from PTSD. Furthermore, many victims of rape are subject to fear of stigma and do not report their victimization, thus preventing them proper medical and psychiatric treatment, and more importantly, justice.http://odihpn.org/magazine/addressing-mental-health-needs-in- lebanon/https://www.who.int/mental_health/who_aims_report_lebanon.pdf. In addition, it has also been estimated that on average, every 2.5 days, someone dies by suicide and every 6 hours, someone attempts suicide in Lebanon. Given the seriousness of the issue and the many lives it affects, “Embrace Lifeline”, Lebanon’s first suicide prevention hotline was established in 2016. This falls in line with the “Mental Health and Substance Use-Prevention, Promotion and Treatment-Strategy for Lebanon 2015–2020\\", launched by the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health with the aim of creating a more effective and comprehensive mental health treatment infrastructure in Lebanon.Embrace.

[Accessed on September 8, 2018]. “Embrace Lifeline”, Lebanon’s First Suicide Hotline ==Women's Health== Women have adequate access to gynecological and other female health facilities in Lebanon, excluding contraceptives. The Lebanese view on unborn children is that they are equivalent to an infant, thus making it difficult for legalization of abortion. However, abortion is rampant among women and frequently performed by the same doctors who call for its prohibition. Underage pregnancies as well as extramarital pregnancies are the most commonly terminated, often in decent conditions but occasionally not. The general consensus of the Lebanese indicates that most do not support abortion, however a significant urban population is currently vying for its legalization. Most Lebanese prefer the concept of birth then adoption by a sterile family, and this is a frequent occurrence. However, more often than not abortions are forced upon young mothers by family members attempting to preserve family honor.http://www.dw.com/en/bound-by-taboos-lebanese-women-seek- abortions/a-17396085. ==References== ","title":"Health in Lebanon"},{"id":"35327214","text":"Since 1990, key health indicators in Mongolia like life expectancy and infant and child mortality have steadily improved, both due to social changes and to improvement in the health sector. Echinococcosis was one of the commonest surgical diagnoses in the 1960s, but now has been greatly reduced. Yet, adult health deteriorated during the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century and mortality rates increased significantly.Mungunsarnai, G. and Spoorenberg, T. 2012. \\"Did the social and economic transition cause a health crisis in Mongolia? Evidence from age- and sex-specific mortality trends (1965–2009)\\", in J. Dierkes (ed.) Change in Democratic Mongolia: Social Relations, Health, Mobile Pastoralism and Mining, Leiden, Brill. Smallpox, typhus, plague, poliomyelitis, and diphtheria were eradicated by 1981. The Mongolian Red Cross Society focusses on preventive work. The Confederation of Mongolian Trade Unions established a network of sanatoriums. Serious problems remain, especially in the countryside. According to a 2011 study by the World Health Organization, Mongolia's capital city of Ulaanbaatar has the second-most fine particle pollution of any city in the world. Poor air quality is also the largest occupational hazard, as over two-thirds of occupational disease in Mongolia is dust induced chronic bronchitis or pneumoconiosis. Average childbirth (fertility rate) is around 2.25–1.87 per woman (2007) and average life expectancy is 68.5 years (2011). Infant mortality is at 1.9% to 4% and child mortality is at 4.3%. Mongolia has the highest rate of liver cancer in the world by a significant margin. ==Healthcare== History Healthcare in Mongolia was developed from 1922 under the Soviet Semashko model with a large hospital and clinical network. This needed a large supply of clinically trained staff, which was not forthcoming. The isolation of the country meant that developments in medicine were slow to reach it. As recently as 2000 there were only 106 anaesthetists in the country. Legal framework The Ministry of Health is responsible for the provision of Public healthcare under the Citizen’s Health Insurance Law. Citizens are legally required to register and have annual check-ups. Finance is through the Health Insurance Fund established in 1994. Patients are required to make copayments of 10% for secondary care and 15% for tertiary care. in 2009 out-of-pocket payments made up 49% of total health expenditure. Traditional medicine Until the end of the 19th century, medical services were provided by Buddhist monks who practised traditional medicine and knew Chinese, Tibetan, and Indian remedies. Mongolian traditional medicine was repressed after 1922 but is now recognized. The Institute of Traditional Medicine was established in 1961, and the Institute of Natural Compounds in 1973. The National Specialized Hospital caters for traditional medicine patients and has 100 beds. It sees 40-50 outpatients daily. In 2006 about 5% of all hospital in-patients were treated by traditional medicine. In 2012 there were 82 private traditional medicine clinics, 63 of them in Ulaanbaatar. Since 1990 the Mongolian National University of Medical Sciences has had a Traditional Medicine Faculty. In 2007 there were 1,538 doctors trained in traditional medicine. Antibiotics Mongolia had the highest consumption of antibiotics of any country in the world in 2015 with a rate of 64.4 defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day. Facilities A hierarchy of clinics and hospitals was established in the 1980s. A somon medical station, with a doctor, then an inter-somon hospital, covering a wider area and above that an aymag general hospital covering an area of about a 200-kilometre radius. An Aymag hospital would have more than 100 beds. A somon hospital has 10 to 20 beds and 1 or 2 general practitioners. There were 4,600 physicians in the country in 1985, 24.8 per 10,000 people. About half of them were in Ulaanbaatar where there was an oncology centre and a 600-bed isolation hospital for infectious diseases. There were about 8,500 nurses and 3,800 physician's assistants. In 1986 there were 112 hospitals. The Health Insurance Fund will not pay for people who go directly to hospitals without a referral. The health sector comprises 17 specialized hospitals and centers, 4 regional diagnostic and treatment centers, 9 district and 21 aimag general hospitals, 323 soum hospitals, 18 feldsher posts, 233 family group practices, 536 private hospitals, and 57 drug supply companies/pharmacies. In 2002, the total number of health workers was 33,273, of whom 6823 were doctors, 788 pharmacists, 7802 nurses, and 14,091 mid-level personnel. At present, there are 27.7 physicians and 75.7 hospital beds per 10,000 inhabitants. Military medicine The Mongolian armed forces run a Hospital Unit in Darfur with 68 personnel, 34 men and 34 women, which provides health care, emergency resuscitation and stabilization, surgical interventions, and basic dental care for UN personnel. It administers vaccinations and other preventive measures. It has also treated more than 10,000 people from the local communities. Hospitals There has been a reduction in the number of public hospitals since 1998. The number of private hospitals (mostly very small) and clinics has increased from 683 in 2005 to 1184 in 2011. Hospitals in Ulaanbaatar *Intermed Hospital a private hospital established in 2014 *Achtan Hospital *Grand Med Hospital *Second Hospital *Songdo Hospital, private, associated with the Bumrungrad International Hospital *State Central Clinic Hospital, established in 1925.

Pharmacies 132 items are included on the Essential Drugs List. If they are prescribed in the public health system pharmacies are reimbursed for 50-80% of the price, which is controlled. Medication is not always available in rural areas. There are 5 traditional medicine manufacturing units and they produce more than 200 types of traditional medicine. The total value in 2009 was US$1.4 million. 30 traditional products have been registered and some are included on the Essential Drugs List. ==References== ","title":"Health in Mongolia"},{"id":"35327215","text":"is a 1965 Japanese film directed by Kaneto Shindo starring Kyōko Kishida.

It was also an all-star revue silent film, now considered a lost film,The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:National Red Cross Pageant directed by Christy Cabanne. ==Production background== On October 5, 1917, a live open-air pageant was held at the Rosemary Open Air Amphitheater on a private estate, Rosemary Farm, near Huntington, New York. It was also performed again a few weeks later at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. Both performances drew large crowds whose numbers were in the hundreds, and consisted mostly of wealthy New Yorkers. The event was mainly the brainchild of Ben Ali Haggin, famous as a stage designer. His wife appears in one of the episodes. The earnings from the live pageant itself went to the Red Cross. Presumably the filming of the pageant was made with a patriotic fervor in the wake of the United States entry into World War I in April 1917. The proceeds from the film going to the war effort, such as the Red Cross, War Bonds, etc. A litany of famous Broadway and motion picture stars of the period participated in the production. Lionel, Ethel, and John Barrymore all appeared in the production but not together in the same scenes as they did in Rasputin and the Empress (1932).The American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films: 1911-20, The American Film Institute, c. 1988, p. 652 According to the National Red Cross Bulletin, 500 people appeared in the production and more than 5,000 spectators were in attendance. The proceeds from the pageant were reported as having been in the amount of $50,000 which created a way for American citizens to make a difference for their country's participation in the Great War, and it also allowed these same citizens to feel a sense of national pride for their beloved homeland. Its success was so remarkable, the National Red Cross later proclaimed December 7 National Red Cross Theatrical Day. ==Synopsis== The cast of the 1917 theatrical production at Huntington, New York The pageant consisted of episodes from the history of each of the Allies. The case of each Ally before the bar of Truth, Justice, and Liberty, was organized by actors and actresses of the American stage. Decorators and artists collaborated in the settings and costuming. The first of two parts consisted of historic episodes in relation to the Allied nations. The prologue, spoken by Edith Wynne Matthison, dedicated an altar to Peace and was followed by rhythmic dancing by Florence Fleming Noyes and her pupils. A scene from early Flemish days followed, and four famous cities, Bruges, Ghent, Ypres, and Louvain paid their allegiance to Flanders, played by Ethel Barrymore in the costume seen in Flemish paintings. The Italian scene followed and then the scene of the birth of English liberty, as represented by King John signing the Magna Carta. Medieval Russia was played by John Barrymore as a tyrant borne upon the shoulders of his serfs. In the French episode, Ina Claire appeared as Jeanne D'Arc riding her white charger. In \\"The Drawing of the Sword\\", the second half of the pageant, each nation among the Allies appeared to present its case before the court of Truth, Justice, and Liberty. Serbia entered first and told her story of the opening of the war, to which Truth spoke assent. Belgium followed, and to her aid came England and France, while Russia came to the support of her ally, Serbia. Next, England called upon her overseas colonies, and Japan also, brought her pledge to maintain the cause of liberty on the Pacific. Armenia came to tell her wrongs; and Italy, shaking off the bonds of the Triple Alliance, cast her lot with the defenders of liberty. The grand climax was reached with the entry of America in the person of Marjorie Rambeau. Jenna Kubly said the pageant described the United States' position in the war as \\"a nation involved in a just war to free all nations.\\" The Red Cross Bulletin wrote: > Many of the leading theatrical stars of America contributed their services > in The National Red Cross Pageant held on the afternoon of October 5 at the > Rosemary Open-Air Theater, on the estate of Roland B.

The audience space includes raked seating incorporated in the terrain. Behind the stage there are trees and flora that make up the background. The set of The National Red Cross Pageant included a large throne and an archway made of stone. There were many different costumes in The National Red Cross Pageant due to the great variety of roles including soldiers, mermaids, and personified countries. ==Cast== *Edith Wynne Matthison - Prologue *Douglas Wood - Herald, Flemish episode *Ethel Barrymore - Flanders, Belgium; Flemish and Final episodes *Kitty Gordon - Bruges; Flemish episode *Margaret Moreland - Ghent; Flemish episode *Adelaide Prince - Ypres; Flemish episode *Olive Tell - Louvain; Flemish episode *Irene Fenwick - Herald; Italian episode *Montgomery Irving - The Alps; Italian episode *Annette Kellerman - The Mediterranean; Italian episode *Josephine Drake - The Adriatic; Italian episode *Ethel McDonough - Leader of the Lakes; Italian episode *Norman Trevor - Herald; English episode *George Backus - King John; English episode *Marjorie Wood - Queen; English episode *Maclyn Arbuckle - Baron Fitz-Walter; English episode (billed as Macklyn Arbuckle) *Lumsden Hare - The Archbishop of Canterbury; English episode Rehearsals. actors rehearsing for their role in the pageant as well as the film. left to right: Guy Favieres, Mrs. Ben Ali Haggin(Helen Roche-Haggin), Ina Claire(kneeling), Clifton Webb, Ivy Troutman, Eugene O'Brien, Jeanne Eagels, Ben Ali Haggin. *Frank Keenan - The Secretary; English episode *Frederick Truesdell - The Papal Legate; English episode *Mrs. Ben Ali Haggin - Dance, The Pavane; French episode *Clifton Webb - Dancer, The Pavane; French episode *Ben Ali Haggin - Dunois, Defender of France; French episode *Ina Claire - Jeanne D'Arc; French episode *Guy Favières - Charles VII, the Dauphin; French episode *John Barrymore - The Tyrant; Russian episode *George F.

Child mortalities have been reduced by over fifty percent since the 1990s. Qatar's healthcare spending is among the highest in the Middle East, with $4.7 billion being invested in healthcare in 2014. The country's progress in health is hampered by exceedingly high rates of obesity, diabetes and genetic disorders. Currently, health coverage is nationwide. In 2013, the infant mortality rate was 7 per 1,000 live births and life expectancy was 79 years. ==The population== The population of 2.3 million is 75% male and 94% are immigrants. There are about 250,000 Qatari citizens with an average income of about US$94,000 per annum in 2014. ==Health concerns== Obesity In 1980, Qatar was the fourth most obese nation in the world. A recent report conducted in 2013 concluded that Qatar ranks fifth globally in terms of obesity rates. The same report revealed that 22.1% of girls under 20 and 33.5% of boys under 20 are classified as obese. 36.5% of boys and 23.6% of girls age 12–17 were overweight in 2003. By 2015, it was predicted that 73% of women and 69% of men will be obese. According to the International Association for the Study of Obesity, Qatar has the 6th highest rate of obesity among boys in the Middle East and North Africa region. One reason for the obesity trend is the lack of exercise and poorly designed pedestrian friendly cities. \\"Like other oil-rich nations, Qatar has leaped across decades of development in a short time, leaving behind the physically demanding life of the desert for air- conditioned comfort, servants, and fast food\\". Although the type of food eaten has changed, the cultural traditions surrounding food have not. Food is often consumed communally, making it nearly impossible to ensure proper portions. A person who does not eat when food is offered is seen as offensive and shameful. It is also normal within Qatari society to be obese. Diabetes The country has among the highest rates of obesity, diabetes and genetic disorders in the world. It has the highest rate of obesity among boys in the MENA region. As of 2013, 16% of the adult population in Qatar have been diagnosed with diabetes. The government has launched numerous campaigns and initiatives to combat the rise in diabetes; the establishment of the Qatar Diabetes Association being one of its most notable initiatives. Birth defects According to March of Dimes's global report on birth defects published in 2006, Qatar ranked in the top 20 countries globally for the number of birth defects per 1,000 births. The rate stands at 73.4 per 10,000 live births. According to March of Dimes, Qatar ranked 16th globally for the number of birth defects per 1,000 births; this is due to the high degree of consanguinity in marriages. ==See also== * Healthcare in Qatar * List of countries by Body Mass Index (BMI) ==References== ","title":"Health in Qatar"},{"id":"35327257","text":"St George's Cross buildings.

This was later revised and published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1909. == Garrad == Another complete translation from Hebrew and Greek was started in 1923. It was published by the British and Foreign Bible Society and translated by Charles Edward Garrad, William Sherratt and George Kya Bin. It is generally believed to have been completed in 1926 and published in 1927. It is claimed to be mainly used within the Anglican denomination. Garrad was a distinguished scholar. He won many prizes while an undergraduate at Jesus College, Cambridge. He later became a fellow of Clare College, Cambridge (1900-1906). He was also Vice-Principal of Westcott House, Clergy Training College, Cambridge (1902-06). https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NloQAAAAIAAJ&q;=C+E+Garrad+clare+college&dq;=C+E+Garrad+clare+college&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiIuLXTx7jqAhXjRRUIHYN- CTQQ6AEwBHoECAYQAg In 1906 he left England to become a missionary in Burma.

The New Testament might be a revision of the U Tun Nyein translation. Garrad continued to document corrections to this translation after its publication. Andrew Garrad, his grandson, and Anne Carter, his daughter, initiated the incorporation of these into the translation. This work was completed in 2012 and defined as a new edition of the translation. Garrad's translation is available in the Bible Society of Myanmar app. Anne Carter has written an account of her family's time in Burma in her book \\"Bewtiched by Burma - A unique insight into Burma's complex past\\".

The Common Language Bible is available in the YouVersion app, the Bible Society of Myanmar app, Bible.com, and the Bible Society of Myanmar website. == Eagle Edition == A revision of the Judson translation was published in 2006 by unknown authors.

Brink, a Christian Reformed missionary working at Rehoboth, New Mexico, translated the first portions of the Bible into Navajo. His translations of Genesis and Mark were published by the American Bible Society in 1910. Presbyterian missionaries John Butler, Alexander Black and F.G. Mitchell translated short portions, and in 1917 after collaborative work the American Bible Society published in one volume portions from Genesis, Exodus, Psalms, Jonah, Isaiah, Mark, Luke, John, Romans, First Corinthians, and Revelation, as God Bîzad. In 1937 Acts was added, and it was republished as \\"God Bizaad\\" (God's Word)God Speaks Navajo, by Ethel Walls -- pg. 67 Work only began in earnest, however, when Faye Edgerton joined Wycliffe Bible Translators in 1944. She and Geronimo Martin revised the older translations, and completed most of the New Testament. The Corinthian epistles were translated by William Goudberg and Jacob Kamps of the Christian Reformed Church. The New Testament was published in 1956, and became an instant bestseller among the tribe.God Speaks Navajo, by Ethel Walls -- ch. 16 The complete Bible, under the name Diyin God Bizaad, was printed for the first time in 1985. A revision was published by the American Bible Society in 2000. It uses the borrowed English word \\"God\\" for God, together with the Native word \\"Diyin\\" (\\"Holy\\"), or \\"Diyinii\\" (\\"Holy One\\"). Thus, the term is not just \\"God,\\" and not just \\"Diyin\\" or \\"Diyinii,\\" but \\"Diyin God,\\" as in \\"Diyin God Bizaad\\" (\\"God's Word\\"). This is equivalent to the earlier title, \\"God Bizaad\\" (\\"God's Word\\").

In 1887 Pozdneev visited Astrakhan, correcting his Acts and distributing Gospels; he also visited nomadic camps and read to all, including Buddhists. After three more journeys to the steppes he completed the New Testament, Acts to Revelation (Dordzhe Kulusoff assisted Pozdneev for this part of the translation).

Miller described Dive as \\"sun-blanched, caked in reverb and semi-hallucinatory fuzz, and kind of wavy at the point where visual lines intersect.\\" Critic Loren Auda Poin analyzed that the synthesizer sounds \\"border on vagueness, barely holding their jelly-like shape as they coalesce atop relaxed but driving beats.\\" In numerous reviews, Dive's sound and style was compared to the works of Boards of Canada.Judge, Stephen (December 21, 2011). \\"Tycho – Dive\\". Blurt. Retrieved June 26, 2017. Allmusic's Jason Lymangrover was one of these critics, writing that it uses the same format of \\"liquid keyboards drizzled over gentle beats\\" as the works of Boards of Canada and Ulrich Schnauss. He also grouped the album with other electronica artists such as M83 and Neon Indian and Small Black. Eric Harvey of Spin magazine more specifically compared Dive to Boards of Canada's Geogaddi album. Bass described the album's sound as consisting of \\"pink sunsets, shuffling hipsters and old video hardware.\\" Some critics have also made direct comparisons of Dive to the works of chillwave artists such as Toro Y Moi and Washed Out.Wallace, Wyndham. Review of Tycho - Dive. BBC Music. 17 November 2011. Retrieved 6 April 2012. Ali compared Dive to The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place (2003), an album by Explosions in the Sky, due to \\"its many gorgeous hues,\\" as well as its musical style to the works of Air. Joe Colly of Pitchfork compared Dive to Boards of Canada and Bibio in terms of its \\"electro-organic\\" sound structure of synthesizers and live instruments. He wrote that what differentiates Dive from the works of other independent artists that use \\"electro-organic\\" arrangements is the \\"simple\\" and \\"OCD- level\\" way each track is crafted and built up. As Colly wrote, \\"In place of the tinny, synthetic beats favored by lots of indie-ambient startups, Hansen takes extra care to capture real live drum sounds with a crack and thump that makes you feel like you're in the room with them.\\" Colly used \\"Daydream\\" as an example of Hansen's attention to detail in terms of song building. As he wrote, it \\"starts out fairly simple with twinkly guitars and a sturdy, knocking beat, but the song's pulse quickens as it progresses, and by the end you've got something heady enough to live up to its title.\\" Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic analyzed a musical difference of Dive from past Tycho releases that gives the LP a more \\"dynamic\\" sound: elements of folk music serving as the \\"foundation\\" of most of its tracks, where \\"swirling melodies give way to acoustic guitars.\\" Stagno also noted that Dive has a \\"livelier, more carefree atmosphere\\" than the \\"nostalgic, sometimes contemplative motif[s]\\" of Hansen's previous albums of the project. This is most showcased on the album's eight- minute title-track, where, as Stagno wrote, \\"driving beats help keep everything focused as Hansen lays down lush soundscapes that help maintain an infectious mood that is as dreamy as it is energetic.\\" Erik Burg of Beats Per Minute noted Dive's \\"transmorphic sound:\\" \\"He can shift from a barrage of keyboards, synthesizers, and drum machines to an acoustic guitar at the drop of a hat, all while sounding completely cohesive on both a track and album level.\\" He described the album as a \\"essential device for sparking imagination,\\" writing that it has \\"a spirit and liveliness which is translated through the listener on their own terms.\\" Kyle Lemmon, a critic for Prefix magazine, described Dive as a post-modern album and a record \\"ensconced in the musty past of outdated appliances and ideas.\\" He analyzed that the LP is a set of \\"nature-inspired\\" tracks where \\"the seemingly commonplace nature all around us\\" is \\"as foreign and transfixing as E.T.\\" He also described the album as more \\"aquatic and climate-altering\\" than past Tycho albums. ==Artwork== The artwork of Dive depicts a multihued sun that, as Patric Fallon writes, \\"practically melt[s] into a large swath of barren earth.\\" Even though Hansen, who created the artwork, left it vague as to whether or not the cover art is trying to depict a sun rising or setting, he stated that the cover art represented a sunset to him: \\"It's kind of like the epilogue to a chapter in my life as an artist and a person. This last year has been really transformative in a lot of ways, personally, so this album is kind of a punctuation on the end of a really intense period [of my life].

Lymangrover reasoned that it was due to its use of more acoustic instruments than past releases of the project. Stagno stated that while the album \\"lacks a certain flair\\" of previous Tycho records, it was still \\"the kind of high quality release one expects from Hansen.\\" He also wrote, \\"Drawing on a variety of different sounds and structures, Tycho is able to craft a number of immersive tracks.\\" In a review for BBC Music, Wyndham Wallace opined that Dive \\"meets expectations, and while surpassing them is something achieved only occasionally, this is a record that well complements a no-work state of mind.\\" In a less positive review, Joe Colly of Pitchfork criticized the album's lack of surprise, writing \\"If that nicely detailed tranquility is Dive's biggest selling point, it also exposes a nagging flaw, which is a lack of tension. Hansen is so committed to keeping things serene that he doesn't incorporate much danger or risk, and at times the album can feel a bit one-note.\\" Poin similarly criticized the LP for the fact that the tracks \\"seem to stroke and soothe the mind’s imaginative engine, rather than exciting it.\\" While he did enjoy Dive, calling it a \\"beautiful album with an amniotic vibe,\\" he also wrote that it was \\"a bit repetitive,\\" writing that \\"each of Dive’s songs gel into one atmosphere rather than branching into the semi-organic variety of the best records.\\" He felt that Dive didn't do what electronic music instrumental records should, which is \\"shift into gears we didn’t even know existed, so we marvel at the counterintuitive beauty of the machine.\\" Harvey described Dive as \\"a pretty and sturdily crafted collection of techno maybe-memories.\\" Bass called Dive \\"irresistibly good,\\" writing that for a 66-minute-long album, \\"Hansen’s clever enough to add spice where it’s needed, edging his sluggish beats away from New Age and into something more engaging.\\" A negative of the LP mentioned his review for Drowned in Sound was that \\"large portions of it overlap.\\" He reasoned that \\"a few tracks feel plain identical\\" to the point where they fit the definition of ambient music set by Brian Eno as “music interesting/bland enough to either analyse with headphones or put on in the background while ironing.” Lemmon wrote that with Dive, \\"Tycho makes damn sure to make his tracks move even when they seem like they’re just stargazing.\\" He also wrote that \\"there’s little pretension wafting over his analog craft and the melodic tokens he unearths are as iridescent as an oceanic sunset.\\" PopMatters named Dive the third-best electronic album of 2011, writing: \\"[H]eavy processing and multicolored aural flourishes unwind here and for the duration, yielding playback that’s refreshingly reluctant on returns.\\"The Best Electronic Music of 2011.

Its native status is L48 (N), CAN (N), and SPM (N). ==Habitat and ecology== Viola lanceolata can be found growing in bogs, swamps, wet meadows and along shores in sandy soil. It is a perennial plant that blooms between May and June. Viola lanceolata frequently hybridizes with northern white violet (Viola macloskeyi) to form primrose-leaved violet (Viola primulifolia). It grows in similar habitats but has leaves intermediate between lance shaped and the typical heart-shaped violet leaves of northern white violet. ==Morphology== The overall plant is tall and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves. These leaves are sometimes wider in the summer than in the spring and have generally smooth surfaces. Its stem is smooth and slender.

He left school at the age of eleven and became an assistant to his sire. He immigrated to the United States in 1847. He worked as a butcher in New York, Ohio, and Missouri and encountered numerous financial problems. In St. Joseph, Missouri, he married Jane Walker, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), on July 2, 1851. The newly married couple moved to Salt Lake City in Utah Territory in 1852. Shortly after arriving in Salt Lake City, Jennings was baptized into the LDS Church. Soon afterwards, he married Priscilla Paul as a plural wife. Career in Utah Jennings opened a butchery and tannery in Salt Lake City and later founded a successful mercantile business. In 1864, he had become so successful that he constructed an expensive building, the Eagle Emporium, and used it as the headquarters of his mercantile businesses. The state of his business at that time made Jennings a leading merchant west of the Mississippi River. Eagle Emporium was later sold to the LDS Church and became a central component of Zions Cooperative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI). His mansion, devereaux, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Jennings became the vice-president of the Utah Central Railroad Company after helping organize it in 1869 and became the president of the Utah Southern Railroad Company. In his later years he was a director for the Deseret National Bank. He was also involved in the ZCMI, acting as superintendent on multiple occasions and as vice-president. Jennings became a member of the LDS Church's Council of Fifty in 1880. He was elected mayor of Salt Lake City in 1882 and served until 1885. He intended to run for a second term, but he was deemed ineligible under the Edmunds Act because he was a polygamist. Jennings died in Salt Lake City and was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery. ==References * Category:1823 births Category:1886 deaths Category:People from Yardley Category:American leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Category:English Latter Day Saints Category:English emigrants to the United States Category:Businesspeople from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Businesspeople from Utah Category:Converts to Mormonism Category:Mayors of Salt Lake City Category:Members of the Council of Fifty Category:People of Utah Territory Category:Burials at Salt Lake City Cemetery Category:English leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Latter Day Saints from Utah ","title":"William Jennings (mayor)"},{"id":"35327838","text":"Helcogramma nigra, the Rotuma triplefin, is a species of triplefin blenny in the genus Helcogramma.

As a result, due to its legal history, Central Square is now one of a few areas in Cardiff designated an alcohol control zone, allowing the police to confiscate alcohol. Between 1932 and 1934, the Great Western Railway replaced the original 1850s station building (also designed by their architect's department) with a new Art Deco building faced in Portland stone, enclosing a booking hall with noted Art Deco light fittings, all topped by a clock cupola. The Great Western Railway has its full name carved onto the façade (larger than the name of the station). During the new station's planning and construction, the GWR made representations to Cardiff Corporation to improve the immediate area.

She served as regent for her predecessor Queen Tamaeva IV. Tamaeva V's reign was disrupted by ongoing French expansionism in the Pacific. She and her predecessor Tamaeva IV had previously attempted in vain to request a British protectorate to hold off French colonial aggression. This action resulted in the declaration of a French protectorate over Rimatara on 29 March 1889. In 1900, the neighboring kingdom of Rurutu was annexed to bring it economically closer to French controlled Tahiti. As the last monarch in the Austral Island group, Tamaeva V ceded Rimatara to the French on 6 June 1901 and the island was formally annexed on 2 September 1901 and incorporated into the territory of French Oceania, today part of the overseas country of French Polynesia. Tamaeva V was responsible for saving the Rimatara lorikeet (Vini kuhlii) from extinction during the early 20th century. The species was threaten by overhunting and the introduction of black rat. In 1900, she declared a tapu or taboo which forbade any Rimataran from exporting, exploiting, or harming the bird. Surviving population of the birds were reintroduced to Atiu in the Cook Islands in 2007. Tamaeva V died in 1923 and her remains were interred in the Royal Sepulchre at the Cemetery of Amaru. ==Early life== Born on the Polynesian island of Rimatara, Heimataura was the daughter of King Tamaeva II, Ari'i of Rimatara. She lived in a world influenced by the changes brought on by the westernization of the island. Rimatara had been the last of the Austral Islands to be discovered by Western explorers in 1811. Protestantism was introduced by Tahitian missionaries from the Society Islands and became the dominant religion on the island. A church at the capital of Amaru, constructed in 1857 and renovated in 1892, housed the entire island's population of 300 people under its roof. The small kingdom had fashioned its own sovereign flag by 1856. The first law code was introduced in 1877.* ==Rule as regent== The young queen Tamaeva IV, the regent, group of chiefs and inhabitants of Rimatara, c. 1889 Rimatara and its neighbor Rurutu were unique because they remained independent while the other Austral Islands, and even Tahiti to the north, fell to the French colonial empire. Tamaeva II died in 1865. It is assumed that a brother or a male relative of Heimataura succeeded to the throne as Tamaeva III. Tamatoa III was later succeed by his daughter Queen Tamaeva IV. Heimataura served as regent for the teenage Tamaeva IV. In 1892, French Protestant missionary Frédéric Vernier, of the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society, visited Rimatara at the invitation of the adolescent queen and queen regent. During his stay, Vernier witnessed the restoration and reopening of the church in the capital, Amaru, which was celebrated with much fanfare. Rimatara and Rurutu attempted in vain to request a British protectorate to hold off French colonial aggression. The French responded immediately to what they presumed to be a threat to their interests in the Pacific. On 29 March 1889, the French warship Dives landed on Rimatara with the colonial governor of French Oceania, Étienne Théodore Lacascade, on board, and he had Rimatara and its dependency Îles Maria declared a French protectorate. The French sources state that the queen, regent and chiefs had personally petitioned Governor Lacascade to take over the islands, but British sources believed the whole affair to be largely contrary to the desire of the majority of the islanders. The protectorate treaty was signed by Lascarde and five French officials and countersigned by the queen, Heimataura, and seven other chiefs or councilors. As a sign of the newly declared protectorate, the French tricolor was added to the canton of the kingdom's flag in 1891. ==Reign== After the early death of Tamaeva IV on 12 November 1892, Heimataura succeeded as Queen of Rimatara in her own right as Tamaeva V. Under the French protectorate she was allowed to reign with much of the intact native government and laws of the past. In 1900, the neighboring King Teuruarii IV of Rurutu had his kingdom formally annexed to France in order to bring it closer economically to the colonial seat of Papeete. Tamaeva, the last independent monarch in the Austral Islands, ceded Rimatara to France the following year, in a declaration dated to 6 June 1901. On 2 September 1901, Rimatara was formally annexed to France in a ceremony officiated by Governor Édouard Georges Théophile Petit. The Queen was represented by her three children: Narii, Tairiata, and Tamatoa. At the end of the transfer, the flag of the protectorate was replaced by the French tricolor with cries of \\"Vive la République Française\\" from the populace. The island was incorporated into the territory of French Oceania, today part of the overseas country of French Polynesia. Tamaeva V died in 1923. Her remains were interred in the Royal Sepulchre at the Cemetery of Amaru, outside the settlement facing the sea; she was laid to rest beside other members of the Tamaeva royal line. ==Saving the Rimatara lorikeet== The Rimatara lorikeet or Kuhl's lorikeet. Lithograph by Edward Lear According to local tradition, the Rimatara lorikeet (Vini kuhlii; also known as the 'Ura or Kuhl's lorikeet) was saved from extinction by a royal declaration issued by Queen Tamaeva V in 1900. The species was endemic to the southern Cook Islands and Rimatara but had been decimated in the former group after the introduction of the black rat and overhunting by local people. She declared a tapu or taboo which forbade any Rimataran from exporting, exploiting, or harming the bird. In 2007, a population was reintroduced to the black-rat-free island of Atiu in the Cook Islands by BirdLife International, the Cook Islands Natural Heritage Trust and numerous conservation bodies, including the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research. In 2008, the introduced population was found to be reproducing. ==NotesReferences== Category:1830s births Category:1923 deaths Category:19th-century monarchs in Oceania Category:Protestant monarchs Category:French Polynesian royalty Category:19th-century women rulers Category:Queens regnant Category:Oceanian monarchs Category:Austral Islands ","title":"Tamaeva V"},{"id":"35327965","text":"Thomas Crook (May 22, 1798 Westminster, Windham County, Vermont – October 3, 1879) was an American politician from New York. ==Life== He was the son of James Crook (1777–1838) and Hannah (Martin) Crook (1767–1834).

They occur throughout Mexico, Central America, and South America, and formerly the Caribbean and North America. One genus and several species are extinct; another genus is extinct in the wild. Two species are known only through subfossil remains. About a dozen hypothetical extinct species (see Extinct Caribbean macaws) have been described, native to the Caribbean area. Among the Arini are some of the rarest birds in the world, such as Spix's macaw, which is extinct in the wild – fewer than 100 specimens survive in captivity. It also contains the largest flighted parrot in the world, the hyacinth macaw. Molecular studies have dated the divergence of the Arini tribe from the ancestral neotropical parrots to late in the Paleogene period about 30–35 million years ago. ==Taxonomy== The Arini are one of three recognized clades in subfamily Arinae of neotropical parrots in the family Psittacidae of Afrotropical and neotropical parrots, one of three families of true parrots. {  - !

Its primary mission is to encourage research and writing on naval and maritime subjects and preserve documents, portraits, and other records of prominent figures, deeds and memories of American naval and maritime history.John C. Rice, Jr., Naval order of the United States: Past-Present-Future. (Paduchah, KY: Turner Publishing Company, 2003), p. 12 ==History== The Naval Order of the United States traces its origin to the initiative of Charles Calhoun Philbrook, Charles Frederick Bacon Philbrook, and Franklin Senter Frisbie, who met in Boston, Massachusetts, on 4 July 1890 to take the first step toward establishing an organization that was originally named the Naval Commandery of the United States of America. Its purpose was to commemorate the seagoing services of their ancestors' naval service. The original eligibility for membership was based upon service \\"in any of the wars or in any battle in which the United States Navy or Marine Corps has participated, or who served as above in connection with the Revenue or Privateer Services.\\" Four months later, on the 115th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps, 10 November 1890, the organization was established on a permanent basis and branches were established in several states. Three years later on 19 July 1893, the Naval Commandery began discussions with a smaller organization that had similar aims: the Naval Legion of the United States. The result of these talks resulted in the formal merger of the two organizations as the Naval Order of the United States. The formal meeting of the new and expanded organization took place on 15 August 1893 at Faneuil Hall, Boston, where the Naval Order adopted its constitution that created local commanderies in the various states with members becoming Companions of the Naval Order.Rice, Naval Order, p.8 ==Membership Criteria== *Regular Members - Any United States citizen, who has served or is serving as an officer or enlisted member of the United States Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, the U.S. Coast Guard and any other federal military maritime service of the United States or its allies and their descendants over 18 years of age, who are US citizens. *Associate Members - Spouses of present and deceased regular members, and those, other than United States citizens, who have served or are serving honorably as commissioned officers in an allied seagoing service. Also, the Naval Order may confer either associate or honorary membership upon individuals who are not otherwise eligible for regular or associate membership, if they have distinguished themselves in the interest of naval service.Rice, Naval Order, p. 12. ==National Awards by the Order== The Order presents a number of annual awards as part of its furtherance of its mission, including three awards to the U. S. Naval Academy midshipmen who score the highest in competitive examinations on national and international political science issues; an award to the outstanding graduate of the Chief of Naval Air Training Command Flight Officer program; awards to the outstanding midshipmen and cadets at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, at the State University of New York Maritime College, the California Maritime Academy, and at Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps programs at various universities, as well as an award to the outstanding junior officer instructor at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.

In April 2005 Pogany was honorably discharged due to medical reasons related to PTSD. However, less than two years earlier, on October 14, 2003 Pogany's separation status and reputation was in serious jeopardy as he became the first American soldier since the Vietnam War to be charged with cowardice. During Pogany's service, he was an interrogator for the Green Berets. On only his second night in Iraq Pogany witnessed the gruesome death of an Iraqi who was cut in half by machine gun fire. He told his superiors that he was suffering from panic attacks and was headed towards a nervous breakdown. Soon after his request his superiors sent him to Fort Carson, Colorado, to face a court-martial for cowardice, a charge which may be punishable by death. The charge was later reduced to dereliction of duty, and was ultimately dropped on Dec 18, 2003. The Army offered Pogany a non-judicial punishment proceeding, but he instead requested a court-martial. Army psychologists said that Pogany had no psychological disorders, but had symptoms consistent with PTSD. Pogany claims that his panic attacks may have been related to Lariam, an antimalarial drug that he and other Ft. Carson soldiers took on a weekly basis prior to leaving for Iraq. The drug's manufacturer, Roche, has received over 3,000 reports of side effects, including paranoia, psychosis and aggression. The Army dropped all charges against Pogany, and a spokesman stated that Pogany “may have a medical problem that requires care and treatment.” After Pogany retired from the military, he has worked as a veterans' and active duty service advocate for issues related to health and military justice. He founded and currently manages \\"J1W2\\", or \\"Just One Wounded Warrior\\" which seeks to connect veteran and active military to mental health care professionals. == References == Category:1971 births Category:People from Munich Category:Living people Category:United States Army non-commissioned officers Category:People with post-traumatic stress disorder Category:Mental health activists ","title":"Georg-Andreas Pogany"},{"id":"35328169","text":"Bathylaconidae is a former family of marine smelts found in deep oceanic waters.

For other people named David Paynter, see David Paynter (disambiguation) David Shillingford Paynter, RA, OBE (5 March 1900 – 7 June 1975), was an internationally renowned Sri Lankan painter. He was a pioneer creator of a Sri Lankan idiom in what was essentially a Western art form. His most celebrated works are his murals at the Trinity College Chapel in Kandy and the Chapel of the Transfiguration, at S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia. The Sri Lanka Philatelic Bureau commemorated Christmas in 1996 with two stamps featuring the murals from the Trinity Chapel. ==Early life== David's father, Arthur Stephen Paynter, was born in Bicester in Oxfordshire, where his family owned several breweries. Arthur married Anagi, the daughter of Arnolis Weerasooriyaa, a Sinhalese person from the south of Sri Lanka. Both were in the Salvation Army and worked in India and after some years left in order to start the India Christian Mission. Arthur and Anagi moved to Ceylon in 1904, and decided to start a mission in Nuwara Eliya. Thus young David had his primary education at Breeks Memorial School in India, and his secondary education at Trinity College, Kandy. Apart from the basic guidance he received at Trinity, he had no formal art lessons. Yet David Paynter entered the Royal Academy by winning a five- year scholarship in the open competition with students, many of whom received formal instruction in European art schools. ==Paynter and the Royal Academy== Paynter won the Royal Academy Gold Medal at the end of the fourth year along with the Edward Stott Travelling Scholarship which gave him two years in Italy. In 1936 he visited London for the third time - a productive and rewarding period in his art career. His one-man exhibition at the Wertheim Gallery in London brought him much recognition from art critics and journals in Europe. By invitation he participated in four international exhibitions in the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburg in Rome, in New Delhi and at the World Fair held in New York. From 1923 to 1940 his paintings were exhibited every year at the Royal Academy in London. The themes of most of his early works are religious. In 1923 two of his best pictures The Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem and the Entombment were considered powerful and dramatic statements of deeply felt religious experiences. ==Trinity College years== \\"Washing the Disciples Feet\\", a mural in Trinity College Chapel, Kandy In 1925, he returned to Sri Lanka and started work on the Trinity College Chapel murals. The Trinity Chapel was a monumental work of architecture exemplifying the core vision that Paynter shared - a European world view rooted in the vernacular of the land. Nothing of its type had even been imagined in the 1920s. The Independence Memorial Hall in Colombo - which borrowed heavily from the Trinity Chapel design – would not be created for another quarter century. Thus, in Rev Gaster's timeless design, Paynter found the ideal setting for his masterwork. Work on the chapel began in 1923. By 1929, the side chapel was erected, and Paynter began work on his first mural. His murals in the chapel, which comprise 'Are Ye Able', 'Washing the Disciples' Feet', 'The Good Samaritan' and 'The Crucifixion', are Bible stories transferred to Ceylon people and scenery. By 1935, all the murals were complete, with the centrepiece being a massive depiction of The Crucifixion - Christ as a dark-skinned, clean-shaven native of the land, raised on his cross above the dusky gloom of a sullen swarm of mangroves – the transformation was total; a symbol of Christian faith expressed to perfection in Lankan idiom; it has arguably never been as beautifully expressed since. Paynter found time during his years at Trinity to work on numerous portraits, many of which may be seen in the college library. He also lent his talent to the creation of many set designs for plays, some of which are still spoken of in awe close to a century later. ==Later life, works== Paynter gradually turned his hand to another branch of art - portraiture. Here he was very successful. To be painted by Paynter became the fashion of the day. His clients ranged the elite of Sri Lanka, to British Governors to the Prime Ministers of Sri Lanka. On invitation in 1954 he painted the official portrait of Jawaharlal Nehru, then Prime Minister of India, whose portrait hangs in the Prime Minister's residence in Delhi, and Mahatma Gandhi whose portrait is in the Law College in Colombo. Another aspect of Paynter's art was his presentation of male beauty in his male nudes and semi-nudes. Paynter's portrait of Sir John Kotelawala is in the Jayawardenapura Kotte Parliament; that of Sir Ivor Jennings in the Peradeniya University Campus; and another of Dr. R. L. Spittel entitled 'Surgeon in the Wilderness' in the possession of his daughter. When an exhibition of contemporary Christian art from all countries was held in Rome in 1951 to commemorate the Holy Year celebrations, Pope Pius XII is said to have asked for Paynter's work. In 1940 Paynter was appointed Director of the College of Fine Arts in Colombo, and served in that capacity for several years. During that period he was made a distinguished citizen and honoured with the Order of the British Empire.http://www.london- gazette.co.uk/issues/39107/supplements/44/page.pdf ==Last years== Apart from his painting, Paynter was also involved in the social service work of the Paynters Homes for orphan children in Nuwara Eliya, which was started by his father. David commenced the Salt Spring Farm at Kumburupiddi near Trincomalee, in 1962 to settle boys from Paynter's Homes, and moved there permanently to settle as a farmer. In 1968 took up his palette to complete his final masterpiece - the mural known as 'The Transfiguration' at the chapel of St Thomas' College, Mt. Lavinia. Paynter died of a heart attack on 7 June 1975 and was buried in the Union Church cemetery in Nuwara Eliya. ==References== Category:1900 births Category:1975 deaths Category:Sri Lankan people of English descent Category:LGBT artists from India Category:LGBT artists from Sri Lanka Category:Portrait painters Category:20th-century Sri Lankan painters Category:Burgher artists Category:Ceylonese Officers of the Order of the British Empire ","title":"David Paynter (artist)"},{"id":"35328377","text":"==Indian Languages== Languages spoken in Indian belong to several language families, the major ones being the Indo-Aryan languages spoken by 75% of Indians and the Dravidian languages spoken by 20% of Indians.

Indian Bible Translators (IBT) have translated and published the New Testament in the Paniya language(2016). Thambi Durai and Elizabeth are the translators in Paniya for Indian Bible Translators. Currently IBT is carrying out the translation of Old Testament in Paniya. Stephen Daniel translated the portions of the Bible into the Paniya language. Theyyam Mancheyaathaayina Kathe, the Translation of the New Testament in the Paniya language was pioneered and presented by Mathews Vergis to the Paniya tribe on 30 December 2008. The Paniyas have historically worked as agricultural laborers. People who natively speak Paniyas are mainly found in the borders of Kerala and Mysore, with a dwindling population of about approximately 120,000. Initially only the Gospel of Luke was translated and presented to the tribe. The Paniya language has no script of its own which is why Mathews Vergis used the Malayalam script to publish the Bible in their language. Jennu Kuruba Language Vasa Nyama, the Translation of the New Testament in the Jennu Kuruba language was published by Mathews Vergis to the Jennu Kuruba tribe on 10 September 2015. People of the Jennu Kuruba tribe are traditionally honey gatherers and are found in forests in Southern central India. Since the forests are getting slaughtered and synthetic honey is replacing natural honey, the tribe is decaying and the people are getting scattered. Initially only the Gospel of Mark was translated and presented to the tribe. Mathews Vergis completed and presented the entire New Testament because of the earnest and eagerness of the Jennu Kuruba people, though few in number. The Jennu Kuruba language has no script of its own and hence Mathews Vergis used the Kannada script to present the Bible in their language. This is the first piece of literature in print ever since the existence of this tribe. Benjara Navo Karar, the translation of the New Testament in the Benjara language of the Benjara ethnic tribe was published by Mathews Vergis on 12 August 2015. The people of the Benjara tribe migrated from Afghanistan and settled in Rajasthan, India long ago. They were salt merchants and suppliers of bullocks. Being nomadic in nature, they spread to different parts of India, namely Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra. In Karnataka they are known as Lambanis and in other places as Lambadis. Among these states, the state of Karnataka has about a million Lambanis – the highest in India. The Benjara language has no script and the people are familiar with the language of the home states. Thus Kannada script is used to present the Bible to the Lambanis to understand the Bible in their language. This is the first piece of literature to be printed in the Benjara language. Kulu Markana Nalla Shuddhi, the translation of the 'Gospel according to Mark' in the Kulu Language spoken by the ethnic Korama and Koracha tribes of South India, was pioneered by Mathews Vergis and was presented to the tribe on 28 December 2015. Though the language is spoken by around 200,000 of people belonging to the Koracha and Korama tribes, it failed to find a place in the dictionary of Indian tribal languages along with scores of other tribal languages recorded in the Census taken by the Government of India a decade and half ago. It was the request of the people of the Koracha and Korama tribes that propelled Mathews Vergis to pioneer the translation of the Gospel according to Mark into the Kulu language. Incidentally this is the first piece of literature in print ever since the existence of the Koracha and Korama tribes on earth. Tulu Parts of The New Testament were translated into the Tulu language of Karnataka in Kannada script in 1842 and the complete New Testament in 1847 by the Basel Missionaries in Mangalore. ==References== Category:Languages of India Category:Christianity in India India ","title":"Bible translations into the languages of India"},{"id":"35328387","text":"Ruyl 1629 Ruyl 1629 Cover Facsimile Reproduction Inside 1629 Matthew Translation Malaysian and Indonesian Bible translations have a lot of common history up until the modern era. Apart from the shared Malay language which historically was the lingua franca of the Malay archipelago and forms the basis for the national languages of Indonesia and Malaysia today, portions of the Bible have been translated into a variety of indigenous languages in the region. The translation of the Bible into the Malay language was one of the first extant translations of the Bible in an East Asian language. Albert Cornelius Ruyl, a Protestant first translated the Gospel of Matthew in 1612 into the Malay. This was followed by the translation of the Gospel of Mark in 1638. The full Canonical Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles was revised and published in 1651 by Justus Heurnius, the chaplain of Batavia. The main early Translators of the Bible into the Malay language were Melchior Leydekker, H. C. Klinkert, and W.G. Shellabear. Leydekker was appointed to the ministry of the Dutch churches at Batavia in 1678.Report of the British and foreign Bible society:11-13 p50 The 3 volume Leydekker translation in the Jawi script was published by J.

Today, there are more than 112 indigenous languages in use in Malaysia, while indigenous Indonesian languages consist of more than 701 languages. ==Malaysian languages== Malay (1612) After Malaya became independent in 1957, a radical transformation occurred in the use of Malay in Christian literature. The original thrust had been two-fold, to work amongst the Peranakan Chinese and the Malays. The former had no longer become dependent on Baba Malay literature as the younger generation started becoming more conversant in English while legal and social considerations had essentially halted evangelistic work amongst the Malays, especially in Malaya (and to a lesser extant in Singapore). The emphasis shifted from providing literature in the Malay language to one that would provide literature in the Malaysian language, a standardised form of Malay in Malaysia, for future generations who would be educated in the language. The Malay Language Committee of the British and Foreign Bible Society auxiliary in Singapore, the Bible Society of Malaya was phased out in the 1960s and was replaced by the National Language Committee. The Bible Society of Malaya was re-constituted as the independent Bible Society of Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei (BSSMB) in 1969 and continued the work of the originating Bible society. The first translation in Bahasa Malaysia was published in 1987 by the Bible Society of Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei as the Alkitab Berita Baik (). This was followed by a revision in 1996 by the Bible Society of Malaysia. A formal equivalence translation of the Bible was published in 2015 and is known as the Alkitab Versi Borneo ().

Each of these languages has at least two Bible versions published by the society: one formal equivalence translation (mainly used among conservative Protestants), and one dynamic equivalence translation (available with or without the deuterocanonical books). In addition to the Tagalog translation of Jose Abriol, the Catholic Church, through the Daughters of St. Paul, publishes Catholic Bibles in Kapampangan, Bicolano, and Waray. Moreover, derivative translations of the Christian Community Bible published by the Claretians are also available in Hiligaynon (Biblia sang Katilingban sang mga Kristiano) and Cebuano (Biblia sa Kristohanong Katilingban). The Jehovah's Witnesses also translate their Bible, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, into several regional languages such as Cebuano (2000 edition, 2019 revision); Hiligaynon (2007, 2014 edition); Iloko (2000 edition, 2018 revision); Pangasinan (2009, 2015 edition); Bicol (2016 edition); and Waray-Waray (2012, 2019 edition).

This was the first book published in Manx, and is often styled the Manx Catechism. It was followed in 1733, by A Further Instruction and A Short and Plain Instruction for the Lord's Supper. The Gospel of St. Matthew was translated with the help of his vicars-general in 1722, and published in 1748 under the sponsorship of Wilson's successor as bishop, Mark Hildesley (1755-1772). The remaining Gospels and the Acts were also translated into Manx under his supervision, but not published. ==The Manx Bible== The Bible was translated into Manx by a committee of clergy from the Isle of Man under the direction of Bishop Mark Hildesley.Language death in the Isle of Man George Broderick, Carl Johan Sverdrup Marstrander, George Broderick - 1999 \\"However, it is due to his successor Bishop Mark Hildesley (1755-1772), also an Englishman, that we owe the main drive to having the full Bible translated into Manx and published 1763-73.\\" The New Testament appeared in 1767, and the Old Testament (including 2 books of the Apocrypha) in 1772 and the whole Bible as one volume in 1775.Spelling and Society: The Culture and Politics of Orthography Page 65 Mark Sebba - 2007 \\".. after the appearance of the Bible in Manx, it was possible for 'masters of families, and others, who are well disposed, [to] read to the ignorant and illiterate the Sacred Oracles in their own language' (Butler 1799: 227).\\" Of 20,000 people in the Isle of Man, few in Hildesley's day knew English. A Manx translation of the New Testament had been begun by his predecessor Thomas Wilson Hildesley himself learned Manx well enough to conduct the church services in it, but not perfectly. John Kelly made for him a grammar and dictionary. At first, with the support of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, Hildesley printed the New Testament and the Book of Common Prayer, translated, under his direction, by the clergy of the diocese, as well as the Christian Monitor, John Lewis's Exposition of the Catechism, and Bishop Wilson's Form of Prayer for the use of the herring fishermen. With further assistance, around 1766, Hildesley made arrangements for the translation of the Old Testament, dividing it into 24 parts. The names of the translators are given in Weeden Butler's Life of Bishop Hildesley.Weeden Butler, Life of Bishop Hildesley pp. 252–6) The work was given for final revision to Philip Moore and John Kelly. The first volume of the translation was completed on 2 July 1771; the second volume was ready for the press on 6 April 1772; and all was finished and transcribed in December of the same year, at the time of the bishop's death. The work was printed at Whitehaven under the title of: . It was published in 1773. The second edition of the Manx scriptures was published as one volume at Whitehaven in 1775. ==Bible Society editions== The British and Foreign Bible Society edited the Manx Bible to produce an edition in 1819. An edition of the Manx New Testament was produced in 1810 which included footnotes. This was reprinted in 1815 and 1824. The Bible Society last printed any of the Manx Bible on paper when it produced the Gospel of John (Noo Ean) in 1936, which was a reproduction of the 1819 edition. This was reprinted in 1968 by the Manx Gaelic Society. In 1973 the Bible Society produced a booklet and exhibition to mark 200 years of the completion of the Manx Bible.

In the late 1980s, Miao Christian leaders decided to finish Pollard's work and translate the Old Testament. After discussion with the Yunnan Christian Council and the Three- Self Patriotic Movement, semi-official organizations, a translation team was formed in Kunming. One question was whether to continue to use the Pollard script, which was familiar to Christians from their reading of older materials, or to use the new script promulgated by the government in 1956. In the end, a modified version of the old script was used. Since Pollard's Miao characters are not included in Unicode, standard computer word processing programs could not handle the text. Consultants from among the missionaries created keyboard shortcuts, but their unique characters could not be copied or the text checked.

Construction started in September 2020 and should be complete by 2024. ==History== Initial plan In 2005 SSE and Shetland Islands Council (via development company Viking Energy.) signed a memorandum of understanding to combine independent proposals for 300 MW wind farms on mainland Shetland and jointly develop a large scale (600 MW) wind farm. The companies formalised the agreement in January 2007.Sources: * * In 2009 the developers submitted a planning application for 150 turbines (estimated 600 MW capacity) on the main island of Shetland. In 2010 the plan was reduced in scope, with the number of turbines reduced to 127; the turbines were to be 3.6 MW machines with hub height of and blade tip height of . The scope area of the wind farm was , of which only would be permanently built upon, additionally the plan required construction of approximately 104 km of access roads, and the quarrying of of rock, and the disturbance of between 650 and 900,000 cubic metres of peat. The development was dependent on the Shetland HVDC Connection being built connecting Shetland to the UK mainland's national grid. The cost of the connector was estimated at £300 million in late 2011; Viking Energy would be liable for 10% or less of the cost, other energy producing projects in Shetland, such as Aegir wave farm, were also dependent on the grid connector being built. The scheme proved contentious with both significant opposition and support, receiving 2,772 formal objections and 1,115 in support, as well as objections from RSPB Scotland; in part due to concerns on its impact on the rare Whimbrel. Approval and legal challenges The converter station at Kergord for the HVDC link to the Scottish mainland reached an initial stage of planning consent in early 2011, after several previous attempts starting 2009. In April 2012 the Scottish Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism, Fergus Ewing, granted planning permission for a 103 wind turbine development, withholding consent on 24 turbines in Delting Parish due to potential interference with equipment at Scatsta Airport, and limiting maximum height to . The reduced development had an estimated capacity of up to 370 MW. The income from the development to shareholder Shetland Islands Trust was estimated at £20 million pa and the capital cost of the development was estimated at £556 million.Sources: * * * In September 2013 a ruling on an objection from Sustainable Shetland to the development held that the consent given under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 was incompetent because Viking Energy did not hold a license under the 1989 Act, and that the Scottish Ministers had failed to have proper regard to their obligations under the Birds Directive [2009/147/EC] to the protected Whimbrel species. In October 2013 the Scottish Government signalled its intention to appeal the decision. In July 2014 appeal judges at Edinburgh's Court of Session announced that there was insufficient reason to stop the wind farm and gave the project the go-ahead. Sustainable Shetland appealed the decision at the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom but lost the appeal in February 2015. They were also refused leave to appeal to the European Court of Justice. Viking applied to get electricity price subsidies under the UK government's low carbon \\"Contracts for Difference\\" programme. Due to the slow progress of Viking's application two of their four staff were made redundant in 2017. A 370 MW wind farm received planning permission in 2012, but an objection by Sustainable Shetland was successful in Sep 2013 on the grounds of inadequate assessment of impact on the Whimbrel bird, and on licensing regulations relating to the 1989 Electricity Act. This decision was subsequently overturned by two higher courts in 2014 and 2015. Recent history In 2019, Viking Energy was unsuccessful in winning a CfD contract in the government auction held in September 2019, making the future of the windfarm uncertain. The wind farm depends on the construction of the Shetland HVDC Connection. In April 2020, Ofgem approved revised proposals for that project, subject to 'evidence that the Shetland Viking Wind Farm project will go ahead'. On 17 June 2020, the project sponsor, SSE Renewables, made a final investment decision to proceed with the Viking Wind Farm investment, conditional on certain industry code modifications, and \\"the outcome of the consultation on Ofgem’s minded-to position to approve the transmission link, expected in July 2020\\". According to Shetland News, this means that both the Windfarm and the HVDC Connection \\"are likely to go ahead\\". Construction started in September 2020 and the farm is due to be operational by 2024. ==Design== If constructed, turbines would be erected in Kergord, North Nesting, and South Nesting.BMT Cordah Ltd, \\"Non- technical summary\\", Why the proposed wind farm design was changed, pp.1-2; Fig. NTS A1 (end) Original proposals included 24 turbines in the Delting area (refused 2012 consent.) and 23 turbines in the Collafirth area (removed from application.BMT Cordah Ltd, \\"Non-technical summary\\", \\"Turbines\\", p.3) Estimated construction time for the 127 turbine farm was 5 years.BMT Cordah Ltd, \\"Non-technical summary\\", Construction programme, p.6 The wind farm was expected to have a high utilisation rate, smaller wind turbines on the island having attained high capacity factors of over 50%. ==Controversy== A number of locals are against the turbines considering them an Eyesore whilst others say that they are utilising the mass land of shetland to build the farm ==Objections== Initially proposed as a 150 turbine 600 MW project in 2009, the scheme had significant opposition, on grounds including effects on wildlife, and the general environment; part of the wind farm was also removed because of a potential interference with equipment at Scatsta Airport. ==NotesReferences== Sources * ==External links== * **, documentation **, map of 2010 application wind turbine placement Category:Wind farms in Scotland Category:Energy in Shetland Category:Proposed buildings and structures in Scotland Category:Mainland, Shetland ","title":"Viking Wind Farm"},{"id":"35328482","text":"== Early Translation Work == The New Testament was first published in the Pashto language in 1818 in Serampore - North India.

Through this work, they gradually developed more practice and ideas about design, and began to be hired to create interior spaces. ==Career== They initially managed the renovation of run-down properties in Manhattan, in order to sell them at a profit. As they got more involved in the design aspect of renovations, they began to develop some characteristics: the use of distinctive architectural details, unique interior finishes, and staging with rare collectibles found while travelling to flea markets around the world. They are known for their distinctive style, which mixes vintage/modern high/low pieces. One of their featured projects is 5 Centre Market Place. It was converted from a former gun shop and is located on the edge of Soho. The couple renovated and designed two properties on Thompson Street in Soho as well. Their design firm is called Sixx Design. In the fall of 2014, they moved to Los Angeles. They bought and renovated a home in the Hollywood Hills. The Novogratzes design private residences for A-list clients, and also boutique hotels. They designed Hotel Dylan, LULU's at the W Hoboken, Bungalow Hotel, and Timber Cove. The Novogratzes recently completed a children's space at Ten Thousand, a luxury apartment building in Beverly Hills, California. They are working on a 250-unit condominium in East Boston, Massachusetts.

Samuel Holden Parsons (1737–1789). Rev. Jonathan Parsons (1705–1776) was his great-grandfather. On May 14, 1826, he married Emeline Bulkeley (1798–1855), daughter of Captain Charles and Eunice (Robbins) Bulkeley of Rocky Hill, Connecticut. They had five children: Charles Samuel (1827–1910), William Brenton (1829–1856), Josephine Emeline (1830–1857), Theodore Parsons (1835–1910), and Richard Henry (1839–1872). Declining the opportunity to attend his father's alma mater (Yale), Hall operated business firms in Middletown and Rocky Hill in partnership with his brother, William Brenton Hall (1798–1824). In 1833, he and his family moved to Buffalo—but the climate proving insalubrious, in 1837, he moved to Binghamton, a growing town at the junction of the Chenango and Susquehanna rivers (and a way station on the Chenango Canal, a branch of the Erie). Hall served as trustee and president of the village of Binghamton. In 1846, he was elected as a Whig member of the New York State Senate from 1847 to 1849, sitting in the 70th (6th D.), 71st and 72nd New York State Legislatures (both 23rd D.). With the election of Millard Fillmore to the U.S. presidency, Hall's cousin, Nathan Kelsey Hall was named U.S. Postmaster General. Through this connection, he became a member of the board of directors of the Erie Railroad. Following the death of his first wife, Hall he married her cousin, Elnora Robbins (b. 1812) in 1857. Samuel Holden Parsons Hall died in Binghamton on March 5, 1877 and was buried in Spring Forest Cemetery in that city. Hall's eldest son, Charles Samuel, received a B.A. from Yale College in 1848 and an M.A. and L.L.B. from the Yale Law School in 1850. He became a prominent attorney in Binghamton and a nationally-known genealogist. His brother, Theodore Parsons Hall, graduated from Yale in 1856 and became a leading business man in Detroit, where he married into one of the old French-Canadian families. He too became a well- known genealogist and author of books on local history. ==Sources== Theodore Parsons Hall. Genealogical Notes Relating to the Families of Hon. Lyman Hall of Georgia, Hon.

There are two distinct varieties or dialects of Lawa, considered to be separate languages; their names in the Ethnologue are Eastern Lawa and Western Lawa. They are spoken in Lawa villages in the provinces of Mae Hong Son and Chiang Mai in Northern Thailand. Linguistically, Lawa belongs to the Palaungic branch of the Mon- Khmer family of languages, which is part of the Austro-Asiatic super-family.M. Paul Lewis Eastern Lawa is distinct from Western Lawa despite being highly cognate because the two languages are not mutually understandable based on consistent testimonies of Eastern and Western Lawa speakers and testing by SIL.Nahhas, Dr. Ramzi W. 2007. Sociolinguistic survey of Lawa in Thailand. Chiang Mai: Payap University. There are two distinct dialects spoken among the Eastern Lawa. These dialects have differences in pronunciation and some lexeme differences. The differences, however, do not present any difficulty in comprehension between speakers of these dialects, due to their close interaction. The main dialect is from Bo Luang, (known locally as juang ra), which is by far the largest Eastern Lawa village, with a population of approximately 3,000 people. Bo Luang is spoken in 16 villages of Bo Luang and Bo Sali subdistricts in Hot District, Chiang Mai Province. The other dialect is from Bo Sangae, (known locally as juang tiang). Eastern Lawa has a high level of language vitality and is spoken in the home by all ages. Government education, village notices and official business are usually undertaken in Central Thai. Most Eastern Lawa are bi-lingual with at least Northern Thai, although there are some older people who will reply in Lawa when spoken to in Northern Thai. The younger generation tend to be fluent in Central Thai because of the education system and mostly fluent in Northern Thai due to the inter-marriages between Lawa and Northern Thais. ==See also== *Wa language ==References== *Blok, Gregory Robert. 2013.

This was translated in 1685 by Louis Laneau of the Paris Foreign Missions Society.E. W.Hutchinson, \\"The Earliest Translation of the Gospel.\\" Journal of the Siam Society 28 (1935): 197-99. The first Protestant effort at Thai Bible translation was a translation of the Gospel of Matthew by Ann Judson.Alex G. Smith, \\"Siamese Gold, A History of Church Growth in Thailand: An Interpretive Analysis 1816-1982\\" (Kanok Bannasan (OMF Publishers): Bangkok, 1981), 12-13. Karl Gützlaff and Jacob Tomlin, who are regarded as the first two resident Protestant missionaries in Thailand, translated the four Gospels and Romans from Chinese into Thai. They were assisted by a Chinese man and a Burmese man, both of whom spoke Thai.Alex G. Smith, \\"Siamese Gold, A History of Church Growth in Thailand: An Interpretive Analysis 1816-1982\\" (Kanok Bannasan (OMF Publishers): Bangkok, 1981), 14-15. John Taylor Jones, an ABMU missionary, translated the New Testament from Greek into the Thai language. Part of the Bible in Thai was first published in 1834. Jones' translation of the New Testament in Thai was printed for the first time in 1846.Baptist Missionary Magazine, vol. 26 (Boston: Baptist General Convention, 1846), 54. The translation of the Old Testament was finished in 1883 and the Bible with the complete Protestant canon in Thai was published as a single volume for the first time in 1894. This edition of the Bible was later revised by the Thailand Bible Society using the King James Version (KJV) as the base text and published as the Thai Standard Version in 1940. This translation was subsequently revised using the Revised Standard Version (RSV) and Authorized Standard Version (ASV) as the base text and republished in 1971. Jehovah's Witnesses released the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures for the first time in Thai by 2007. This Christian Greek Scriptures is based from the English 1984 edition of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures which was released in 1984 in United States. Few years later, in 2015, a complete Bible with Hebrew Scriptures and revised Christian Greek Scriptures was released in Thai with a new name called: คัมภีร์ไบเบิลฉบับแปลโลกใหม่ (New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures). The Bible is based from the English 2013 revision of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures which was released in 2013 in Jersey City, New Jersey, U.S.A. This newly revised edition includes the use of more modern and understandable language (comparison above), clarified Biblical expression, appendixes, and many more. ==Other Language Bibles in Thailand== In addition to the Thai Bible, several other language Bible translations are used in Thailand, especially among ethnic minorities. These include Chinese, Lao, Burmese, Cambodian, Malay, Karen, Akha, Hmong, Lahu, Lawa, and Shan. ==References * Thailand Bible Society Page * Thai Bible King James Version * A Brief Survey of Thai Bible Translations by Karl Dahlfred. * Thai Bible Translations - Peter Passchier's most comprehensive survey, inspired by Dahlfred's page. *คัมภีร์ไบเบิลฉบับแปลโลกใหม่ - New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures Category:Thai language Category:Christianity in Thailand Thai ","title":"Bible translations into Thai"},{"id":"35328692","text":"The first portion of the Bible, the Gospel of John, in a Tibetic language was translated by Moravian Church missionaries William Heyde, Edward Pagel, and Heinrich August Jäschke, and later Dr. August Francke. It was printed in 1862 at Kyelang capital of Lahul in Kashmir. The whole New Testament was printed in 1885 in Ladakh. Another version was translated in 1903. So as not to have the problem of various dialectal differences it was translated into classical Tibetan, but this was not understood by most people. Yoseb Gergen (aka Sonam Gergen), a Tibetan Christian translated the entire Bible, complete in 1935. This version was translated into a dialect of Tibetan Gergen had accidentally stumbled across, and which was understandable by all Tibetans. It was finally published in 1948.God Spoke Tibetan, by Alan Maberly, http://www.nwtv.co.uk/pages/arts/books/books/tibet/chap01.htm This is known in India as the Tibetan OV Bible.(Tibetan Edition) (9788122115451) Eliya Tsetan Phuntshog published a New Testament in 1970. There is currently a project going on to translate the Bible into the East Tibetan dialect.http://www.gsungrab.org/ Central Tibetan Bible Website == Dialectal Variation and Register == Western Tibetan languages Recent research has shown there are approximately 50 Tibetan languages and over 200 varieties of Tibetan.Nicolas Tournadre, 2014 \\"The Tibetic Languages and their classification\\" In Nathan W. HIll and Thomas Owen-Smith (eds.) Trans-Himalayan Linguistics, Historical and descriptive Linguistics of the Himalayan area, 105-129. Mouton de Gruyter The complex task of translating the Scriptures into the different varieties of Tibetan is made more difficult by the need to choose between different linguistic registers. These are: the high literary register (the language used for the Tibetan Buddhist scriptures, also known as ); the mid literary register (a mixture of high literary and some known common spoken and non-spoken words); and one of many varieties of the low register (the vernacular/spoken language), which are specific to particular regions. There are advantages and disadvantages of translating into each different register. A translation into one of the varieties of the low register will be easily understood in one specific region but its geographical reach will be limited,Heinrich August Jaeschke: Pioneer Tibetan Scholar, by John Bray, The Tibet Journal, Vol. 8, No. 1 (Spring 1983), pp. 50-55, Published by: Library of Tibetan Works and Archives and it will be seen as less prestigious than the high and mid registers. Mid Literary is more difficult to understand than the spoken language but has a wider geographical reach. The high literary register can reach even further geographically but it requires people first to learn a literary language in order to understand what is written in it. == History of translations into Mid and High Literary registers == The Moravian missionary H. A. Jäschke (1817–1883) spent three months in Ladakh in 1857, and subsequently worked in Keylong (Lahul) until 1868. He studied the spoken languages of the region. However, he decided to translate the New Testament into Classical Tibetan, drawing on the assistance and advice of speakers and scholars of different forms of Tibetan in both the Western Himalayan region and Darjeeling. He hoped that his choice of language would ensure that the written text would be widely understood across Tibet and the Himalayan border regions. Jäschke’s successor F. A. Redslob (1838–1891) completed the translation of the New Testament in 1885. Between 1898 and 1902, a committee chaired by another Moravian missionary A. W. Heyde (1825–1907) prepared a revised version of the Tibetan New Testament under the sponsorship of the British and Foreign Bible Society. Later, Dr A. H. Francke (1870–1930) and his Ladakhi colleague Yoseb Gergan (1878–1946) translated the Old Testament into Classical Tibetan. The draft translation of the Old Testament was completed by 1935, but the full Tibetan Bible was not published until 1948. In 1959, Eliyah Tsetan Phuntsog (son-in-law of Yoseb Gergan) started to revise the New Testament with Pierre Vittoz (a Swiss missionary). They translated it into a Mid Literary register, hoping that this would be accessible to the various Tibetan-speaking peoples in both India and Tibet. This version was published in 1970. However, most of the Ladakhis who were not trained in the Literary register found all these versions difficult to understand. In 2011, a Tibetan Old Testament (TOT11) was completed, attributed to the Nepal Bible Society. A translation of the New Testament into modern \\"low literary\\" Tibetan, often called the Central Tibetan Bible (CTB), and released in 2018 under the subheading (Wylie: ) \\"Radiant Light to the Ends of the Earth\\", and printed by Central Asia Publishing, as well as being available digitally. The rights to the Bible are held by the Wycliffe Bible Translators. In 2019, a translation of the New Testament was released as the New Tibetan Bible (NTB) in a form of literary Tibetan, available digitally. Rights to this are also held by the Wycliffe Bible Translators. ==Translations into Ladakhi== Ladakhi is a language spoken in India in regions bordering both China and Pakistan; its neighbouring languages are Purik, Balti, Zanskari, Nubra, and the more divergent Changthang (see map). All these languages are part of the Western Tibetan language groupingBettina Zeisler, 2007 \\"On the position of Ladakhi and Balti in the Tibetan language family\\" In: John Bray and Nawang Tsering Shakspo (eds.) Recent research on Ladakh 2007. Leh: J & K Academy for Art, Culture & Science, International Association for Ladakh Studies: 27-33. and quite distinct from the Central, Amdo and Khams Tibetan spoken varieties. Alongside his main Tibetan translation work, Jäschke translated the Harmony of the Gospels, a selection of texts used by the Moravian church in Easter Week, into vernacular Ladakhi. He noticed that the Ladakhi Christians were more attentive when listening to the Harmony, than they were when they heard texts written in the High Register of Classical Tibetan. Like Jäschke, Francke put his main efforts into Bible translation into literary Tibetan. However, he also emphasised the need to translate at least some portions of the Bible into the spoken languages of the region.Francke, A.H. 1910. “Die Sprachenfrage in der west-tibetischen Mission der Brüdergemeine.” Allgemeine Missions-Zeitschrift 37, pp. 412-420; pp. 448-454. Berlin. In 1907, he printed a revised version of Jäschke’s Harmony. He also prepared a Ladakhi Life of Christ, and in 1908, he published a Ladakhi version of Mark's Gospel. Yoseb Gergan produced a revised version of the Ladakhi St Mark, and this was published at Lahore in 1919. These early vernacular translations adapted the classical literary spelling system rather than using a phonetic transcription of spoken Ladakhi. In the early 1950s, E. T. Phuntsog experimented with a greatly simplified spelling system for writing Ladakhi. John Bray \\"Towards a Tibetan Christianity? The Lives of Joseph Gergan and Eliyah Tsetan Phuntsog. In Tibetan Studies Vol. 1, pp 68-80, Edited by Per Kvaerne. Oslo: Institute for Comparative Research in Human Culture, 1994 However, he ran into opposition from a segment of the Ladakhi community who wanted to preserve the classical spelling system of the Buddhist Scriptures. Phuntsog translated excerpts from the Gospels of St Mark and St Luke using this script. However, his proposals were never accepted outside the small Christian community, and he was forced to put them on one side. Today there is an ongoing project to translate the complete Bible into the low register of spoken Ladakhi (Zhung/Leh dialect) using a more phonemic spelling structure. Currently the New Testament and Genesis 1-16 have been completed. ==References== Category:Tibetan language Category:Christianity in China Tibetan Category:Religion in Tibet ","title":"Bible translations into Tibetan"},{"id":"35328697","text":"Club Deportivo y Social Colo-Colo B, usually called Colo-Colo B, is a Chilean football team from Santiago.

The Flat was theatrically released in Germany in June 2012. The German version of the film features the voice of renowned German actor Axel Milberg taking on the role of narrator Arnon Goldfinger. The Flat was theatrically released in USA in October 2012 and was theatrically released in Hungary in April 2015. The film won the 2012 Best Editing in a Documentary Feature Award in the Tribeca Film Festival World Documentary Competition.

His grandmother lived in the same apartment for 70 years, ever since she and her husband, Kurt, left Nazi Germany in the 1930's and immigrated to Mandatory Palestine. It is not long, however, before Goldfinger finds various items in his grandmother's house that reveal an astonishing chapter in the family's history – a chapter that had been kept under wraps for decades.When to tell, how to tell, whether to tell, Nirit Anderman, 5 September 2011 Haaretz Goldfinger gradually discovers that his grandparents had a close personal relationship with a high Nazi official, Leopold von Mildenstein, head of the SS Office for Jewish Affairs (prior to Adolf Eichmann). Mildenstein traveled to Palestine accompanied by the Tuchlers in 1930, and wrote few sympathetic reports of its Jewish communitiy, in the sheer Nazi 'Der Angriff' (foonded by Joseph Goebbels).

By chance Goldfinger met cinematographer Talya (Tulik) Galon, who lives not far from his grandmother's flat, and told her about the flat. She helped with the cinematography (Philip Bellaiche entered the production later on). They filmed the family rummaging through closets, the items with their old-fashioned European flavor that were pulled out one after another – and the dozens of garbage bags that filled up quickly. But Goldfinger and the others did not know exactly what they were looking for. And then it happened: Suddenly among the cartons of gloves and shoes, the fox furs and the purses, the books and the boxes with letters – a pile of old German newspapers appeared. Goldfinger did not imagine that this would be the first clue that would lead him on an emotional journey that would be both upsetting and confusing, and that would reveal a family history that for years had been repressed and hidden. At that point the research broadened and new characters emerged, unexpected ones. The crew expanded until the point that the film became a German-Israeli coproduction with Zero One Film coming on board as co-producers. Goldfinger worked for five years till finishing the film that is being supported by New Israeli Foundation for Cinema and Television, , Medienboard Berlin- Brandenburg, Deutscher Filmförderfonds with ARTE, ZDF, SWR, Noga Communications- Channel 8. ==Reception== Critical reception The Flat had its premiere at the Jerusalem Film Festival in July 2011.

The full 150 Metrical Psalms called Sailm Dhaibhidh were first published in full in 1694. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland produced a revised edition in 1826, which is basically the same text which is still used today. The Metrical Psalms of all 150 Hebrew Psalms are often printed at the back of the Bible along with some 67 Paraphrases called Laoidhean o na Sgrioptuiribh Naomha and some 5 Spiritual Songs called Dana Spioradail. This was last printed as a separate edition by the Scottish Bible Society in 1987. == First Bible Society editions == In 1801 the Gaelic Bible was printed by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK). The Gaelic Bible was first printed by the Bible Society in 1807 when the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) printed a corrected edition of the SPCK text. In 1826 a revision of the Bible was made by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and was printed with the Metrical Psalms Sailm Dhaibhidh by SPCK and BFBS. From 1872 the text was maintained by the National Bible Society of Scotland (NBSS) in Edinburgh, instead of by the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS). == Other translations == In the 1830s a Roman Catholic translation of the New Testament was made from the Latin Vulgate by Ewen MacEachen and published in Aberdeen in 1875. In 1860 the Apocrypha was translated by Alister Macgregor, a minister from Inverness. == 1902 edition == In 1880 the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SSPCK) formed a commission to revise the Gaelic Bible. This consisted of both the Established and Free Churches. The commission under the chairmanship of Norman Macleod, included the following well-known Gaelic scholars: - A. Clerk, T. McLauchlan, and N. Dewar, Andrew D. Mackenzie, Robert Blair, John Maclean, Alexander Nicolson, and Donald Mackinnon. By the time the New Testament was completed the affairs of the SSPCK came under the investigation of a Royal Commission, and the work of revision was suspended, to be resumed some 13 years later in 1896. Meanwhile, four of the revisers had died, and the Old Testament was completed by N. Macleod, R. Blair, J. Maclean, and N. Dewar. The result amounts to a fresh translation of the Bible, preserving as far as possible the diction and idiom of the Bible of 1826. In 1902 the new revision of the Bible was adopted by the National Bible Society of Scotland, (now called the Scottish Bible Society). ==Today's Gaelic version== In 1980 the Bible Society produced An Deagh Sgeul aig Marcus which was the Gospel of Mark in Today's Gaelic Version (TGV). It was translated by Kenneth McDonald, Donald Meek, Donald Gillies and Roderick MacLeod. In 1986 the Bible Society produced Facal as a' Phriosan which was a translation of Paul's Letters from Prison to the Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians and Philemon. It was translated by Kenneth MacDonald, Calum Matheson and Donald Meek. ==Recent Bible Society editions== In 1992 a new edition of the Bible was printed by the Scottish Bible Society Comann-Bhìoball Dùthchail na h-Alba. This was an orthographic revision of the 1902 Bible by Donald Meek, and also included an updated edition of the Metrical Psalms. In 2000 another edition of the Bible was produced which included an orthographic revision of the 1826 Metrical Psalms. In 2002 a diglot New Testament was published by the Scottish Bible Society of the 2000 edition of the Gaelic New Testament and the English New King James Version.https://www.eden.co.uk/shop/gaelic_english_new_testament__blue__vinyl__an_tiomnadh_nuadh_2470.html ==New translation== In 2009 a new Gaelic translation of the New Testament was started by the Scottish Bible Society called Eadar-theangachadh Ùr http://jeltzz.blogspot.co.uk/2009/03/is-new-scottish-gaelic-bible.html The aim is to translated the Bible into modern everyday Scots Gaelic.

Initially successful, the company expanded to New South Wales by absorbing the Sydney and Country Bank Limited in 1882. Banknotes were issued at branches in Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide. The headquarters was in a modest building on the corner of Elizabeth and Collins Street in Melbourne. The managing director was James Munro, a politician, who had been Premier of Victoria in 1890-1892, who was also a businessman and President on the Federal Building Society, established about the same time. Both institutions principally invested in speculative land companies, which boomed in the 1880s as the economy expanded and property prices climbed to a frenzied peak in about 1890. The boom was followed by a crash as property prices declined, which led to the collapse of building societies burdened by unsustainable debts, and the uncertainty soon spread to banks. A run by depositors in late 1892 forced the Federal to close their doors 'temporarily' on 30 January 1893. The doors never reopened, and the Federal was to become the first bank, as opposed to building society, to fail as part of the Australian banking crisis of 1893. A provisional liquidator was appointed on the 3 February 1893. The extent of the banks debts, especially to English banks, was soon revealed. James Munro, already in debt (much to his own companies), had resigned as Premier in early 1892, and left for the UK, but returned voluntarily, where he was declared bankrupt in February 1893, with personal debts of ₤97,000, and his companies owing over ₤600,000. ==References== Category:Banks established in 1881 Category:Banks disestablished in 1893 Category:Australian companies established in 1881 Category:Defunct banks of Australia ","title":"Federal Bank of Australia"},{"id":"35328973","text":"Due to the convenience, affordability, and broad reach of social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, terrorist groups and individuals have increasingly used social media to further their goals, recruit members, and spread their message.

ISIS uses social media to their advantage when releasing threatening videos of beheadings. ISIS uses this tactic to scare normal people on social media. Similarly, Western domestic terrorists also use social media and technology to spread their ideas. ==Traditional media== Many authors have proposed that media attention increases perceptions of risk of fear of terrorism and crime and relates to how much attention the person pays to the news.Nellis and Savage (2012) The relationship between terrorism and the media has long been noted. Terrorist organizations depend on the open media systems of democratic countries to further their goals and spread their messages. To garner publicity for their cause, terrorist organizations resort to acts of violence and aggression that deliberately target civilians. This method has proven to be effective in gathering attention: > It cannot be denied that although terrorism has proved remarkably > ineffective as the major weapon for taking down governments and capturing > political power, it has been a remarkably successful means of publicizing a > political cause and relaying the terrorist threat to a wider audience, > particularly in the open and pluralistic countries of the West. When one > says 'terrorism' in a democratic society, one also says 'media'. While a media organization may not support the goals of terrorist organizations, it is their job to report current events and issues. In the fiercely competitive media environment, when a terrorist attack occurs, media outlets scramble to cover the event. In doing so the media help to further the message of terrorist organizations: > To summarise briefly on the symbiotic nature of the relationship between > terrorists and the media, the recent history of terrorism in many democratic > countries vividly demonstrates that terrorists do thrive on the oxygen of > publicity, and it is foolish to deny this. This does not mean that the > established democratic media share the values of the terrorists. It does > demonstrate, however, that the free media in an open society are > particularly vulnerable to exploitation and manipulation by ruthless > terrorist organisations. One notable example of the relationship between terror groups and the media was the release of the Osama bin Laden audio and video recordings. These tapes were sent directly to mainstream Arabic television networks, including Al- Jazeera. Media can often be the source of discontent for terrorist groups. Irene Kahn says, > New seeds of social discord and insecurity are sprouting between citizens > and noncitizens. Racism and xenophobia are latent in all societies, but in > some European countries they feature blatantly as some politicians exploit > people's fears and prejudices for short-term electoral gains.

Retrieved from > https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0c1d.15 Most terrorist groups use social media as a means to bypass the traditional media and spread their propaganda. ==Media surveillance== The network described in Michel Foucault's theory of surveillance, panopticism, is a networks of power where all parties are transfixed by the actions of the others in the network. It is especially imperative when major events in the world occur, which is usually the case with terrorism. This model can be transposed on the network of power that media-outlet consumers and producers enter. In a network of power that includes consumers and producers, both parties have fixed gazes' on each other. The consumers transfix their gazes' on the stories that media outlets produce. And, the needs of the consumers, which is in this case their need to be updated regularly, becomes the producers gaze. The producers or media outlets are in competition with other media outlets to supply their constituents with the most up-to-date information. This network of fixed gazes' is both \\"privileged and imperative\\" for the system to satisfy the status quo. Consumers looks to media outlets to provide news on terrorism. If consumers believe terrorism is a threat to their safety, they want to be informed of the threats against them. Media outlets fulfill their viewers' needs, and portray terrorism as a threat because of the cycle that surveillance engenders. As terrorism flourishes as a prominent discourse of fear, consumers want information faster because they feel their safe being is in peril. The idea of total surveillance, as prescribed by Foucault, becomes a cycle where the disruption of power causes scrutiny by various players in system. If the media-outlets are not constantly looking for stories that fulfill consumer needs, then they are scrutinized. In addition to the surveillance aspect of news dissemination, therein is the notion that \\"needs\\" drive the network of power: both the media outlets and consumers have needs that are fulfilled by broadcasting the news. It is this idea expressed in the uses and gratifications theory. It stipulates that the active audience and the terrorist \\"seek to satisfy their various needs\\" through media transmission. While media outlets know the stories they show have astounding effects on the political and sociological perspective in society, the impetus on economic gains is of greater importance. ==Use of social media== In a study by Gabriel Weimann from the University of Haifa, Weimann found that nearly 90% of organized terrorism activities on the internet takes place via social media. According to Weimann, terror groups use social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and internet forums to spread their messages, recruit members and gather intelligence. Terror groups take to social media because social media tools are cheap and accessible, facilitate quick, broad dissemination of messages, and allow for unfettered communication with an audience without the filter or \\"selectivity\\" of mainstream news outlets. Also, social media platforms allow terror groups to engage with their networks. Whereas previously terror groups would release messages via intermediaries, social media platforms allow terror groups to release messages directly to their intended audience and converse with their audience in real time: Weimann also mentions in \\"Theater of Terror\\", that terrorists use the media to promote the theatrical like nature of the premeditated terror. > HSMPress is using Twitter the way social media experts have always advised- > not just broadcasting, but engaging in conversation.

Terror groups using social media Al-Qaeda has been noted as being one of the terror groups that uses social media the most extensively. Brian Jenkins, senior advisor for the Rand Corporation, commented on Al-Qaeda's dominant presence on the web: > While almost all terrorist organizations have websites, al Qaeda is the > first to fully exploit the internet. This reflects al Qaeda's unique > characteristics. It regards itself as a global movement and therefore > depends on a global communications network to reach its perceived > constituents.

The number of > websites devoted to the al Qaeda-inspired movement has grown from a handful > to reportedly thousands, although many of these are ephemeral. According to Rob Wainwright, author of \\"Fighting Crime and Terrorism in the Age of Technology,\\" in order for ISIS to spread its message, they have utilized more than one hundred sites. This shows how vastly social media is used by terrorist groups. Known terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, also translated to ISIS, uses the widespread of news over social media to their advantage when releasing threatening videos of beheadings. As of November 16, 2014, following the beheading of former U.S. Army Ranger Peter Kassig, there have now been five recorded executions of Westerners taken captive in Syria. James Foley, David Cawthorne Haines, Alan Henning, and Steven Sotloff are also among the men kidnapped and executed by ISIS. The videos of the brutal beheadings are both posted online by ISIS, where they can be viewed by anyone using their own discretion, and sent to government officials as threats. Posting the executions online gives the terrorist groups the power to manipulate viewers and cause havoc among the population viewing them, and the videos have the ability to instill fear within the Western world. The videos are typically high production quality and generally show the entirety of the gruesome act, with the hostage speaking a few words before they are killed on camera. In the case of U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig, his video did not show the actual beheading act and he did not speak any final words before the execution. His silence and the fact that the actual execution was not included in the video raised question about his video was different than the rest.http://time.com/3587620/isis-us-aid-worker-peter- kassig/?xid=time_readnext In response to Kassig's beheading, his family expressed their wish that news media avoid doing what the group wants by refraining from publishing or distributing the video. By refusing to circulate the video of the beheading, it therefore loses the ability to manipulate Americans or further the cause of the terrorist group. In addition to beheading videos, ISIS has released videos of their members doing nonviolent acts. For example, Imran Awan described one such instance in his article \\"Cyber-Extremism: Isis and the Power of Social Media\\" where one video showed members of the Islamic State were seen helping people and visiting hospitals. These videos gave a humanistic nature to the terrorist group members, therefore, contradicting what civilians think terrorist groups should be. Edgar Jones has mentioned in his article, \\"The Reception of Broadcast Terrorism: Recruitment and Radicalisation,\\" that ISIS has utilized documentaries and even their own magazine, Dabiq, in order to recruit new members and to get their message out to the public. This illustrates just a couple of the various mediums that ISIS has used. According to Wainwright, social media is also used by ISIS and other terror groups to recruit foreign people to join the terrorist cause. In some cases, these new recruits are sent back to their home country to carry out terrorist attacks. Others who can not physically move to the terrorist cause have been known to carry out acts of terrorism in their own countries due to the propaganda that they are exposed to online. This exhibits how ISIS can brainwash or expand on ideas that individuals may have. The Taliban has been active on Twitter since May 2011, and has more than 7,000 followers. Tweeting under the handle @alemarahweb, the Taliban tweets frequently, on some days nearly hourly. This account is currently suspended. In December 2011, it was discovered that the Somalia- based terror cell Al-Shabab was using a Twitter account under the name @HSMPress. Since opening on December 7, 2011, the account has amassed tens of thousands of followers and tweets frequently. Shortly after a series of coordinated Christmas bombings in Kono, Nigeria, in 2011, the Nigerian-based terror group Boko Haram released a video statement defending their actions to YouTube. Boko Haram has also used Twitter to voice their opinions. AQAP and Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL/DAESH) Islamic State has emerged as one of the most potent users of social media. In many respects, Islamic State learned their propaganda craft from al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). However, IS quickly eclipsed its mentor, deploying a whole range of narratives, images and political proselytizing through various social media platforms.Jeff Lewis (2015/6) Media, Culture and Human Violence, Rowman and Littlefield, Lanham, MD. A study by Berger and Morgan estimated that at least 46,000 Twitter accounts were used by ISIS supporters between September and December 2014. However, as ISIS supporters regularly get suspended and then easily create new, duplicate accounts, counting ISIS Twitter accounts over a few months can overestimate the number of unique people represented by 20–30%. In 2019, Storyful discovered that approximately two dozen TikTok accounts were used to post propaganda videos targeting users. Accounts broadcast news from Amaq News Agency, the official news outlet for the Islamic State. However, as the November 2015 attacks in Paris demonstrate, IS also uses old-fashioned methods of communication and propaganda. Lewis notes that the attacks in Paris represent the sort of 'propaganda in action' which was a method developed by the 19th century anarchists in Europe. The November 2015 IS attacks were perpetrated without prior warning, largely because the operatives met face-to- face and used other non-digital means of communication. ==Attempts to thwart the use of social media by terror groups== Some U.S. government officials have urged social media companies to stop hosting content from terror groups. In particular, Joe Lieberman has been especially vocal in demanding that social media companies not permit terror groups to use their tools. In 2008, Lieberman and the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs issued a report titled \\"Violent Islamist Extremism, the Internet, and the Homegrown Terrorist Threat\\". The report stated that the internet is one of the \\"primary drivers\\" of the terrorist threat to the United States. In response to the news that Al-Shabab was using Twitter, U.S. officials have called for the company to shut down the account. Twitter executives have not complied with these demands and have declined to comment on the case. In January 2012, Twitter announced changes to their censorship policy, stating that they would now be censoring tweets in certain countries when the tweets risked breaking the local laws of that country. The reason behind the move was stated on their website as follows: > As we continue to grow internationally, we will enter countries that have > different ideas about the contours of freedom of expression. Some differ so > much from our ideas that we will not be able to exist there. Others are > similar but, for historical or cultural reasons, restrict certain types of > content, such as France or Germany, which ban pro-Nazi content.Until now, > the only way we could take account of those countries' limits was to remove > content globally. Starting today, we give ourselves the ability to > reactively withhold content from users in a specific country — while keeping > it available in the rest of the world. We have also built in a way to > communicate transparently to users when content is withheld, and why. The move drew criticism from many Twitter users who said the move was an affront to free speech. Many of the users threatened to quit tweeting if the policy was not rescinded, including Chinese artist and activist Ai Weiwei. In December 2010, in response to growing demands that YouTube pull video content from terrorist groups from its servers, the company added a \\"promotes terrorism\\" option under the \\"violent or repulsive content\\" category that viewers can select to \\"flag\\" offensive content. By limiting the terrorists access to conventional mass media and censoring news coverage of terrorist acts and their perpetrators and also minimising the terrorists allowance to manipulate mass media, the mass fear impact that is usually created will decrease.Weimann,1999  Effectiveness of suspension  Western governments have been actively trying to surveil and censor IS social media sites. As Jeff Lewis explains, as quickly as platform managers close down accounts, IS and its supporters continually create new IDs which they then use to resurge back with new accounts and sites for propaganda. A case study of an al Shabaab account and a George Washington University white paper found that accounts that resurged did not regain the high number of followers they had had originally. However this picture is complicated as a May 2016 article in the Journal of Terrorism Research found that resurgent accounts acquire an average (median) of 43.8 followers per day, while regular jihadist accounts accrue only 8.37 followers on average per day.  Free speech and terrorism  U.S. Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, has said that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to terrorists and that they have given up their rights to free speech. He cited a Supreme Court ruling that anyone providing \\"material support\\" to a terrorist organization is guilty of a crime, even if that support only involves speaking and association. He also cited terrorist speech as being like child pornography in that it does harm. ==Homeland security subcommittee== On December 6, 2011 the US Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence held a hearing entitled \\"Jihadist Use of Social Media - How to Prevent Terrorism and Preserve Innovation.\\" At the hearing, members heard testimony from William McCants, an analyst for the Center for Naval Analyses, Aaron Weisburd, director of the Society for Internet Research, Brian Jenkins, senior advisor for the Rand Corporation and Evan Kohlmann, senior partner from Flashpoint Global Partners. McCants stated that while terror groups were actively using social media platforms to further their goals, research did not support the notion that the social media strategies they adopted were proving effective: > We are talking about a relatively small number of people. Because the number > of people is so small, it is difficult to say why some become active > supporters of al-Qaeda and others do not. What we can say is that the vast > majority of people who watch and read al-Qaeda propaganda will never act > violently because of it. Put metaphorically, the material may be incendiary > but nearly everyone is fireproof. Since that is the case, it is better to > spend our resources putting out the fires and issuing warnings about the > dangers of fire rather than trying to fireproof everyone or remove > incendiary material. McCants added that he did not believe that closing online user accounts would be effective in stopping radicalization and stated that closing online accounts could even disadvantage US security and intelligence forces: > I do not put much stock in closing online user accounts that do not violate > our laws. I also do not put much stock in intervening with well-meaning > outreach programs or removing propaganda. There are too many downsides to > these approaches. They are also unnecessary. The FBI and local law > enforcement in the United States have done an excellent job in finding al- > Qaeda supporters online and arresting them before they hurt anyone. They > have gotten very good at following the smoke trails and putting out fires. McCants stressed that not enough research has been conducted on this topic and he would be willing to change his opinion on the matter if there was empirical evidence that proved that social media has a major role in radicalizing youth. Weisburd stated that any organization that played a part in producing and distributing media for terrorist organizations were in fact supporting terrorism: > I would argue that a service provider who knowingly assists in the > distribution of terrorist media is also culpable. While it is in no one's > interest to prosecute internet service providers, they must be made to > realize that they can neither turn a blind eye to the use of their services > by terrorist organizations, nor can they continue to put the onus of > identifying and removing terrorist media on private citizens. Weisburd argued that social media lends an air of legitimacy to content produced by terror organizations and provides terrorist organizations an opportunity to brand their content: \\"Branding in terrorist media is a sign of authenticity, and terrorist media is readily identifiable as such due to the presence of trademarks known to be associated with particular organizations.\\" He concluded that the goal of intelligence and security forces should not be to drive all terrorist media offline, but rather to deprive terror groups from the branding power gleaned from social media. Jenkins stated that the risks associated with al Qaeda's online campaign do not justify an attempt to impose controls on content distributors. Any attempted controls would be costly and would deprive the intelligence officials of a valuable source of information. Jenkins also stated that there was no evidence that attempts to control online content would be possible: > Even China, which has devoted immense resources to controlling social media > networks with far fewer concerns about freedom of speech, has been unable to > block the micro blogs that flourish on the web. Faced with the shutdown of > one site, jihadist communicators merely change names and move to another, > dragging authorities into a frustrating game of Whac-a-mole and depriving > them of intelligence while they look for the new site. Is this, then the > best way to address the problem?\\" Kohlmann stated US government officials must do more to pressure social media groups like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter to remove content produced by terror groups: > Unfortunately, current U.S. law gives few incentives for companies like > YouTube for volunteering information on illicit activity, or even > cooperating when requested by U.S. law enforcement. If such companies are to > be trusted to self-police their own professed commitments to fighting hate > speech, then they must be held to a public standard which reflects the > importance of that not unsubstantial responsibility. ==See also== *Jihadist extremism in the United States#Internet *Online youth radicalization *Use of social media by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ==References== Category:Terrorism Category:Social media ","title":"Terrorism and social media"},{"id":"35329006","text":"Horst Walther Overdick-Mejía, alias El Tigre (English: The Tiger), is a former Guatemalan drug lord and associate of the Mexican criminal group known as Los Zetas. He is known for helping Los Zetas cement their power in northern Guatemala. He was considered by the authorities as \\"one of the most prolific\\" drug lords in the country of Guatemala. He was arrested on 3 April 2012 in San Lucas, Guatemala. ==Criminal career== Overdick began as a trader of cardamom, a spice used in cooking, then used his knowledge of import and export routes to help Los Zetas drug cartel move cocaine to the United States from Guatemala. Nevertheless, since 1999, Overdick has been trafficking cocaine into Guatemala by securing airstrips in the country for planes carrying hundreds of kilograms to land. By the year 2002, he was responsible for more than 1,200-kilogram cocaine shipments at airstrips that arrived at the country, which he and his associates later hid in trucks to transport to Mexico. Overdick then began to purchase cocaine directly from Los Zetas, a Mexican criminal group. In fact, reports mention that he was the \\"first person to ally himself with Los Zetas in Guatemala\\" and cement their presence in 2008. During the investigations leading to Overdick's arrest, the Guatemalan authorities recovered videos of Overdick with prominent members of the Zetas at a \\"narco-fiesta,\\" a large party hosted by drug traffickers in Guatemala, which took place at a horse race. Hand-written books with details of where the shipments of weapons, drugs, and money were also discovered by the authorities. And when his son Kevin Paul was captured by the authorities in July 2011, Overdick announced through radio that \\"men were going to start falling.\\" He was one of the most influential drug traffickers in Cobán, Alta Verapaz, and reports say that he \\"had been arrested before\\" but was later released because Overdick would \\"bribe or threaten\\" his prosecutors. Overdick was also the primary ally of Los Zetas in the provinces of Petén, Izabal, and Alta Verapaz, establishing a cocaine-trafficking link between South America and Mexico. The Woodrow Wilson Center claimed that the DEA had listed Overdick as one of the most-wanted drug lords. Arrest On 3 April 2012, Overdick was arrested by Guatemalan police and United Nations investigators after they raided his home in San Lucas Sacatepéquez, just 20 km (12 miles) west of the capital Guatemala City. During the time of his arrest, Overdick did not have bodyguards, and was accompanied only by a man and a woman who have not been identified. All the firearms inside his home had a license, but they were still confiscated by the authorities. Soon after the arrest, the U.S. embassy in Guatemala congratulated the authorities for Overdick's arrest. The Interior Minister, Mauricio López, mentioned that Overdick was the \\"most important nexus for the Zetas\\" in the northern part of the country. The Guatemalan and U.S. authorities are looking to extradite Overdick to the United States. Experts in drug trafficking, like Cynthia Arsons, claimed that the apprehension of Overdick would cause a wave of violence in Guatemala, since the same strategy of removing drug kingpins in Mexico has resulted in surges of violent. ;Possible changes in Guatemala's criminal underworld Throughout all of 2011, several important and long-established drug traffickers in Guatemala were arrested. This includes two members of the Lorenzana crime family, along with Juan Ortiz-Lopez, nicknamed as Juan Chamale, ranked by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) as Guatemala's \\"number one drug trafficker.\\" Along with the arrival of Los Zetas, the past arrests have posed a threat to the \\"old generation of traditional narcos\\" in Guatemala, and raises questions on what is next for Guatemala's criminal underworld. And as Prensa Libre mentions, Los Zetas were not Overdick's only ally. Overdick also had an alliance with the organization of Mario Ponce Rodriguez's, who was arrested in Honduras in May 2011 and later extradited to the United States. His brother, Jorge Rodriguez, reportedly took control of the criminal group and made an alliance with Los Zetas. Overdick allegedly sold cocaine to the Zetas and to the Ponces. In addition, Overdick may have the same fate as Ponce, who is currently under custody in Miami and has agreed to provide intelligence on the structure of his organization for a soother life-sentence. With the arrival and consolidation of Los Zetas, Overdick's alliance with them represented a new era for drug trafficking in Guatemala, mainly because the Zetas were eager to impose their military-like tactics instead of relying on family connections and support from communities as the Guatemalan crime families did. Extradition process A Guatemalan court authorized the extradition of Overdick to the United States on 13 June 2012, accusing him of being one of the top drug barons in Central America and a close associate of the Mexican drug cartel known as Los Zetas. Judges ruled that he was responsible for overseeing the drug flow of cocaine shipments from South America to the United States. The court also stated that Overdick had built several warehouses and clandestine dirt roads to traffic cocaine through land. Otto Pérez Molina, the president of Guatemala, must ratify the extradition before Overdick is sent to the United States. Overdick is believed to have granted Los Zetas with logistics necessary to set foot on Central America. Extradition in Guatemala's justice system plays a huge role, largely because of political corruption, widespread immunity, and court weakness. Less than four percent of all cases are prosecuted, and top criminal leaders in Guatemala rarely face charges in their own country. In January 2011, the former president Alfonso Portillo was tried for alleged money laundering and embezzlement from charity donations. Aside from Portillo's scandal, what was at stake was the effectiveness of Guatemala's justice system. Many politicians before him – including several ex-presidents – were seen as \\"untouchable,\\" and the extra cash they allegedly stole was \\"simply [their] reward for reaching the pinnacle.\\" Nonetheless, despite the strong evidence against him, Portillo was acquitted of all charges and extradited to the U.S. Occurrences like this are not rare in Guatemala, since the failing court system must often rely on extradition to successfully impose justice and punish its criminals. Although there have been some pushes for extradition reforms, they are often filled with loopholes that delay the process. Guatemala's extradition practice, however, fails to address the country's weak justice system. Extradition, imprisonment, and release Overdick was extradited to the United States on drug trafficking charges on 10 December 2012. He was assigned Federal Inmate Number 91938-054 and incarcerated at the New York City Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he remains awaiting trial. He served over 6 years for drug-related charges. He was released from prison in April 2019 and deported back to Guatemala. ==References== Category:Guatemalan drug traffickers Category:Los Zetas Category:Living people Category:People of the Mexican Drug War Category:Guatemalan people imprisoned abroad Category:People extradited from Guatemala Category:People extradited to the United States Category:Prisoners and detainees of the United States federal government Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:People deported from the United States ","title":"Horst Overdick"},{"id":"35329008","text":"Robert Edward Lee Wilson (March 5, 1865 - September 27, 1933) was the creator and owner of Lee Wilson and Company, a group of large cotton plantations in Mississippi County, Arkansas.

This phrase is usually mentioned by the media as a way to label voters of this ethnicity, and to opine that this demographic group could potentially tilt the outcome of an election, and how candidates have developed messaging strategies to this ethnic group.http://www.wcvi.org/latino_voter_research/latino_voter_statistics.htmlhttp://theamericano.com/2011/04/27/importance- latino-vote-future-elections/ ==Voting demographics== States with the most share of eligible Latino voters in 2016 were: New Mexico (40.4%), Texas (28.1%), California (28.0%), Arizona (21.5%), Florida (18.1%), Nevada (17.2%), Colorado (14.5%), and New York (13.8%). ==Low Voting Turnout== The percentage of Latinos who participate in political activities varies, but rarely exceeds half of those eligible. Charles S. Bullock, and M. V. Hood, \\"A Mile‐Wide Gap: The Evolution of Hispanic Political Emergence in the Deep South.\\" Social Science Quarterly 87.5 (2006): 1117-1135. online In general, Latinos participate in common civic activities, such as voting, at much lower rates than nearby non-Hispanic Whites or Blacks. Approximately 57.9 percent of U.S. citizen adult Latinos were registered to vote at the time of the 2004 election, and 47.2 percent turned out to vote. The registration and turnout rates are approximately 10 percent lower than those of non-Hispanic blacks and 18 percent lower than those of non-Hispanic whites. To explain low voter turnout among Latinos, researchers have analyzed voter participation demographics throughout many years. Researchers have found many explanations as towards why Latinos have a low voter turn out. There are explanations that account for physical barriers such as lack of transportation. As well as systemic barriers such as, harassment, discrimination, inadequate numbers of polling booths, inconvenient placements of polling booths, and biased administration of election laws may suppress Latino access to registering and voting. One of the biggest explanation for low Latino voter turn outs is associated with accurately measuring the Latino vote based on a general population that includes many non-citizens. The number of adult non-U.S. citizens rose from 1.9 million in 1976 to more than 8.4 million in 2000, a 350 percent increase. Thus, the share of Latino nonparticipants are overwhelmingly non-U.S. citizens. Another explanation for low levels of Latino voter turnout stems from the relatively young age of the Latino population. For example, 40 percent of the California Latino population was under eighteen years of age in 1985. Individuals with lower incomes vote at lower rates than people with higher incomes. In terms of income, the general argument is that individuals with higher socioeconomic status have the civic skills, the participatory attitudes, and the time and money to facilitate participation. Education is also positively related to participation and vote choice, as Latinos with a college degree and postgraduate training are more likely to vote. More than 30 percent of Hispanic adult citizens have less than a high school education, while 12 percent of non-Hispanic white adult citizens have less than a high school education. Therefore, low participation may result from low levels of knowledge about the political process that should be garnered through formal education. Although turn out for Latinos is low, it has been noted that Latinos residing in communities with a large Latino population are more likely to turn out to vote. ==Latino Vote Influences== There is a significant amount of literature dedicated to analyzing what influences Latino vote choices. One strong determinant has been found to be religion, which is believed to play a role in defining the political attitudes and behaviors of Latino voters. Latinos have long been associated with Catholicism with respect to faith and religious identity and with the Democratic Party with regard to political allegiance and identity. Although most Latinos affiliate themselves with the Democratic Party, the Latino National Political Survey, has found a consistent finding that Latinos identify themselves ideologically as moderates and conservatives. Social conservatism usually originates from religion, which oftentimes predicts Latino's opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage, support for the death penalty, and support for traditional gender roles. Political ads have also been studied to determine how they influence Latino voting behavior. In a study conducted by Abrajano, it was concluded that different political ads influence Latino vote choices depending on how assimilated individuals are to American life. For Spanish dominated Latinos, political ads that tapped into ethnic identity seemed to be the most influential. On the other hand, for assimilated Latinos, ethnic appeals did have some influence but exposure to more informative policy ads in English or Spanish had a greater impact on these voters' decision to vote. ==Policies== In the United States, the Latino or Hispanic vote is typically associated with immigration issues such as immigration reform, immigration enforcement and amnesty for undocumented immigrants, usually with images of Mexican illegal immigrants crossing the border or being arrested by the border patrol, despite the fact that in many cases immigration could be an issue no more important than unemployment or the economy for many Latino American citizens.http://thehispanicblog.com/2012/03/12/is-respect-a-major-issue-for- latinos-election-2012-coverage-on-the-hispanic-vote/ Data from both the 2002 and 1999 National Surveys on Latinos revealed that over 60% percent of Latinos favor a larger government with more government programs, even if this means higher taxes. Government programs that Latinos are more likely to advocate for are those that focus on issues such as crime control and drug prevention, child care services, environmental protection, science and technology, defense, and programs for refugees and immigrants According to the National Exit Poll, in 2012 60% of Latino voters identified the economy as the most important issue the country was facing. Education is also a constant preoccupation among Latino voters. Latinos emphasize education, mentioning such issues as expanding the number of schools, reducing class sizes, and adding to the cultural sensitivity of teachers and curricula. Other educational concerns expressed by Latinos include ensuring that children are able to advance to the next educational level. Following the economy and education, health care (18%), the federal budget deficit (11%) and foreign policy (6%), were other concerns among the Latino population. ==2016 Election== According to Pew Research Center projections, 27.3 million Latinos are eligible to vote, representing 12% of all eligible voters. For the 2016 election, millennials made up 44% of Latino eligible voters which is an 80% increase since 2012. In 2016, 57% of Hispanic voters said they were dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country, up from 50% in 2012. Three-quarters of Hispanic registered voters said they had discussed Trump's comments about Hispanics or other groups with family, friends or coworkers, which made them more willing to vote in this election. ==See also== *Politics of the United States *Race in the United States *United States presidential election *Jewish views and involvement in US politics *Catholic Church and politics in the United States *Identity politics ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Barreto, Matt A., and Loren Collingwood. \\"Group-based appeals and the Latino vote in 2012: How immigration became a mobilizing issue.\\" Electoral Studies 40 (2015): 490-499.

The head coach was James H. Horne, who was in his first and only year. The team played its home games at the Old Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana, as an independent school. Indiana did not officially compete in basketball as a member of the Western Conference, later known as the Big Ten Conference, until the 1904–1905 season. The Hoosiers finished the regular season with an overall record of 1–4. ==Team formation== During the 1900–01 school year, Indiana University officials desired to compete with rival schools in \\"basket ball,\\" as it was then known. So after the holiday break at the end of 1900, athletic director James H. Horne put out a call for players to try out for the new team. To prepare players participated in drills and scrimmages daily.

According to Indiana Daily Student reports, \\"the excitement approached that of an inter-collegiate football contest.\\" However, the superior performance of Butler's star forward Carl McGaughey ultimately helped propel Butler to a 20–17 victory. Butler: February 21 Indiana and Butler scheduled a return match-up on Thursday, February 21 in Bloomington. Phelps Darby, who was 5 feet 11 inches tall, had played center in the initial game, but for the re-match he was moved to the forward position so that he could guard Butler's Carl McGaughey. McGaughey still managed to score five field goals in the first half to give Butler a 16–6 advantage at halftime. Indiana rallied behind the play of team captain, Ernest Strange, but still lost 24–20. McGaughey was scoreless in the second half but still led all players with 10 points. For Indiana, Strange and Fitzgerald each had six points. Purdue: March 2 On Saturday, March 2 in Bloomington, Indiana played Purdue. The two schools had already developed a fierce rivalry in football. Purdue edged out the Hoosiers in the first half with a 12–10 lead and was able to hold on to the lead with a 20–15 victory. Purdue went on to have a 12–0 season and was considered by some to be the best team in the country; however, Yale won the Helms Foundation award that year. Wabash: March 8 Indiana's fourth game of the year was against Wabash, who traveled to Bloomington on March 8. The game was close after the first half with Indiana ahead 9–8. But in the second half Indiana arguably played its best basketball of the season by scoring 17 points to win by a total score of 26–17. Disputed Purdue game Indiana originally planned to play away games at Wabash and Purdue, but according to the Arbutus (the school yearbook), those games were \\"declared off, and the season ended at Indiana.\\" The official records of Indiana University and Purdue University indicate that Indiana lost to Purdue 23–19 in West Lafayette on March 15, 1901. However, the Indiana University Basketball Encyclopedia by Jason Hiner notes that an absence of newspaper reports about the game suggests that it never took place.

The route is a remnant of the former U.S. Route 290 through the ghost town of Bakersfield in eastern Pecos County east of Fort Stockton before the construction of Interstate 10. Both ends of the route terminate at service roads of I-10, and the loop has one major intersection with Farm to Market Road 11 in Bakersfield. The route has been included in the state highway system under various designations since the original formation of the state system. ==Route description== Loop 293 begins along the north service road of I-10 just south of Squawteat Peak west of Bakersfield. After the route intersects FM 11 in the center of Bakersfield. The route proceeds for another before returning to the I-10 north service road. The road passes through the Taylor-Link Oil and Gas Field, and follows a generally straight path through gentle terrain with little physical relief. There is no direct connection between Loop 293 and the main roadways of I-10. The north service road at the west end of Loop 293 ends abruptly a short distance away with no entrance or exit ramps. Access to the loop from I-10 is by way of FM 11 at Exit 294, and westbound motorists on I-10 can also reach the east end by following the north service road from Exit 298 at Ranch to Market Road 2886. ==History== Loop 293 was originally designated as a Travis County route along the south side of the city of Austin on August 24, 1955. That route began at the current intersection of US 290 and Loop 343, then proceeded along the present SH 71 ending at the current intersection of US 183 with SH 71. The route of the original loop now carries US 290 west of I-35. The original route designation was replaced by US 290 and SH 71 on May 30, 1961, with the old route becoming Loop 343. left The present Loop 293, despite its short distance and the small size of the community it serves, overlays a roadway that has been part of several significant highway routes since the beginning of the state's highway system. Soon after the Texas State Highway Department, a predecessor to TxDOT, was established in 1917, the agency proposed State Highway 10 that included the present loop. That proposal came to fruition locally by 1919, and the road became part of the seven percent of the state's highway network receiving 50% federal funding under the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. left left SH 10 was locally reassigned as part of SH 27 by 1926. That same year the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) adopted the network of United States Numbered Highways which was published in 1927. At that time the road became part of US 290 while maintaining its SH 27 designation. The redundant state designation was removed by the 1939 general redescription of the state highway system. The I-10 bypass around Bakersfield was constructed in 1976. US 290 was rerouted along the I-10 bypass, and the original roadway was designated Loop 293 on March 19, 1981. After the completion of I-10 in western Texas, US 290 was decommissioned west of its intersection with I-10 southeast of Junction in 1992. ==Major intersectionsSee also== * * ==References * *Bakersfield, Texas from the Handbook of Texas Online *Bakersfield, Texas from TexasEscapes.com 293 Category:Transportation in Pecos County, Texas ","title":"Texas State Highway Loop 293"},{"id":"35329403","text":"Al-Harra (), also spelled Khirbet al-Harra; translation: \\"the Hot\\") is a town in southern Syria, administratively belonging to the al-Sanamayn District of the Daraa Governorate.

It had an entirely Muslim population of 50 households and 25 bachelors. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 25% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and bee-hives; in addition to occasional revenues. Their total tax was 36,638 akçe, with half of it going to a waqf (religious trust).Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 207 In 1897 Gottlieb Schumacher visited al-Harra and reported that except for two small Damascus-born Arab Christian families, the town's population of 500 was entirely Muslim. The inhabitants were fellahin originally from the nearby towns of Jasim and Zimrin who settled among the nomadic Bedouins of the area. Many of the latter continued to graze their fields in al-Harra. The 126 residences in the village consisted mostly of stone-built huts. The village itself was built around the eastern section of a small volcanic crater in the southeastern base of the Tell al-Harra) elevation. At the time, the property of al-Harra was owned by Selim Freige of Beirut and its farmland was administered by Yusuf Effendi Mansur Hatim on Freige's behalf.

Musseau - profile - genealogy - accessed 2012-04-04was an American football coach. He served as the head football coach at the University of Idaho for three seasons, from 1965 to 1967, compiling a record of 13–17. Following coaching, he was a motivational speaker and mental performance teacher. ==Early years== Born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Musseau played football at LSU until interrupted by World War II. While serving as a paratrooper in the , he incurred a badly fractured leg that ended his football career, but led him to his future wife, a nurse he met while recuperating. He returned to LSU to finish his degree, changing from engineering to pre-dental to education. ==Coaching== A high school head coach in Louisiana and California, Musseau was at Mater Dei High School for two seasons,materdei.org - football history - accessed 2012-04-04 then moved to the junior college level in 1957. He was the head coach at Orange Coast College for five years when named to the staff at Idaho in 1962 by new head coach Dee Andros. Three years later, Andros left for Oregon State in 1965 with several assistants and offered him an assistant coaching position in Corvallis as well; Musseau was named head coach at Idaho within two days. Idaho head coach Musseau's 1965 Vandals, with fullback Thunder Ray McDonald, won the Battle of the Palouse over neighbor Washington State for the second straight year, this time on the road in Pullman, and finished at 5–5. Although Idaho was a charter member was the Big Sky Conference in 1963, it had only played one conference game in football in the first two seasons, a previously scheduled game against Idaho State. Idaho was a \\"university division\\" program and a longtime member of the defunct PCC, while the other four football-playing members of the Big Sky were \\"college division\\" (Division II). Under Andros, Idaho viewed the six- team Big Sky as an answer to its basketball scheduling problems, as well as other sports, but had desired to continue as an independent at the top level in football. Directed by the conference to comply, Idaho played its first full conference schedule in football in 1965 and was 3–1 for the first two seasons, but posted a disappointing 2–2 in the third. A November defeat at Weber State and non-conference blowout losses at Washington State (14–52) and Houston (6–77) closed out the 1967 season at 4–6 overall. Although his 13–17 () record was better than each of the previous eight head coaches, pressure from alumni and boosters forced Musseau's resignation, despite a signed petition by the Vandal football players that he remain for a fourth year. His salary during his final year as head coach was $13,900. He stayed with the university in 1968, but outside the athletic department in a fund-raising role under the university president. ==After coaching== Following coaching, he was a motivational speaker, author, and mental performance teacher. For several seasons in the mid-1990s, Northwestern head coach Gary Barnett brought in Musseau as an inspirational mentor on adversity, including their 1995 run to their first Rose Bowl in nearly a half century. At the 1995 pre-season camp, Musseau dressed up in costume as Moses to help emphasize his key points. Two of Musseau's sons had played high school football for Barnett in the 1970s at Air Academy High School in Colorado Springs. After AAHS was beaten by its overmatched archrival, Barnett discovered that the rival team had been mentored by Musseau that week. ==Personal== At the time of his hiring as head coach at Idaho in 1965, Musseau and his wife Yollanda were the parents of twelve children: ten sons and two daughters. Musseau had ongoing problems with his health; following his first season as head coach at Idaho, he had a heart attack in early 1966 at age 42, and had several triple-bypass surgeries, as well as diabetes. In his later years, Musseau was a resident of Marysville, Washington, north of Seattle. He died of heart failure in late 1997 at a nursing home in Everett. ==Head coaching record== College ==References== Category:1923 births Category:1997 deaths Category:American football guards Category:Idaho Vandals football coaches Category:LSU Tigers football players Category:High school football coaches in California Category:Junior college football coaches in the United States Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:Sportspeople from Baton Rouge, Louisiana Category:People from Marysville, Washington Category:Players of American football from Louisiana ","title":"Steve Musseau"},{"id":"35329613","text":"Midway is an unincorporated community in Leake County, Mississippi, United States. == Geography == Midway is located on Midway Road northeast of Carthage. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Leake County, Mississippi Category:Unincorporated communities in Mississippi ","title":"Midway, Leake County, Mississippi"},{"id":"35329701","text":"Midway, also known as Peetsville, is an unincorporated community in Copiah County, Mississippi, United States.

It occurred following the passage of a strong cold front, in combination with a high- pressure area situated over the Mississippi River Valley. As a result, cold air moved far to the south across Florida, causing both snow flurries and record low temperatures. Most notably, the weather system brought snow flurries (seen in the air, but not on the ground) as far south as Homestead on January 19\\\\. No snow had ever been reported in southeastern Florida before or since. Damage was most significant to agriculture, as major losses occurred to Citrus fruits and tender vegetables. Statewide, agricultural damage from the cold wave totaled to $350 million (1977 USD), and losses overall totaled to $2 billion (1977 USD). One fatality occurred due to an automobile accident in Central Florida, which was related to the cold wave. ==Meteorological history== Beginning on January 16, a strong arctic cold front began crossing the state of Florida. Two days later, another cold front crossed Florida, while a strong arctic high-pressure system over the Mississippi River Valley also began pushing cold air into Florida. Simultaneously, an upper-level trough associated with the second cold front contained a band of clouds and precipitation. Between 8 and 9:30 am, snow flurries were reported in several areas outside Miami. The National Weather Service office in Miami reported that an observation at nearby Lake Worth reported a trace of snow on the ground at the 9:00 am observation (it was gone by the 10:00 am observation). This was the source of the trace of snow at Miami in 1977. It was reported that people stopped their cars and emerged from their homes to see the snow in great numbers, many having never seen snow flurries in their lifetimes. That day the high only reached 47 °F (8 °C) in Miami. The associated cold air began to subside on January 21. ==Impact== Florida Flurries were seen in the air and on the ground a trace was reported at both Tampa and Plant City. West Palm Beach reported flurries in the air at 1010 UTC (5:10 a.m. EST) on January 19, and lasted for 1 hours and 20 minutes, ending at 1200 UTC (7 a.m. EST). Simultaneously, snow flurries began falling in Broward and Dade counties; it was the first time snow had ever been observed at Miami. At Homestead, a mix of light rain and wet snow flurries fell briefly at the Homestead Air Force Base, and is regarded as the southernmost location of snowfall in the Contiguous United States. Prior to this event, the southernmost snow record was in Fort Myers in February 1899. Additionally, wet snow flurries were reported at Freeport, Bahamas, on Grand Bahama, making the only known snowfall in the 358-year history of The Bahamas. Across the state, record low temperatures were reported. For much of the state, temperatures remained below freezing for 10–14 hours, and at or less than for at least four hours. In Pensacola, a temperature of was recorded, and was later surpassed by a mere during the Winter 1985 Arctic outbreak. A record low temperature of was reported in Orlando. Few other records were broken in North and Central Florida. In the Tampa Bay Area, temperatures hovered around the upper 's. South of Tampa, record temperatures included in Devils Garden, in Fort Lauderdale, in LaBelle, and in Miami Beach. Other cold but not record-breaking temperatures included in Belle Glade, in Hollywood, at the Homestead Agricultural Center, in Immokalee, at the Miami International Airport, in Moore Haven, in Naples, and in North Miami Beach, and in West Palm Beach. Additionally, temperatures in the 's were reported in the Florida Keys for several hours. In combination with snow and abnormally low temperatures, a severe freeze ensued, causing extensive damage, especially to agriculture. The USDA reported the following crop losses: 35% to citrus, at least 95% to vegetables, between 50–75% of commercial flowers, 50% to permanent pasture lands, and 40% to sugar cane. Crop damage totaled to $350 million (1977 USD), while at least $100 million (1977 USD) of that figure occurred in Dade County alone. In order to prevent water pipes from freezing, nurseries and farms ran sprinklers all night. However, some water began flowing onto roadways, and with freezing temperatures, caused ice to form on roads in western Dade County. Overall, the cold wave caused up to $2 billion (1977 USD) in damage. Several traffic accidents occurred due to snowfall and ice. Most notably, there was a ten-car pileup in Tampa, and another accident killed a man near Auburndale, when his car skidded in snow and crashed into a truck. Due to significant losses related to the freezing temperatures, then-President Jimmy Carter, who was inaugurated on January 20, designated 35 counties in Florida disaster areas. The South Areas of the eastern United States outside of Florida were also affected by the cold wave. In Georgia, the temperature fell to in Atlanta on January 17\\\\. Overall, the mean low temperature in the city during the month of January was , well below the average of . In Tennessee, the Public Service Commission estimating that approximately 100,000 people would be forced to miss a day of work due to closures, while nearly 2,000 people in southern West Virginia were left without heat as a result of interruption of natural gas service. Every day of January 1977 was below average in Raleigh, North Carolina, and the city experienced its coldest winter on record, with January being 14.4 degrees below average. The temperature stayed below freezing from the night of January 16 until January 20, and the temperature fell below zero Fahrenheit for one of the few times in the city's history. Midwest January 1977 is the coldest month on record in the state of Ohio, with an average temperature of 11.9 degrees. Snowfall was above average throughout the month and the all-time record low of was set in Cincinnati. The Ohio River froze solid for the first time since 1918, halting commercial shipping for weeks. Some parts of northern Ohio stayed below freezing for the entire month. Temperatures did not rise above freezing the entire month in a swath from eastern Iowa to western Pennsylvania northward. The cold wave was named the top story of 1977 in the Associated Press' annual poll of the year's biggest news stories. ==See also== *List of snow events in Florida *Blizzard of 1977 ==References External links == *35th Anniversary of Snow in South Florida *Storm Data for January 1977 Category:1977 in Florida Category:1977 meteorology Category:1977 natural disasters in the United States Category:1977 in the Bahamas Category:Cold waves in the United States Category:Climate of Florida Category:January 1977 events in the United States Category:Natural disasters in Florida ","title":"Cold wave of January 1977"},{"id":"35329784","text":"Alapaʻi may refer to: * Alapainui (died 1754), usurper king of Hawaiʻi * Alapai, chief of Oʻahu, friend of Kahahana * Alapaimaloiki, Hawaiian chief, grandfather of David Piikoi * Julia Alapai (c. 1814–1849), granddaughter of Alapainui and wife of Keoni Ana * Alapaiwahine, daughter of Kalaninuiamamao by his wife/daughter Kaolanialiʻi * Nani Alapai (1874–1928), Hawaiian soprano vocalist ","title":"Alapai (disambiguation)"},{"id":"35329811","text":"Midway is an unincorporated community in Scott County, Mississippi, United States.

In the January 1990 edition of Games International (Issue 12), Mike Siggins found the arcade version of the game uninspiring, and the strategy game only a bit better. He concluded by giving the game 3 out of 5 for game play and 4 out of 5 for graphics, saying, \\"It is among the best hockey games around but sadly, given the earlier efforts in this field, that is not saying much [...] It is neither a good arcade game or stats based game, while it attempts to do both.\\" In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared Wayne Gretzky Hockey the 111th-best computer game ever released. ==See also== *Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey (1996) ==References== Category:1988 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Atari ST games Category:Bethesda Softworks games Gretzky, Wayne Hockey Category:DOS games Category:Ice hockey video games Category:Mac OS games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Wayne Gretzky Hockey"},{"id":"35329856","text":"Midway is an unincorporated community in Tishomingo County, Mississippi, United States.

The Blue Line provides service north from this station to Downtown Salt Lake City. ==Description== The station is located at 1131 East Pioneer Road (12400 South). The station was built in the historic center of Draper between 12300 South and 12400 South next to Draper's city hall, the Draper Poultrymen and Egg Producers' Plant (now operated as Intermountain Farmers Association [IFA]), and Draper City Park. It is situated in an area where the railroad right-of-way on which the TRAX line is built turns east- southeast at the base of a retail-covered hill to the northeast; the right-of- way (proposed for use in Phase 2 of the Draper Extension, and already incorporating a rails-with-trails multi-use path) continues east, then south and west in a curve following the contours of the land in order to gain elevation on its approach to the Point of the Mountain pass and enter Utah County. The Draper Branch of the Salt Lake County Library is located just south of the station (off 1130 East). Immediately south of the passenger platform (on the north side of East Pioneer Road) is an exhibit that includes an historic rail car and the history of Draper, particularly the history of egg production in the area. The station has a free Park and Ride lot to the north of the passenger platform which is accessible from East Draper Parkway (from 700 East, 1000 East, 1300 East, and I-15). Due to the slope of the hillside on which it is built, the Park and Ride lot is terraced, with the Draper Canal running between sections of the lot. The station is scheduled to open August 18, 2013 as part of the Draper extension of the Blue Line and is operated by Utah Transit Authority. ==Future plans== While the Draper Town Center station is the terminus of Phase 1 of the Draper Draper extension, in Phase 2 of the Draper extension UTA plans two more stations further south along the railway right of way. The planned stations will be along Highland Drive and at about 146000 South. UTA has not provided any specific date by which work Phase 2 of the extension will begin. ==References== Category:UTA TRAX stations Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 2013 Category:Railway stations in Salt Lake County, Utah Category:2013 establishments in Utah ","title":"Draper Town Center station"},{"id":"35329984","text":"This is a list of finalists for the 2012 Archibald Prize for portraiture.

Detail of a ceiling painting by Daniel Gran in St. Anne's Church, Vienna. Adam and Eve are portrayed below, in chains. The Last Adam, also given as the Final Adam or the Ultimate Adam, is a title given to Jesus in the New Testament.Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard, eds, Mercer dictionary of the Bible. 1998, p. 10. .James D. G. Dunn. \\"The Last Adam\\". The Theology of Paul the Apostle. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, Michigan. 2006, p. 241. . Similar titles that also refer to Jesus include Second Adam and New Adam. Twice in the New Testament an explicit comparison is made between Jesus and Adam. In Romans 5:12–21, Paul argues that \\"just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous\\" (Romans 5:19, NIV). In 1 Corinthians 15:22, Paul argues that \\"as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive,\\" while in verse 45 he calls Jesus the \\"last/ultimate/final Adam\\". John Henry Newman used the phrase \\"Second Adam\\" in his hymn \\"Praise to the Holiest in the height\\", first appearing in The Dream of Gerontius: > O loving wisdom of our God! > When all was sin and shame, > A second Adam to the fight > And to the rescue came. The title \\"New Adam\\" is emphasised in the Recapitulation theory of atonement. ==The Pauline representation== Paul the Apostle contrasted Adam and Christ as two corporate personalities or representatives (; 1 Cor. 15:20–3, 45–9) and saw human beings as bearing the image of both Adam and Christ (1 Cor. 15:49). Where Adam's disobedience meant sin and death for all, Christ's obedience more than made good the harm due to Adam by bringing righteousness and abundance of grace ().In his book, Christology in the Making (1989) p. 115, Christian scholar J.D.G. Dunn assembles evidence to show how not only but also interpret the human condition, at least partly, in the light of the creation and fall narratives of Genesis. As a \\"life-giving spirit\\", the last Adam is risen from the dead and will transform us through resurrection into a heavenly, spiritual existence (1 Cor. 15:22, 45, 48–9). Thus Paul's Adam Christology involved both the earthly Jesus' obedience (Rom. 5) and the risen Christ's role as giver of the Spirit (1 Cor. 15).An explicit Adam Christology seems to have been introduced by Paul himself — first in 1 Cor. 15 and then in Rom. 5: cf. J.A. Fitzmyer, Romans. New York: Doubleday (1993), pp. 136, 406, 412. The same symbol, used to express Christ as the corporate, representative personality (and Adam as his foreshadow or \\"type\\", per Rom. 5:14), was taken up to express Christ's being: he is \\"the last Adam\\" (1 Cor. 15:45), or the \\"second man from heaven\\", and one not made \\"from earth, of dust\\" (1 Cor. 15:47; see Gen. 2:7).For this specific section and themes, compare Gerald O'Collins, Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus. Oxford:Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 24–41. Some scholars detect an Adamic reference in several other New Testament passages: for example, in the language about \\"the glory of Christ, who is the image (Gr.:eikōn) of God\\" (2 Cor. 4:4). Perhaps this is an echo of the language of about Adam being created in the divine image. If so, Paul would be thinking here of Christ as the ideal Adam, with his humanity perfectly expressing the divine image. But this exegesis is not fully convincing.As the divine eikōn or image (2 Cor. 4:4), Christ reveals God. The \\"glory\\" which becomes visible on the face of Christ is his own glory or, equivalently, \\"the glory of God\\" (2 Cor. 4:6). Cf. J.A. Fitzmyer, \\"Glory Reflected on the Face of Christ and a Palestinian Jewish Motif\\", Theological Studies, 42 (1981), pp. 630–44; M. J. Harris, The Second Epistle to the Corinthians, Grand rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans (2005), pp. 330–31. One may likewise be less than fully convinced by those who find a reference to Adam in two hymnic or at least poetic passages: and . Colossians 1:15 In , Christ is called \\"the image (eikōn) of the invisible God, the first-born of all creation\\". In isolation, this verse could be taken merely in an Adamic sense as referring to Christ as the first created being, the archetypal human being who visibly reflects God, the invisible Creator. However, the context suggests finding the background in personified wisdom, the perfect image of God () and the agent of creation (). The verses which follow speak of \\"all things\\" being \\"created through him and for him\\", of his being \\"before all things\\", of \\"all things holding together\\" in him, and of the plenitude of deity dwelling in him (). Any parallelism with Adam, who was simply made in the divine image and likeness, gets left behind here.For comments on the hymn, cf. M. Barth & H. Blanke, Colossians. New York: Doubleday (1994), pp. 193–251; N. T. Wright, The Climax of the Covenant. Edinburgh: T & T Clark (1991), pp. 99–119. On the contrary, every created thing, including the angelic \\"thrones, dominions, principalities, and authorities\\" (), is said to have originated through Christ (as creative agent) and for Christ (as final goal), who likewise is the principle of cohesion in holding the universe together. Further, it strains plausibility to argue that a mere Adamic model does justice to the language of \\"the fullness of God\\" dwelling in Christ (; cf. ). The context of Colossians 1:15, therefore, prompts one to interpret \\"the image of the invisible God\\" as pointing to Christ being on the divine side and being the perfect revealer of God — a thought paralleled by and 2 Corinthians 4:4. Like the hymn or poem in Colossians, Hebrews also portrays Christ as the exact (divine) counterpart through whom the Father speaks and is revealed, and who is the one that sustains the entire universe: \\"He reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature, upholding the universe by his word of power\\" (). The whole context of suggests a more than Adamic and human interpretation of \\"the first-born of all creation\\". Christ is the \\"first-born\\" in the sense of being prior to and supreme over all creation, just as by virtue of his resurrection from the dead he is supreme vis-à-vis the Church (). The emphatic and repeated \\"kai autos\\" (Gr. for \\"and he\\") of underline the absolute \\"pre-eminence\\" of Christ in the orders of creation and salvation history; he is pre-eminent both cosmologically and soteriologically.Cf. G. O'Collins, Salvation for All, loc. cit.. He through whom the universe was created is the same Christ who formed the Church by rising from the dead. He has been active in both creation and redemption.The context is decisive for interpreting the nature of the genitive in (\\"of all creation\\"). The 1989 Revised English Bible catches clearly the comparative force of the genitive: \\"his is the primacy over all creation\\". The \\"firstborn from the dead\\" () is also the \\"firstborn over all creation\\" (). Philippians 2 In the hymn in , any Adamic interpretation of Christ's prior state of being \\"in the form of God\\" and enjoying \\"equality with God\\" () seems to be made doubtful by what follows. This divine status and mode of existence stand in counterpoint (the emphatic \\"but\\" of \\"but he emptied himself\\") to the subsequent state of \\"assuming the form of a slave\\", \\"being born in human likeness\\", and \\"being found in human form\\" (). It is what is said in v. 7 that first puts Christ with the community of human beings and their collective image, Adam. Christ belonged to the eternal sphere of divine existence () and joined the human (and Adamic) sphere only when he assumed another mode of existence () which concealed his proper (divine) being. Nevertheless, in talking of Christ as refusing to use for his own advantage or exploit for himself the godhead which was his, v. 6 might also be contrasting his humility (in becoming human and dying the death of a slave) with the presumptuous aspiration of Adam (and Eve) to enjoy illegitimate equality with God and become \\"like God\\" ().On (), see Dunn cit., pp. 113–21. Against Dunn, N. T. Wright cit., convincingly shows that finding elements of an Adam-Christology in the hymn in no ways means following Dunn by squeezing everything into a purely Adamic pattern and ruling out a Christology of pre-existence and incarnation. For a thorough account of the exegetical and theological issues, cf. N. Capizzi, L'uso di Fil. 2, 6–11 nella cristologia contemporanea (1965–93), Rome: Gregorian University Press (1997). ==Post-New Testament symbolism== Whether one accepts the wider circle of references to Adam or limits oneself to the clear references in and 1 Corinthians 15, the New Testament used Adamic language to express the being of Jesus and, even more, his task and goal. In post-New Testament times, the symbol of Adam proved a valuable foil for Clement of Alexandria, Origen (d. c.254), St Athanasius of Alexandria (c.296–373), St Hilary of Poitiers (c.315–367), St Gregory of Nazianzus (329–389), St Gregory of Nyssa (c.330–395), and other Church Fathers, when they presented and interpreted the person and work of Christ. St Irenaeus (c.130–200), in particular, did much to elaborate further Paul's antithetical parallelism between Adam and Christ, the latter reversing the failure of the first. In a typical passage of his Adversus haereses, he wrote: > The Son of God... was incarnate and made man; and then he summed up in > himself the long line of the human race, procuring for us a comprehensive > salvation, that we might recover in Christ Jesus what in Adam we had lost, > namely the state of being in the image and likeness of God\\" (3. 18. 1) ==Islam== The Quran directly compares Jesus to Adam in terms of how he came into existence. Sura Al-Imran says, \\"Verily, the likeness of Jesus before Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then He said to him: 'Be!' – and he was.\\" http://kaheel7.com/eng/index.php/numeric- miracle/137-amazing-miracle-jesus-and-adam ==See also== * Adam Kadmon * Logos (Christianity) * Paul the Apostle * Old Testament and Adam * Federal headship * Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament ==ReferencesBibliography== * Borgen, Peder.
