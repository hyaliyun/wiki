These villages initially developed as suburbs of Kolkata, but now forms part of the city proper within the limits of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. ==Background== In the early years of the 18th century, Calcutta was a small settlement spread across a narrow stretch on the east bank of the Hooghly. Most of the English residences were to be found around what was then the fort in Kalikata. To its north was Sutanuti hat (cotton and yarn market), and still north lay the native area of Sutanuti. To the south, Gobindapur was a forested area. Beyond the English settlement lay Chitpur and Kalighat, and across the river lay Betor and Salkia. In 1742, the Marathas burst into Bengal, and Nawab Alivardy Khan required all his energy and skills to keep them at bay. They laid waste the countryside. There was a feeling of insecurity in the English settlement and they procured the permission of the Nawab to build a protective ditch around the settlement. When a part of the Maratha Ditch was ready, the realisation dawned that the Marathas were not going to attack Calcutta. The project was abandoned but the ditch remained a sort of a boundary for the English settlement.Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, first published 1909/reprint 1980, Chapters 1-4, General Printers and Publishers Pvt. Ltd. ==Dihis and mouzas== The 55 villages were known en-bloc as Dihi Panchannagram and their details are as follows (old archaic spellings for the places retained): Dihi Sinthee (1. Sinthee 2. Cossipur 3. Paikpara). Dihi Chitpore (4. Chitpore 5. Tallah 6. Beerpara 7. Kalidaha). Dihi Bagzollah (8. Dakhindarie 9. Kankooria 10. Noabad). Dihi Dakhin Paikparah (11. Belgachya). Dihi Ooltadangah (12. Ooltadangah 13. Bagmari 14. Gouriberh). Dihi Similiah (15. Bahir Similiah 16. Narikeldanga). Dihi Soorah (17. Soorah 18. Kankoorgatchi 19. Koochnan 20. Duttabad). Dihi Cooliah (21. Mullickabad 22. Cooleah). Dihi Sealdah (23. Sealdah 24. Baliaghata). Dihi Entally (25. Entally 26. Pagladanga 27. Neemuckpota 28. Gobrah 29. Tangrah). Dihi Topsiah (30. Topsea 31. Tiljulla 32. Baniapooker 33. Kareya). Dihi Serampur (34. Chowbagah 35. Dhullunda 36. Sanpgatchee 37. Auntobad 38. Nonadanga 39. Bondel–Ooloberia 40. Beddeadanga 41. Koostea 42. Purannuggur 43. Ghoogoodanga 44. Serampur). Dihi Chukerberh (45. Ballygunj 46. Gudshaha 47. Chuckerberh). Dihi Bhowanipur (48. Bhowanipur 49. Neejgram). Dihi Monoharpur (50. Beltola 51. Kalighat 52. Monoharpur 53. Moodeali 54. Shahnagar 55. Koykalee). P. Thankappan Nair says that the English obtained from the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar, in 1717, the right to rent from 38 villages surrounding their settlement. Of these 5 lay across the Hooghly in what is now Howrah district. These were – Salkia, Haora, Kusundia, Ramkrishnapur and Betor. The remaining 33 villages on the Calcutta side were (spellings have been modernised): Dakshin Paikpara, Belgachia, Dakshin Dari, Bahir Dakshin Dari, Chitprur, Hoglakundi (or Hoglakuria), Ultadanga, Shimulia (or Shimla), Macond, Kamarpara, Kankurgachi, Bagmari, Shura, Bahir Shura, Dolland, Shrirampur, Chaubaga, Tapsia, Shiltala, Sangassey, Gobra, Kulia, Tangra, Hintalee (or Entali), Colimba, Jal Colimba, Shealdah, Mirzapur, Arcooley, Birjee, Chourangi, Shehparra and Garedalparra. These villages gradually reconstituted themselves as 55 mouzas and hance the name \\"Panchannagram\\". These were grouped under 15 dihis.Nair, P.Thankappan, The Growth and Development of Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, pp. 14-15, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Oxford University Press, 1995 edition. H.E.A. Cotton says that in addition to the comparatively small British settlement, which was defined in a proclamation dated 10 September 1794, primarily as the area within the Maratha Ditch, the 55 villages of Panchannagram formed the suburbs beyond the ditch. They were spread over an area of 23 square miles and even in the early 20th century were under the magisterial and revenue jurisdiction of 24 Parganas.Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, first published 1909/reprint 1980, pages 103-4 and 221, General Printers and Publishers Pvt. Ltd. ==Thanas== Along with the dihis and mouzas, noted above, another administrative division for the development of an integrated colonial settlement was the thana or police station. In the earlier days, the police stations also looked after the civic needs of the people. The earliest list of thanas was prepared in 1785 (names modernised): Armenian Church, Old Fort, Chandpal Ghat, ‘South of the Great Tank’ (Lal Dighi or B.B.D. Bagh tank), Dharmatala, Old Court House, Domtala, Amragali and Panchanantala, China Bazar, Chandni Chowk, ‘Trul Bazar’, Jhamapukur, Charakdanga, Simla Bazar, ‘Lallunch’ (Raja Ramlochan’s) Bazar, Malancha and Pataldanga, Kabardanga, Baitakkhana, Shyampukur, Shyambazar, Padmapukur, Kumartuli, Jorasanko, Mechhuabazar, Jan Bazar, Dingabhanga, Sutanuti Hatkhola, Daychata, Hanspukur, Colimba and Jorabagan.Nair, P.Thankappan, The Growth and Development of Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, pp. 15-20, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Oxford University Press, 1995 edition. In 1888, these thanas were regrouped under 25 Police Section Houses. The 25 wards created under the Calcutta Municipal Act of 1889, precisely matched these divisions. The final picture of old Calcutta had emerged. We present here a brief of the 25 Police Section Houses: 1\\\\. Shyampukur, the citadel of Bengali aristocracy. It was long overtaken by the adjacent settlements of Shyambazar and Baghbazar. 2\\\\. Kumartuli, still retains its fame for clay images. 3\\\\. Bartala, the area where the Rajas of Shobhabazar, the most orthodox Hindus of Calcutta, lived. 4\\\\. Sukeas (corrupted to Sukea) Street, named after Armenian Merchant, Peter Sukeas. 5\\\\. Jorabagan or Jora Bari Bag. 6\\\\. Jorasanko, the seat of the Tagore family. 7\\\\. Barabazar, the market has been traced back to 1738, as the old Sutanati hat, but the present-day wholesale market was a creation of the Marwaris, who achieved phenomenal success in the second half of the 19th century. 8\\\\. Kalutola, the home of the oil pressers, harks back to the beginning of the 18th century. 9\\\\. Muchipara, the home of the cobblers, was not there in 1785 and so must have come up subsequently. 10\\\\. Boubazar, bahu or bride’s market, can be traced back to 1739. 11\\\\. Padmapukur, adjacent to Boubazar, is difficult to locate. The Byaparitola tank in Dingabhanga became Wellington Square (now Subodh Mallick Square). 12\\\\. Waterloo Street Police Section was split among three sections in 1785: Old Fort, ‘South of the Great Tank’ and Old Court House. 13\\\\. Fenwick’s Bazar, named after Edward Fenwick, stood east of the present New Market. 14\\\\. Taltala is a Muslim dominated area. 15\\\\. Kalinga, takes its name from colimba or musk melon. 16\\\\. Park Street, earlier known as Badamtala, then as Burial Ground Road, and finally Park Street in 1840s, because of Sir Elijah Impey’s deer park. 17\\\\. Bamun Bustee, a slum area occupied by the servants of the Park Street sahibs, later converted to a European neighbourhood. 18\\\\. Hastings, initially a Muslim burial ground, then ‘Coolie Bazar’ for workmen who built Fort William, and then a township for Ordnance and Commissariat department people. 19\\\\. Entali, once part of salt lakes beyond the Maratha Ditch, later a marshy area for economically distressed sections of society. 20\\\\. Beniapukur, the home of the merchants, is mentioned from the mid- eighteenth century, but the thana dates from early 19th century. 21\\\\. Baliganj and Tollyganj formed a combined thana. Baliganj grew up around a market for sand and had garden-houses of 18th century Europeans. Baliganj emerged as a citadel of the educated Bengali middle class after the suburban railway opened up the area. Tollyganj was earlier called Rasa Pagla, and in the 18th century, it had European garden-houses in a predominantly jungle area. Tipu Sultan’s sons settled down in the area after the Vellore Mutiny in 1806. 22\\\\. Bhabanipur existed as a dihi in 1765 and also absorbed a part of Dihi Chakraberia. It is said the original shrine of Kali, stood here on the bank of the Adi Ganga, a ‘small brook’ and was shifted to the present site at Kalighat, about a mile away, in 1809. The construction of Harish Mukherjee Road and Lansdowne Road (now Sarat Bose Road) and extension of Hazra Road to Kalighat, opened up the area at the beginning of the 20th century. 23\\\\. Alipur, initially a Muslim locality, was taken over by the British elite, late in the 18th century. Alipur became the headquarters of 24 Parganas district and acquired military installations. It has a meteorological observatory. The Belvedere Estate, once the Lieutenant Governor’s palace, now houses the National Library of India. Around it are Hastings House, the Zoological Garden and the gardens of the Agri-Horticultural Society. 24\\\\. Ekbalpore developed as a Muslim neighbourhood with the settlement of those displaced for the construction of the zoo at Zirat in Alipur police station, and King George’s Docks (now Netaji Subhas Docks) at Garden Reach, as well as migration of Momins or weavers from Bihar and UP. 25\\\\. Watganj is named after Colonel Henry Watson, who set the first dockyards in Bengal. Outside the area of the 25 Police Section Houses, mention may be made of Garden Reach, which became a Muslim area when Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, with a large entourage settled in Metiabruz. ==Conclusion== P.

It is the only species in the monotypic genus Afrololigo. ==Description== Afrololigo mercatoris is a relatively small species of squid where the females reach a mantle length of 50mm and the males attain 35mm. Its mantle is wide, the width being equal to around 35% of the length of the mantle, and blunt at the posterior end. It has short, round fins, equalling 40-45% of the length of the mantle and between 55% and 65% of mantle length in width, with a convex margin at the rear. The head is short and the short and there are no buccal suckers on the buccal lappets. The tentacular club is small and narrow with suckers which are set out in 4 longitudinal series, 4 or 5 pairs of medial suckers on the central part of the club, the manus which are enlarged when compared to the lateral suckers. The club suckers have rings of 15 to 25 sharp teeth which become more pointed and increase in size towards the tip. Its dorsal arms are very short in comparison with its other arms and in males the left ventral arm is hectocotylized. The arm has 6 to 12 pairs of normal suckers at its base with the suckers replaced towards the tip by elongate papillae, these are more strongly developed in the dorsal row. ==Distribution and ecology== Afrololigo mercatoris occurs only off the west coast of Africa from Rio de Oro in Mauritania) to Lüderitz Bay in Namibia. This species is collected from depths of less than 50 m where there are mud and sandy-mud substrates. There is very little data available on its life cycle and biology. The eggs are small and the spermatophores have long bodies made of cement. This species is not a species of interest to fisheries. ==Taxonomy== Afrololigo mercatoris shows some morphological similarity with the squids of the genus Lolliguncula, which is where William Adam originbally placed it when he described this species. However, based on morphology, genetic data and distribution Afrololigowas recognised as a distinct monotypic genus. The Red Sea species Uroteuthis abulati was also thought to be close to A. mercatoris. ==References== Category:Squid Category:Cephalopod genera Category:Monotypic mollusc genera Category:Molluscs described in 1941 ","title":"Afrololigo"},{"id":"56646700","text":"The 1940 Hardin–Simmons Cowboys football team represented Hardin–Simmons University as an independent during the 1940 college football season.

A special emphasis is on the role or autophagy in a wide spectrum of diseases with me tabolic, inflammatory and immunological aspects. At the fundamental level, autophagy is a cytoplasmic pathway for the disposal of damaged or surplus organelles such as mitochondria, peroxisomes, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, protein aggregates and also serves as a catabolic process providing nutrients through autodigestion at times of starvation. Autophagy has been implicated in cancer, neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease, diabetes, development, infections and immune diseases, as well as a process of relevance for aging. The purpose of the AIM center is to promote autophagy research at the international, national and regional levels and to provide resources to communities of scholars interested in this process in any context including basic science or translational research. AIM has scientific cores providing technical resources for study of autophagy, accessible to its members, associate members as well as to a group of international affiliate members. It provides a mentoring structure for support of junior faculty enrolled with the center and promotes collaborative multidisciplinary studies centered on the key thematic focus of the AIM center – fundamental study of autophagy and its role in disease. The AIM has International Council of Affiliate Members (ICAM) on all continents. The ICAM is complemented by the National Council of Affiliate (NCAM) members. NCAM is organized in sections by clinical disciplines/specialties, and at present has cardiology and nephrology sections.

Walden won the 2018 Eisner Award for Best Reality-Based Work for her graphic novel Spinning, making her one of the youngest Eisner Award winners ever. ==Early life== Tillie Walden grew up in New Jersey and Austin, Texas. Walden was shaped by her childhood move from New Jersey to Texas. She was a competitive ice skater. Walden is named after her paternal grandmother, an artist who died before Walden was born. Walden's first comic was a black-and-white comic \\"about never knowing her [grandmother] but following in her footsteps.\\" A workshop led by Scott McCloud had been a major turning point in her career, given it \\"really inspired [her] to draw some comics, and around this time [she] was also becoming increasingly bored with fine art\\". Growing up, Walden read a lot of manga. This greatly influenced her work, leading her to focus more on line than shape or color. The biggest manga artist that had an impact on her was Yoshihiro Togashi, creator of the manga Hunter x Hunter. Additionally, in an interview, Walden said \\"Studio Ghibli has completely shaped my visual vocabulary and how I think about stories.\\" Walden is said to have also been influenced by graphic memoirs, such as Fun Home by Alison Bechdel, Blankets by Craig Thompson and Stitches by David Small. Walden began putting her comics and drawings on her website, and was discovered while still in high school by British publisher Avery Hill Publishing, who worked with Walden to publish her first graphic novel, The End of Summer. ==Career== Walden's debut graphic novel, The End of Summer, was published by Avery Hill in June 2015. It is told from the viewpoint of Lars, a feeble boy who lives in a fantastical palace and has a giant cat named Nemo. In an interview with Paul Gravett, she dedicates the book to her twin brother, John. She describes the main characters as being a mishmash of her and John. Walden won the 2016 Ignatz Award for outstanding artist for The End of Summer. Her second graphic novel, I Love This Part, was published by Avery Hill in November 2015 and tells the story of two teenage girls who fall in love. Walden won the 2016 Ignatz Award for promising new talent for I Love This Part. The novel was also nominated for the 2016 Eisner Award for Best Single Issue/One-Shot. Walden's third graphic novel, A City Inside, was published by Avery Hill in 2016. It won the 2016 Broken Frontier Award for Best One-Shot. Spinning, Walden's first graphic novel memoir about her years coming-of-age as a competitive ice skater, was published by First Second Books in September 2017. Originally, Spinning was Walden's thesis work for the Center for Cartoon Studies (CCS) during her second year of schooling there. It won the 2018 Eisner Award for Best Reality-Based Work, making Walden one of the youngest Eisner Award winners ever at 22. Walden's On a Sunbeam, a science fiction webcomic, was nominated for the 2017 Eisner Award for Best Digital Comic. The webcomic was adapted into a graphic novel that was released in October 2018 by First Second Books, with the UK edition published by Avery Hill Publishing . Set in space, the story revolves around a crew in charge of rebuilding structures, which allows them to acknowledge the past. As Mia, the newest member, gets to know her team, a flashback occurs where she fell in love with another student named Grace. As time progresses and bonds are formed, Mia inevitably opens up about her reasoning for joining their ship - to find the love she lost. This piece is Walden's first take on science fiction. The graphic novel won the 2018 Los Angeles Times Book Prize. To commemorate International Women's Day, Walden's piece \\"Minutes\\" was featured as a Google Doodle on March 8, 2018. In 2019, Walden published Are You Listening? from First Second Books, which earned her the 2020 Eisner Award for Best Graphic Album-New.https://www.comic-con.org/awards/eisner-awards-current- info ==Personal life== Walden has known she was a lesbian since she was 5. Before she came out, Walden avoided including queer characters in her stories, feeling that she \\"couldn't draw openly gay characters if [she] was still scared to be openly gay\\". Walden spoke of her father's influence on her entrance into the comics industry. As said in an interview, \\"My dad has been the behind-the-scenes guy for my entire comics career. I realized that when I start looking, he’s been everywhere.\\" Walden is a graduate of the Center for Cartoon Studies. ==ReferencesOn a Sunbeam (webcomic) Category:1996 births Category:21st-century American artists Category:21st- century American women writers Category:American female comics artists Category:American graphic novelists Category:American webcomic creators Category:Artists from Austin, Texas Category:Eisner Award winners Category:Female comics writers Category:Ignatz Award winners Category:Ignatz Award winners for Outstanding Artist Category:Lesbian artists Category:Lesbian writers Category:LGBT artists from the United States Category:LGBT comics creators Category:LGBT people from New Jersey Category:LGBT people from Texas Category:LGBT writers from the United States Category:Living people ","title":"Tillie Walden"},{"id":"56646865","text":"Richard Henry Jelf (2 February 1844 – 26 April 1913) was a British army officer and commandant of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. ==Early life== Jelf was born in Oxford, the third and youngest son of the Reverend Doctor Richard William Jelf (1798-1871), Principal of King's College, London, and canon of Christ Church, Oxford.

Sissoko was a member of the National Assembly between 2002 and 2014. He was born in the village of Dabia, to the west of Mali’s capital, Bamako. Little is known of Sissoko's early life.This playboy swindled a Dubai Bank out of $242 million with black magic Retrieved on 24 Feb 2018 With this money obtained from the bank, Sissoko could fulfill \\"his dream of opening an airline for West Africa\\". A used Hawker-Siddeley 125 and a pair of old Boeing 727s were the first airplanes he bought. In this way he founded Air Dabia, named after his native village. He was said to have swindled the Dubai Islamic Bank for US$242 million using claims he could perform black magic, a claim he denies saying he only went into the bank to receive a car loan. He could do it with the help of the bank manager, Mohammed Ayoub. From 1995 to 1998, Ayoub made 183 transfers into Sissoko's accounts around the world.The “Black Magic” Playboy who took Dubai Islamic Bank to brink of Collapse Retrieved on 24 Feb 2018 In 1996, Sissoko was arrested for trying to buy two Huey helicopters for Gambia. Because they could \\"be refitted as gunships\\", it was necessary to obtain a special export licence. Sissoko's men tried to circumvent this and offered a $30,000 bribe to a customs officer. They were arrested and Interpol issued a warrant for Sissoko's arrest too. Sissoko was arrested in Geneva, where he tried to open a new bank account. Sissoko was quickly extradited to the US, where he mobilised influential supporters. Among his defence team was the former US Senator Birch Bayh. The US government wanted \\"Sissoko held in custody, but he was bailed\\" for 20 million USA dollars. He was prosecuted for paying an illegal gratuity and served 43 days in jail and paid a $250,000 fine. After serving only half this sentence, he was given \\"early release in return for a $1 million payment to a homeless shelter,\\" to serve the rest of his sentence under the house arrest in Mali. At this time Ayoub confessed taking money from the Dubai bank; he was arrested and sentenced to three years for fraud in jail. From 2002 to 2014 Sissoko was a member of Parliament in Mali which gave him immunity from prosecution. It is also alleged that he was ordered to undergo an exorcism to \\"cure him of black magic\\". In the late 1990s, Sissoko made plans to construct a large hotel in Bamako, on the north bank of the Niger River. The structure was never finished, however, owing to Sissoko's financial and legal woes; the site was purchased by Libyan investors in 2007 and renamed the Afriqiyah Hotel. Following the downfall of Libyan leader Mu'amar al-Kadafi in 2011, construction was again halted. The site was subsequently purchased by Moroccan investors, but as of 2019 it remained unfinished. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Malian politicians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Malian criminals ","title":"Foutanga Babani Sissoko"},{"id":"56646947","text":"Dave de Hugard (born 1945) is an Australian musician and folklorist.

The organization was created following the desegregation of schools in Arkansas, to attempt to prevent \\"any attempts by Negroes to enter white schools\\" in the state. The group joined two other militant white supremacist organizations in September 1955 to attempt to intimidate the local school board of Hoxie to reverse its decision to integrate its schools. The group's intimidating actions were so severe that a federal judge said they amounted to terrorism and placed an injunction on the organization and its affiliates to prevent them from contacting or otherwise interfering with the school board. This was the first time in U.S. history that a federal court had placed such an injunction on white supremacist intimidation. The group was affiliated with the White Citizens' Councils that existed throughout the United States during the Civil Rights Movement, as well as other state and regional segregationist organizations. A year after its formation, White America, Inc., merged with the official White Citizens' Council chapter in Little Rock. ==Background== While the Civil Rights Movement was ongoing, several anti-integration groups founded to attempt to stop the racial desegregation and removals of discrimination which were beginning to occur. One such network of organizations was the White Citizens' Councils, which founded in 1954, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling Brown v. Board of Education, that same year, that stated state laws permitting white and black segregation were found to be unconstitutional. While the decision effectively overturned the Plessy v. Ferguson decision of 1896, which allowed states to segregate schools stating \\"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal\\", there was no true enforcement of this ruling in the south for many years. Blatant discrimination continued to take place for decades via Jim Crow laws, which had mandated racial segregation in all public facilities in the states of the former Confederate States of America, and continued to be enforced in many ways until 1965. ==History== White America, Inc., was founded by three white supremacist employees of the Cotton Belt Railroad in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, in February 1955. They formed the organization to, in the words of one of the co-founders, \\"perpetuate the white race and to endeavor to have this and future generations free of contamination of Negro blood\\". The organization's main goal was to prevent or stop racial integration in the state's schools. The president of the group stated they were going to stop \\"any attempts by Negroes to enter white schools\\" and that they would do so \\"on a peaceable basis_through legal action\\", but warned if that failed that \\"the people\\" would \\"take matters into their own hands\\". The organization believed that the Brown vs. Board of Education ruling by the United States Supreme Court violated states' rights. The co-founder and organization president, L. D. Poynter, stated at a meeting in Pine Bluff that if integration happened \\"in a few years we won't be able to identify ourselves as white or black\\". The articles of incorporation of White America, Inc., entitled the executive office of the organization to the \\"Pine Bluff Labor Temple\\". In February 1955 the group circulated a petition to request the state to place a referendum on the ballot to force the state government to \\"prevent integration\\". The petition garnered over 6,000 signatures and was submitted to state senator Lawrence Blackwell. In February 1956, a primary gubernatorial candidate (eventually elected as the 38th Governor of Arkansas), Orval Faubus, stated he held no objections to state employees signing the petition to have a pro- segregation measure placed on the ballot that November. The following month White America, Inc., commended Faubus for his statement; according to Amis Guthridge, the group's executive secretary, Faubus had \\"finally declared himself for the principles which White America stands for\\", but stopped short of endorsing him for the 1956 Arkansas gubernatorial election. The organization worked with other white supremacist and anti-integration groups in the state, including the Hoxie Committee for Segregation and the White Citizen's Council of Arkansas. ===Hoxie school integration dispute=== As in most areas in the Jim Crow south, Hoxie, Arkansas, had a segregated school system. This remained in place until June 11, 1955, after the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, the local school superintendent requested and received the unanimous support of the school board to integrate the entirety of the school system, including restrooms and cafeterias.Jerry Vervack, Road to Armageddon: Arkansas and Brown v. Board of Education, May 17, 1954, to September 2, 1957. (Fayetteville, Arkansas: MA Thesis, University of Arkansas, (1978). When local segregationists heard of the decision they converged in the summer of 1955 to attempt to intimidate the superintendent and school board to reverse the decision. They called for the removal of the local school board, and even threatened the life of the superintendent. To further intimidate the local community the groups began performing drive-by shootings of homes where black schoolchildren lived. Guthridge stated that school integration was a \\"plan that was founded in Moscow in 1924 to mongrelize the white race in America\\" and claimed that white Methodist women \\"want integration so that the Negro can get in the white bedroom\\". In Hoxie School District No. 46 of Lawrence Co., Ark. v. Brewer, 137 F. Supp. 364, the first time the federal government had ever intervened in a case of white supremacist's intimidation, U.S. federal judge Albert L. Reeves ruled that the actions by the anti- integration groups amounted to acts of terrorism, and ordered them to stop interfering with the Hoxie school board. White America, Inc., immediately appealed the injunction to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the ruling by the lower court. The Eighth Circuit ruling stated that the segregationists' conduct \\"was deliberately aimed at preventing the school board from affording to all the children within the school district the equal protection of the laws\\". Assisted by the Hoxie Committee for Segregation, White America, Inc., began a campaign to enroll over 100,000 members statewide for $2 ($18.23 adjusted for inflation in 2018) a year. Guthridge, stated they intended to enlist over two thousand people in Lawrence County alone, after the Hoxie school integration dispute. ==Merger== In late 1956, after the group's unsuccessful segregation attempts in Hoxie, White America, Inc., merged with the Arkansas chapter of the White Citizens' Council. ==See also== *Ku Klux Klan *Dixiecrat ==References== Category:White supremacist groups in the United States Category:Segregated schools in the United States Category:Anti-black racism in the United States Category:1955 establishments in Arkansas Category:1956 disestablishments in Arkansas Category:Terrorism in the United States ","title":"White America, Inc."},{"id":"56646980","text":"Andrew Forbes (born 1993 in Perth, Scotland) an organist, harpsichordist and conductor.

He claimed to be a descendant of Mithridates VI of Pontus, the earlier king of Pontus who had also ruled the Bosporus. Through this, he claimed the throne of the Bosporan Kingdom in 17 BC. The real king of the Bosporus, Asander starved himself because of this. He somehow convinced the wife of Asander, Dynamis to marry him. When Augustus learned of what Scribonius had done he sent Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa to remove Scribonius. Agrippa then sent Polemon I of Pontus to remove Scribonius and take the throne himself. Scribonius was executed in 16 BC, and Polemon took the throne. To legitimise his claim he married Dynamis.

Appearing in both Dark Souls and Dark Souls III, it is the seat of the power of the gods, deities of the Dark Souls world who used the power of the First Flame to destroy the Everlasting Dragons that once controlled it. By the time of Dark Souls, however, it has become an abandoned lost city, as Lord Gwyn had long since sacrificed himself to rekindle the fading First Flame. Anor Londo has been cited by critics for its design as well as the level's high difficulty, including a section guarded by two powerful archers, and the level's final boss duo, Ornstein and Smough. == Level content == ===Dark Souls=== The player character arrives in Anor Londo after completing Sen's Fortress. After dispatching the boss of the area, the Iron Golem, the player is carried over the otherwise sealed-off wall of Anor Londo by a pack of winged demons. As one of the only non-ruined areas of Lordran, Anor Londo stands in contrast to the other levels of the game. Following their arrival, the player must then travel to Gwyn's Keep to obtain the Lordvessel, passing many obstacles. This includes a duo of Silver Knight archers that guard the buttress leading to a side balcony entrance of the Keep. After fighting their way through the Keep itself, the player must face the level's dual bosses, Dragonslayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough, to gain access to Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight. She awards the player the Lordvessel, allowing the player to warp away from the level. ===Dark Souls III=== When the player revisits Anor Londo, it is bathed in moonlight, frozen over, and has fallen to visible levels of decay. Pathways near the central elevator have crumbled, and force the player to explore a different side of the city. Additionally, a new path exists where a former bonfire once stood. The terrain of Lordran has also clearly shifted heavily over time, with large chunks of Anor Londo and its surrounding walls having vanished, and a new palace being visible in the distance. As the player progresses into Lord Gwyn's keep, parts are blocked off by collapse, and the entire location is waterlogged, full of debris, but decorated with new features such as cloth curtains. In the same room where Ornstein and Smough were formerly fought, the player must face Aldrich, Devourer of Gods, in order to obtain his power and return it to Firelink Shrine. == Plot == Anor Londo was created by Gwyn, ruler of the gods, to consolidate his power after ushering in the Age of Fire. Many centuries later, upon the fading of the First Flame, he was forced to leave the city along with half of his Silver Knight army to rekindle the flame. At the time of Dark Souls, the only remaining deity in Anor Londo is Gwyndolin, who presides over the Darkmoon covenant. He creates the illusion of sunlight, as well as Princess Gwynevere, to compel the Chosen Undead to defeat Gwyn and rekindle the First Flame yet again. If the player attacks Gwynevere, the illusion is shattered and the city reverts to its true appearance, shrouded in darkness. By the time of Dark Souls III, the city was repopulated and renamed Irithyll, until it became deserted again upon the onset of the Undead Curse. Gwyn's Keep is now an ancient ruin housing Aldrich, Devourer of Gods, a former human who mutated into an amorphous blob due to his cannibalism, and consumed the very body and soul of Gwyndolin, becoming a Lord of Cinder. == Development == The artistic design of Anor Londo was inspired by the Milan Cathedral, or Duomo. Anor Londo was designed to feel like a reward after completing Sen's Fortress, but also presented no clear path to the player, forcing them to take a number of side paths, like walking up the flying buttresses. The city's spiral staircases were meant to represent life. The city's design was inspired by that of Milan Cathedral, which was visited in person by Dark Souls designer Masanori Waragai. The game's director, Hidetaka Miyazaki, stated that he regretted the fact that the sense of excitement the player felt upon entry to Anor Londo was not continued for the level's entirety. == Reception == Edge called Anor Londo \\"as beautiful as it is deadly\\" and \\"where Dark Souls casts off restraint\\". Comparing it to the Divine Comedy, and the strata traversed by Dante in the poem, they equated Anor Londo with Heaven, and that it therefore \\"makes sense that it's the one area in the game you are incapable of reaching by your own agency\\". Calling the first glimpses of Anor Londo \\"dazzling\\", they state that since Dark Souls is \\"so bleak at times, so starved of warmth and light\\", the city's beauty \\"seems almost eye-shadingly pornographic\\". Kotaku cited the environmental storytelling of the city's design, where the obvious path forward is blocked, showing the player they do not belong there. Patrick Klepek of Kotaku called the appearance of Anor Londo in Dark Souls III a \\"highlight\\" of his playthrough and the city's architecture \\"beautiful\\" and \\"haunting\\". Den of Geek called Anor Londo one of \\"gaming's greatest levels\\", saying that it \\"represents the core appeal of Dark Souls\\", by being designed to \\"intimidate and impress\\" the player, as well as being full of mysteries. Cian Maher of The Washington Post called Anor Londo one of the \\"eight wonders of the virtual world\\", calling the \\"gorgeously lit skyline\\" \\"striking\\" in comparison to the darkness of the rest of the game, and stating that \\"the people - or deities - who inhabit the city also contribute to its sublimity.\\" Eurogamer called revisiting Anor Londo in Dark Souls III a \\"surreal, melancholy experience\\" that \\"ranks among Dark Souls III's many high points\\", but also \\"shows how the series line has evolved, both technically and in its visual direction\\". The Silver Knight archers of Anor Londo were criticized by PC Gamer's Joe Donnelly as the moment he fell out of love with the game, saying that the game never felt unfair until that moment. The entire city, including a dungeon and boss, was remade in Minecraft. == References == Category:Video game locations Category:Video game levels Category:Fictional sealed locations Category:Fictional lost cities and towns Category:Souls (series) ","title":"Anor Londo"},{"id":"56647147","text":"Tanay Thyagarajan (born 15 November 1995) is an Indian cricketer.

The centerpiece of the system is a tamper-resistant security tape (sticker) with an embedded hologram. Each sticker carries a unique alphanumeric code. The sticker is affixed to all game-used merchandise and memorabilia, while information about the item is entered into a computer database. Between 500,000 and 600,000 items are authenticated each season. == Background == Major League Baseball started running an authentication program in 2001 after the FBI discovered during an investigation that 75 percent of autographs purported to be from MLB players and other personnel were fake. The organization has had a long-running issue with counterfeiting in general, which peaks during the postseason. For example, during the 2011 National League Championship Series between the St Louis Cardinals and the Milwaukee Brewers, MLB officials confiscated over 5,000 counterfeited items, with more than 80 percent being found in the vicinity of Busch Stadium. The largest haul is during the World Series, when thousands of knock-off jerseys, caps, bags, and other items of merchandise are seized. During the San Francisco Giants’ 2014 World Series race, United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents seized over 2,700 pieces of counterfeit MLB merchandise in the San Francisco Bay Area. == Program description == The authentication system centers on a hologram sticker by OpSec, which carries its own individual alphanumeric code. The sticker is tamper-resistant: the embedded hologram is ruined if the sticker is removed from the item. MLB employs approximately 150 authenticators, with four being appointed to each team. An MLB authenticator will be present at every MLB game as well as the World Baseball Classic and team-specific events. MLB postseason games will have three or more authenticators. The authenticators all have a background in law enforcement and are recommended to the role by their local police departments. The authenticator usually sits in the first base camera well. Every ball that is taken out of play, without leaving the ballpark, is handed to the authenticator, who enters information about that ball into a computer database—such as \\"the pitcher, batter, inning and the reason the ball came out of play\\"—and then affixes the hologram. While anything that goes into the stands is generally considered outside their jurisdiction, if there is a batter's milestone occurring, the authenticators will often work with the umpires to mark up baseballs to ensure that even if the milestone ball is hit into the stands, it can be tracked and later authenticated. == Items authenticated == Baseball autographed by Juan Lagares Usually the MLB Authentication Program authenticates items used during baseball games, with baseballs and baseball bats being the most common. Other game-used items which are authenticated include \\"player jerseys, locker tags, lineup cards, the pitching rubber, home plate, broken bats\\", and base pads. Any player can request that any item be authenticated, with the request usually being passed to the authenticators by the relevant clubhouse manager. Any item with an MLB association can be authenticated. One example of this was when the Baltimore Orioles authenticated the remains of a dugout telephone that was smashed by the Boston Red Sox's David Ortiz. They then presented the phone to Ortiz during his retirement season. After the Houston Astros' Game 7 win in the 2017 World Series at Dodger Stadium, MLB authenticated jars of dirt taken from the field. Between 500,000 and 600,000 items are authenticated each season. Game- used memorabilia remains the property of each team, which authenticates items for players who have reached certain milestones, for sale to fans at the team store or on the MLB online store, and for sale to retailers and other marketers of authenticated MLB merchandise. Occasionally items are sent for inclusion in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. In 2001 MLB Properties contracted with the Arthur Andersen accounting firm to oversee and authenticate private autographing sessions for balls, bats, base pads, and other items. The Deloitte & Touche accounting firm took over this role in 2002. == References == == External links == *MLB authentication program Category:Major League Baseball Category:2001 establishments in the United States Category:Baseball memorabilia ","title":"Major League Baseball Authentication Program"},{"id":"56647405","text":"Schloss Gymnich, location of the first informal meeting of EU foreign ministers A Gymnich meeting is an informal meeting of the foreign ministers of the member states of the European Union, organized according to the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union since 1974 (every six months).

At one time she was accused of having been a spy for the Soviet Union, a claim which she always denied. ==Biography== Hart was the daughter of John Fischer Williams, a barrister, who for a time worked in France, where she obtained her early education. She later attended Downe House School. In 1932, she was admitted to Somerville College, Oxford, where she read History. Her mother was descended from the Dukes of Atholl and her sister was Judith Hubback. In 1933, she joined the Communist Party of Great Britain. Three years later she joined the Civil Service after having achieved better marks in the examinations than any woman had previously done, it being unusual for a woman even to aspire to a career in the Civil Service. She became private secretary to the Permanent Under-secretary, Sir Alexander Maxwell. Although she admitted to having had a meeting with spymaster Arnold Deutsch early in her career, she claimed not to have been recruited or passed any confidential information to him or to other Communist Party members. In 1983, an edition of the BBC's Timewatch programme revealed that she had been interviewed in the 1960s by Peter Wright and others about her political activities, and this led to controversy since she was the wife of H. L. A. Hart, himself a former intelligence officer. She married Herbert Hart in 1941, and resigned from the Civil Service in 1945 when he became a Fellow of New College, Oxford. She herself later became a research fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford, and eventually a Fellow of St Anne's College, Oxford, where she remained until 1981; she admitted her disappointment at not having become Principal. Her pupils included Rose Dugdale. Jenifer Hart was for a time a university representative on Oxford City Council. Her husband became Principal of Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1973. The BBC revelations about her Communist associations led to an article in The Sunday Times, referring to her as \\"a Russian spy\\". She and her husband threatened to sue the paper, which later printed an apology. Herbert Hart had a nervous breakdown shortly afterwards, which was attributed to the stress of the situation. The Harts had four children, but Herbert admitted to having little interest in sex and suspected Jenifer of having affairs with other men, including Sir Isaiah Berlin.

A week before the film's release, it was leaked on the piracy website. Trance was released in Kerala on 20 February 2020, and across India on 28 February. The film opened to positive reviews from critics, praising Faasil's performance, the direction, writing and screenplay. At the box-office, the film's performance was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as the theatres were shut down. Later, the film was released through digital platforms. Later, the Telugu dubbing rights were bought by a popular Telugu production house named Geetha Arts and the Telugu dubbed version was released digitally on their digital platform Aha. ==Plot== Viju Prasad is a small-time motivational speaker living in Kanyakumari with his mentally unstable younger brother, Kunjan. When Kunjan commits suicide, Viju is devastated and relocates to Mumbai. There through a casting director he had once met at Kanyakumari, Viju meets businessmen Solomon Davis and Issac Thomas, who hire Viju to pose as a Christian pastor and perform hoax miracles. He is sent to Kochi where he is trained for his role by their associate Avarachan, who changes Viju's name to Joshua Carlton. Initially hesitant, Viju successfully transforms into the character of Joshua. He captures the devotion of many and help Solomon and Issac's enterprise grow into a global phenomenon. At the height of his fame, Joshua is invited to an TV interview by a reporter named Matthews. On air, Matthews demands a live miracle. Joshua secretly drugs Matthews during a commercial break, causing him to collapse in front of the camera. The event is initially hailed as a miracle but a subsequent blood report proves that he was drugged. Furious at having put their enterprise in trouble, Solomon and Issac attack Joshua, leading him to be hospitalised with severe head injuries. He remains in coma for two days and they decide to quietly kill him to avoid any further trouble. On the third day, Joshua starts moving about and shatters the glass by his bedside, making a miraculous recovery. He renegotiates his deal with Solomon and Issac to secure 80% of the profits for himself. Suspecting that Joshua is mentally ill, Solomon and Issac agree. They appoint a model and sex worker named Esther Lopez to observe him and determine whether his illness is an act. Esther herself has a past of being cheated in a relationship, giving birth to a child, falling into depression and then coming into this profession. Esther eventually grows close to Joshua and believes that he is really unstable. When she reports this to Solomon and Issac, she is immediately taken away. Avarachan tries to convince Joshua that Esther was a figment of his imagination. Meanwhile, a poor man named Thomas, who is an ardent follower of Joshua, tries to cure his young daughter's fever through his miracle cures. When she ultimately succumbs to her sickness, Joshua is devastated. He comes clean to Thomas and points him to Solomon and Isaac as the masterminds behind the scam. Joshua tries to publicise the truth by sending a confessional tape to Matthews. Matthews is killed on Solomon's orders but in his dying moments, manages to air the video. As it goes public, Avarachan suffers a fatal stroke. Thomas kills Solomon and Isaac to avenge his daughter's death. Joshua is acquitted from his crimes due to his mental state and spends time at a rehabilitation centre. When he recovers, he learns that Esther is in fact a real person and sets out to Amsterdam to find her. He finds her in one of the glass cubicles in the Red light area in Amsterdam. They see each other, and as she runs to him, the film cuts to black to the sound of shattering glass. == Cast == * Fahadh Faasil as Viju Prasad / Pastor Joshua Carlton * Dileesh Pothan as Avarachan * Nazriya Nazim as Esther Lopez * Gautham Menon as Solomon Davis * Soubin Shahir as Mathew Varghese * Chemban Vinod Jose as Issac Thomas * Vinayakan as Thomas * Sreenath Bhasi as Kunjan, Vijus's Brother * Jinu Joseph as Dr. Jase John * Srinda Arhaan as Latha * Aswathi Menon as Kavitha * Arjun Ashokan as Paul * Dharmajan Bolgatty as Soji * Amalda Liz as Sheeba, Thomas' Wife * Unnimaya Prasad as Shani, News Reporter * Joju George as News Reader * Arushi Mudgal as Viju's And Kunjan's Mother * Dilan as Young Viju * Dian as Young Kunjan * Anu K.

Trance was officially announced with a title poster in June 2017. The film was produced by Rasheed himself. The film marks the debut of Vincent Vadakkan as screenwriter. Rasheed was earlier supposed to direct a short in 5 Sundarikal (2013) based on the screenplay by Vadakkan. But it did not work out as he did not get the right cast. Later, Vadakkan narrated the story of Trance, but then he was not ready to produce the film because of its high production cost. Rasheed had Fahadh in mind for the lead role then itself. Later, Fahadh happened to hear the story from Vadakkan and insisted Rasheed to reconsider the project. By then, the storyline had changed and bankability of Fahadh had also grown and Rasheed was confident in producing the film. ===Filming=== Filming began in July 2017. A week-long first schedule of filming was completed in December 2017 in Mumbai. For the first time in Malayalam cinema, Bolt High Speed Cinebot cameras were used to shoot some scenes in the film. The film is shot with sync sound. The film was shot mainly in coastal Kanyakumari, across various locations in India and Dubai. In July 2019, it as reported that Trance is expected to cost close to ₹20 crore when it completes production. Amal Neerad was the cinematographer and Resul Pookutty was the film's sound designer. Filming was completed on 1 September 2019. The film was made on a budget of ₹35 crore. ==Themes and influences== The film deals with the themes of substance dependence, religion, and the commercialization of spirituality. In an interview with The Hindu, Faasil said the film \\"is about dependency, be it on drugs, religion or emotions. Religion has become a business these days. [...] What we are trying to say in Trance is that humanity and compassion come above religion.\\" Vineeth Chacko of The Deccan Herald said the film depicted how \\"a struggle with depression, unmonitored ingestion of antidepressants and an illusory lifestyle can combine to tear away the seams between dreams and reality ... Viju has bought into his own hype and has come to believe on some level in his incredible miracles.\\" The film studies the intersection between science and faith, dealing \\"with two kinds of drugs — the psychotropic sort (both legal and illegal) and religion/faith. If the first is being developed by scientists in laboratories, Trance shows us how religion too can be manufactured, not at temples or churches as one might think, but at five-star hotel lobbies (the lobby in the film looks like it’s the abode of Gods) with a “we-mean-business” attitude you'd associate with a startup pitch or a job interview.\\" Writing for Silverscreen India, Aswathy Gopalakrishnan said that the film showcased \\"the green room of the controversial faith-healing business that exploits gullible masses.\\" Critics also noted allusions to godmen such as Osho and Benny Hinn. Film critic Baradwaj Rangan observed that \\"Christian symbolism spills over from every frame\\", citing Joshua Carlton's initials, his third-day \\"resurrection\\" and the Holy Trinity of businessmen as examples. Characters in the film also drew parallels to biblical and mythological figures, such as Esther to Mary Magdelene, Solomon to his namesake, Matthews to Icarus, and Thomas to Abraham and later to the Grim Reaper. ==Music== The soundtrack album was composed and produced by Rex Vijayan's brother Jackson Vijayan, in his debut as a music composer. Vijayan also contributed to the film score along with Sushin Shyam. The album features a title track composed by Vinayakan TK. The album which was released under the Muzik 247 label on 15 January 2020, features six tracks along with the title track with lyrics written by Vinayak Sasikumar for most of the tracks, with Kamal Karthik and Blaaze providing additional lyrics. Actor Soubin Shahir, made his debut as a playback singer, rendering the track \\"Mathayichan\\" along with Sreenath Bhasi and Blaze. The track \\"Noolupoya\\" was served as the lead single which released on 3 January 2020. Sneha Khanwalkar, Pradeep Kumar, Varun Sunil, Neha S. Nair, Shakthisree Gopalan, Rex Vijayan amongst others contributed vocals for the soundtrack album. ==Release== The film's release was postponed multiple times. It was initially scheduled to be released on 22 March 2019. Then there were plans to release the film during Eid al-Fitr (5 June 2019), but was later shifted to Onam festival (11 September 2019) due to pending visual effects work. It was again scheduled to release on 20 December 2019, coinciding with the Christmas festival, before postponing to February 2020 due to delay in post-production work. Then it was scheduled to 14 February 2020 on Valentine's Day. But the regional Central Board of Film Certification in Thiruvananthapuram referred the film to a revising committee in Mumbai since Rasheed was not willing to cut a 17-minute long sequence that could hurt religious sentiments. On 15 February 2020, the film was leaked on the website Tamil Rockers a week ahead of its release. The film was released in Kerala on 20 February 2020. The film was made available through Amazon Prime Video on 1 April 2020. == Reception == Vineeth T. Chacko of Deccan Herald gave 4.5 in a scale of 5, entitled as \\"A thought-provoking daze\\" and said: \\"Trance is another such effort that is courageous, thought-provoking and encourages conversations about issues that matter to us on a personal level and speaks to society as a whole. An avant- garde achievement in filmmaking anchored by a sublime Fahadh\\". He applauds the film score, lighting and color palette. Goutham V. S. of The Indian Express rated 3.5 in 5 and said: \\"The abstract style of filmmaking, and the narrative structure that visualises the complex layers of the protagonist’s psyche is bound to make Trance a trendsetter in the Malayalam film industry ... Fahadh steals the limelight by portraying a character that is hysteric and disturbing at the same time\\". He also praised the \\"vivid visualisation, colour tones and the brilliant use of sounds\\" and cinematography and background score. Critic from Sify also rated 3.5 in 5, describing the film \\"bold and thrilling\\", writing \\"Trance is a genuine and brave attempt that is gripping from start to finish ... Anwar has packaged the movie deliciously, adding lots of emotions, in an honest way. With top notch visuals, music and sound the viewer is in for a grand experience ... But in a way, this film belongs to Fahadh Faasil, who is absolutely brilliant\\". Prem Udayabhanu from Malayala Manorama gave 3.5 in 5, stating that \\"it is psychedelic and vibrant, flamboyant and gripping ... Trance is magical, hysterical and depressing and you need to transcend the mundane line of cinematic offerings to relish it\\". He praised the sound design, background score and cinematography. Rating 3.5 out of 5, Sajin Shrijith of The New Indian Express said: \\"If you are into films with a slightly eccentric touch, you may find yourself overwhelmed by the overall audio-visual experience ... Anwar Rasheed, cinematographer Amal Neerad, editor Praveen Prabhakar, and composers Sushin Shyam-Jackson Vijayan keep us hooked by delivering a film that feels part-dream, part-nightmare. However, post- interval, you begin to sense Trance losing some of the potency established in the first half\\". Cris from The News Minute also gave 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that \\"Fahadh delivers a great performance ... Anwar's filmmaking keeps you engaged the entire first half during which a captivating story begins to unfold. The last half does not keep up to the first, scenes that you enjoyed earlier becoming stretched, almost like you took a pill yourself and everything seems to take too long. But it doesn't let you down, with some excellent performances coming from a very promising cast\\". Sanjith Sidhardhan of The Times of India awarded 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated: \\"Fahadh as a subdued Viju and the flamboyant Joshua is the maniacal energy that drives the film ... Director Anwar gets the first half absolutely right in its pacing and content.

The makers seem to have chosen style over substance in the latter half\\". He praised the cinematography and background score. Rating 2.5 in 5, Nirmal Jovial from The Week wrote that \\"Trance is definitely a bold attempt for its theme, as far as Malayalam cinema is concerned. But it fails to do justice to the theme it explores with its weak script that becomes so cluttered and confused towards the third act\\", but praised the cinematography. S. R. Praveen of The Hindu called it \\"a half-baked attempt\\", stating \\"the first half of the film, which captures this transformation is gripping, owing much to Fahadh's performance, ... The film attains its high by the interval point, almost having the viewer in a trance ... Unfortunately, from there, the script goes downhill. One gets to see the writer taking the easy way out at crucial points, bumping off-key characters in a tame manner and depending on the usual television newsbreaks to untangle tricky situations\\". Critic Veeyen states that \\"‘Trance’ does address a theme that is radically important and proffers a compelling investigation into the unexplored realms of religion, faith and belief.\\" But he adds that ..\\"it's also a movie that eventually gets choked by the mistiness that pervades its plot and design, and ends up a pale shadow of the head turner flick that it should have been. == References == == External links == * Category:2020 films Category:2020s Malayalam-language films Category:Indian films Category:2020s psychological drama films Category:Indian psychological drama films Category:Films directed by Anwar Rasheed Category:Films set in Tamil Nadu Category:Films shot in Tamil Nadu Category:Films set in Amsterdam Category:Films set in Mumbai Category:Films shot in Mumbai Category:Films shot in Dubai Category:Films shot in Amsterdam Category:Films with atheism-related themes Category:Films critical of the Catholic Church Category:Films set in hospitals ","title":"Trance (2020 film)"},{"id":"56647658","text":"Darya Starostina (born 19 October 1982) is a Kazakhstani cross-country skier.

It was demolished on 3 June 1933. ==History== Collyer Quay, Johnston's Pier is on the right After the establishment of Singapore as a Strait Settlements port, many buildings along its southern shoreline were directly facing the sea. As business and commerce constantly developed along the waterfront, many merchants set up their businesses at Commercial Square with their godowns backed into the waterfront where they had their own jetties. The idea of constructing a wooden jetty near the godowns of A. L. Johnston & Co. was first mooted to the municipal committee on 26 March 1853 for the convenience of the commercial and shipping interests in Singapore. After consulting the government surveyor, the municipal committee approved the construction of a stone ghaut on 20 July 1853 to be used as a public landing place instead of the wooden jetty as originally intended. In conjunction with the proposed ghaut, a stone embankment stretching from the proposed ghaut to Battery Road would be built. Plans for a jetty known as Johnston's Pier was submitted to the municipal committee about 3 months later. On 19 October 1853, the municipal committee approved the construction of the jetty at an expenditure not exceeding S$3,000. A small house for a pier-keeper would also constructed at the inner end of the pier.http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_517_2005-01-19.html ===Launch=== The Engineer Captain Ronald MacPherson officially announced its completion to the Resident Councillor and Chairman of the municipal committee on 13 March 1856, the pier was named after a prominent Scottish businessman Alexander Laurie Johnston, one of the earliest European settlers who had arrived in Singapore in 1819 and established the first merchant firm A. L. Johnston & Co. there in 1820.http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_535_2004-12-27.html A male pier-keeper was hired at a salary of S$6 per month for the maintaining of the crane as well as lighting and cleaning of the lamps at the pier. The wooden jetty was 40-feet wide and stretched 120-feet into the sea. The red lamps which were placed above the pier had led to many local Chinese of Hokkien origin to name the pier as ang teng beh tau (Chinese: 红灯码头, meaning “red lantern harbour”) and to the Malays as lampu merah (meaning “red lamp”). === Royal visits === Johnston's Pier played host to many royal figures and dignitaries. The visits began in 1869, with the then Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Alfred Ernest Albert. Royal visits were met with great efforts in decoration of the jetty and many areas of the town. Mercantile businesses and private firms participated heavily in welcoming of the royal guests. ===Closure and demolition=== By the 1920s, the pier could no longer handle the increased volume of traffic from docking ships. The pier had soon become dilapidated in the 1930s and the Governor of the Straits Settlements Sir Cecil Clementi approved plans to build a new pier to replace the former.Johnston's Pier, Singapore: completed on 13 March 1856, this jetty cum landing platform stood opposite Fullerton Square. It was torn down on 3 June 1933 Johnston's Pier was closed and had its red lamps transferred to a new pier, Clifford Pier, named after Sir Hugh Clifford, which was opened 3 June 1933. Johnston's Pier had been demolished from 3 June 1933.http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/087ade56-f294-422e-8b6b-05515f9c87bd === Naming controversy === The decision to name the newly constructed pier after Sir Hugh Clifford sparked contention. The Straits Settlements Association of Singapore had several correspondences with the governor Sir Cecil Clementi appealing to retain the name of Johnston for the new pier. Persuasion failed due to the governor refusing to reverse his decision on grounds that Clifford's name was prominent in the region. Several members of the public also showed displeasure at the renaming, believing that the memory of Johnston's Pier would go along with its demolition. Despite the loss of the original name, locals continued to refer to the new pier in its Hokkien and Malay names. ==References== Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Singapore Category:Downtown Core (Singapore) Category:Piers in Singapore Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 1856 Category:1856 establishments in the British Empire Category:1856 establishments in the Straits Settlements Category:1933 disestablishments in the British Empire Category:1933 disestablishments in the Straits Settlements Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1933 ","title":"Johnston's Pier"},{"id":"56647755","text":"This Road may refer to: * This Road (album), a 1992 album by James Blundell ** \\"This Road\\" (James Blundell song), a song by James Blundell from his 1992 album, This Road * \\"This Road\\" (Jars of Clay song), a song by Jars of Clay from their 2000 album, City on a Hill: Songs of Worship and Praise * \\"This Road\\", a song by Ane Brun and Lars Bygdén from the 2005 album, Duets ","title":"This Road"},{"id":"56647805","text":"Moran Victor Hingston Caplat, CBE (1 October 1916 - 19 June 2003) was an English opera manager, associated throughout his career with Glyndebourne Festival Opera. ==Life and career== ===Early years=== Caplat was born in Herne Bay, Kent, the only child of Armand Charles Victor Roger Caplat, a French-born architect, and his wife, Norah Bessie, née Hingston. He was educated locally. When he was fifteen he saw a touring production of Twelfth Night by the Ben Greet company which made him stage-struck, and in 1933 he was accepted as a student at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, London. After graduation from the academy, Caplat acted in repertory companies at Margate and Croydon and toured with Matheson Lang. He appeared in a couple of films and acted in Stephen Spender's first play, Trial of a Judge, at the Unity Theatre, London. His last position as an actor was with the local repertory company in Sevenoaks. Caplat was a keen yachtsman, and with war approaching he joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Supplementary Reserve (known unofficially as the \\"Yachtsman's Reserve\\"). During the Second World War he had a distinguished naval career, ending it as a Lieutenant Commander. In 1943 he married Diana Downton. They had two daughters and two sons, one of whom predeceased his parents.Forbes, Elizabeth. \\"Moran Caplet: Commander for more than 30 years of 'the good ship Glyndebourne'\\" , The Independent, 25 June 2003 Their daughter Simone married the historian David Sekers, son of the industrialist Nicholas Sekers. After Caplat was released from the navy in 1945 a relative put him in touch with Glyndebourne Festival Opera, which was resuming productions after a wartime gap. The company needed an assistant to its manager, Rudolf Bing. The latter was impressed with Caplat, as were the proprietors of the company, John and Audrey Christie, and he took up post at Glyndebourne in October 1945. ===Glyndebourne=== At that time Glyndebourne had close ties with the Edinburgh Festival, where its early post-war productions were premiered. Bing was a key figure of that festival, and in 1947 he was appointed its director. He remained Glyndebourne's general manager, but Caplat had day-to-day responsibility there. In 1949 Bing left Britain for the US, to run the Metropolitan Opera; Caplat was promoted to general manager of Glyndebourne. He remained in the post until he retired, aged sixty-five, in 1981. During his tenure, Glyndebourne increased the length and scope of the festival from fourteen performances of two operas in 1950, to seventy performances of six operas in 1960. Christie retired in 1959, handing the running of the festival to his son George, whom Caplat guided in his early years in charge. Caplat also ensured continuity of Glyndebourne's traditions and standards, through the musical directorships of Fritz Busch, Vittorio Gui, John Pritchard and Bernard Haitink with successive directors of productions, Carl Ebert, Günther Rennert, John Cox and Peter Hall.Forbes, Elizabeth. \\"Caplat, Moran Victor Hingston (1916–2003), actor and opera administrator\\" , Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2007. Retrieved 20 February 2018 Caplat arranged overseas performances of Glyndebourne productions: La Cenerentola in Berlin (1954), Falstaff and Le Comte Ory in Paris (1958); Don Giovanni and Il matrimonio segreto in Sweden, Norway and Denmark (1967) and L'Ormindo in Munich (1969). When Glyndebourne productions were brought to the Proms, Caplat took charge of the semi-staging at the Albert Hall. Another key role was talent spotting. Caplat toured Europe looking for future stars, sometimes accompanied by one or more of the Christies, sometimes on his own. Among those appearing in Glyndebourne productions early in their careers were Sena Jurinac and Birgit Nilsson in 1951 and Luciano Pavarotti in 1964.\\"Obituary: Moran Caplat\\", The Times, 26 June 2003, p. 32Obituary: Luciano Pavarotti\\", The Times, 6 September 2007 Operas receiving their UK professional premieres in Caplat's time included Idomeneo (1951), The Rake's Progress (1953), La voix humaine (1960) and Intermezzo (1974). Caplat encouraged the conductor Raymond Leppard to revive neglected early operas, and Glyndebourne gave the first British productions of L'incoronazione di Poppea (1962) L'Ormindo (1967), La Calisto (1970) and Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1972).\\"Glyndebourne Firsts\\" , Glyndebourne Festival Opera, retrieved 21 February 2017 Caplat was particularly interested in good stage design, hitherto a weakness at Glyndebourne.Boston, p. 224 He brought in leading British designers, including Hugh Casson, Leslie Hurry, Osbert Lancaster, Oliver Messel and John Piper.

He was the fourth son of the Rev.

He received a commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade on 2 September 1834 and was promoted to Captain on 2 September 1842, and to brevet Major on 26 September 1854. He served in South Africa with the Rifle Brigade after landing at Algoa Bay on 20 November 1846 and was promptly posted to the Kei where he took part in the Seventh Xhosa War, mainly in the Amatola Mountains. At the end of hostilities he was appointed Resident Magistrate of East London on 1 January 1849, a post which he held until June 1850 when he returned to England with his regiment. During this period he had a chance encounter with the explorer and painter, Thomas Baines, inviting him to his headquarters at Fort Glamorgan to see his own paintings which included many botanical illustrations. These paintings came to light in 1956 and were purchased by the Botanical Research Institute of Pretoria as a result of efforts by its librarian, Mary Gunn, following a suggestion by Baines' biographer John Peter Richard Wallis. On 30 March 1852 he landed once again at Algoa Bay and set off for the Amatolas to take part in the Eighth Xhosa War, returning to England on 12 November 1853. In July 1854 he sailed from England with his Regiment for the Crimea where they arrived 20 September 1854. From a camp near Beicos Bay, the fleet anchorage in the Bosphorus, he wrote a letter to his brother, George Rooper of Lincoln’s Inn: '''' Edward was wounded at the Battle of Inkerman on 5 November 1854 and died on 11 or 15 November aboard the troop transport ship Golden Fleece on its way to the hospital at Scutari.

This humanist education was probably intended to prepare Gaddi for a career in the church, and at the age of fourteen he took minor orders. His cardinal uncle immediately granted him an income of 1000 scudi a year from the funds of the Diocese of Bologna and later also granted him other income-producing estates of the archdiocese of Cosenza and the Abbey of San Leonardo di Siponto in Apulia. In 1559 Gaddi had an illegitimate daughter named Lucrezia and around the same time he returned to the status of a layman, marrying Emilia, daughter of Lorenzo Ridolfi. Around 1552 he became a knight of the Order of St James of the Sword, then headed by Charles V as King of Spain. After learning how to dress, think, and behave as a knight, Gaddi gave up banking and commerce, in effect becoming more like a , activity which raised him around 50,000 scudi a year, mostly from estates in land and public debt securities. He lived lavishly, keeping a great many servants and horses, exhibiting his collections of art and other objects in his palazzo on the Piazza Madonna degli Aldobrandini in Florence and adding a botanical garden to it. He also hired the Flemish botanist Joseph Goedenhuyze and introduced him to the Grand Dukes of Tuscany. After his first wife's death in 1563, Gaddi married again, this time to Maria, a daughter of Alfonso Strozzi. In 1569 Cosimo de' Medici was granted the title of grand duke by the pope. That same year he sent Gaddi to Mantua and Ferrara to give their lords' news of this promotion and in 1570 he attended Cosimo's coronation in Rome. Between 1573 and 1590 Gaddi was one of those supervising the Stinche Prison in Florence, as well as sitting several times with the 'accoppiatori', those who prepared electoral lists for civil offices which were elected by lot. He was also made a grand-ducal senator on 12 November 1578. In 1575 he was an 'operaio' at Santa Maria del Fiore, in 1579 one of the nine 'conservatori del Dominio', in 1581 the supreme magistrate and in 1582 one of the eight 'guardia e balia'. 1587 was a busy year for him, in which he acted as the health official, one of the reformers of the merchants' statutes and one of the lay reformers of nunneries. In 1588 he was one of the 'Conservatori di leggi', took part in converting the hospice linked to the monastery of San Paolo, Florence into a hospital for convalescents and was also given charge of planning the festivities for Christine of Lorraine's arrival in Florence to marry Ferdinand I. He set up a series of temporary triumphal arches adorned with sculptures and paintings along the path of the procession, commissioning G A Dosio to design them and A. Allori, D. Oresti (known as il Passignano) and G.B. Naldini to produce the paintings. He demanded that the paintings be in oils. However, he is more notable as an art collector and advisor to the Medici art collections. For example, he negotiated their acquisition of \\"a marble portrait head of Homer, the Greek poet\\"Arch. di Stato di Firenze, Guardaroba Mediceo 91, c. 120. He owned around 200 paintings by his death but unusually for his time he also appreciated the preparatory drawings and cartoons made for frescoes - by his death he had even acquired for himself the whole of Giorgio Vasari's Libro de' Disegni. Between 1586 and 1590 he was put in charge of the Uffizi's painting collections, then mostly made up of Medici family portraits. He commissioned works from Giovan Battista Paggi, Naldini, Santi di Tito and Girolamo Macchietti, his favourite artists, who probably also produced works for Gaddi's own collection. He also collected (mostly ancient Roman) statues and vases and by his death owned nine sundials, 2700 medals in different metals, 1270 general books and manuscripts, 130 music books and manuscripts, around 40 musical instruments and a small collection of exotic curiosities, minerals, corals and shells. Gaddi made his will on 11 June 1591 and died three days later - he was buried in his family tomb in Santa Maria Novella. The will added his collection to the trust set up by his father and already including most of his father's goods - if the male Gaddi line died out, the trust was to go to descendants of his sister Maddalena, wife of Jacopo Pitti. However, only a few years after his death, the collection began to be dispersed, despite the best efforts of Vincenzo Gonzaga's wife Eleonora de' Medici - she had made an advance offer to buy the whole collection on 28 June 1591, only a fortnight after Gaddi's death, but this did not prove successful. What remained of Gaddi's library by the 1700s was bought by the grand dukes in 1755, followed by what was left of the artworks in 1774. ==References== category:Italian art collectors category:People from Florence category:1537 births category:1591 deaths ","title":"Niccolò Gaddi (1537–1591)"},{"id":"56647991","text":"The Deputy Chairman of the NATO Military Committee (DCMC) is the deputy head of the NATO Military Committee.

This office was always an American to link the United States and NATO in nuclear strategy. Two dynamics served as the catalyst to establish the Deputy Chairman position on the Military Committee as it reflects today: 1. When the Chairman was away from Brussels, using a Military Representative within the Military Committee as a substitute proved unviable due to the conflict of simultaneously representing the interests of the Military Committee at large and one's own national interests and 2. the Military Committee did not want to create additional high-ranking officer positions to resolve the first issue. As a solution, the Military Committee elected to eliminate the Vice Director of the IMS position and simultaneously establish a new post of Deputy Chairman of the Military Committee. The Deputy position would still maintain the special responsibility for nuclear matters and remain a U.S. officer as established for the Vice- Director position.

Donald was notable for routinely sterilising catgut sutures and for a surgical repair technique for Uterine prolapse that later became known as the Fothergills Repair and later still became known as the Manchester operation ==Life== Donald was the son of John Donald who was a Justice of the peace and Mary Donald née Smarte. Donald took his early education at the Craigmount School before matriculating at the Edinburgh College of Art and graduating in 1880. Donald then transferred to the University of Edinburgh Medical School and graduated with a M.B, C.M in 1883. Donald was married to Maude Helen and between them had two daughters and four sons. ==Career== Once he completed his preclinical training, Donald started his residency at the Edinburgh Royal Maternity Hospital and Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion. After completing his yearly residency in 1884, Donald joined the Royal Navy and worked as a Naval surgeon while sailing to India. When Donald returned from India in 1885, he was appointed to a senior resident position at Saint Mary's Hospital, Manchester with the job title Resident Obstetric Assistant Surgeon and elected to the staff of the hospital in 1888, In 1895 Donald was appointed to his final surgical position as a gynaecological surgeon at the Manchester Royal Infirmary. For several years leading up to the end of the century, Donald lectured at Victoria University on clinical obstetrics and gynaecology. In 1912 he was promoted to the rank of professor in the chair of obstetrics and gynaecology at Manchester University. During World War I, Donald served with the rank of captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps that was attached to the 2nd Western General Hospital. He was subsequently made Deputy-Lieutenant of Lancashire. In 1920 he wrote his only book Introduction to Midwifery that was extremely popular amongst students and midwives, being produced in eight editions. In the same year he finally convinced the university to create a new chair in clinical obstetrics and gynaecology in which he occupied until 1925 when he became emeritus professor. ==Surgical career== Donald promoted gynaecological surgery as a stand-alone discipline for much of his career, although in his early years the evidence for a separate discipline was insufficient. In 1888 Donald attempted five uterine prolapse operations. The procedure he developed became known as the Manchester repair and originally consisted of an anterior colporrhaphy, amputation of the cervix, followed by a posterior colpoperineorrhaphy. Donald executed the operation sometimes in two sittings. Donald's student, William Edward Fothergill subsequently refined the operation by combining the two steps into one and including parametrial fixation. As Donald disliked writing about the operation, it was left to Fothergill to popularise it in his classic paper. It eventually became known as the Fothergill's Repair as it was popular among gyneacologist's. However over time as Donald's pioneering work was recognised, the operation became known as the Manchester operation. ==Bibliography== * == References == Category:1860 births Category:1937 deaths Category:Physicians of the Manchester Royal Infirmary Category:Royal Army Medical Corps officers Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:British obstetricians Category:British gynaecologists Category:Academics of the Victoria University of Manchester Category:British surgeons Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Lancashire ","title":"Archibald Donald"},{"id":"56648048","text":"The list of shipwrecks in March 1830 includes some ships sunk, foundered, grounded, or otherwise lost during March 1830. ==2 March== ==4 March== ==6 March== ==7 March== ==8 March== ==9 March== ==10 March== ==11 March== ==12 March== ==13 March== ==15 March== ==16 March== ==17 March== ==18 March== ==26 March== ==27 March== ==29 March== ==Unknown date== ==Notes== # Date may have been 16 March 1831. ==References== 1830-03 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in March 1830"},{"id":"56648067","text":"Da He ding The Da He ding or Da He fangding () is an ancient Chinese bronze rectangular ding vessel from the late Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BC).

The ding is rectangular, with four legs, a common shape during the late Shang. It is high, and its opening measures by , which is slightly larger than its bottom. The most unique feature of the vessel is that each of its four sides is decorated with a dominant human face in high-relief, which is found in no other ancient Chinese bronzeware. Around the faces are small symbolic decorations of horns and claws, indicating a half-human, half-animal nature of the figures. There are many speculations regarding the identity of the figures, including ancient mythological figures such as Taotie, Zhurong, Chiyou, and the four-faced Yellow Emperor.

He searched the warehouse for the remaining parts, eventually locating more than ten pieces, only missing one leg and the bottom.

They were designed by Kálmán Kandó for hauling fast passenger trains. Having the same electrical equipment as the FS Class E.552 locomotives, they presented the same defects and had to be modified. After modification, they were able to carry out the services for which they were designed. ==Overview== For service on the three-phase AC electrified lines in 1920, FS had locomotives of classes E.550, E.330, E.331 and E.332. All were based on electrical systems designed and patented by foreign companies. The FS Material and Traction Service, wishing to free itself of this burden, independently planned the classes E.551 and E.431. Kálmán Kandó (the designer of the E.550 and the E.330) had had to leave Italy during the First World War and was trying to regain his lost position through the company Ing Nicola Romeo di Saronno, who until then had only built steam locomotives. The first result of this collaboration was the new Class E.552, commissioned by the FS on 17 January 1920, which was intended to replace further orders for Class E.550. While the E.552 locomotives were under construction, the company Romeo succeeded in obtaining a contract for 18 locomotives for the haulage of passenger trains on flat or moderately steep lines, which was agreed on 17 January 1922 with deliveries scheduled by May 1924. These were to be E.333.001-018. On 4 October 1922, another 22 units were ordered. These were to be E.333.019-028 and 029-040. The Romeo company, which was financially linked to the Mechanical and Naval Workshops of Naples through Credito Italiano, subcontracted to them the construction of the mechanical parts and the responsibility for the whole supply of E.333.029-040. The locomotives were divided into two subgroups: # 001-014 and 029-034 # 015-028 and 035-040 The second group was distinguished externally by a higher cab other detail differences. The E.333 was designed to haul both local and non-stop passenger trains of modest weight on moderately steep lines with a maximum speed of 75 km / h in both directions. This implied driving wheels similar to those of the E.330 and a traction system that developed the greatest tractive effort at the two highest speeds. Four speeds were provided and, with a power frequency of 16.7 Hz, these were 25, 37.5, 50 and 75 km / h. ==Construction== ===Mechanical part=== The mechanical part of the E.333 resembled that of the E.330, with a UIC wheel arrangement of 1'C1', large driving wheels and Zara bogies at each end. The adhesive weight was reduced from 51 tonnes to 45 tonnes to reduce axle load and allow use on many lines. The overall design of the machine resembled that of the E.552 and other projects developed by Kandó. These included a long section containing the traction motors with their auxiliaries in the centre, the rheostat at one end and the driver's cab at the other. This provision was advantageous for the accessibility of the equipment and for reduction of the accident risk for train drivers in the event of an explosion of the rheostat (which occurred several times on machines of various classes, with sometimes deadly consequences). ===Electrical part=== The electrical part of the E.333 was substantially similar to that of the FS E.552 locomotives. The only notable differences were the presence of cooling fans for the traction motors and a smaller number of rheostat electrodes. The two traction motors were identical to those of the E.552, with an output of 800 kW at 75 km / h for each. Foreign patents were not completely eliminated. The stators were wound according to a Kandó patent and the rotors according to a patent by Ottó Titusz Bláthy, one of Kandó's colleagues at Ganz. As with all the locomotives designed by Kandó, the regulation of starting and the transition from one speed to the next was done by an automatically controlled liquid rheostat containing sodium carbonate solution. Four fixed speeds were available by switching between 12 and 8 poles on the motors and using cascade or parallel connections. The fixed speeds were: * Cascade connection, 25 and 37.5 km / h * Parallel connection, 50 and 75 km / h ==Modifications== The E.333 had the same electrical equipment as the E.552 and reproduced its greatest defect - insufficient tractive effort when starting and at low speeds. Measured values were 96.8 kN at 25 km/h falling to 69.3 kN at 37.5 km/h. The Locomotive Studies Department of the Material and Traction Service of the FS, directed by the engineer Giuseppe Bianchi, proposed to the supplier the elimination of the second fixed speed and the modification of the motors and the rheostat. After some tests in 1926, a tractive effort of 176 kN at 25 km/h was achieved. The modifications were then applied to all the locomotives. As a result of these modifications, the fixed speeds were reduced to three, namely 25, 50 and 75 km/h, and good performance was delivered, especially at the two higher speeds. This made it possible to withdraw from the idea of radically altering or scrapping the whole class. The rheostat designed by Kandó had a pneumatic adjustment of the electrolyte level. Subsequently the FS technicians studied a new rheostat which allowed for exclusively mechanical regulation. This was first applied to the E.333 and later to classes E.432 and E.554 as well. The machines were delivered with electric steam generators for train heating but these were unsatisfactory. In the 1930s, thirty eight E.333 locomotives were equipped with a new type of boiler. This had been developed by FS in 1924 and applied, with subsequent modifications, to 184 locomotives of various classes. In 1933-1934 four E.333s stabled at Bolzano and Lecco were equipped with vigilance devices designed and built by Breda for one-man operation. These were also fitted to ten E.550s. This was followed by a device for automatically adjusting the train heating boiler. The vigilance devices were removed around 1945 because there was union pressure to restore two-man operation as a result of the post-war unemployment situation. After experiments carried out in 1958-1959 on some E.554s, locomotives E.333.025 and 033 were equipped with multiple unit control devices of the \\"Genova type\\" in 1960. However, they was rarely used. There were also some minor changes, such as modification of the inspection doors and moving the lights. In 1927, E333.006 was fitted with pantographs in place of the original Brown-Boveri type trolley poles. This modification was later applied to classes E.432, E.470 and E.472. ==Statistics== The E.333s were delivered between September 1923 and December 1924 and, having overcome the initial difficulties, proved to be remarkably efficient machines. First they were assigned to the depots at Alessandria, Genoa (Terralba) and Lecco. Statistics for the second half of the 1930s confirm the reliability of the class. For example E.333.010 of Lecco in 1937-1938 totalled an average of 5,609 km of travel per month and of 170,223 km between two major overhauls. In the year 1963-1964 the interval between two major overhauls was, for the whole class, 224,545 km. ==Service== In 1927 they were assigned to the Florence depot, to work on the Porrettana railway. They worked the Rome - Milan express trains and almost all the trains between Florence and Pistoia, hauling 440 tonnes at 75 km/h. From March 1934, some of them were transferred to the Bolzano depot for service on the Bolzano - Trento, Bolzano - Merano and Bolzano - Brennero lines. On these services they were able to haul trains of 480 tonnes (a dozen carriages) at 75 km/h. From 1931, thanks to the electrification of the Savona - Ventimiglia line, they were used extensively on the Ligurian coast line, also hauling prestigious trains composed of Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits cars such as sections of the Milan - Cannes and Cannes - Sanremo services. The services on the Brenner line were also demanding, including the direct trains from Merano to Vienna, Munich and Berlin, or the Bolzano - Merano service with carriages continuing to Rotterdam. ==Depot allocations== This list is incomplete. * 1923-1924, Alessandria, Lecco, Genoa (Terralba) * 1927-1930, Florence Santa Maria Novella (Romito), between 4 and 11 units * 1930, Alessandria (11 units), Florence (1 unit), Genoa (Terralba) (13 units), Lecco (15 units) * 1934, Bolzano (11 units) * 1953, Alessandria (21 units), Savona (Fornaci) (17 units) ==Losses and withdrawals== In 1943 E.333.023 of Bolzano depot was destroyed by bombing. It was then decided to remove many locomotives (including Classes E.432 and E.554) from Bolzano to a subsidiary traction centre in Bronzolo. In 1949, E.333.015 was derailed by a landslide at Malpasso on the Genoa - Ventimiglia line. It was withdrawn and scrapped in 1950. The conversion of the Brenner, Ligurian and Piedmontese lines from three-phase alternating current to direct current, and the decision to keep in service only classes E.431, E.432 and E.554 led to a constant reduction in the number of E.333 units in service. By 1968, only seven E.333s remained. They were withdrawn and scrapped at Savona (Fornaci) and Verona (Santa Lucia). ==Preservation== E.333.026 preserved at Pietrarsa E.333.026 was stored at the Novi Ligure depot (San Bovo) until 1992. It is now exhibited at the National Railway Museum of Pietrarsa. ==References== ==Further reading== * Ministero delle Comunicazioni. Ferrovie dello Stato. Servizio Materiale e Trazione.

Keith, Jr., published in August 1998. The novel focuses on Richard Faraday, an actor who plays an extraterrestrial diplomat on a science fiction television series, who is kidnapped by aliens who believe him to be the diplomat he portrays. The novel was inspired by Jurasik's role as extraterrestrial ambassador Londo Mollari in the science fiction series Babylon 5 (1993-1998). ==Plot== Richard Faraday is an actor on a science fiction television series, Star Peace. He plays Harmon the Eldar, an extraterrestrial diplomat who is both kind and wise. An alien group of watchers, called the Kluj, who have been observing mankind through their television broadcasts for decades, do not understand the distinction between fact and fiction (in fact the concept of fiction might be a uniquely human concept), and kidnap Faraday as they believe him to be Harmon, and they are in need of his diplomatic services. The Kluj need Faraday to solve a metaphilosophical crisis and avert a galactic war. While Faraday is trying to sort out the galactic crisis, a Kluj takes Faraday's place on the set of Star Peace and learns about the difference between fiction and reality, and how Hollywood works. This Kluj has to team up with Faraday to defeat the evil plans of one of the Elder Races wandering around the galaxy. ==Development== The lead character in the novel, Faraday, who is an actor on a science fiction television show where he plays an extraterrestrial diplomat, bears some similarity to author Jurasik, as Jurasik played extraterrestrial ambassador Londo Mollari in the science fiction series Babylon 5 (1993–1998). The novel was completed during Jurasik's final year on Babylon 5, and the cover illustration by Gary RuddellThe Internet Speculative Fiction Database: Diplomatic Act bears a strong similarity to Jurasik's character. Co-author William H. Keith, Jr. is the writer of a number of science fiction novel series including the Warstrider series. The book is similar in tone and story to Galaxy Quest, which was released one year later.ScreenRant: 18 Secrets Behind Babylon 5 Even Die-Hard Fans Don’t Know It also bears similarities to the 1995 science fiction/comedy television film The Adventures of Captain Zoom in Outer Space, as well as John Scalzi’s Redshirts published in 2012.Keith DeCandido reviews Redshirts ==Reception== Publishers Weekly reviewed that novel calling it a \\"lightly entertaining story\\" that \\"moves briskly and includes fast action\\" PublishersWeekly: Diplomatic Act reviewGoodReads: Diplomatic Act review. == See also == * Galaxy Quest – a comedy film about aliens that mistake science fiction actors for their characters, parodies Star Trek. * Redshirts – a comedy novel about life on board a spaceship where wearing a red shirt can prove fatal, parodies Star Trek. * The Adventures of Captain Zoom in Outer Space – a comedy TV film about a science fiction actor who is mistaken for the character he plays, parodies Captain Video. * Three Amigos – a comedy film about three silent film actors who are mistaken for their characters by the people of a small Mexican village. ==References== ==External links== * Diplomatic Act at FantasticFiction * Diplomatic Act at The Internet Speculative Fiction Database Category:1998 American novels Category:American science fiction novels ","title":"Diplomatic Act"},{"id":"56648136","text":"Gjio Bain (born July 15, 1985) is a Bahamian professional basketball player for San-en NeoPhoenix in Japan. ==References== ==External Links== *Stats in Japan Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Bahamian men's basketball players Category:Bahamian expatriates in Japan Category:Centers (basketball) Category:Hiroshima Lightning players Category:Iwate Big Bulls players Category:Kagoshima Rebnise players Category:Kanazawa Samuraiz players Category:Sportspeople from Nassau, Bahamas Category:Tokyo Cinq Rêves players ","title":"Gjio Bain"},{"id":"56648153","text":"Joseph Goedenhuyze or Goedenhuize (died late 1595) was a Flemish botanist and naturalist, active in the court of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. He was also known by the Italian name Giuseppe Casabona or more rarely Giuseppe Benincasa ==Life== He was born in Flanders, probably in the mid 16th century, but soon moved to Florence, probably as a teenager. His parentage and education are unknown but the latter does not seem to have extended much beyond that of a herbalist. Probably around 1570 he entered Niccolò Gaddi's service - Gaddi had built a major botanical garden in the grounds of his palazzo, to which Goedenhuyze brought back plants from Livorno, Monte Pisano and Barga. In 1578 or possibly earlier, Gaddi's influence at court gained Goedenhuyze a role in the court of Francesco I, as one of the gardeners in his Giardino Delle Stalle and Giardino dei Semplici and the garden at his casino di San Marco. He travelled widely to bring back new plants for the gardens, sending letters back to the grand dukes and to his scientist friends. In summer-autumn 1578 he went searching for plants in the Apuane Alps, getting as far as Liguria and Piedmont and between May and June 1579 he visited Grosseto, the Argentario, Piombino and the island of Elba, returning to the Apuane near Seravezza. In spring 1581 he collected plants in the territories of Padua, Bassano and Vicenza, finishing up at Trentino. In early summer 1583 he set off from Garfagnana, crossing the mountains around Parma and reaching the Euganean Hills and monte Summano near Vicenza - that August he visited the gardens in Padua and Venice. In his final years Francesco I began to neglect his gardens in favour of his art collections and the sciences and Goedenhuyze suffered, complaining about his low salary and small purchase funds. He died in October 1587 and his successor Ferdinand I confirmed Goedenhuyze's post, increased his salary and assigned him a larger plot in Florence to plant his garden. Around this time Goedenhuyze made contact with botanists and scientists across Italy and Europe, such as Ulisse Aldrovandi, Gian Vincenzo Pinelli, Karl Clusius (director of the botanical gardens in Leiden) and Joachim Camerarius the Younger. Ferdinand recommended him Leonardo Valmarana, Count of Vicenza and to Girolamo Cappello, brother of the dowager grand-duchess Bianca. Thanks to this recommendation he returned to Padua in summer 1588 and from there began a long journey through the Republic of Venice's territories, including the monti Lessini, monte Summano, Rosà (where he was a guest of Capello's), Bassano, Cividale del Friuli, Fiera di Primiero and Agordo). The journey culminated in a climb of monte Baldo, though the local peasants thought Goedenhuyze was a necromancer and so count Agostino Giusti (godfather of the guardian of Verona) had to provide him with an armed escort. In the meantime some grand-ducal officials were trying to eject him from his lodgings at the Casino di San Marco and so he had to write back from Cividale to Florence to frustrate their plans. In 1589 Goedenhuyze was elected chamberlain of the Compagnia di S. Barbara dei Fiamminghi in Florence and in October that year he travelled to Venice in an attempt to sail to Crete - the attempt failed but he still managed to use the trip study herbs in Verona and Mantua. As shown in a letter of Clusius, in April 1590 he was in Pisa to work in its old botanical garden, then headed by Lorenzo Mazzanga da Barga. In July and August that year he visited the mountains in Liguria as well as Munich and Nice and in late summer 1590 he made another attempt to visit Crete. He was unable to join Camerarius' nephew Joachim Jungermannhttps://thesaurus.cerl.org/record/cnp01103020 on his voyage out, but on 17 September managed to embark on a galley commanded by Girolamo Cappello, who had been appointed governor of Crete. He explored the coasts of Istria, Dalmatia and Albania en route before finally landing at Candia on 22 November. Goedenhuyze explored the whole island for almost a year, collecting plants and commissioning drawings of some of them from Georg Dyckman, a German soldier in the Venetian army - thirty-five of Dyckman's images are now in the university library in Pisa, copies by Aldrovandi of seventeen more in the university library in Bologna. Goedenhuyze also wrote back to Ferdinand, Clusius, the duke of Mantua, Aldrovandi and Ferdinand's secretary Belisario Vinta. Goedenhuyze returned to Venice in early November 1591 and went immediately from there to Florence, with major health concerns but also anxious to resume work on the gardens there, which had been looked after by his brother-in-law Giulio Marucelli in his absence. Goedenhuyze was appointed prefect of the Medici's botanical garden in Pisa and arrived there early in 1592, leading the transfer of plants from its old site at the Santa Maria convent to a new one on Via Santa Maria - the work took until at least 1595 and possibly longer. In autumn 1595 he travelled to Corsica but this final effort seems to have worn him out and he died late that year. His widow sold his small collection of minerals, animals and zoological and botanical drawings to the grand duke in February 1596. He was succeeded at the garden in Pisa by Francesco Malocchi, who continued to collaborate with Goedenhuyze's son Francesco. ==References== Category:1595 deaths Category:Flemish botanists Category:16th-century botanists Category:Plant collectors Category:Grand Duchy of Tuscany Category:Pre-Linnaean botanists ","title":"Joseph Goedenhuyze"},{"id":"56648190","text":"David Miles Hogg (born April 12, 2000) is an American gun control activist and student who survived the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018.Washington Post, Alex Horton, April 29, 2018, The NRA said guns will be banned during a Pence speech.

He has helped lead several high-profile protests, marches, and boycotts. He has also been a target and scapegoat of several conspiracy theories and right-wing accusations. With his sister Lauren Hogg, he wrote #NeverAgain: A New Generation Draws the Line, a book that made The New York Times bestseller list. They pledged to donate to charity all income from the book. As of September 2019, Hogg is a student at Harvard University.CBS News, December 22, 2018, David Hogg says he'll attend Harvard University in the fall. Retrieved December 22, 2018 Hogg was included in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2018. == Early life and education == Before attending Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Hogg lived in Los Angeles, California. He is the son of Kevin Hogg, a former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. His mother is Rebecca Boldrick, born in San Diego County, California and a teacher for Broward County Public Schools in Broward County, Florida. Hogg chose to attend Stoneman Douglas because it offered television production classes. He is a Teenlink reporter for the Sun Sentinel. He graduated on June 3, 2018. Hogg had been accepted to several universities including the University of California, Irvine, but decided to take a year off before starting college to work on the 2018 mid-term elections. In December 2018, he announced that he had been accepted by Harvard University and started in the fall of 2019. Hogg reportedly had a 1270 SAT score and 4.2 weighted GPA, which resulted in criticism from conservatives as the average score for entrants is 1520. == Stoneman Douglas High School shooting == On February 14, 2018, Hogg was a senior at Stoneman Douglas and on campus when a 19-year-old former student of the school entered Building 12 and started shooting with a semi-automatic rifle after pulling the fire alarm. Hogg, who was in his AP environmental science class, told the teacher that the repeated \\"pop\\" sounds the class heard sounded like gunshots. Hogg and other students made an attempt to exit the building, but a janitor instructed the students to go back into the classroom. Hogg credits the janitor for saving them, as the group of students were inadvertently heading towards the shooter. A culinary arts teacher pulled Hogg and others inside her classroom and they hid in a closet. Hogg checked social media and discovered that the shooting was occurring at his high school in real time. He used his cell phone to record the scene, to interview the other students hiding in the closet, and to leave a record in the event that they did not survive the shooting. Hogg's sister, Lauren Hogg, who was a freshman student at the time, corresponded with her brother via text message while the shooting was taking place. After about an hour, SWAT team police officers came into the classroom and escorted them out. Hogg reunited with his sister and father later that day. == Gun control advocacy == ===Protests=== Hogg (center) speaking at a rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, February 17, 2018. After the school shooting, Hogg emerged as a leader in the 2018 United States gun violence protests. Along with Alfonso Calderon, Sarah Chadwick, Emma González, Cameron Kasky and other students, he turned to the media to talk about their role as survivors in the shooting and voice his opinion on gun control and gun violence. He called on elected officials to pass gun control measures and has been a vocal critic of officials who take donations from the NRA, and he has been urging them to compromise on legislation to save lives. Hogg joined the social media movement and student- led gun control advocacy group Never Again MSD shortly after its formation. Hogg flew to Los Angeles on February 21, 2018, to be on The Dr. Phil Show, along with his sister, to discuss the shooting. There, they met with survivors of the Columbine High School massacre. Hogg, along with González, blamed the National Rifle Association and the politicians to which they donate as being complicit in school shootings. He declined to go to the White House on February 21 to meet with President Donald Trump, saying that he had to be in Tallahassee, and that Trump could come to Parkland if he wanted to talk. ===Reactions by politicians=== When Republican candidate Leslie Gibson, who was running unopposed for the Maine House of Representatives, described González as a \\"skinhead lesbian\\", and also insulted Hogg as a \\"bald-faced liar\\", Hogg called for somebody to challenge the Republican; Eryn Gilchrist, who was \\"horrified and embarrassed\\" by Gibson's comment, decided to run as a Democrat to challenge Gibson for the position,Sun Journal, Steve Collins, March 15, 2018, Democrat who's horrified by Gibson decided to take him on for House seat.

Asked what new legislation he wants to see, Hogg replied: \\"Raising the federal age of gun ownership and possession to the age of 21; banning all bump stocks; making sure that we have universal background checks; making sure that people that have committed acts of domestic violence are no longer able to get a gun, which in Florida, it's harder, it's just not impossible, fully, yet; and making sure that people with a criminal history and a history of mental illness are not able to obtain these weapons of mass destruction.\\" ===Activism=== Hogg criticized the media coverage of the Parkland shooting as well as its aftermath in that black students were not given a voice by the media; he said that his school was 25% black but \\"the way we're covered doesn't reflect that\\".T.

Having finished high school in May 2018, Hogg has taken a gap year to campaign for politicians in favor of gun reform in the midterm elections. Hogg initiated a boycott of companies who advertise during The Ingraham Angle. Hogg called for the boycott after television host Laura Ingraham attacked him in a tweet about his lack of college acceptances, which Hogg characterized as cyberbullying. In response to the boycott, 24 advertisers left the show. Following the loss of advertisers, Ingraham apologized. Hogg dismissed the apology as insincere. The boycott drew mixed reactions. Ingraham was supported by Ted Nugent, Bill MaherJohn Bowden, April 7, 2018, The Hill, Bill Maher defends Ingraham: Parkland student calling for a boycott is wrong.

You shouldn't do this by team, you should do it by principle.\\"...\\" and by Russian bots on Twitter. Fox News continued to support Ingraham. Public polling showed that public perception of Fox News declined more than that of any advertiser. Simultaneously, Ingraham's viewership increased in the weeks following the boycott. Before, her viewership averaged 2.5 million. It jumped to 3 million when she returned after the boycott. == Conspiracy theories and harassment == Shortly after the shooting, false claims appeared on social media that it had never really happened, and others accused Hogg and other students of being \\"crisis actors\\". After a series of televised interviews following the shooting, far-right figures and conspiracy theorists attacked Hogg in online media. Hogg's family received death threats from various conspiracy theorists, according to David's mother. Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram reported removing posts that attack the students or accuse them of being actors. The conspiracy theories about Hogg and other Parkland activists were named PolitiFact's 2018 Lie of the Year. In April 2018, Hogg was threatened by a Sinclair Broadcast Group TV host Jamie Allman from station KDNL in St. Louis, who wrote a tweet threatening to insert a hot poker in his anus. Following a boycott of advertisers initiated by Hogg on The Allman Report, Allman resigned and his show was canceled. On the morning of June 5, 2018, Broward County Sheriff's Office received a false report from an anonymous caller claiming that there was a hostage situation in Hogg's family home. The harassment tactic known as swatting was described by Hogg, several media organizations, and the sheriff's department as a prank. During a June 2019 interview with the Washington Post Magazine, Hogg said there have been seven attempts on his life. == Bibliography == * * The March for Our Lives Founders (2018).

She was married to Lars Magnus Waesterberg, and became the mother-in-law of the industrialist Fredrik Ljungström.Sveriges dödbok 1901–2013 Sveriges släktforskarförbund From 1875, under the nom de plume \\"A S-g\\", Amanda Sandborg Waesterberg composed hundreds of works. She was also active in piano pedagogy. As a member of the Protestant free church in Sweden, many of her works were sacred songs. Half of the sacred ones were written for one or more voices with accompaniment. The remainder were in four-part harmonies for choir or for congregational singing. > Stylistically, Sandborg-Waesterberg was typical of mid-1800s song > composition: a style that continued to be used in bourgeoisie salon music as > well as within the frikyrkan, even when it had lost its pertinence in coeval > art music.

It is one of the largest of its kind, and called the \\"King of Fanglei\\". After its accidental discovery in 1919 in Hunan, its lid remained in China but the body was sold to collectors overseas, and set a world-record auction price for an Asian art work in 2001 when it fetched US$9.24 million. In 2014, a group of Chinese collectors bought it for a price between US$20 and 30 million, and donated it to the Hunan Museum, where it was reunited with its lid. ==Description== The inscription inside the lid reads: 皿而[or 天]全作父己尊彝 (Min Er [or Tian] Quan made [this] esteemed vessel for Father Ji). The Min fanglei is dated to the late Shang dynasty or early Western Zhou dynasty (12th – 11th century BC). It is a fanglei, or square or rectangular lei, a type of ancient Chinese ritual bronze vessel. The Min fanglei is tall, and its mouth measures . Without the lid, it is 64 cm (25 inches) tall and weighs 42 kg (92.5 pounds). It is finely decorated on each of its four sides, with pairs of dragons cast on its shoulders and a horned dragon mask on its handle. Because of its size and workmanship, it is called the \\"King of Fanglei\\". The fanglei is named for the bronze inscription inside its body, which reads \\"Min zuo Fu Ji zun yi\\" (), or \\"Min made [this] esteemed vessel for Father Ji\\". On the inside of its lid, the inscription has two extra characters: \\"Min Er [or Tian] Quan zuo Fu Ji zun yi\\" (皿而[or 天]全作父己尊彝), or \\"Min Er [or Tian] Quan made [this] esteemed vessel for Father Ji\\". ==Modern history== The Min fanglei was accidentally discovered in 1919 in Maoshanyu, Shuitian Township (now Jiaqiao Town), Taoyuan County, Hunan Province. According to local records, a boy named Ai Xinzhai () found the vessel lying partly exposed on a mountain slope and told his father Ai Qingyan (), who then dug it out. In 1924, Shi Yuzhang () bought the body of the vessel for a substantial sum. Ai Qingyan kept the lid, which he gave to his son's school, Xinmin School (), in lieu of tuition. The staff of the school read the inscription inside the lid and recognized its significance. After the Ta Kung Pao in Changsha reported the discovery of the artifact on June 11, 1925, Zhang Shizhao, the provincial education director, attempted to retrieve the vessel but was unable to locate it. Zhou Pan (), a local military officer, purchased the lid for 3,000 silver dollars. When Zhou was arrested in Kunming, Yunnan in 1950, the lid was confiscated and given to the Hunan Cultural Relics Management Committee, which was merged into Hunan Museum in 1956. In 1928, French scholar George Soulié de Morant published A History of Chinese Art, which included a photograph of the Min fanglei (without the lid) and noted that it had been collected by prominent art dealers including C. T. Loo, A. W. Bahr, and C. F. Yau (). The vessel was bought by Japanese collector Umekichi Asano () in 1930, and then sold to Taiwanese-Japanese collector Munachi Nita (新田栋一; Chinese name Peng Kaidong 彭楷棟) in 1950. When Nita put it on auction with Christie's in 2001, Shanghai Museum and Poly Museum raised a large sum to make a bid for the vessel, but were outbid by a French collector for US$9.24 million. At the time it was a world-record price for an Asian artwork. In 2014, the Min fanglei was again put on auction by Christie's. On March 19, a day before the auction was scheduled to take place, Christie's announced that the owner had agreed to sell the vessel to a group of private Chinese collectors, who then donated it to Hunan Museum to be reunited with its lid, from which it had been separated for 90 years. Christie's did not disclose the sale price, but Sina News reported it to be US$20 million, while another estimate gave $30 million. On January 14, 2018, the Min fanglei was featured on the Chinese TV program National Treasure. ==Gallery== ==References== Category:Taojiang County Category:History of Yiyang Category:Collections of the Hunan Museum Category:Shang dynasty bronzeware Category:1919 archaeological discoveries ","title":"Min fanglei"},{"id":"56648412","text":"is a public park in Kōhoku Ward, Yokohama, Japan.

Peter Bloom believes that it is likely that she took singing lessons from the great Italian singer David Banderali (an academic at the Conservatoire de Paris from 1828 to 1849), being the friend of his daughter, Anne Barthe. In the 1830s, she became a professional singer in Paris. Berlioz and Marie met around 1840. Maybe is it for Marie Recio that Berlioz began Les Nuits d'été, with Absence (1841, the fourth piece of the final collection), which she often sang and that the musician orchestrated as soon as 1843. Berlioz himself confided: \\"She's meowing like a dozen cats.\\"Les passions amoureuses on bnf.fr. Thanks to Berlioz's influence, she made her debut at the Opéra-Comique on 9 October 1841, but it was a fiasco and she only held the position for a few months. Her repertoire was limited: Inès in Donizetti's La Favorite, Isolier in Rossini's Le Comte Ory and Alice in Meyerbeer's Robert le Diable. It seems that the singer had a stage fright that deprived her of her skills. Marie and Berlioz travelled to Brussels in September 1842 and she accompanied him on his various journeys to Prague in 1846 etc. The couple lived together from 1844 and for almost twenty years. He married her on 19 October 1854, at the Sainte Trinité church in Paris. During all these years, she became collaborator and manager of the musician. She died of a heart disease at a friend's home in Saint- Germain-en-Laye at age 48. Her mother, Marie Sotera Villas Recio, stayed with the composer until his last days. She appeared under the features of actress Renée Saint-Cyr, in La Symphonie fantastique (1942), a feature film by Christian-Jaque. == Bibliography == * * * Pierre-Jean Remy, Dictionnaire amoureux de l'opéra, Plon, 2014, 1076 pages , , Read online * Pascal Beyls, Marie Recio, 1814-1862 — seconde épouse de Berlioz. 2015, 209 pages , == References == == External links == * Biography on findagrave.com * Autograph letter from Marie Recio (1843) * Lettre of Berlioz mentioning Marie Recio (1854) * Chronologie: Marie Recio Biographie on Kronobase.org Category:1814 births Category:People from Châtenay-Malabry Category:1862 deaths Category:French operatic mezzo-sopranos Category:19th-century French singers Category:Hector Berlioz Category:19th-century women singers ","title":"Marie Recio"},{"id":"56648462","text":" The MHV 900 Class is the Danish Home Guard's newest ship class.

He was working on another major work which was destroyed during the Second World War. He committed suicide along with his wife when Soviet troops marched into Germany. ==Biography == Tischler was the brother of the botanist Georg Tischler (1878-1955) and the son of Oskar Tischler (1843-1891), a landowner in Losgehnen. Tischler studied law in Königsberg, Leipzig and Munich and worked as a magistrate in Heilsberg. He took an early interest in birds and biology thanks to his tutor Karl Borowski, and became a member of the Deutschen Ornithologen Gesellschaft (German Ornithologists Society) in 1908 and spent time in an ornithological station on the Curonian Spit, meeting Johannes Thienemann and spent time at the Zoological Institute of the Königsberg Albertina University. He built up an insect collection and a herbarium. He published Die Vögel der Provinz Ostpreußen (the birds of the East Prussian province) in 1914 and a two volume Die Vögel Ostpreußens und seiner Nachbargebiete (the birds of east Prussia and neighbourhood) in 1941. He was appointed as a Foreign Scientific member of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Königsberg Albertina University. Friedrich Tischler was married to Rose Kowalski (1884-1945). The manuscript of a third work was destroyed in the Bombing of Königsberg. While Soviet troops invaded the region in the winter of 1945, the couple committed suicide next to a grave that they had their servant Karl Hartwig dig for themselves, most likely on the January 29, 1945. The site was recognizable only as a grassy mound overgrown with trees and it was only in 1999 that a memorial was set up by Polish and German ornithologists. Otto Kleinschmidt named a subspecies Parus borealis tischleri after Tischler in 1917 but it is today considered a synonym. Similarly he also described Accipiter tischleri in 1938 which is a synonym of Accipiter gentilis and Corvus coloeus tischleri in 1935 which is a synonym of Coloeus monedula soemmerringii. == References == ==External links == * In Polish Category:1881 births Category:1945 deaths Category:People from Bartoszyce County Category:People from East Prussia Category:German ornithologists Category:Jurists from North Rhine-Westphalia Category:University of Königsberg alumni Category:Leipzig University alumni Category:Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich alumni Category:Suicides in Germany Category:20th-century zoologists ","title":"Friedrich Tischler"},{"id":"56648805","text":"Katerina Balkaba (born 11 June 1982) is a Greek cross-country skier.

It stood more or less on the site now occupied by the Teatro Verdi. ==History== The earliest mention of a prison in Florence refers to the Burellæ, the vaults under the ruins of the city's ancient Roman amphitheatre and theatre, which remained visible for most of the medieval period. Next the city built or adapted towers as prisons, such as the torre della Pagliazza. People were also imprisoned in the basement of the Palazzo del Capitano or the Bargello. A cramped but less spartan gaol known as the \\"Alberghetto\\" was sited in the Torre di Arnolfo of the Palazzo Vecchio - its 15th century inmates included Cosimo il Vecchio and Girolamo Savonarola. All these prisons were run by private individuals and inmates had to pay one 'libbra' a day to their gaoler to cover his expenses, meaning wealthier people could buy better treatment. The poor were very harshly treated and mainly had to cover their fees from alms - there were periodic amnesties on particular holidays and religious festivals, but these only released a very limited number of prisoners and did not include murderers, political prisoners and those who had committed other serious crimes. Lunette in the oratorio dei Buonomini di San Martino showing people visiting those in gaol, which was one of the seven works of mercy. The painting probably shows the Stinche prison, which was near the oratory. The 'Tabernacolo delle Stinche' The Stinche complex was built from 1299 onwards by the Florentine Republic, using many stones from towers and houses owned by the Ghibelline Uberti family, which had been demolished after that family was driven out of the city following the Battle of Benevento. It was a square building surrounded by a moat and a very high 18-metre-long wall with no openings - this gave it its nickname of the \\"Isola delle Stinche\\" or \\"Stinche Island\\". The building itself had only one door, known as the \\"Porta della miseria\\" after its inscription Oportet misereri (it requires charity), referring to the fact that the prison was funded by private individuals not the state. The Buononimi di San Martino and a sub-company of the Compagnia di Santa Maria della Croce al Tempio known as the Buononimi delle Stinche gave charity to the prisoners. The Compagnia appointed four Buononimi delle Stinche to manage their donations and bequests so as to provide spiritual aid, money and food to the prisoners, especially the poorer ones who could not afford to bribe the guards for better treatment. They gained so much authority that they were granted the right to free debtors on the condition that the Buononimi became their guarantors and oversaw whether or not the debts were paid. In 1304 the prison's first inmates were Ghibellines taken in the capture of Stinche Castle, a Cavalcanti family stronghold near Greve in Chianti Giovanni Villani, Nuova Cronica, XI/75: Come i Fiorentini feciono oste e presono il castello delle Stinche e Montecalvi, che 'l teneano i Bianchi.. The prison went on mainly to house prisoners of war and political prisoners. Most of Walter VI, Count of Brienne's political enemies were held there and the city's inhabitants stormed the prison. Orcagna was commissioned to paint a fresco of the event in the prison courtyard, entitled The Fall of the Duke of Athens, in which saint Anne gives the Florentines the banners of the arts but an evil angel chases Walter from the city - the fresco is now in the museum in Palazzo Vecchio. Prisoners were led along the via Ghibellina to the execution site near Torre della Zecca. Tabernacles were set up along the route to comfort the condemned prisoners, such as the 'Tabernacolo delle Stinche' painted in 1616 by Giovanni da San Giovanni and remodelled in the 19th century by the architect Luigi Cambray- Digny. Later the prison also housed debtors and bankrupts, including the historians Giovanni Villani (caught up in the Bardi and Peruzzi banking crises) and Giovanni Cavalcanti (who described his time there in Storia dei suoi tempi). Niccolò Machiavelli was another inmate after he was implicated in the Orti Oricellari plot, as were the Florentine ambassador to France Roberto Acciaioli, Francesco Gianfigliazzi's wife (imprisoned in 1440 after smuggling herself into the city in disguise to plead her exiled husband's case) and the Neapolitan ambassador Pietro Vespucci (for his part in the Pazzi Plot). The painter Cennino Cennini may have written his Libro dell'arte whilst imprisoned there, but this is uncertain. In 1428 the Florentine Republic authorised the Compagnia di Santa Maria della Croce al Tempio to hire a doctor, a chaplain, a barber and a caretaker to assist the Buonomi delle Stinche at the prison. The Compagnia became so popular that it was granted an annual public subsidy of 112 gold florins, which supplemented the donations and bequests it also received. Also in 1428 public wash-houses were built against the prison's south side, as shown by the street name via dei Lavatoi. The prison was sold off by the state in 1833 and partially demolished, making room for a building for equestrian shows and a home for the Società Filarmonica Fiorentina - the latter was later transformed into the Teatro di Pagliano, which later still became the Teatro Verdi. After the prison closed its inmates were moved to the Le Murate complex just to its east. ==References== ==Bibliography (in Italian)== *Francesco Lumachi, Firenze, nuova guida illustrata storica- artistica-aneddotica della città e dintorni, Firenze, Società Editrice Fiorentina, 1929 *Anita Valentini, L'iconografia fiorentina di Sant'Anna.

He was unraced as a two-year-old in 1919 before emerging as a top-class stayer in the following year. In his first eight races as a three-year-old he won a minor race at Newmarket and the Ascot Derby but looked outpaced when tried over shorter distances. He recorded his biggest win on his final appearance when he recorded an upset victory over a strong field in the St Leger. After being briefly exported to India he stood as a breeding stallion at various European locations but had little success as a sire of winners. ==Background== Caligula was a \\"striking\\" grey horse bred in County Kildare Ireland by James J. Maher. As a yearling he was put up for auction and bought for 3,100 guineas by Seymour Edward Frederick Egerton, 6th Earl of Wilton. Lord Wilton sent the colt into training with Harvey Leader at Newmarket, Suffolk. He was sired by The Tetrarch an unbeaten horse who was regarded as one of the fastest two-year-old ever seen in Britain and Ireland, but whose career was ended by injury before he could race at three. The Tetrarch showed very little interest in his stud duties: his attitude towards sex was described as being \\"monastic in the extreme\\". Although he sired few foals his progeny included several major winners. Caligula's dam Snoot was an influential broodmare whose other descendants include Nashua, La Sorellina (Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe), King of Kings, American Flag, Blue Swords, Noverre, and Dance Partner. ==Racing career== ===1920: three-year-old season=== Caligula, who was unraced as a two-year-old, made his racecourse debut in the Severals Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in April and finished second to Cicerole. At the next Newmarket meeting he finished down the field behind Tetratema in the 2000 Guineas and then recorded his first success in a minor race under a light weight of 100 pounds. Later that month he ran disappointingly when 1/3 favourite for a race at York Racecourse in May. In June, it became apparent that Lord Wilton, who was well known for his heavy betting, was experiencing financial difficulties: he withdrew Caligula from the Derby and was forced to cancel a \\"large private luncheon party\\". At Royal Ascot in June Caligula, ridden by Joe Childs started at odds of 10/1 for the Ascot Derby and won \\"easily\\" from Paladin and Novello, while the leading fancies Abbot's Trace and Hugo Cunliffe-Owen's Orpheus were unplaced. On the following day the colt was dropped in distance and was beaten into third behind Allenby and Edward Hulton's Silvern in the St James's Palace Stakes over one mile. At Goodwood Racecourse in July he ran unplaced behind Braishfield in the Sussex Stakes. On his last run before the St Leger Caligula ran in the £1,000 Richemount Plate at Hurst Park in August and finished a close fourth behind Bracket, Bideford and Most Beautiful. In the late summer of 1920 Lord Wilton financial problems worsened and his creditors refused to let his horses race. With Caligula scheduled to run in the St Leger but unable to do so under Wilton's ownership, Harvey Leader embarked on a search for a new owner for the colt and a week before the race arranged his sale to the Indian industrialist and businessman Mathradas Goculdas. The sale was private but the price was reported to be approximately 8,000 guineas. On 8 September, in front of an exceptionally large crowd at Doncaster Racecourse, Caligula stated at odds of 100/6 (approximately 16.7/1) for the 145th running of the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs. Shortly before the race the colt had performed very impressively in a training gallop at Newmarket leading the London Sportsmans correspondent to describe him as a likely winner but this was a minority view. The Derby winner Spion Kop started favourite at 3/1 in a field of fourteen despite having had injury problems in the build up to the race, while the other fancied runners included Allenby, Silvern, Abbot's Trace and Orpheus. The race was run in a fog, and for most of the race the runners were not visible from the stands. When the leaders emerged from the murk in the straight Black Gauntlet was in front but Caligula, ridden by Arthur Smith, took the lead approaching the final furlong and held off a challenge from Silvern to win by half a length, with three lengths back to Lady James Douglas's Manton (a 33/1 outsider) in third place. Caligula's victory was surprising from a pedigree viewpoint as The Tetrarch's stock had previously been regarded as deficient in stamina. Caligula earned £7,941 in 1920, making him the second most financially successful horse of the season behind the 1000 Guineas winner Cinna. It was reported that Goculdas had imported Caligula in late September to India with the intention of racing him at least once (in the Viceroy's Cup) before standing him at stud. Later reports suggested that Goculdas had brought the colt to India simply to look at him before returning Caligula to England to begin his career as a breeding stallion. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Caligula an \\"inferior\\" winner of the St Leger. ==Stud record== Caligula stood as a breeding stallion in Britain, Germany and France, with his last foals being born in 1938. He had fertility problems throughout his stud career and sired few foals, but did get some good winners including The Consul (Yorkshire Cup). ==Pedigree== ==References== Category:1917 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 7 Category:St Leger winners ","title":"Caligula (horse)"},{"id":"56649083","text":"Eaglehill () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland.

Originally developed by Media.Vision, it is an entry in Sega's Shining series of video games, and an expanded and remastered version of the Japan-only Shining Resonance released for the PlayStation 3 in 2014. While the original PS3 release was not translated into English, Refrain was released in July 2018 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One platforms. ==Gameplay== The game plays as a traditional Japanese role-playing game with action-based battles, similar to the Tales series of video games. Interactions by the player made between the main character and other playable characters affect player's \\"relationship level\\"; talking while resting or camping initiates special story scenes, which in turn can lead to dating scenes the following day. ==Plot== The game follows Yuma Ilvern, who holds the Spirit of the Shining Dragon, an ancient Dragon who died in an ancient war. At the start of the game, Yuma is held captive in Gaelritz Prison with an attempted rescue mission by Sonia Blanche and Kirika Towe Alma on the way. After a confrontation with Excella Noa Aura and her three spears, Yuma summons the Blade of the Shining Dragon, the Vanderhorn. They then manage to escape on the back of the Shining Dragon after Yuma transformed into him and return to Marga, the capital of Astoria. When he wakes up back as Yuma, he joins Astoria in their war against the Empire alongside the Dragoneers and the Princess of Astoria in an attempt to achieve peace for their people. ==Development and release== The game was announced in May 2014 as Shining Resonance, as the newest title in Sega's Shining series. The game was developed by Media.Vision, and featured illustrations by longtime series character artist Tony Taka. The game received a Japan-only release later in the year on the PlayStation 3. In November 2017, a remaster, Shining Resonance Refrain, was announced for PlayStation 4. The remaster was at 90% complete at the time of the announcement, and while an English language release was not announced, Sega did note that they were considering a worldwide audience for the series, a departure from most of the recent entries in the series, which had stayed in Japan. In February 2018, Sega announced that the game would receive an English language release of the PS4 version, and that an additional release would be made for the Xbox One and Nintendo Switch platforms. The game was released in July 2018. The remastered version on PlayStation 4 and Switch contain multiple new additions to the core of the original PS3 game. The game contains a \\"Refrain Mode\\" which tells a new \\"what-if\\" side story separate from the main story. It does not need to be unlocked - it is available prior to even starting the main game, though the developers state that while the side story doesn't affect the main story, it makes more sense if the main game is played first. Two additional party members, Excela and Jinas, are added as well; they were present in the prior game, but not playable. Over 150 pieces of downloadable content (DLC) from the PS3 game are included in the remaster as well. ==Reception== Shining Resonance Refrain received mixed reception, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The PlayStation 3 version of the game was the fifth best-selling game in its release week in Japan, selling approximately 67,000 copies. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2014 video games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Japanese role- playing video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Sega video games Category:Shining (series) Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games ","title":"Shining Resonance Refrain"},{"id":"56649236","text":"John Phillpotts (1743-1814) was a landowner and entrepreneur chiefly noted as the father of Henry Phillpotts, a controversial Bishop of Exeter. ==Biography== John Phillpotts inherited the Sonke estate in Llangarron, Herefordshire, in 1769 when his father died.

There are hilarious scenes of her attacking both verbally and physically anyone who complains about Mohanlal movies. She becomes pregnant with a child which is a long cherished dream of Sethu and his family but a late night trip to watch a movie followed by a bike accident on the way back leads to the miscarriage of the child which breaks both Meenu and Sethu's hearts and Sethu relocated from his home village to the city by getting a transfer from his bank job in the village to a branch in the city.

While Meenukutty gives him all her gold ornaments she also finds a bag in the cupboard which was given to Sethu by his close friend as it contained all the money he has collected by selling everything he owned to pay back a bank loan. Meenukutty under a misunderstanding thinks the money is a surprise Sethu had hidden from her to give to Aamod to pay for the movie production and takes it and gives it to Aamod. When Sethu comes back from work and realises what Meenu has done he goes blind with anger and frustration and slaps her and tells her he does not want to live with her and even claims he was a fool to not to listen to the villagers and the doctor back home who said Meenu was not mentally well because he loved her and thought they could have a good life together. Then he leaves the house for the railway station to die because now he will be labelled as a dishonest person and a thief and his reputation as an honest man was one of the most valuable things he had. Mr Who listens to his story and berates him for acting like a coward and tells him to learn from the lessons of Mohanlal movies and how even in situations worse than this the hero faces all his problems headstrong and succeeds in life. Sethu convinced by Mr Who leaves the station and on the way back to his home he calls the Mohanlal fans club leader tells him of a man who committed a scam in the name of Mohanlal and is on the run with the money. The enraged fans ask for a photo of Aamod from Setho in whatsapp and spread his face across social media using Mohanlal fans and eventually track him to a railway station where he is waiting for a train to escape the city. The fans and Sethu capture him and retrieve the money. Sethu gets a call from one of his neighbours in the colony telling him to come to the hospital as Meenu has tried to commit suicide. Doctor tells Sethu that his wife is in urgent need for blood and Sethu who felt helpless once again relies on the power of the Mohanlal fan club to get many club members to come and donate blood. The doctor chides Sethu for not understanding what was the underlying cause for Meenu's love for Mohanlal and the Doctor gives Sethu his wife's suicide note where she explains to him that when she was little her father died in an accident and she was depressed and afraid of the world and Mohanlal and his movies gradually helped her become normal in his and that he was the light which helped her come out of her darkest moment in her childhood.

In May 2017, Indrajith revealed that the film is a humorous \\"family entertainer\\" in which he plays a working man in a middle-class family with Warrier playing his wife and how they cope with the issues arising due to his wife's extreme adoration for Mohanlal forms the plot. On Mohanlal's birthday on 21 May, posters were released confirming the title and revealing the character name of Warrier as Meenukutty and Indrajith as Sethumadhavan, both the character names in Mohanlal's early films. In that month, Soubin Shahir and Aju Varghese were confirmed to be in important roles and a casting call was released by Yahiya in search of two child actors for the childhood roles of Warrier and Indrajith. Including them, the film consists of a large star cast. Yahiya describes Meenukutty as a crazy fan who compares everything she encounters to Mohanlal characters, and Sethu (Sethumadhavan) as a \\"devout husband who supports his wife in everything\\". He also revealed that the filming would begin in May last week. ===Filming=== The film began principal photography on 27 May 2017 in Kochi. In the first schedule, filming took place in and around Ernakulam and at locations in Kolenchery, Ottapalam, and Guruvayur. The schedule was concluded in Kolenchery by 13 June 2017. The complete filming process was wrapped on 23 December 2017. ==Soundtrack== The film's original songs were composed by debutant Tony Joseph. The soundtrack album consists of 12 tracks. Manu Manjith wrote the lyrics for all songs, except \\"Aaranu Njhan\\" (by Suhail Koya). All the songs were major hits especially La La Laletta, Va Va Vo and Thoovenilla.The film's music launch function was held on 9 April 2018 at Gokulam Convention Centre in Kochi. At the function, Mallika Sukumaran released the audio music. Soundtrack album was distributed by the label Zee Music Company. ==Release== Mohanlal was released in Kerala on 14 April 2018 on the occasion of Vishu festival. It was reported Jyothika is likely to act in the Tamil remake of the film titled Rajini Selvi and she attended the special screening of Mohanlal. The buzz originated after the scriptwriter of Mohanlal, Suneesh Waranad, posted on his social media page that they had approached the actress for the remake. However, no official confirmation has yet been made.http://www.moviemint.com/jyothika-to-star-in-tamil-remake-of-manju- warriers-mohanlal/ ==ReferencesCategory:Indian films Category:2010s Malayalam-language films Category:Indian comedy films ","title":"Mohanlal (film)"},{"id":"56649264","text":"Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 156 (2012), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court clarified the Sixth Amendment standard for reversing convictions due to ineffective assistance of counsel during plea bargaining. The Court ruled that when a lawyer's ineffective assistance leads to the rejection of a plea agreement, a defendant is entitled to relief if the outcome of the plea process would have been different with competent advice. In such cases, the Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment requires the trial judge to exercise discretion to determine an appropriate remedy. Anthony Cooper was charged by the State of Michigan with assault with intent to murder and three other offenses. After being incorrectly advised by his lawyer that the prosecution would be unable to prove intent to murder, he rejected a plea bargain. After being convicted at a fair trial, he appealed his conviction, arguing that his lawyer had provided ineffective assistance of counsel by advising him to reject the plea deal. Michigan courts denied him relief, but federal courts granted a writ of habeas corpus requiring the State to reduce Cooper's sentence to the one he would have received under the plea agreement. The State appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case. Writing for the 5–4 majority, Justice Kennedy ruled that ineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations can constitute grounds for relief if there is a fair probability that defense counsel's ineffective assistance resulted in a harsher sentence or conviction. In those cases, Justice Kennedy wrote, trial judges should exercise discretion in choosing to vacate a conviction and accept the original plea bargain, resentence the defendant, or leave the original conviction undisturbed. Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Thomas and Chief Justice Roberts (in large part) which argued that the majority had invented a constitutional right to plea bargain. Justice Alito also wrote a dissenting opinion in which he largely agreed with Justice Scalia and specifically argued that the majority's remedy was unsound. Reactions following the Supreme Court's ruling were mixed, with some commentators praising the Court's recognition of the role of plea bargaining in criminal justice and others criticizing the implications of not sufficiently protecting defendants' rights and of requiring defense counsel to plea bargain at the desire of the prosecutor. ==Background== ===Ineffective assistance of counsel=== The Assistance of Counsel Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that: > In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have > the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\\"U.S. Const. Amend. VI. The Supreme Court has interpreted the clause to require states to provide indigent criminal defendants with counsel. In Strickland v. Washington, the controlling Supreme Court decision on ineffective assistance of counsel, the Court ruled that simply having \\"a person who happens to be a lawyer [...] present at trial alongside the accused [...] is not enough to satisfy the constitutional command\\".. The Strickland Court determined that a conviction may be reversed for ineffective assistance of counsel if the defendant shows that: *Counsel's performance was \\"deficient,\\" such that counsel's errors were \\"so serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment\\" (the performance prong); and *Counsel's performance gives rise to a reasonable probability that if counsel had performed adequately, the result would have been different (the prejudice prong).Strickland, 466 U.S. at 693–694. ===Michigan trial court=== On March 25, 2003, Anthony Cooper shot Kali Mundy repeatedly under the waist, injuring (but not killing) her. Cooper was charged with assault with intent to murder, possession of a firearm by a felon, possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony, misdemeanor possession of marijuana, and for being a habitual offender. Before trial, the prosecution offered Cooper a plea bargain to dismiss two charges and recommend a sentence of 51 to 85 months on the other two in exchange for a guilty plea. Cooper expressed willingness to accept the deal and plead guilty, but later rejected the offer and went to trial. At trial, Cooper was convicted on all counts and received a sentence of 185 to 360 months' imprisonment.Lafler v. Cooper, . Cooper later gave evidence his attorney had inaccurately advised him that he could not be convicted of assault with intent to murder because he shot the victim below the waist. The state trial court heard and rejected Cooper's motion for resentencing, not finding that his attorney's defective advice, to reject the plea agreement, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. ===State court appeals=== Cooper appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals, renewing his claim that his attorney's incorrect advice during plea bargaining constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. In a per curiam opinion issued on March 15, 2005, the Court of Appeals affirmed the rejection of the claim on the grounds that Cooper had \\"knowingly and intelligently rejected two plea offers and chose to go to trial\\".People v. Cooper, No. 250583, 2005 WL 599740 (March 15, 2005) (per curiam). Cooper applied to the Michigan Supreme Court for leave to file an appeal, which it denied on October 31, 2005, \\"because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this Court\\".People v. Cooper, 474 Mich. 905, 705 N. W. 2d 118 (2005). === Federal habeas proceedings === Cooper filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, again renewing his claim that his attorney's advice to reject the plea agreement constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. On March 26, 2009, U.S. District Judge Denise Page Hood granted the petition, issuing a writ of habeas corpus \\"ordering specific performance of Petitioner’s original plea agreement, for a minimum sentence in the range of fifty-one to eighty-five months, the plea Petitioner would have accepted if counsel had been competent\\".Cooper v. Lafler, No. 06–11068, 2009 WL 817712, *9 (ED Mich., March 26, 2009). The State of Michigan appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, arguing that Cooper's lawyer had not provided deficient advice, that there was no prejudice because Cooper received a fair trial, and that the District Court's \\"specific performance\\" remedy was unlawful. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's order, holding that Cooper had established a Strickland violation and that the remedy of specific performance was proper.Cooper v. Lafler, 376 F.Appx. 563 (6th Cir. 2010). ==Supreme Court== The State appealed to the Supreme Court, filing a petition for certiorari. On January 7, 2011, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, granting certiorari and directing the parties to brief and argue the following question, in addition to the question presented in the petition for certiorari: \\"What remedy, if any, should be provided for ineffective assistance of counsel during plea bargain negotiations if the defendant was later convicted and sentenced pursuant to constitutionally adequate procedures?\\"Lafler v. Cooper, 562 U.S. 1127; 131 S. Ct. 856; 178 L. Ed. 2d 622 (2011) (cert. granted). ===Arguments=== For the Supreme Court's review, both parties agreed that the first Strickland prong had been satisfied – that is, the parties agreed that Cooper's trial counsel had performed deficiently. The central disagreement was on whether Cooper had satisfied the Strickland prejudice prong.Lafler, 566 U.S. at 174. The State argued that Cooper did not suffer any prejudice from his counsel's deficient performance because the Constitution does not guarantee defendants a right to a plea agreement, and that far from being prejudiced, Cooper had exercised his Constitutional right to stand trial by rejecting the plea deal. Because Cooper had received a fair trial after pleading not guilty, the State argued, Cooper's rights had not been violated..Lafler, 566 U.S. at 164–165. Cooper argued that even though there is no right to a plea agreement itself, criminal defendants have the right to be assisted by competent counsel during plea negotiations. Accordingly, Cooper argued that criminal defendants can be prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations, even if the subsequent trial was fair. Cooper also pointed out that every federal court of appeals to have considered the issue, and 25 of the 27 states to have considered the issue, agreed that counsel's deficient performance during plea negotiations can constitute Strickland prejudice.Brief of respondent Anthony Cooper at 19–20, Lafler v. Cooper, . In response to the Supreme Court's order directing the parties to argue what remedy would be appropriate, the State argued that no remedy was appropriate. The State wrote that courts should not order prosecutions to offer a particular plea agreement, because doing so would constitute a breach of separation of powers and the discretion inherent in the plea process. The State also argued that allowing criminal defendants any remedy would \\"open the floodgates to litigation by defendants seeking to unsettle their convictions\\".Lafler, 566 U.S. at 172.Brief of petitioner Blaine Lafler at 20, Lafler v. Cooper, . Cooper argued that allowing the defendant to accept the plea agreement was the appropriate remedy, putting the defendant in the same position as if counsel had not performed deficiently. ===Opinion of the Court=== Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court on March 21, 2012. In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court vacated the Sixth Circuit's opinion and remanded for further consideration. Relying on his opinion in Missouri v. Frye, which was also decided the same day, Justice Kennedy wrote that the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel extends to plea negotiations.Lafler, 566 U.S. at 160.. The Court ruled that to establish prejudice and obtain relief, a defendant > must show that but for the ineffective advice of counsel there is a > reasonable probability that the plea offer would have been presented to the > court (i.e., that the defendant would have accepted the plea and the > prosecution would not have withdrawn it in light of intervening > circumstances), that the court would have accepted its terms, and that the > conviction or sentence, or both, under the offer's terms would have been > less severe than under the judgment and sentence that in fact were > imposed.Lafler, 566 U.S. at 164. As to the remedy for ineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations, the Court wrote that any remedy should be \\"tailored to the injury suffered from the constitutional violation and should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests\\".Lafler, 566 U.S. at 170 (quoting United States v. Morrison, 449 U.S. 361, 364 (1981)). The Court noted that the injury from deficient counsel during plea bargaining \\"can come in at least one of two forms\\": losing a \\"lesser sentence\\" and losing the opportunity to plead guilty to \\"counts less serious than the ones for which a defendant was convicted after trial\\".Lafler, 566 U.S. at 170–171. In cases where the \\"sole advantage a defendant would have received under the plea is a lesser sentence\\", the Supreme Court ruled that courts should \\"exercise discretion in determining whether the defendant should receive the term of imprisonment the government offered in the plea, the sentence he received at trial, or something in between\\". When \\"resentencing alone will not be full redress for the constitutional injury, [...] the proper exercise of discretion to remedy the constitutional injury may be to require the prosecution to reoffer the plea proposal\\".Lafler, 566 U.S. at 171. Applying those standards to Cooper's case, the Supreme Court ruled that Cooper had established that he had been prejudiced by his counsel's deficient performance. Turning to the remedy, the Court ruled that the District Court should require the prosecution to re-offer the plea deal and then decide whether to resentence Cooper. ===Dissents=== Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Thomas and Chief Justice Roberts (as to all but Part IV).Lafler, 566 U.S. at 175–187 (Scalia, J., dissenting). In a rare move, Scalia read his dissent from the bench, calling the Court's holding \\"absurd\\" and \\"unheard-of\\". Scalia argued that by reversing a conviction following \\"a full-dress criminal trial with its innumerable constitutional and statutory limitations upon the evidence that the prosecution can bring forward, and (in Michigan as in most States) the requirement of a unanimous guilty verdict by impartial jurors\\",Lafler, 566 U.S. at 186 (Scalia, J., dissenting). the majority transformed plea bargaining from being an embarrassing \\"necessary evil\\" to being an embraced, constitutionally-protected institution of the criminal justice system. Justice Scalia remarked that the Sixth Amendment was designed to protect fair trials, and that errors which do not impact the fairness of a trial cannot constitute Strickland prejudice.Lafler, 566 U.S. at 178 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\\"Impairment of fair trial is how we distinguish between unfortunate attorney error and error of constitutional significance.\\"). He noted that the majority's remedy, which left to the discretion of the trial judge the specific relief, was unprecedented in the history of the Court's criminal justice jurisprudence.Lafler, 566 U.S. at 183 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Finally, he argued that granting relief would violate the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which prohibits federal courts from granting relief unless the state court issued a decision \\"contrary to, or [which] involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\\".Lafler, 566 U.S. at 181 (quoting (d)(1)) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Justice Alito also wrote a dissenting opinion, which largely agreed with Justice Scalia's analysis. Justice Alito then wrote the \\"weakness in the Court’s analysis is highlighted by its opaque discussion of the remedy that is appropriate when a plea offer is rejected due to defective legal representation\\".Lafler, 566 U.S. at 187–188 (Alito, J., dissenting). ==Reception== Reactions to the Supreme Court's decision were mixed. Lawyers on all sides of the issue were surprised by the broadness of the Court's ruling. An article published in the Federal Sentencing Reporter argued that the government had \\"[won] by losing\\" by requiring defense lawyers to \\"bargain at the behest of the prosecutor\\". The Brennan Center for Justice wrote that the decision could incentivize defense counsel to advise accepting the first plea bargain their clients are offered for fear of being labelled \\"ineffective\\" by a court deciding that rejecting the plea was disadvantageous with the advantage of hindsight, but also noted that the decision represented a \\"triumph of realism and justice over narrow legalism and formalism\\". Articles published by the Notre Dame Law Review and the University of Chicago Public Law & Legal Theory Research Paper Series argued that the Court had not done enough to protect defendants' rights, while an article published in the Mississippi Law Journal criticized the Court for \\"possibly neglecting the fundamental goal of the Sixth Amendment: the right to a fair trial\\". The ruling was described as creating \\"a new body of constitutional law\\" and was seen as broadly impactful on all sides. ==References== ==External links== * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:2012 in United States case law ","title":"Lafler v.

There has been an increasing demand by the community, that such data collected with the deployment of public funds should be made more readily available to all, for enabling rational debate, better decision making and use in meeting civil society needs. The NDSAP policy is designed to promote data sharing and enable access to Government of India owned data for national planning, development and awareness. The National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) is applicable to all shareable non- sensitive data available either in digital or analog forms but generated using public funds by various ministries, departments, subordinate offices, organizations, and agencies of Government of India as well as of the states. The objective of this policy is to facilitate access to Government of India owned shareable data through a wide area network, thereby permitting a wider accessibility and usage by public. The principles on which data sharing and accessibility need to be based include: openness, flexibility, transparency, quality, security and efficiency,. The motivation behind this policy is United Nations Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Principle 10: \\"Environmental issues are best handled with the participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level. At the national level, each individual shall have appropriate access to information concerning the environment that is held by public authorities,...and the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes.

(23 February 1738, Busto Arsizio - 23 December 1826, FaenzaStefano BONSIGNORI in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, 1971, Volume 12) was an Italian cleric, bishop and theologian. Napoleon I appointed him patriarch of Venice, but this appointment was not confirmed by the Holy See. ==Life== ===Academic=== A son of the cotton merchant Giovanni Battista Bonsignori and his wife Giovanna Galeazzi, he began his education under an uncle who was a priest, before moving to the Archepiscopal Seminary of Milan. In 1759 he entered the oblates of Saints Ambrose and Charles and was ordained priest at the end of 1760. He served as a grammar teacher at the seminaries in Celana and Gorla, then as a rhetoric and theology teacher at the main seminary in Milan and the Helvetic College. During this time he became part of the circle of scholars gathered by cardinal Angelo Maria Durini - others included count Karl Joseph von Firmian, archbishop Giuseppe Pozzobonelli and Carlo Trivulzio. He became an orator, epigraphist and church historian and in 1774 was made doctor of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana. The following year he graduated in theology from the University of Pavia. In 1791, after the seminaries reopened following the limitations on the general seminary, he was made professor of dogmatic theology and prefect of studies, with a substantial salary. He became a noted and rich orator and theologian and in 1797 he was admitted to the prestigious Metropolitan Chapter as a canon theologian. This period of success soon stopped, however, with the founding of the Cisalpine Republic, the abolition of cathedral chapters and the confiscation of their goods. Probably thanks to contacts with politicians, Bonsignori gained a 1,200 lire pension and met Napoleon after he came to Milan following his victory at the battle of Marengo. He gained the general's sympathy and accompanied archbishop Filippo Maria Visconti to the Consulte de Lyon as an advisor. ===Bishopric=== Thanks to Francesco Melzi d'Eril, vice- president of the new Italian Republic, he gained several important posts in the following years, as part of Melzi's attempts to reinstate those linked to the aristocratic world swept away by the Cisalpine Republic. In a list of names proposed as diocesan bishops in Italy, Melzi wrote by Bonsignori's name \\"one of ours\\". Whilst he waited for the 1801 Concordat to come into force, Bonsignori became a member of the Istituto Nazionale and vice-director of the Biblioteca di Brera. Only on 5 April 1806 did Napoleon nominate him to be bishop of Faenza, confirmed on 18 September 1807 by pope Pius VII. He was consecrated as a bishop by archbishop Antonio Codronchi on 27 December 1807 and on 13 March the following year took possession of his diocese. He was one of the most pro-French bishops, albeit in a passive form, even when the First French Empire annexed the Papal States and when Pius was put under house arrest after excommunicating Napoleon. This put him at odds with Pius' attempts at resistance. He even wrote a letter to his diocese's parish priests in 1810 praising a circular by the Minister of Religion and ascribing civil marriage the same value as church marriage. He was suitably rewarded with the titles of count, baron, commander of the Order of the Iron Crown and Grand Official of the Kingdom of Italy. This culminated in Napoleon's nomination of him as Patriarch of Venice on 9 February 1811, without approval from the pope, who continued to see him as only bishop of Faenza. Bonsignori reached the Lagoon on 9 April but did not spend much time there, since on 5 May he reached Paris for a council, where he acted as secretary and made no major interventions. He was similarly passive at the later deputation of Savona between October 1811 and February 1812. In 1813 he reached Pius in his captivity at Fontainebleau, but again took no active part in the negotiations for the new concordat. ===After Napoleon=== After Napoleon's first fall in 1814 Bonsignori renounced his loyalty to him and withdrew his statements about civil marriage. He left Venice on 5 May 1814 and made a sermon at Faenza Cathedral confessing his guilt. Pius then sentenced him to a year in which he was not allowed to hold pontifical masses, after which he was allowed to return to his diocese. He became a strong supporter of Pius' attempts to return to the pre-Napoleonic status quo - he rebuilt the college of urban parish priests, restored the suppressed monasteries and parishes and opened new monasteries at Bagnacavallo and at Fognano, Brisighella. He later reorganised the episcopal seminary, leaving it his collection of books and manuscripts. ==References== Category:1738 births Category:1826 deaths Category:18th-century Italian people Category:History of Venice Category:Bishops of Faenza Category:Patriarchs of Venice Category:People from Busto Arsizio Category:19th-century Italian people ","title":"Stefano Bonsignori (bishop)"},{"id":"56649578","text":"Robert Frank Krueger is Hathaway Distinguished Professor of Clinical Psychology and Distinguished McKnight University Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Minnesota.

Educated at the private school of John Andrews at Wellesley House, Brighton, he passed to University College, Durham, but left Durham without completing his course to enter the office of a relative who was a solicitor in London. He did not remain there long. In 1866 he was admitted a student of the Middle Temple, and after spending a short time in the chambers of T. Bourdillon, a well-known conveyancing counsel, he was called to the bar on 26 January 1869. He had mastered the principal treatises of law, and especially the law of real property. ==Career== In 1870 Copinger settled in Manchester, and commenced practice as an equity draughtsman and conveyancer, and in the chancery court of the county palatine of Lancaster. His work as a conveyancer increased: he ceased to take court work and became the leading conveyancer out of London, also consulted on questions of copyright. He was a lucid legal thinker with facility in drafting, and a vivid teacher to his pupils. After his call to the bar, Copinger turned his attention to the law of copyright, and in 1870 he published a work on the Law of Copyright in Works of Literature and Art (4th edit. 1904). Copinger continued to write on legal subjects, more particularly on conveyancing. In 1872 appeared an exhaustive Index to Precedents in Conveyancing; and in 1875 Title Deeds, their Custody and Production of other Documentary Evidence at Law and Equity. His Law of Rents with special Reference to the Sale of Land in Consideration of a Rent Charge, which was written many years before, was published in 1886, in collaboration with Professor Munro. In 1876 he published An Essay on the Abolition of Capital Punishment, which, to his amusement, was so enthusiastically received by the abolitionists that his intention to publish another pamphlet demolishing all the arguments in the first was abandoned. In 1888 Copinger was appointed lecturer in law in Owens College, Manchester, and in 1892, on the resignation of Joseph Edwin Crawford Munro, he became professor of law, and finally dean of the faculty of law in the Victoria University. He received the Lambeth degree of Doctor of Laws from Archbishop Benson in 1889, and that of M.A. from the Victoria University in 1905. He was president of the Manchester Law Society's Library, and of the East Anglians of Manchester and District. Copinger industriously pursued versatile interests. Besides being an expert in old property law, he was also a bibliographer and antiquarian, and took an interest in theology. ===Bibliographer=== Largely owing to Copinger's efforts, supported by Richard Copley Christie, the Bibliographical Society was founded in London in 1892; he was the society's first president, and held the post for four years. His own work in the field, however, lacked accuracy. Between 1895 and 1898 Copinger published his major bibliographical work, the Supplement to Hain's Repertorium bibliographicum. It comprises 7000 corrections of and additions to the collations of fifteenth-century works described or mentioned by Ludwig Hain, and a list of nearly 6000 works not referred to by Hain. This work extends to upwards of 1630 closely printed double-column pages. It must be used with caution. He contributed papers to the Transactions of the Bibliographical Society, including a monograph on the fifteenth-century printed editions of Virgil. In 1892 he published a folio volume on Incunabula Biblica, a bibliographical account of 124 editions of the Latin Bible printed between 1450 and 1500. At his Manchester residence, The Priory, Greenheys, he set up a small press, at which he printed for private circulation four volumes: 1. Catalogue of the Copinger Collection of Editions of the Latin Bible, 1893. 2. Corrections and Additions to the Catalogue of Incunabula in the Mazarin Library, 1893. 3. Reprint of Leland's New Year's Gift to Henry VIII, 1895. 4. On the Authorship of the First Hundred numbers of the Edinburgh Review, 1895. Nos. 3 and 4 bear the serial title 'Bibliographiana. ===Antiquary=== Copinger was interested also in genealogy, heraldry, and manorial history. In 1882 he published his History of the Copingers or Coppingers (new enlarged edit. 1884), in which he traces the descent of his family from the Danes in the tenth century, when they appear to have settled in Suffolk and in the south of Ireland. In his last years he concentrated on the history of Suffolk. In 1902 he issued the History of the Parish of Buxhall, of which he was lord of the manor. Between 1904 and 1907 the History of Suffolk as described by Existing Records (in 5 vols.) made its appearance together with the Manors of Suffolk: Notes on their History and Devolution (7 vols. 1905–11). He also compiled the History of the Smith-Carrington Family (2 vols. 1907), which was severely criticized for its dependence upon inauthentic sources,'The Great Carington Imposture', in J.H. Round, Peerage and Pedigree: Studies in Peerage Law and Family History, 2 vols (James Nisbet & Co., Ltd./The St. Catherine Press, London 1910), II, pp. 134-257 (Hathi Trust). and wrote Heraldry Simplified, which appeared in the year of his death. ===Theology=== In religion Copinger was member of the Catholic Apostolic Church, and for a number of years was the angel of the Catholic Apostolic church in Manchester; later he was angel-evangelist.Columba Graham Flegg, Gathered under Apostles, A Study of the Catholic Apostolic Church, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1992, p. 16. His interest in theology was broad, and the work which he valued most of his own writings was a lengthy treatise from his pen on Predestination, Election, and Grace (1889). His other theological writings were: Testimony of Antiquity ... being a Reprint of the Homily by Elfric, edited by himself, 1877; Thoughts on Holiness, Doctrinal and Practical, 1883; Contributions to Hymnody, 1886; The Bible and its Transmission, 1897; a new translation of Imitatio Christi, 1900; and William Law's Serious Call adapted to the Requirements of the Present Day, 1905. ==Personal life== Copinger played several instruments, including the pianoforte and violin, and found time to compose a number of musical pieces, amongst which is a collection of seventy-five original hymn tunes. This collection, the Contributions to the Hymnody of the Church, was first published in 1883 with thirty-five hymns in 1883 and enlarged to seventy-five hymns in 1885.Tim Grass, The Lord's Work: A History of the Catholic Apostolic Church, 2017, p. 205 and 344. An ardent book-collector, he accumulated a considerable library. It was rich in early printed books, Bibles, manuscripts, and printed editions of the Imitatio Christi, hymn books, Elzevirs, and general works of reference. On 3 September 1873 Copinger married Caroline Agnes, eldest daughter of Thomas Inglis Stewart, vicar of Landscove, Devon. She predeceased him, leaving two sons and three daughters. Copinger died at his residence in Manchester on 13 March 1910 from pneumonia following an attack of influenza.

The show revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick—and their bizarre adventures in and around the titular Colorado town. Much like The Simpsons, South Park uses a very large ensemble cast of recurring characters and became infamous for its profanity and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics towards a mature audience. The pilot episode was produced using cutout animation, leading to all subsequent episodes being produced with computer animation that emulated the cutout technique. Parker and Stone perform most of the voice acting for the show's male characters. Since 2000, each episode has typically been written and produced in the week preceding its broadcast, with Parker serving as the primary writer and director. There have been a total of episodes over the course of the show's 23 seasons. The show's twenty-third season premiered on September 25, 2019. ==Film== In June 1999, less than two years after the series first aired, a feature-length film was released domestically by Paramount Pictures, with Warner Bros. handling international distribution. The film, a musical comedy, was directed by Parker, who co-wrote the script with Stone and Pam Brady. The film was generally well received by critics, and earned a combined US$83.1 million at the domestic and foreign box office. The film satirizes the controversy surrounding the show itself and gained a spot in the 2001 edition of Guinness World Records for \\"Most Swearing in an Animated Film\\". The song \\"Blame Canada\\" from the film's soundtrack earned song co-writers Parker and Marc Shaiman an Academy Award nomination for Best Music, Original Song. Imaginationland: The Movie was released direct-to-video in 2008 and features the three episodes from the 11th season (Imaginationland I, Imaginationland II, and Imaginationland III) merged into a compilation film. Parker and Stone said in a 2008 interview that a theatrically released sequel would most likely be what concludes the series. In 2011, when asked on the official South Park website whether a sequel would be made, they said \\"the first South Park movie was so potent, we're all still recovering from the blow. Unfortunately, at the current moment, there are no plans for a second South Park movie. But you never know what the future may bring, crazier things have happened...\\" In 2011, Time called South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut the sixth greatest animated feature of all time. In 2013, Warner Bros. relinquished to Paramount its rights to co-finance a potential future South Park film during their negotiations to co-finance the Christopher Nolan science fiction film Interstellar. Previous efforts to create a second South Park film were complicated due to both studios retaining certain rights to the property. ==Media and merchandise== ===Shorts=== As a tribute to the Dead Parrot sketch, a short that features Cartman attempting to return a dead Kenny to a shop run by Kyle aired during a 1999 BBC television special commemorating the 30th anniversary of Monty Python's Flying Circus. South Park parodied Scientology in a short that aired as part of the 2000 MTV Movie Awards. The short was entitled \\"The Gauntlet\\" and also poked fun at John Travolta, a Scientologist. Short that aired during the 2000 MTV Movie Awards The four main characters were featured in the documentary film The Aristocrats, listening to Cartman tell his version of the film's titular joke. Short clips of Cartman introducing the starting lineup for the University of Colorado football team were featured during ABC's coverage of the 2007 matchup between the University of Colorado and the University of Nebraska. In 2008, Parker, as Cartman, gave answers to a Proust Questionnaire conducted by Julie Rovner of NPR. The Snakes & Arrows Tour for Rush in 2007 used an intro from Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny preceding \\"Tom Sawyer\\". As Parker, Stone and producer Frank Agnone are Los Angeles Kings fans, special South Park pre-game videos have been featured at Kings home games at Staples Center, and the club even sent the Stanley Cup to visit South Park Studios after winning the 2012 finals. Parker and Stone have also created Denver Broncos and Denver Nuggets-themed shorts, featuring Cartman, for home games at Pepsi Center. ===Music=== Chef Aid: The South Park Album, a compilation of original songs from the show, characters performing cover songs, and tracks performed by guest artists was released in 1998, while Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics, a compilation of songs performed by the characters in the episode of the same name as well as other Christmas-themed songs was released in 1999, as was the soundtrack to the feature film. The song \\"Chocolate Salty Balls\\" (performed by Hayes as Chef) was released as a single in the UK in 1998 to support the Chef Aid: The South Park Album and became a number one hit. ===Video games=== Following the early success of the series, three video games based on the series were released by Acclaim Entertainment. A first-person shooter simply titled South Park was released in 1998 for the PC, Nintendo 64, and PlayStation. This was followed in 1999 by South Park: Chef's Luv Shack, a party video game featuring quizzes and mini- games, on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC. In 2000, South Park Rally, a racing game, was released on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC. Parker and Stone had little to do with the development of these games, apart from providing voice acting, and have publicly criticized Acclaim and the quality of the South Park games they produced. . There was a South Park game for the Game Boy Color in development at Acclaim but it was cancelled by Parker and Stone because they thought the game was not right for the system as the main demographic was kids. Parker and Stone have the prototype cartridge of the game, making it the first South Park video game ever made. Only one screenshot was published in Nintendo Power issue 114 in 1998. A ROM file for the game, in a complete state, was leaked online in August 2018. Another South Park game was in development for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube in 2004 but was cancelled for unknown reasons. A prototype of the game was found in an Xbox development kit in 2015. In 2010, the decision was made to form a small group called South Park Digital Studios, which would, among other things, work on creating new South Park games, that would involve the studio and the show's creators more heavily. The first such title is South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!, a tower defense game developed by Doublesix, which was released in 2009 for the Xbox Live Arcade service on the Xbox 360 console. Another Xbox Live Arcade game, South Park: Tenorman's Revenge, is a platformer which was released in the spring of 2012. South Park: The Stick of Truth is a role- playing video game that was written by Parker and Stone, and was originally scheduled to be released on March 5, 2013 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles, and Microsoft Windows. The game was eventually released a year later in March 2014 to positive reviews. A sequel to The Stick of Truth, South Park: The Fractured but Whole, was released in October 2017 with similarly good reception. A mobile game, 'South Park: Phone Destroyer, was released for Android and iOS in November 2017. ===Merchandising=== Logo commonly used for promotional adverts and merchandise Merchandising related to the show is an industry which generates several million dollars a year. In 1998, the top- selling specialty T-shirt in the United States was based on South Park, and US$30 million in T-shirt sales was reached during the show's first season. A South Park pinball machine was released in 1999 by Sega Pinball. The companies Fun 4 All, Mezco Toyz, and Mirage have produced various South Park action figures, collectibles, and plush dolls. Comedy Central entered into an agreement with Frito-Lay to sell 1.5 million bags of Cheesy Poofs, Cartman's favorite snack from the show, at Walmart until the premiere of the second half of the fifteenth season on October 5, 2011. ==References== Category:ViacomCBS franchises Category:Television shows adapted into films Category:Television shows adapted into video games Category:Mass media franchises introduced in 1997 Category:Television franchises ","title":"South Park (franchise)"},{"id":"56649792","text":"The Association for Research in Personality (abbreviated ARP) is an American learned society dedicated to advancing research into personality.

Its members use the suffix 'O.SS.C.A'. It was originally based in San Sepolcro, Milan, but in 1928 moved to its present base on via Settala. P. Calliari, Oblati dei Santi Ambrogio e Carlo, in Dizionario degli istituti di perfezione, vol. VI, Milano, Edizioni paoline, 1980, coll. 647-652. Their spirituality does not belong to any particular school, but has strong elements of the Ignatian - part of their charism is to maintain a spirituality whose marks are belonging to the diocesan clergy, obedience to the bishop and safeguarding elements of the Ambrosian Rite. ==History== It was founded as the Oblates of St Ambrose in Milan in 1578 by archbishop Carlo Borromeo, inspired by the Oratorians, although he had begun preparing for the establishment of the association as early as 1570. Its initial members were diocesan priests who made a vow of particular obedience to their bishop and of stability (ie to stay in the institution), but no vow of poverty and no vow to live in community. This formed a body of well-trained and willing volunteer oblates who the bishop could use for emergencies and other difficult tasks, principally heading seminaries and carrying out popular missionary preaching. Its constitutions were elaborations on those of Agostino Valier and the Barnabite Carlo Bascapè, then bishop of Novara. After a trial period of two years and a commission called by Filippo Neri and Felice da Cantalice, the oblates' rule was promulgated on 13 September 1581. It was renamed in 1611 by cardinal Federigo Borromeo, who added Carlo Borromeo's name to its title. Napoleon I suppressed it in 1810 and after his fall cardinal Carlo Gaetano Gaisruck opposed reviving it. It took until 1854 for the oblates to be restored by archbishop Carlo Bartolomeo Romilli. == Structure== The Congregation is now organised into four groups or 'families' *missionary oblates of Rho (17 members in 1980) - set up in 1714 by Giorgio Maria Martinelli; specifically dedicated to preaching spiritual exercises, retreats and popular missions; has included cardinals Angelo Ramazzotti and Eugenio Tosi and archbishop Ernesto Maria Piovella *vicar oblates (24 members in 1980) - founded in 1875 to fill vacant parishes; approved on 24 January 1908 by Andrea Carlo Ferrari, who added the secondary purpose of managing shrines in the diocese *diocesan oblates (largest group; around 160 members in 1980) - office priests, mostly stable posts in the diocese such as parish priests and teachers; put in charge of diocesan seminaries and colleges by cardinal Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster in 1931; reformed by archbishop Giovan Battista Montini in 1956 *lay oblates or 'oblatini' (around 60 members in 1980) - founded in 1932 by archbishop Schuster; take temporary vows of chastity and obedience; originally intended for administration, nursing and technical roles in seminaries and diocesan institutes; joined the diocese's missionary work after the Second Vatican Council; based in Seveso ==References== Category:Catholic orders and societies category:1578 establishments category:Christianity in Milan ","title":"Oblates of Saints Ambrose and Charles"},{"id":"56649853","text":"The Select Committee on Overseas Trade was a select committee of the House of Lords that sat from 1984 to 1985. The Committee was chaired by Lord Aldington and was described by one peer as \\"the most comprehensive survey of the British industrial scene since the Second World War\\".The Times (16 October 1985), p. 4. ==Background== During the early 1980s recession the surplus in the balance of trade had turned into a deficit of £2.4 billion for 1983, £3.8 billion for 1984 and £2 billion for the first half of 1985. This had been covered by North Sea oil, which contributed £6.8 billion in 1983, £7.1 billion for 1984 and £4.2 billion for the first half of 1985. ==Report== The unanimous view of the committee, as expressed in its Report (published on 15 October 1985), was that unless there was a change in attitude towards manufacturing industry Britain faced a political, economic and social crisis. The Report warned that Britain needed to expand its declining manufacturing base to combat the fall in revenue from North Sea oil. If there were no change in economic policy a growing balance of payments deficit would lead to harsh deflationary measures along with lower tax revenues, meaning less spent on public services and defence. The Report also predicted higher unemployment, a stagnating economy, rising inflation and an irreplaceable loss of GDP. The Report added: > The committee takes the view that, together, these prospects constitute a > grave threat to the standard of living of the British people. Failure to > recognize these dangers now could have a devastating effect on the future > economic and political stability of the nation. The situation in which we > find ourselves is not self-correcting: things will not come right of their > own accord. Urgent action is required, not only by government but by > everyone. The Report quoted an article in the Lloyds Bank Economic Bulletin of September 1984 that predicted Britain's current account would change from a £1 billion surplus for that year to a deficit of £13.6 billion in 1990.Christopher Johnson, The Economy under Mrs Thatcher (London: Penguin, 1991), p. 207. The Report claimed that services were not a substitute for manufacturing \\"because many services are dependent on manufacturing and only 20 per cent of services are tradeable overseas\\".William Keegan, Mr Lawson's Gamble (London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1989), p. 161 They also warned that there was no reason to expect an \\"automatic\\" revival of manufacturing to compensate for the decline of the oil surplus because lost export markets would be difficult to recover. Manufacturing would take years to recover: \\"New industries and new products usually grow out of long-established activities and require a long time-scale for development\\".Keegan, pp. 161-162. ==Response== The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Leon Brittan, took what The Times called the \\"unprecedented step\\" of pre-empting the publication of the Report by releasing a statement: \\"This report needs to be set in perspective if we are not to get a totally biased and misleading view of the performance and prospects of our economy\\".The Times (16 October 1985), p. 1. The Shadow Chancellor, Roy Hattersley, responded by saying the \\"select committee's view of what will happen to this country if we do not act before the oil runs out confirms exactly what we have been saying in speech after speech for years\\". In his Mansion House speech for 1985 the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, dismissed the Report: \\"The Government...wholly rejects the mixture of special pleading dressed up as analysis and assertion masquerading as evidence which leads the Committee to its doom-laden conclusion\\".Johnson, p. 207. In his evidence to the Committee Lawson claimed: \\"There is no adamantine law that says we have to produce as much in the way of manufactures as we consume...If it does turn out that we are relatively more efficient in world terms at providing services than at producing goods, then our national interest lies in a surplus on services and a deficit on goods\\".Michael Kitson and Jonathan Michie, 'The Deindustrial Revolution: The Rise and Fall of UK Manufacturing, 1870-2010', Centre for Business Research, University of Cambridge Working Paper No. 459 (June 2014), p. 23. The Report was debated in the House of Lords on 3 December 1985.HL Deb 03 December 1985 vol 468 cc1191-294 On 21 October 1987 Lord Beaverbrook claimed that the Report had \\"largely been discredited by events\\".HL Deb 21 October 1987 vol 489 cc119-22 This led to a further debate on the Report in November 1987, where Lord Aldington contested Beaverbrook's statement.HL Deb 09 November 1987 vol 489 cc1248-80 The Report ran through five editions and has been used as a teaching aid in universities.Robert Rogers and Rhodri Walters, How Parliament Works: Sixth Edition (Abingdon: Routledge, 2006), p. 383. ==Notes== ==External links== *Peter Jenkins, 'What's going on?', London Review of Books (21 November 1985).

After the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated, water melting off the glacier accumulated between the Rocky Mountinas and the ice sheet. The lake drained along the front of the ice sheet, eastward towards the Judith River and the Missouri River. The front of the Keewatin ice sheet completely blocked the valley of Cut Bank Creek so that for the ice dam was bordered by the water of an extensive lake, which has been designated glacial Lake Cut Bank. It is defined by the granitic pebbles and boulders on top of the hills southeast of Cut Bank and are present at several places in the basin farther north and west all below . The pebbles were deposited from icebergs floating on the lake. The lake bottom is identified by the laminated silts over the flatter parts of the basin. The silts are up to as seen in some of the coulees. Additionally, stratified sand and gravel are visible in the basin. There is no defined shoreline. The lake has been mapped below contour, with shore like slopes between . The Carlow Flat shows evidence of being submerged part of the time. About southwest of Cut Bank the same granite pebbles are found at . This is taken as the maximum and first lake level. The lake drained southward along the ice front.

By September 2013, as a general producer and creative director, he was in charge of the intellectual creativity and production of the first heavy metal song of the famous Peruvian singer of Creole and Afro Peruvian music Eva Ayllón with the band of hard rock Temptation Xplodes, the song was called \\"Desaparecer\\". In the same year, the Archbishop of Lima hired him as a producer and press director to create the first massive March for Life by producing and directing three testimonial video clips and a song with a video clip where the Peruvian artist Sandra Muente sang \\"Vengo a cuidar de ti\\" (\\"I come to take care of you\\"). In September 2014, he released his new video clip with the band Kikasban called Seis (This music comes from the soul), and he tried to mix the different fusions that our cultures, ethnics, and traditions have. == Support to Peruvian rock == In April 2010, in a new press interview made by the Peruvian newspaper El Chino, he declared: \\"The rock in Peru is not only (his commercial stars) Pedro Suárez Vertiz and Libido, be heavy is a matter of survival, we ask the Peruvian State for support to the real rock scene in Peru\\". The Chino newspaper qualified his work as a \\"quixotic\\" example that a man does not need to be used to \\"hang on to boom\\" to have success. == Personal life == On September 20, 2014, he married the constitutional lawyer Patricia Ballenas. == Present == Nowadays, he lives with his wife and continues editing and broadcasting Rockum. Gino produces new artists, and he is a business consultant in matters of press and corporate reputation.

Stefano Bonsignori or Buonsignori (died 21 September 1589, in Florence) was an Italian Olivetan monk and cartographer to Francesco I, Grand Duke of Tuscany. He was born in Florence and is most notable for his eponymous Bonsignori Map of Florence. == Biography == Little is known about Bonsignori's life before he came to be in the service of the Medicis. He was born in Florence and became part of the Olivetan monastic order before being invited in 1575 to become Francesco's cartographer. According to a letter sent to the superior of his congregations, the Grand Duke intended to entrust him with the completion of the cycle of maps for the Guardaroba (cloakroom) in the Palazzo Vecchio, which remained unfinished after the dismissal of Ignazio Danti. Of the 53 cartographic panels painted on the doors of the cloakroom, 23 are by Bonsignori, with the most recent one being from 1589. His famous axonometric map of Florence was created under the patronage of Francesco between 1576 and 1584 and etched by Bonaventura Billocardi. The prominence of the Arno River and the detailed depiction of a variety of often quite minor water-related structures is telling of the way in which water management had been an important aspect of the policies of Francesco's father, Cosimo I, whose achievements had transformed the city's landscape. In 1588 his role as Grand Ducal cartographer was confirmed by Francesco's successor, Ferdinando I. Stefano Bonsignori died in 1589 and was buried in the church of Santi Michele e Gaetano, but his tomb disappeared during the seventeenth-century reconstruction of the building. == References == Category:Italian Benedictines Category:Olivetan Order Category:Italian cartographers Category:People from Florence Category:1589 deaths Category:16th-century cartographers ","title":"Stefano Bonsignori (cartographer)"},{"id":"56650000","text":" ","title":"Lutescent"},{"id":"56650004","text":"Shesh i Bardhë (lit. \\"white field\\")Shesh i Bardhë Cobo Winery is an Albanian wine variety.

The history of leprosy in Malta began in the Middle Ages, but the disease became particularly prevalent in the Maltese archipelago during the 19th century. ==Before the 16th century== There is no clear information about the length of time leprosy has been present in Malta, but the origin of the Maltese word is clearly Semitic and suggests a link to Maltese history prior to the arrival of the Normans. It has been proposed that the Hospitalier religious settlement, which was held by the Franciscans near Mdina, had a leprosarium, but there is a lack of historic evidence to support this. The first clear testimony about leprosy in Malta is that of Garita Xejbais, a Gozitan, known as erga corpore morbo lepre (effects of leprosy on the body) when he gave his testament in support of the church in 1492. This example equally shows that the sick person maintained their legal rights, contrary to what happened in some European countries during the Middle Ages.Buttigieg, George G., et al, p. 34 ==Under the Knights of Malta== When the knights of the Order of St John of Jerusalem arrived in Malta in 1530, they brought their laws with them to the archipelago. Notably, it was stipulated that a knight who had contracted leprosy could be treated for the disease but could not keep his habit. Quarantine rules were decreed, and when the unwell were welcomed to the Sacra Infermeria, they were cared for in separate cells. The first case reported during the Hospitalier period is that of a Dominican friar, who died in 1630 at his monastery in Ir-Rabat.Savona- Ventura, C., p. 8 The interest shown by Maltese leaders in the illness grew over the course of the 17th century, as the contagiousness of the disease became better understood. For each suspected case, a precise diagnosis had to be confirmed by multiple specialists. Census records show that prevalence of the disease remained rather weak as, during the 1687 census, only one 30-year- old woman living in Ħal Qormi is registered as suffering from leprosy, but it is likely that not all cases had been registered, and five other cases were identified during the same period. A few other cases were reported, like that of a religious woman at the monastery of Saint Catherine in Valletta who died in 1770, or that of the son of a Turkish dignitary who came to seek treatment on his journey to Marseille. ==The 19th century== At the beginning of the 19th century, cases of leprosy remained sporadic. Between 1839 and 1858, only seven cases of leprosy were noted— four men and three women. Despite these cases, however, the British health authorities in Malta responded negatively to an enquiry from the Royal College of Medicine about the presence of leprosy on the archipelago, recognising nevertheless that cases might be present but unidentified.\\"Malta Garrison 1862\\", Regimental Surgeons of the Malta Garrison, 6 February 2008. Retrieved on 21 June 2015. However, prevalence of the condition continued to grow during the second half of the 19th century, perhaps due to increased contact with North Africa but also with British India. A special committee was created in 1883 which noted 30 known cases of the disease. There were 69 cases in 1890, with prevalence estimated at 42 per 100,000. Eight cases were noted in Gozo of which four were in In-Nadur. Only 11 advanced cases of the disease were admitted to the Ospizio for the poor in Il-Furjana. The majority of these cases came from rural areas, such as Ħal Qormi and Il-Mosta. A single case came from Valletta. ==The 20th century== In 1892, the construction of a specialist building for leprosy patients linked to the new hospital in Ħal Luqa was agreed, replacing the Ospizio in Il-Furjana. This building was named after Saint Bartholomew. Initially, the hospital only accepted male patients; female patients were only welcomed from 1912 onwards. The maximum number of patients was reached in 1917 with the presence of 114 patients, of which 71 were men and 43 were women, suggesting a prevalence in the archipelago of 49 per 100,000. The presence of the disease declined thereafter. The isolation conditions were probably very difficult, as the unwell were treated more like prisoners than patients. Several incidents have been noted, in particular in 1900 when there were two attacks on guards and several escapees. A police presence was maintained on the site until 1903. Gradually, the rules regarding isolation were relaxed and the number of incidents diminished. The prevalence of the disease remained constant, with a rate calculated at 47.2 per 100,000 in 1916. A new specialist service for Gozo patients (Sacré-Cœur hospital) opened at Fort Chambray in Gozo in 1937.\\"Fort Chambray - Gozo\\", Malta Family History. Retrieved on 20 June 2015. However, due to the small number of patients, the service closed in 1956 and Gozo patients were sent to Saint Bartholomew hospital in Malta. The arrival of effective antibiotics and the death of the oldest patients meant that the number of patients at the hospital diminished until its closure in December 1974. The 22 remaining patients were assigned to quarters in the Hal Ferha Estate (a development created in the abandoned fort of Ħal Għargħur)\\"LEPROSARIUM\\" , Leprosy History. Retrieved on 20 June 2015. with the provision of a plot of land to cultivate and the care of a nurse and a doctor. There were no more than five of them in 1994. ==The 21st century== The last patient at the Hal Ferha Estate was transferred to a geriatric hospital in 2001. The centre was closed in 2004.

Only a few members of this gens are mentioned in history, of whom the most illustrious was the grammarian Quintus Remmius Palaemon, but many others are known from inscriptions.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 88 (\\"Quintus Remmius Palaemon\\").PW, s. v. Remmius.PIR, vol. III, p. 127. ==Origin== The Remmii claimed descent from Remus, the twin brother of Romulus, the legendary founder and first King of Rome.PW, s. v. Remus. Although the traditions relating to them date back to at least the fourth century BC, Romulus and Remus are not generally regarded as historical figures, and in the Greek authors Remus is generally called Romus, for which the apparent diminutive Romulus might be regarded as a doublet.Grant, Roman Myths, p. 102. However, the nomen Remmius could still be derived from Remus, perhaps a cognomen of uncertain derivation. Chase classifies it among the gentilicia that either originated at Rome, or cannot be shown to have come from anywhere else.Chase, pp. 131. Schulze, on the other hand, regards it as an Etruscan name, rem-ne, perhaps sharing a root with place names such as Remona and Remoria.Schulze, Zur Geschichte lateinischer Eigennamen, p. 219. ==Praenomina== The Remmii largely confined themselves to the most common praenomina, particularly Marcus, Lucius, Gaius, Publius, and Quintus. One of the women of this gens bore the feminine praenomen Prima. Other women of the Remmii bore individualizing surnames derived from old praenomina, identical in form but placed at the end of the name, like cognomina, including Maxima, Octavia, Salvia, and Secunda, as well as Tertullina, a diminutive of Tertia. ==Branches and cognomina== The only distinct family of the Remmii under the Republic bore the surname Rufus, originally given to someone with red hair.Chase, p. 110. Most of the other surnames of the Remmii seem to have been personal cognomina, many of them belonging to freedmen, and indicating their original names. Of those that represent traditional Roman surnames, Faustus, fortunate, was an old praenomen that came to be widely used as a cognomen in the late Republic and imperial times. Felix means \\"happy\\", Festus \\"joyous\\" or \\"festive\\", Fidelis \\"faithful\\", Fortis \\"strong\\", Fructa \\"fruitful\\", Fructuosa \\"very fruitful\\", Jucundus \\"pleasant\\", Scaeva \\"left-handed\\" or \\"unlucky\\", and Severus \\"stern\\" or \\"severe\\".New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. faustus, felix, festus, fidelis, fortis, fructus, fructuosus, jucundus, scaevus, severus. Three of the Remmii were named after months, and bore Januarius, Aprilis, and December as surnames. ==Members== * Remmius, aedile with Marcus Livius Drusus circa 94 BC.

His mother was Charles Paul Jean Baptiste's wife, Marie Élisabeth Jean Baptiste Guyard de Saint-Clair (1721-1765), daughter of Jean Guyard de Saint-Clair and Marguerite Élisabeth Vialart. The Bourgevin family was linked to the Boucher, Grimaudet and Guiller families. He was a member of the 1st (Grey) Company of the King's Musketeers from 1761 to 1769. He married Éléonore Élisabeth de Beauterne de Jauville on 29 July 1769, sole heiress to her uncle Étienne-Paul Boucher (1699-1778). Étienne-Paul was the son of the cloth merchant Louis-Paul Boucher and brother of Charles-Gabriel Boucher de l'Étang (commissioner for the 1st Company of the King's Musketeers) and Catherine Thérèse Boucher. His new wife's fortune allowed him to buy the office of counsellor in the Grand'chambre of the Parlement de Paris. He lived at 8 rue Vivienne in Paris an in 1780 bought an estate at Hondainville, where he began a manor house on the site of the old château to house his collection of drawings, paintings and natural history specimens. The building later became a prison before half the estate was bought by colonel Guillaume-Michel Barbier-Dufay (1769-1834), Jean-Baptiste Sirey, Jurisprudence du Conseil d'état, depuis 1806, époque de l'institution de la Commission du contentieux, jusqu'à la fin de septembre 1818, Paris, 1818, tome 4, no 302, (online) who demolished the house. The other half remained his wife's property. He was an amateur draughtsman and engraver and in 1784 he also began potato farming in what is now the Canton of Mouy. He chose to leave France in 1790 at the start of the French Revolution and so his goods, lands and collections were seized, including all his drawings, which were integrated into the Louvre between 1796 and 1797.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. The local pronunciation is Tullyveela.Tullyveela townland, Corlough parish, County Cavan, Republic of Ireland. Heading north-west ==Geography== Tullyveela is bounded on the west by Derrynananta Lower, Derrynananta Upper, Gowlan and Lannanerriagh townlands and on the east by Corrachomera, Greaghnadoony, Greaghnaloughry and Tullynaconspod townlands. Its chief geographical features are Derrynananta Lough, mountain streams, a waterfall, forestry plantations, a quarry, gravel pits, dug wells and spring wells. Tullyveela is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 505 statute acres. ==History== In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land. The 1930s Dúchas Folklore collection states- A battle was fought in Crocán na gCamps, Derryconnessy, Corlough. Co. Cavan. It is supposed to have been fought between the Gael and Danes. When the cavalry were coming to Crocán na gCamps they had a row and fought a battle. The fought in Tullyvella and Conspud. It is not known which side won the battle, but they are still supposed to fight, at certain times of the year at night, and it is thought to be a bad sign of disturbance when dead people come back to fight. About 100-200 years ago battles were fought in the Townlands of Tullyvella and Conspud between the dead people who fought at the battle of Crocán na gCamps. In the morning after these battles were fought, the heather would be red with blood. One night there was a fight in Conspud and a man heard a voice calling him by his Christian name, that a neighbour's house was on fire. He looked out and saw the neighbour's house on fire, but he did not go to it. Next day the house was not burned, but was as if nothing happened. A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as Tullyvelagh and the owner as John Finlay. The Tithe Applotment Books for 1826 list twenty-one tithepayers in the townland. and and Tithe Applotment Books 1826 The Ordnance Survey Name Books for 1836 give the following description of the townland- The soil is light and produces bad crops of oats, potatoes etc. It pays no county cess nor tithe, being considered a track of mountain...It is bounded on the north-east & south-west sides by two large streams which rise in the mountain and run south-east.

Von Drenckmann repeatedly refused to join any Nazi- connected organisation, so was unable to become a judge. Instead he worked on legal matters in industry and for the chamber of commerce. In the later 1930s, together with his friend Francis Wolff he was a member of \\"Hot Club Berlin\\". This was a circle of friends who got together in private to listen to banned jazz music. They also established contact with one or two jazz musicians such as Herb Flemming. In 1939 Wolff, who was Jewish, relocated to New York where he built a career for himself as a successful record company executive. Von Drenkmann stayed in Germany. In April 1939 he married Lilo Morgenroth. She was his first wife. === Middle years === May 1945 marked the end of the war and the end of the Nazi regime. Drenkmann found himself one of a relatively small number of lawyers without the political encumbrance of any sort of Nazi past. By temperament he was a liberal Social Democrat, and in 1945 (if not earlier) he became a member of the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). His career as a judge began in 1947 with appointment as a judge for civil matters at the Berlin district court (\\"Kammergericht\\"). True to his family tradition, a succession of promotions quickly followed. In 1967 he took the top job, as president of the Berlin district court (\\"Kammergericht\\"). == Death == Von Drenkmann celebrated his sixty-fourth birthday on 9 November 1974, no doubt anticipating his retirement, scheduled for twelve months later. On Sunday 10 November 1974 he was at home with his wife. An unexpected visitor appeared at the door. When the bell rang he went to open the door, placing it \\"on the chain\\" because something felt not right. Several assailants nevertheless forced their way into the apartment. There was a struggle and a gun was used. Someone fired a .38 calibre \\"dumdum\\" bullet. It was three minutes before nine o'clock in the evening. Neighbours saw the attackers escape in two cars. Günter von Drenkmann died on the way to hospital. The \\"2 June Movement\\" associated itself with the \\"action\\" against someone whom it identified as one of those \\"responsible ... for the murder of a comrade\\". Commentators were invited to infer a connection between the killing of von Drenkmann and the death at the Wittlich Youth Penitentiary, one day earlier, of Holger Meins, a student member of the RAF terrorist group. Meins was a large man who at the time of his death had weighed just 39 Kg. It was reported and widely accepted that he had died of starvation as a result of a hunger strike on which he had embarked, like other RAF prisoners, to pressure the authorities into improving prison conditions. The attack on von Drenkmann had actually been part of planned kidnapping for ransom that went wrong, although at least some of the terrorists were at the same time conscious of a \\"need to escalate their profile\\". In 1986 six members of the \\"2 June Movement\\" faced trial. The so-called Lorenz-Drenkmann trial covered both the 1974 murder of Günter von Drenkmann and the 1975 kidnapping of Peter Lorenz. The court was unable to attribute the killing to von Drenkmann to any of the six individuals on trial. It remains unclear who killed Günter von Drenkmann. All six received substantial jail terms, of up to fifteen years apiece, however, in respect of the kidnapping of Peter Lorenz and membership of a criminal association. The murder of Günter von Drenkmann is frequently cited as the first of a series of widely publicised terrorist atrocities in West Germany. A state funeral was held in front of Berlin's Schöneberg City- hall. Over 20,000 members of the public attended. The West German President Walter Scheel gave a brief address in which he called for all democrats to join the war against terror. == Commemoration == A bronze memorial tablet to von Drenkmann was placed on the former courthouse building in Berlin- Charlottenburg. When the court relocated to Berlin-Schöneberg another memorial tablet was placed near the entrance. However, plans announced in 2004 to rename the street in which the new building is located from Elßholzstraße to Drenkmannstraße have not been implemented. \\"The checking processes continue\\" was the explanation from Andrea Boehnke, speaking on behalf of the Justice Ministry, when asked about it in 2014. == References == Category:1910 births Category:1974 deaths Category:German judges Category:Social Democratic Party of Germany politicians Category:Terrorism deaths in Germany Category:Jurists from Berlin ","title":"Günter von Drenkmann"},{"id":"56650285","text":"Speak No Evil is an American mystery novel by Mignon G.

The field includes a wide variety of surgical procedures that seek to restore or replace a patient’s skull, face, scalp, dura (the protective covering of the brain and spinal cord), the spine and/or its overlying tissues. == History of the field == Neuroplastic surgery has adapted reconstructive principles from the fields of craniofacial surgery, and plastic and reconstructive surgery and refined them in order to prevent and/or address challenging deformities which result from Neurosurgical Procedures. The evolution of this new specialty and first center for Neuroplastic and Reconstructive Surgery was started at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland by a formal collaboration between the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and Department of Neurosurgery, under the vision of Dr. Chad Gordon. Gordon CR, et al. Neuroplastic Surgery. J Craniofac Surg. 2018; Jan;29(1):4-5. PMID: 29077688 Upon arrival to Johns Hopkins Hospital, Dr. Chad Gordon formed a multi- disciplinary team of physicians, scientists and engineers. The team’s unified goal was to develop techniques and devices to treat adult neurosurgical patients. These advances led to several \\"first-in-human\\" publications and skull implant/craniofacial computer-assisted technology patents, and allowed for the establishment of the first formal fellowship training program in Neuroplastic and Reconstructive Surgery.

In March 2018, Dr. Gordon was appointed the Director of Neuroplastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Johns Hopkins. In 2018, the \\"Society of Neuroplastic Surgery\\" was officially formed with the mission to \\"advance the art, science, and technology related to Neuroplastic and Reconstructive Surgery\\", and at that time, Dr. Gordon was elected to be the society's first President. The first peer reviewed journal to recognize neuroplastic and reconstructive surgery as its own field was the Journal of Craniofacial Surgery which dedicated its January 2018 issue to introducing the new field of neuroplastic surgery to its readership. In that issue, the editor-in-chief, Mutaz Habal, published an editorial on neuroplastic surgery where he stated: \\"Based on the desire to present the fact that neuroplastic surgery is there, we have a dedicated this issue of the Journal of Craniofacial Surgery.

J Craniofac Surg. 2018 Jan;29(1):1-3. doi: 10.1097/SCS.0000000000004342. . == Training == Training in neuroplastic surgery requires completion of a neuroplastic and reconstructive surgery fellowship which lasts 1–2 years. Such fellowships are available to individuals who have completed a residency in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, ENT Surgery, Neurosurgery or Oral and Maxillofacial surgery. As of today, the only formal fellowship training program in neuroplastic and reconstructive surgery is located at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Johns Hopkins Hospital. The fellowship is co-sponsored by both Departments of Plastic Surgery and Neurosurgery. For each of the clinical fellows in the program, there is an expected volume of participating in over 110 neuro- cranial reconstructions per year with Dr. Gordon and his neurosurgery colleagues, as well as a large spectrum of complex scalp reconstruction and craniofacial cases. The first surgeon formally trained in \\"Neuroplastic and Reconstructive Surgery\\" was Dr. Gabriel Santiago [2016-18], who completed ENT surgery residency in the US Navy prior to starting the fellowship. The first Neuroplastic Surgery Research Fellow was Dr. Amir Wolff [2017-18], an attending oral-maxillofacial surgeon from Rambam Medical Center in Haifa, Israel. == Annual Neuroplastic Surgery Symposium == The first Annual Neuroplastic and Reconstructive Surgery Symposium was held at Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital in September 2015, co-chaired by Dr. Chad Gordon (Johns Hopkins) and Dr. Michael Yaremchuk (Harvard). Its overarching mission was to increase collaboration, awareness and synergy amongst numerous disciplines including craniofacial plastic surgery, adult- based cranial neurosurgery, biomedical engineering, and neurology for improved patient outcomes. Since then, the symposium has grown significantly and rotates annually between Harvard Medical School/Massachuestts General Hospital (Boston, MA) and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine/Johns Hopkins Hospital (Baltimore, MD). Its main emphasis relates to cranioplasty, implants and implantable neurotechnologies. == Neuroplastic surgery procedures == * Cranioplasty (or skull reconstruction) * Temporal Hollowing Repair * Removal of Neurofibroma Tumors in Neurofibromatosis * Complex Scalp Reconstruction * Craniofacial Approaches to brain tumors * Removal of skull and craniofacial tumors * Complex Approaches to the spine and spinal cord * Complex closures of the back following spine surgery * Ventricular Shunt Revision * Repair of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) leaks * Dural Reconstruction * Implantation of Functional Neural Devices == References == Category:Plastic surgery Category:Neurosurgery Category:Surgery Category:Neurology ","title":"Neuroplastic surgery"},{"id":"56650406","text":"The list of shipwrecks in December 1830 includes some ships sunk, foundered, grounded, or otherwise lost during December 1830. ==1 December== ==2 December== ==3 December== ==5 December== ==6 December== ==7 December== ==8 December== ==9 December== ==10 December== ==11 December== ==12 December== ==13 December== ==14 December== ==15 December== ==16 December== ==17 December== ==18 December== ==19 December== ==20 December== ==21 December== ==22 December== ==23 December== ==24 December== ==25 December== ==27 December== ==28 December== ==29 December== ==30 December== ==31 December== ==Unknown date== ==References== 1830-11 Category:December 1830 events ","title":"List of shipwrecks in December 1830"},{"id":"56650420","text":"Phantom Brickworks is the ninth studio album by English producer Stephen Wilkinson, known by his stage name Bibio.

In addition, she is a professor of acting perception, diction, and vocal projection, and a theater and opera director. She is known for being the first to portray the character Carmela in the Isidora Aguirre play ' in 1960. ==Biography== Carmen Barros is the elder of two siblings. Because of her father's military profession, which caused him to be sent on missions in Germany, as well as to different garrisons in the country, Carmen never stayed more than seven months at one school. She lived between Santiago, other cities of the country, Peru, and Europe, and learned to speak German before Spanish. However, she attended the French Nuns, a women's college where she was the \\"wild card\\" of the course for any artistic competition involving dancing or acting. When she was 14 her father was assigned as Chilean ambassador to Germany, and that change marked her life. It was 1940 and World War II was in full development. A lot of people Barros' age that she met on this trip she never saw again; they joined Hitler's army to colonize Europe and fell out of contact. As a counterpoint, the cultural opportunities of Berlin influenced her future career: concerts, opera, theater; despite the horror of the war, that never changed. She tried to resume her basic education, in a German school, but could not stand being in a co-educational one, so she chose to retire and take private classes at home. However she never finished her studies. At age 19 Barros returned to Chile, but everything had changed. Santiago del Campo offered to let her sing on the radio and gave her the pseudonym Marianela. She had begun her career as a singer. She worked at Radio Agricultura, Corporación, and Minería. In 1946, when a company of New York's Metropolitan Opera House came to Chile with the Beethoven opera Fidelio, Barros was invited to participate. It was one of the great successes of the Municipal Theater. She was even invited to go to New York, but did not dare; she had been outside the country for too long. Her brother was the one who spurred her interest in theater. He was an actor and creator of the Pocket Theater, and invited her to participate in the play Carlos y Ana, which she starred in. She also worked with , combining her talents for singing and the theater. This continued until her father was named ambassador to Italy, and the dream vanished. She went to Italy with her husband and three children to see what happened there. She continued with her \\"operatic\\" work, went to live in Vienna, and was invited to take a leading role in the Opera of Brussels, Belgium. However her father was named chancellor and had to return home. She could never reconcile her dreams with distance. Although she endured another year without seeing her children, finally, and although her prospects were favorable, she returned to Chile in 1957. Barros had the opportunity to become an international opera star. She entered the and was invited to participate in Esta Señorita Trini, which was the prelude to La pérgola de las flores. She shared the stage with , Ana González, and many other luminaries, and starred as the first Carmela. Also in 1965 she had a musical group, Los Gatos, which was very successful. After the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, she went to Kenya and worked as a UN official for nine years. Then she returned to Chile and began appearing on television. Her first series was Los títeres (1984), which together with her role on El amor está de moda (1995) was her greatest pride. In 2010, she received the Award for her artistic career. In 2015, she starred alongside Gloria Münchmeyer, Ana Reeves, and in the television series ', directed by .

He appeared one month later in Heroes in Crisis. ==Character biography== Within the context of the stories, while on a trip to Gotham with his adoptive mother, Derek James, a Puerto Rican high school student, falls through a dimensional rift into the dark matter dimension following the events of Dark Nights: Metal. As a result, he gains the power to travel through dimensions and create rifts that can act as small barriers. Derek is best friends with a girl named Ernestine, and is unpopular in school, as well as adopted. A few months after Derek James acquires his powers, he is video recording his powers when he meets a being known as Tempus Fuginaut who accuses Derek of causing tears in reality. Derek escapes but he dislocates his shoulder, and he goes to his best friend Ernestine for help. Ernestine takes him to the hospital, where Derek's adopted mother arrives worrying for him. Suddenly, a mentally unstable woman name Killspeed breaks out and kills several hospital staff members in order to take some money for her cancer. Derek suits up into his Sideways costume and they both fight, with Sideways defeating her. When the police arrive, Sideways use his Rift abilities to teleport, but he accidentally severs Killspeed's arm. A few weeks later, Derek teams up with Hot Spot, a former Teen Titan, to take down a man named Replicant who can replicate superpowers. Replicant accidentally kills himself when he creates multiple rifts on top of his body, and Sideways gains popularity. In Issue 5, Sideways is called out by a villain name Showman who gains power the more people are angry. With quick thinking from Erin, she calms the audience, which allows Sideways to teleport Showman to a different location where he defeats him. In Issue 6, Derek is overwhelmed with stress and doesn't talk to his adopted mother, but finds out his mother was killed by people who were investigating him. In the final issues, Sideways manages to find out the people who killed his mother, and defeat most of them. In Young Justice #13, Derek joins the Young Justice team. == Powers and abilities == Due to Derek falling through the Dark Multiverse during the Dark Nights: Metal event, he acquired several powers involving reality and spacetime manipulation. Derek has the ability to create rifts (tears in the space-time continuum) which allow him to travel through any place he wants as long as he knows where it is. He can also teleport to other people's locations as long as he knows who they are; he did not know where his best friend was but when he imagined her face, he immediately teleported to her location. He can also use rifts for offensive abilities, like cutting off people or redirecting their attacks back at them. Sideways also has super strength and durability as well. When Derek creates a rift on top of another rift, it can create a miniature Black Hole. ==Critical reception== The character has been commonly compared to Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, specifically the Ultimate version, evoking both his costume design and personality. The character and comic initially received mixed reviews, with the first issue averaging 7 out of 10 according to review aggregator Comic Book Roundup.

The band emerged from Cathercist founded by former Wild Fire guitarist Taylor Roberts. After Cathercist lost some band members they recruited new ones, which changed the band's musical direction. As a result, the band no longer felt comfortable performing under their original name and changed it to Wild Fire. Before this transformation, Cathercist had released two albums titled The Untimely Death of Zack Sawyer and As Hope Expires. Wild Fire released their single, \\"Villain\\", on November 5, 2015, which was later included on their debut album released on May 23, 2017, titled Revolt. With this release, they also announced the end of Cathercist. Revolt contains 15 tracks, one of them a cover of Dr. Hook's \\"The Cover of Rolling Stone\\", the album's final track. On March 29, 2018, Wild Fire announced in a Facebook post about an upcoming acoustic record and revealed that Taylor Roberts would be leaving the band. It has been reported that Alidor also left Wild Fire with Roberts, but the band has not confirmed this. On July 26, 2018, Wild Fire announced that Wade Sigue will be replacing Taylor Roberts as lead guitarist. Then on August 2, 2018, Sawyer announced their new musical project is called At the Lake House; each song from will be released independently, not collectively as an album. On January 10, 2019, the band revealed through a Facebook livestream that their new drummer is called Britt Hartley and he will be replacing Cameron Alidor. Soon after this, it was reported that Hartley left the band. With no further comment, Sawyer said “it wasn’t working out.” ==History== ===Formation and early years=== Taylor Roberts, former guitarist of Wild Fire and founder of Cathercist Wild Fire was founded on November 5, 2015, in Biloxi, Mississippi. It evolved from the band Cathercist, which had been active for five years according to an article in the Sun Herald. Former Wild Fire guitarist Taylor Roberts founded Cathercist in Gulfport, Mississippi, but the exact date of the band's beginning is unclear. On their official page on ReverbNation the band says Cathercist was founded in 2007, but on their biography on Last.fm the date is given as 2008. Sources say the band was officially established in 2010. During an interview, Roberts said the band was founded in 2005–2006. They appeared at the 2008 Taste of Chaos concert where they opened for Avenged Sevenfold, Atreyu, and Bullet For My Valentine. This indicates the band was active prior to 2010 and before Sawyer joined as the lead vocalist. The band adapted their name from the word \\"catharsis\\", which they defined as purging or cleansing oneself through music or art. Cathercist released their debut album titled The Untimely Death of Zack Sawyer in 2011. The name represents the change Sawyer went through in the process of making the album. It was recorded in Argo, Alabama, at Echelon Studios, and was produced, mixed and mastered by Joseph McQueen. The band released their second album As Hope Expires on May 24, 2013. They began recording it a week after the release of their first album. It consists of eight tracks, four of which appear on Revolt, Wild Fire's 2017 debut album. The instrumentals were recorded in Miami at Bieler Bros. Studios over the course of a week and the vocals were recorded in Wisconsin. Matt LaPlant produced, mixed and mastered the album. In 2014 Wild Fire was the national winner of the Ernie Ball Battle of the Bands at Welcome to Rockville. left Wild Fire includes members from Cathercist, Zack Sawyer and Taylor Roberts. The other known members of Cathercist were: Aaron Buck (rhythm guitar), Hollis Godsey (bass guitar) and his brother, Chris Godsey (drums), Daniel Ferguson (guitars), Mikhail Cintgran (bass guitar), and Matt Marciana (drums). Tyler Voss and Cameron Alidor replaced them in Wild Fire. Sawyer became a member of Cathercist when he first met Roberts in Mobile, Alabama, in 2009. He was originally a member of a band called 35 Point Week. After they broke up Sawyer auditioned for Cathercist, who had also lost their singer, and was hired the same night. With a new lineup and the release of the new single, \\"Villain\\", in 2015, they announced Cathercist was over and that the band would continue making music under its new name Wild Fire with Zack Sawyer on vocals and piano, Taylor Roberts on guitar, Tyler Voss on bass, and Cameron Alidor on drums. After the announcement, Cathercist's official website was taken down, and their Facebook account was renamed \\"Wild Fire\\". When Sawyer was asked how Wild Fire emerged from Cathercist, he responded saying: > Taylor Roberts and myself were working on our record with our band > Cathercist for a couple of years and then we lost some members. We were > still continuing to work on it, but by the time the record was written, with > the new people involved, it was just a different sound. It was something > new, something we wanted to push forward with and something we really loved. > It's not like we thought our fans didn't like it—we just didn't feel > comfortable continuing under the same name. There were a lot of twists and > turns to get where we looked up and said 'we need to change the name. It's > time'. Taylor Roberts said it was the beginning of a new chapter for them and with four members it felt like a different band with the lineup change. ===2017–present: Revolt and At the Lake House project=== The band released their debut album Revolt on May 23, 2017. Revolt contains 15 tracks and was produced by Matt LaPlant, who sang backing vocals for some of the songs.

In total, all the videos containing the song on YouTube have more than three million views. The single peaked at number 82 on the Media Base Rock Charts in the third quarter of 2017. In an interview, when Roberts was asked about \\"Villain\\", he said the song was about being a villain after he hinted he did not write the song. He cited The Joker as an inspiration, saying \\"there's always been something so fascinating about [Joker]. He's a villain you fall in love with and every now and again, you can find yourself in those same shoes, so his character becomes very relatable.\\" left The band covered one of Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show's songs titled \\"Cover of the Rolling Stone\\", which is included on Revolt. Sawyer revealed that his cousin, Ray Sawyer, was a member in Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show which disbanded in 1985, not long after Ray Sawyer left the band to pursue a solo career. Wild Fire has been featured at 1065 Fest 2016, Rocklahoma 2017, Gulfport Music Fest 2017, and Inktober Fest 2017. The band began touring across the United States after the release of Revolt. They announced a show on September 5, 2017, in Mobile, Alabama, alongside Sick Puppies. Later, on November 14, 2017, they announced a show opening for Sleeping With Sirens in the House of Blues Parish Room in New Orleans on November 15. They also announced they had signed with Artery Global to fulfill their booking needs. In early 2018, the band announced a free concert at the House of Blues in New Orleans alongside Appetite for Destruction, a Guns N' Roses tribute band. Sawyer revealed plans for a new record in summer 2018. On March 29, 2018, along with a statement of an upcoming acoustic record the band announced that Taylor Roberts was leaving Wild Fire. During a Facebook live stream, Tyler Voss and Zack Sawyer announced that the band will \\"no longer be genre specific\\", they also revealed that they will be trying to release a new song each month. According to former lead guitarist Roberts, the album features songs from their debut album Revolt re- recorded acoustically, along with some covers, at Sawyer's house in the last week of February. On April 25, 2018, the band released a single from the new album, which is a cover of Post Malone's \\"I Fall Apart\\", to YouTube. on May 2, 2018, Roberts performed his last show with Wild Fire. Tyler Voss has been the bassist of Wild Fire since its formation in 2015 On June 27, 2018, drummer Cameron Alidor also announced through a Facebook post that he will be leaving Wild Fire \\"to focus on other opportunities.\\" It has been reported that Alidor left the band when Roberts did, but Wild Fire postponed the announcement. On July 11, Wild Fire broke the news to their fans on their official Facebook account, stating that \\"auditions are officially closed for guitar\\" and they are accepting auditions from drummers. On July 26, 2018, Sawyer and Voss revealed via a video posted to YouTube and their social media accounts that the guitarist from Memory of a Melody, Wade Sigue, will be replacing Taylor Roberts. On August 2, 2018, Sawyer reported the band will be releasing a collection of songs titled At the Lake House, but each of the songs will be released independently. Amongst the songs will be re-recorded tracks from Revolt and covers of pop songs. Sawyer reported that even though they announced they will no longer be genre specific, that does not mean they will leave hard rock behind. He said that At the Lake House was a project they wanted to do. All the songs on At the Lake House will be acoustic. Roberts left with two songs left to be recorded. The guitar parts for those songs were written by Sawyer and producer Matt LaPlant. It has been reported that the band also stripped off some parts of the finished songs which were written by Roberts. On November 6, 2018, the band released the second song from At the Lake House, which was a cover of Marshmallow's Silence. On February, 14, 2019, the band published their first song since Silence titled \\"Earned It\\", with a noticeable stylistic change musically. ==Musical style and influences== Wild Fire labeled the genre of their music as \\"loud and aggressive hard rock\\" in 2015–2018. During an interview, former guitarist Taylor Roberts said: \\"We’re too hard to be hard rock but we’re not hard enough to be metal, so we’re kind of a nice little in-between [...] we hate labeling the genre that we’re in. We play music and we like to have a good time.\\" After Roberts left the band, Sawyer and Voss both announced that they will no longer be genre specific. After the announcement, some fans were led to believe that Wild Fire will be abandoning hard rock. Sawyer said: > We haven’t left the old sound behind exactly. People who love music tend to > love all kinds of music. We’re just showing off a different side to our > musical interests. The hard rock is not gone. This was just something we had > to do. […] It just means we’re going to do whatever we want with little to > no regard for what we’ve done in the past. It means that we’re a rock band > that can do anything. If I want to write an acoustic song, I will. A pop > song, a rap song, a country song. It means this band will fulfill all of our > musical endeavors instead of making side projects to fulfill those ideas. > We’re still making rock music. The band is known for using classical instruments like pianos and strings on their songs, especially on the Revolt record. The band has seen a stylistic change with their new materials, stripping rock elements from the At the Lake House songs. == Band members == ;Current members * Zack Sawyer – lead vocals, piano (2015–present) * Tyler Voss – bass guitar, backing vocals (2015–present) ;Past members * Taylor Roberts – lead guitar, backing vocals (2015–2018) * Cameron Alidor – drums (2015–2018) * Britton Hartley – drums (2019) * Wade Sigue – lead guitar (2018–2019) ==Discography== * Revolt (2017) ==ReferencesWild Fire at ReverbNation Category:American hard rock musical groups Category:Rock music groups from Mississippi Category:Musical groups established in 2015 Category:Musical quartets ","title":"Wild Fire (band)"},{"id":"56650534","text":"Tullytrasna () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland.

It was the refectory of the Olivetan monastery of Santa Maria di Monteoliveto Touring Club Italiano, 2008, p. 148 until 1688, when it was converted to its current role. The conversion in 1688 revealed 15th century inlays by Fra Giovanni da Verona, also to be seen in the church's Tolosa Chapel. The church was renamed Sant'Anna dei Lombardi in 1805. An Adoration of the Shepherds by a follower of Vasari was moved to its present position above the door in the counter-facade during the 17th century. The two side lunettes contain sculptures of the archangel Gabriel and the Virgin Mary, attributed to Giovan Battista Cavagna and resting on two marble lavabos leaning against the walls Cesare Cundari, Arnaldo Venditti, Il complesso di Monteoliveto, Gangemi, 1999. The central nave vault is divided into three quadrants, showing personifications of Faith, Religion and EternityLa Repubblica It is accompanied along the walls by 17th century furniture decorated with a cycle of precious wooden inlays by Fra Giovanni da Verona dating to 1506 (the third cycle after those of Santa Maria in Organo in Verona and the Territorial Abbey of Monte Oliveto Maggiore near Asciano) with views of the city and scenes of life in the Olivetan order. Between the inlays are niches with wooden statues showing saints relating to the Olivetans. Behind the altar is a painting of Carlo Borromeo by Girolamo d'Arena, which had hung in the original church of Sant'Anna dei Lombardi (which had also been dedicated to St Carlo Borromeo) but was moved to its present location after that church was destroyed in the 1805 earthquake. Either side are two paintings of Michael the Archangel and the Virgin Mary. ==History== It is named after Giorgio Vasari who in 1545 painted its vault frescoes, whilst it was still a refectory. His fame had reached Naples due to his 1542-44 works in Rome and due to his capacity to complete commissions quickly. His time in Campania from 1544 to 1545 was short but busy and brought Tuscan Mannerism (which had previously only reached as far as Rome) to Naples. He received several commissions from viceroy don Pedro da Toledo, from noblemen and from monasteries, the first of which was to decorate the old refectory of the monastery next to Santa Maria di Monteoliveto. Detail of a vault He almost refused it due to the space's Gothic architecture, which he felt might be too dark to show off his style to best effect. He decided to take it, however, and plastered the vaults, brightening the space and giving him extra space to paint. Some of the figures were painted from Vasari's drawings by Raffaellino del Colle,Touring Club Italiano, 2008, p. 150, whilst Stefano Veltroni and others assisted with the purely decorative areas. Whilst painting the frescoes Vasari also produced two triptychs, one for the room's counter-facade and one for its back wall, showing The Manna from Heaven and The Feast in the House of Simon, now in the Museo nazionale di Capodimonte and museo diocesano di Napoli. ==References== ==Bibliography (in Italian)== * AA.VV., Vasari a Napoli, Paparo Edizioni (2011) * Cesare Cundari, Arnaldo Venditti, Il complesso di Monteoliveto, Gangemi, 1999 * D'Ambrosio P., La chiesa di Monteoliveto (1952) Category:Buildings and structures in Naples Category:Church frescos in Italy Sacristy Category:Olivetan Order ","title":"Vasari Sacristy"},{"id":"56650647","text":"Wang Jian (), also known as Wang Chien, is a female Chinese former international table tennis player. ==Table tennis career== She won two bronze medals at the 1961 World Table Tennis Championships in the women's doubles with Hu Keming and women's singles.

The cells are then lifted and media is changed until the development of a mucociliary phenotype of a pseudostratified epithelium, similar to the tracheal epithelium. This method of cell culture aims to be used to study fundamental aspects of the respiratory epithelium, such as cell-to-cell signaling, disease modeling, and respiratory regeneration. Air-liquid interface cell culture compares to standard cell culture practices by specifically aiming to restore the pseudostratified striation of the respiratory airway in vitro, and aiming to maintain the respiratory airway-niche of (from top to bottom) 1) air, 2) pseudostratified epithelium, and 3) liquid media. Standard cell culture processes are either non-airway specific, or revolve around an organ system that require other means of cellular maintenance in vitro. == Protocol == The protocol for air-liquid interface culture relies on two key steps: isolation of the epithelial cells from an organism, and culture of those cells === Isolation === Organs with epithelial cells are isolated (dissected) and placed in PBS to clean any impurities and these isolated organs are digested using trypsin. After the digest, ROCK inhibitor (Rho-associated kinase inhibitor) is added to prevent cellular apoptosis of isolated cells. What is left is digested cellular content mixed with tissue; pronase/DNAse is added to clean up dead cellular material as well as any remaining protein material. The resulting material is chopped finely in media and individual isolated cell samples are placed in respectively marked microcentrifuge tubes, and shaken at 37 °C for 30 – 40 minutes. Once the cells have been incubated, they are plated onto transwell membranes for growth. === Culture === Plate cells with SABM (Small Airway Basal Media) to enrich the cells with nutrients for the purpose of growth and eventual differentiation. Once the cells are plated, they are grown for 3–7 days under careful observation (while changing media each day) until desired confluence is reached. More recently, a study on In vitro generation of type-II pneumocytes initiated from human CD34(+) stem cells has been demonstrated the air liquid interface cell culture method precisely. == Uses in scientific study == Air-liquid interface cultures are used in many stem cell studies which aim to recreate a pseudostratified epithelium in vitro. These studies can contribute to new findings in various topics: === Cancer === In modeling cancer and various other diseases, the stem cells in the basal layer of the tracheal epithelium (basal stem cells) were isolated and used in developing 3D organoids that could be used for various studies, including tumor studies. The cell culture method used involves the isolation of cells into culturing with growth factors to grow over time. Once the cells had been grown, they were mixed with Matrigel and cultured to form 3D organoids. === Cell growth/differentiation === In modeling the pseudostratified epithelium in vitro, more cellular studies have been performed in order to determine the nature of the cells – their differentiation pathways, their growth mechanism, their repair/response mechanism in the state of post-injury. One recent study has shown that differentiated cells in the respiratory epithelium (secretory cells and ciliated cells primarily) can dedifferentiate into their naive status, and become stem-like again. == Adapted protocol: maintenance of stem-like properties in basal stem cells == As an adaptation to the air-liquid interface culture protocol, auxiliary protocols have been developed using the ALI framework to maintain naive stem cell properties for extensive periods of time. ==References== Category:Cell culture ","title":"Air-liquid interface cell culture"},{"id":"56650705","text":"Hu Keming (, born 1940), also known as Hu Ko-ming is a female Chinese former international table tennis player. ==Table tennis career== She won a bronze medal at the 1961 World Table Tennis Championships in the women's doubles with Wang Jian and a silver medal in the Corbillon Cup (women's team) for China. ==See also== * List of table tennis players * List of World Table Tennis Championships medalists ==References== Category:Chinese female table tennis players Category:Table tennis players from Guangzhou Category:Living people Category:1940 births Category:World Table Tennis Championships medalists ","title":"Hu Keming"},{"id":"56650719","text":"Parque Puebla is a shopping mall in the La Cienega area of Puebla City, Mexico, located between the Stadium District and the Instituto Tecnológico de Puebla near the Mexico City–Puebla tollway (150D).http://periodicocentral.mx/2017/vida-y-estilo/item/17511-inauguran- centro-comercial-parque-puebla-estas-son-las-tiendas-que-encontraras It was developed by Fibra Danhos at a cost of 4.5 billion pesos (240 million U.S. dollars).https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/estados/Centros-comerciales-preven- aumentar-inversion-en-Puebla-20180221-0034.html Governor Rafael Moreno of the State of Puebla inaugurated the center in January 2017.

Seventeen units were built by Officine Meccaniche (OM) of Milan, with electrical equipment by Tecnomasio Italiano-Brown-Boveri (TIBB), from 1923 to haul heavy passenger trains on the electrified line of the Milan - Varese - Porto Ceresio railway and for use on the so-called \\"subway\\" of Naples. == Construction == The locomotive consisted of a single central box, following the typical design of the time, with cabs and control desks at each end. This was mounted on a rigid frame carried on three coupled axles with 1,500 mm driving wheels and a carrying axle on the typical Italian Zara bogie at each end. The wheel arrangement was 1′C1′. The electrical equipment was contained in the central body. Two direct current (DC) traction motors provided a total power of and the locomotive could reach a maximum speed of 95 km/h. The design was almost the same as the E.320, but addressed the fragility of the E.320's mechanical rod transmission. The two motors, of similar but slightly lower power rating, were now set lower in the frame. This allowed the previous arrangement of steeply inclined coupling rods to intermediate jackshafts to be replaced by a lighter triangular rod on each side, similar to that used on the Italian three-phase locomotives, and no longer needing the jackshafts. The total weight of the locomotive in working order was 69 tonnes, of which 48 tonnes was adhesive. This was nearly three tonnes lighter than the E.320 and yet there was nearly a ton more adhesive weight.

In the method, subjects are kept in constant conditions for at least 24 hours. These include constant light and temperature, as well as constant semi-recumbent posture. In addition, subjects' food intake is evenly distributed throughout the protocol, and subjects are typically not allowed to sleep for the duration. While in these conditions, subjects are often assessed for a number of variables of interest. Two of the most common and best understood of these variables are core body temperature and melatonin. ==History== The term was first coined by in 1978 after it was used in an experiment to determine the effects of jet lag independent of an individual's behavioral cycle - though the methods involved in a constant routine date back to at least 1947. The protocol arose from the well established concept in circadian research that the observation of organisms under constant conditions allows for the illumination of endogenous rhythms, as first described by French scientist Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan in 1729. In contrast to previous methods, however, the constant routine protocol was developed upon the recognition that several key behaviors exhibiting circadian rhythmicity (including sleep-wake cycle, the behavioral cycle, and the food-intake cycle) also act as masking agents of some endogenous rhythms. ==Discoveries== The constant routine protocol, because of its ability to drastically reduce the masking effect of exogenous influences on the circadian pacemaker, has yielded invaluable results in the literature over the last 40 years of its use. Some of these achievements include accurate characterization of the endogenous components of the diurnal rhythms of melatonin, core body temperature, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), glucose tolerance, heart rate, and cognitive performance, among others. ==Drawbacks== Constant routine protocols have been criticized due to evidence that the conditions necessary for the protocol themselves influence the circadian clock. Sleep deprivation and constant dim lighting may mask the endogenous clock or affect circadian phase. For example, it has been demonstrated previously that sleep deprivation itself has an effect on heart rate rhythms as measured by EEG. In addition, it has been suggested that sleep deprivation and the constant routine protocol may themselves effect the circadian phase of the participant, based on research done in hamsters. ==References== Category:Circadian rhythm Category:Sleep Category:Sleep physiology ","title":"Constant routine protocol"},{"id":"56650816","text":"Car in space may refer to: * Lunar Roving Vehicles launched and driven on the surface of the Moon: ** Apollo 15, in July 1971 ** Apollo 16, in April 1972 ** Apollo 17, in December 1972 * Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster, launched into outer space in February 2018 ","title":"Cars in space"},{"id":"56650839","text":"The International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders (abbreviated ISSPD) is an international learned society dedicated to promoting research on personality disorders.

When the city of Sukhumi fell to the Russian-supported separatists on 27 September 1993, Berulava along with other authorities from the legitimate Government of Abkhazian Autonomous Republic (Zhiuli Shartava, Raul Eshba, Mamia Alasania, Guram Gabiskiria and others) refused to leave the besieged city and was captured by Abkhaz militants and North Caucasian mercenaries. Based on video materials, Human rights documents and witness accountsUS State Department, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1993, February 1994, pp. 80 of the event, Berulava, Gabiskiria, Shartava, Eshba and other members of the government were dragged outside of the parliament building and forced to knee by the Abkhaz/North Caucasian militants.

Its primary host plant is Pistacia and its secondary host is a grass, where it is present on the roots. Here it is associated with an ant and part of its life cycle is spent in the ant's nest. ==Hosts== The primary host for this species is the terebinth or turpentine tree (Pistacia terebinthus). Its secondary hosts include the grasses and cereals bent, wild oat, cock's-foot, fescue, wall barley, barley, rice, meadow-grass, Polypogon viridis, tall fescue, Stipa capensis and wheat. ==Distribution== Paracletus cimiciformis is native to much of Europe and has been recorded in North Africa and Asia. ==Life cycle== The life cycle of P. cimiciformis is complex. For most of the year, wingless females are produced parthogenetically, but in the late summer on their secondary hosts (grass), winged males and females are produced which fly to their primary host, the terebinth tree. Here they mate and overwintering eggs are laid. In the spring these hatch and the wingless females that develop create swollen galls on the leaves; they live in these galls and reproduce asexually. In late summer some winged females develop which fly off and colonise the roots of grasses. Some of these aphids are carried into their nests by ants, where they overwinter, emerging in the spring to recolonise the roots of their secondary hosts, the whole cycle taking two years. ==Ecology== Although Pistacia is the primary host plant, this aphid is present in parts of Europe where this tree does not grow, and in these localities, the insect stays on the roots of the secondary host all year round. On grasses, it is always found living in association with ants in the genus Tetramorium such as the pavement ant (Tetramorium caespitum) and Tetramorium semilaeve. On its secondary host, the aphids have two genetically identical forms. One of these has a rounded green body and sucks the sap of the host plant; it produces honeydew which is consumed by the ants, and in fact the ants herd the aphids and stimulate them to produce honeydew. The other form has a flattened brown body and produces pheromones which mimic those produced by ant larvae. When approached by an ant these flattened aphids remain stationary and get carried into the ant nest and deposited among the ant brood. Here they proceed to prey on the ant larvae, piercing them with their stylets and sucking out the hemolymph. They stay in the ant nest during the winter, and in the spring are carried to near the surface of the ground with the ant's own young. Here they produce round-bodied aphids which proceed to feed on grass roots and reproduce asexually. Both round-bodied and flattened morphs can reproduce parthogenetically, producing either form of offspring, and it is unclear what factors trigger the production of one morph in preference to another. ==References== Category:Eriosomatinae Category:Insects described in 1837 Category:Hemiptera of Europe ","title":"Paracletus cimiciformis"},{"id":"56651189","text":"Pinus yorkshirensis is an extinct species of pine tree.

During his long career, Indian film actor- director Kamal Haasan has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his acting commitments or direction. Some of these projects fell into development hell or were officially cancelled. == 1960s == === Mangala Mangai === Mangala Mangai, starring Kamal Haasan as a child actor, has not been released. == 1980s == === Chamayam === Chamayam is a 1981 Malayalam-language movie directed by Sathyan Anthikad and written by John Paul Puthusery. Kamal Haasan and Ambika were meant to star in the film, but the project was later shelved. The project was abandoned because of the death of producer Majendran, who has co-produced the 1981 film Sambhavam. === Raja Ennai Mannithuvidu === In 1982, C. Rudhraiya began a venture titled Raja Ennai Mannithuvidu, with Kamal Haasan playing younger brother to Chandrahasan. Sujatha was cast as the latter’s wife and Sumalatha was to play Kamal’s heroine. The story dealt with the conflict between the peacenik older brother and the Naxal leanings of the Kamal character. The film was shot simultaneously in Telugu language. After 15 days shoot, this movie was shelved. One song recorded for the film by Ilaiyaraaja were later used in Mohan starrer Anbin Mugavari (1985). === Khabardar === Telugu director Tatineni Rama Rao started working on the film in 1984, which was a social drama centred upon a terminally ill patient and a doctor. Kamal Haasan and Amitabh Bachchan worked on the film which revolved around the notion of euthanasia. However, after shooting a substantial portion of the film, it was shelved. === Untitled adaptation of The Godfather === In the mid-1980s, Muktha Srinivasan planned to direct a film based on the American film The Godfather (1972) with Sivaji Ganesan, Kamal Haasan and Amala. He paid them an advance and confirmed their dates; however the project was dropped after Kamal Haasan's then associate Ananthu felt that it would be a Ganesan- focused film and not a Kamal film. === Top Tucker === This film, directed by Bharathiraaja, was to have starred Kamal Haasan and Radha. After was canned, the film was shelved as Bharathiraaja felt it was becoming too similar to his and Kamal's earlier film Sigappu Rojakkal (1978), and decided to collaborate with Kamal on a different film, which eventually became Oru Kaidhiyin Diary. == 1990s == === Athi Veerapandiyan === In the early 1990s, Gangai Amaran agreed terms to direct a film titled Athi Veerapandiyan starring Kamal Haasan in the lead role. The film was based on jallikattu and Aishwarya was signed to portray the leading female role. However Kamal Haasan later opted out of the film and instead began work on another rural drama, Thevar Magan (1992), directed by Bharathan. He later credited Gangai Amaran for the idea of the song \\"Sandhu Pottu\\" from the film, which was initially meant for Athi Veerapandiyan. In 2016, Gangai Amaran alleged that his brother Ilaiyaraaja had effectively told Kamal Haasan to stop working on the project, during an ego clash between the two brothers. === Ponniyin Selvan === In an interview with Filmfare in January 1994, director Mani Ratnam stated that adopting Kalki Krishnamurthy's historical novel Ponniyin Selvan was one of his \\"dream projects\\" that he had hoped to work on during his career. Ratnam revealed that he worked on a first draft of the film alongside Kamal Haasan, who had bought the rights of the novel, but the pair shelved their plan as the project did not make financial sense at the time. === Kanden Seethaiyai === Balachandra Menon wanted to remake his Malayalam film Ammayane Sathyam (1993) into Tamil, and turned down remake offers from other directors. Producer Raveendran signed on Kamal Haasan to do the film and recruited S. P. Balasubrahmanyam to take another role. The team initially approached Annie, who starred in the original to reprise her role as the lead female character, though her reluctance meant that the team picked newcomer Ruchita Prasad, who adopted a stage name of Jayasandhya. The makers abandoned the project due to creative differences. It was later alleged that Kamal Haasan had wanted his role to be more prominent than the character from the original version. Kamal Haasan subsequently moved on to begin work on Avvai Shanmughi (1996), and recruited several members of the cast of Kanden Seethaiyai to work on his next project. === Ladies Only === A remake of the Tamil film Magalir Mattum (1994), the film is yet to have a theatrical release for unknown reasons. Produced by Kamal Haasan, Ladies Only is the story of three women, Seema Biswas, Shilpa Shirodkar and Heera Rajagopal working in the same office. They are constantly harassed by their lecherous boss Randhir Kapoor. The three decide to gang up against him to teach a lesson, but a strange accident complicates things when the boss lands in a hospital and the three women end up with the dead body of a terrorist, played by Kamal Haasan. === Marudhanayagam === Kamal Haasan had been pondering directing a historical film for a period of four to five years, when writer Sujatha suggested that Kamal Haasan looked at a folk ballad edited by Tamil scholar Vanamamalai, which introduced them to the historical figure of Muhammed Yusuf Khan, an 18th-century warrior. Kamal Haasan immediately agreed at the prospect and felt that the story had all the potential of a good historical film, being appealed to by the elevation from the nadir to the top of Khan's life. Sujatha revealed that nearly 80% of the film would faithfully adapt Samuel Charles Hill's biography of Khan, also known as Marudhanayagam, and to only use imagination where no solid or substantial information is available. The producers and Kamal Haasan managed to rope in Queen Elizabeth II to appear as the chief guest at the launch of the project which took place in the MGR Film City on 16 October 1997. The launch also saw the inaugural shot canned with Kamal Haasan, in the persona of Marudhanayagam, hearing and reacting to an imperial announcement read out by the character played by Nassar, with Om Puri's character looking on. Official filming began several months later in Velangudi on 10 August 1998 with a scene of where a companion of the lead character, played by Kamal Haasan, is hanged prompting a brief altercation. Works on Marudhanayagam suddenly ceased after a British company that had planned to co-produce the film backed out and the film has been indefinitely postponed since. Haasan had invested 8 crores of his own wealth into the project through and has since revealed that the film would be revived at a future date. Since 1999, Kamal Haasan has consistently spoken of plans to revive the film. === Londonil Kameshwaran === Kamal Haasan had written the script of Londonil Kameshwaran and wanted to play the lead role in the late 1990s, but never got down to making it because he felt it would not have been cost-effective. Through the project, he had aimed to reprise his character of the Palakkad Brahmin cook Kameshwaran from Michael Madana Kama Rajan (1990) and place him in funny situations when he visits London. He had briefly considered making the film in early 1999 after Marudhanayagam had run into production troubles, but instead chose to prioritise his commitments for Hey Ram (2000). After the profitable Pammal K. Sambandam (2002), Mouli asked Haasan to re-collaborate with this particular script but Haasan was uninterested. Madhavan was selected by Haasan to replace him, after the pair had shot for Anbe Sivam together in the period, and the project was made under Haasan's production house with the title of Nala Damayanthi (2003). == 2000s == === Robot === Following the completion of his first directorial venture in Hindi, Nayak (2001), S. Shankar announced his next project, Robot, which was to feature Kamal Haasan and Preity Zinta. The film was to be produced by the now-defunct company Media Dreams, a division of Pentamedia Graphics. The film was reported to be a futuristic techno-thriller set in Chennai in around 2200 or 3000 AD. Despite the completion of a photoshoot featuring Haasan and Zinta, the project was shelved as a result of scheduling conflicts with Haasan. Shankar consequently started work on Boys (2003). The film was eventually revived and released in 2010 as Enthiran starring Rajinikanth and Aishwarya Rai. === Krishna Leela === In February 2004, Kamal Haasan and Singeetham Sreenivasa Rao began pre-production works on a project titled Krishna Leela. The film was set to narrate the story of an individual called Krishna Das, played by Kamal Haasan, and the women in his life. The project was described as a comedy entertainer, much like the actor and director's previous collaborations in the 1990s. Gautami was reported to feature alongside him in a leading role, in a proposed comeback, while actresses Rohini and Vinodhini were also cast in roles. Comedians including Goundamani, Vadivelu, Senthil, Vivek and Chitti Babu were also added to the supporting cast. Seeking to cast two new actresses, Kamal Haasan scouted for talent in London. The film was later dropped, and Kamal Haasan and Rao considered working together for a different project.http://tfmpage.com/forum/5623.03.44.05.html === Kumar Sambhavam === In May 2004, Kamal Haasan and Singeetham Sreenivasa Rao were keen to make a Hindi and Tamil bilingual film titled Kumar Sambhavam with Madhuri Dixit as the lead actress. Kamal Haasan stated he needed a \\"woman of substance who would look convincing as a wife and mother\\" and stated there was \\"no second choice\\" for the role. Bharat Shah was set to finance the project and negotiated terms with Dixit to work on the project, having earlier worked with her during the making of Devdas (2002).http://tfmpage.com/forum/19880.05.19.18.html The film was dropped after Dixit quoted a salary, which was more than the whole cost of the film itself. Kamal Haasan later expressed his disappointment at the film not materialising as a result of Dixit's refusal. === KG === Kamal Haasan, Singeetham Sreenivasa Rao and Ramesh Aravind discussed the script of a film titled KG in early 2004, usually during Kamal Haasan's visits to Bangalore. Described as a \\"cop thriller\\" to be shot in Tamil and Kannada around Bangalore, Kamal Haasan revealed that there would be no female lead and that it would be \\"quite a change\\" from his other films.http://tfmpage.com/forum/21712.00.12.57.html In a turn of events, Kamal Haasan accepted an offer to star in Saran's Vasool Raja MBBS (2004), and put KG on hold. He later continued to work on KG, which marked Ramesh Aravind's directorial debut, and Mumbai-based financier Bharat Shah agreed to fund the film. The trio later decided to indefinitely postpone work on the project. === Marmayogi === Marmayogi was first pondered by Kamal Haasan after the release of Aalavandhan (2001), however nothing proceeded. After a four-year sabbatical from directing films since Virumaandi (2004), Kamal Haasan announced Marmayogi as his next project after the completion of Dasavathaaram (2008). The film was planned as a bilingual Hindi-Tamil period film, set in the 7th century. Production house Pyramid Saimira along with Haasan's company Raaj Kamal Films International were set to produce the venture, and work began in late 2007. Early media reports suggested a box- office battle between Marmayogi and Shankar's Enthiran (2010), which was rebooted from the shelved Robot. Pre-production on the film continued throughout 2008, with technicians such as Rajesh Selva and Sanu Varghese actively involved for close to a year. Meanwhile, Kamal Haasan grew a long, thick beard for the film. He also cast actresses Hema Malini, Trisha, Shriya Saran and Sushmita Sen in pivotal roles. Along with Trisha, Kamal Haasan held a photoshoot at the AVM Studios in August 2008. Following the failure of Rajinikanth's Kuselan (2008), Pyramid Saimira opted out of the project in November 2008, effectively shelving the film. Kamal Haasan subsequently moved on to begin work on Unnaipol Oruvan (2009), and later filed a legal complaint against Pyramid Saimira for loss of earnings. === Thalaivan Irukkiraan === The project was first reported in the media in November 2008 as Kamal Haasan's next project, after his historical drama Marmayogi was shelved as a result of Pyramid Saimira's financial problems. Titled Thalaivan Irukkiraan and described by The Times of India as an \\"action adventure\\" film, it was said to be directed by Kamal Haasan and co-produced by Gemini Film Circuit and Sun Pictures, with A. R. Rahman working as the music composer. Pre-production works continued throughout late 2008, with actors such as Rishi Kapoor, Mohanlal and Venkatesh approached for leading roles. Actresses Trisha and Shriya Saran, who were originally a part of Marmayogi, were expected to be retained for the film in order to use the dates they had allotted for the shelved film. Kamal Haasan's Raaj Kamal Films International registered the film's title but production was postponed after a deal could not be agreed with the proposed co-producers. During the period, Kamal Haasan also pitched the idea of financing the film to Udhayanidhi Stalin of Red Giant Movies, who did not take up the offer citing that he felt the script was too political. He later used the dates offered by Mohanlal and Venkatesh for another of his productions, Unnaipol Oruvan (2009), which was incorrectly reported in the media as being the same project as Thalaivan Irukkiraan. In November 2010, Kamal Haasan revealed that he was busy writing the final draft of the film and would look to start production by March 2011 with American producers. Actress Anushka Shetty was also reported to have accepted to star in the film during the period, but the film was again stalled. In January 2012, the film resurfaced with Kamal Haasan confirming that the film would be simultaneously made in Hindi under the title of Amar Hain. The media reported that the film would be produced by Aascar Ravichandran, with actors Mohanlal, Ajith Kumar, Ravi Teja and Katrina Kaif also in the cast, though this later proved to be untrue. Reports later in February 2012, suggested that Kamal Haasan had asked Shankar to direct the film, with Jackie Chan, Salman Khan, Prabhas and Asin amongst others speculated to be a part of the project. Chakri Toleti was also reportedly approached to be the film's director during July 2012, but the project still did not materialise. After three years of inactivity, in June 2015, Kamal Haasan announced that he was reviving the film and that Saif Ali Khan would feature alongside him in a leading role. Associating with Hindi producers Virender K. Arora and Arjun N. Kapoor, Kamal Haasan revealed that the project would be a \\"contemporary story, touching on politics, finance and the underworld\\" and \\"an action film with lots of emotion\\", while comparing the film to Brian De Palma's English film, The Untouchables (1987). He added that the film would be shot in Mumbai and Delhi in India, with schedules also planned in Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States, while also that he would finish scripting the film after he finished work on the production of Thoongaa Vanam (2015). Despite the announcements, the producers backed out of the project and the film was again stalled. After two more years of inactivity, in July 2017, Kamal Haasan suggested that he would revive the project after the release of Vishwaroopam 2 (2018) and Sabaash Naidu. Following a further period of quiet, where Kamal Haasan also revealed that he would stop acting, it was announced that composer A. R. Rahman and studio Lyca Productions became attached to the project in July 2019.https://cinema.dinamalar.com/tamil-news/79769/cinema/Kollywood/Sabash- naidu-drop,-Thalaivan-Irukiran-restart.htm === 19 Steps === In mid-2008, Kamal Haasan agreed terms to be a part of an Indo-Japanese production titled 19 Steps to be directed by Bharat Bala. The film was written by Malayalam scriptwriter, M. T. Vasudevan Nair and was set to tell the tale of a Samurai warrior trying to conquer the ancient Indian martial art of Kalaripayattu. Starring alongside Asin and Tadanobu Asano, Kamal Haasan was set to play the role of an Indian martial arts guru. The film was being produced by Walt Disney and pre-production work had begun with large portions set to be shot in Kerala. Twenty days before the film began shoot, Kamal Haasan dropped out and the film was subsequently reported to be shelved indefinitely. As recently as 2016, Bharat Bala and producer Phillip Lee have expressed their desire to continue the film with a different cast. === The Tooth of Buddha === In mid-2009, Kamal Haasan agreed terms to work with Mysskin on a film about Buddha. Following the cancellation of Marmayogi and 19 Steps, Kamal Haasan was keen to work on a historical film with a similar theme, with the project also referred to in the media as 500 BC. He travelled to the United States to seek out production companies who were willing to fund the film, but no studio eventually agreed. Mysskin was then forced to drop the project and revealed it took him six months to get over the disappointment of the project's sudden end. == 2010s == === Moo === In late 2012, Hollywood producer Barrie Osborne expressed his interest in making an English film in association with Kamal Haasan, who would direct the project and feature in the lead role. The actor subsequently announced a project titled Moo in February 2013, which was said to be about three lives. A potential English title of Triple Impact was speculated, while other sources titled the film as Yaavarum Kelir, with an English title of All Are Kin. The project later failed to develop. In 2017, sources suggested that the film was still under consideration. === Amma Appa Vilayattu === In November 2015, Kamal Haasan and T. K. Rajeev Kumar agreed to collaborate on a project and announced that they were working on a family drama script to be titled Amma Appa Vilayattu in Tamil and Amma Naana Aata in Telugu. After initial discussions with Sridevi failed to materialise, Rajeev Kumar cast Amala Akkineni and Zarina Wahab in pivotal roles and announced that the film would be shot entirely across the United States, with schedules in New York and Georgia. The film was later postponed and by early 2016, Kamal Haasan chose to collaborate with Rajeev Kumar on a different project that he had written himself, Sabaash Naidu. === Sabaash Naidu === In early 2016, following the postponement of Amma Appa Vilayattu, Kamal Haasan developed a story featuring the character of Balram Naidu, the RAW operative from his 2008 film Dasavathaaram for Sabaash Naidu, and T. K. Rajeev Kumar was handed directorial duties. Co-produced by Raaj Kamal Films International and Lyca Productions, the film was launched in three languages, with the title Sabaash Naidu used for the Tamil and Telugu versions, and Shabhash Kundu used for the Hindi version. Kamal Haasan's daughter Shruti Haasan was selected for a key acting role, while his younger daughter Akshara Haasan joined the team as an assistant director. Ramya Krishnan, Brahmanandam and Saurabh Shukla were selected for other acting roles in the production. The team commenced the shoot in Los Angeles, California during June 2016. The shoot of the film was initially put on hold in June 2016 after the original director T. K. Rajeev Kumar was diagnosed with Lyme disease, prompting Kamal Haasan to takeover as the director. Two days after Rajeev Kumar's exit, the film's editor James Joseph also withdrew from the project after his wife had met with an accident. After the completion of the film's schedule in the US, Kamal Haasan chose to replace the original cinematographer Jaya Krishna Gummadi after being unimpressed with his work.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/After- directors-exit-Sabash-Naidu-team-reshuffled/articleshow/53409828.cms In July 2016, Kamal Haasan fractured his leg after falling at his home in Chennai, with the incident leading to an indefinite delay of the project. During the period of the production delay, in November 2016, Kamal Haasan split with his long time partner Gautami, who had also worked in the project as a costume designer. Delays meant that the actors in the project had committed to other films and it became difficult to coordinate all the cast members to partake in the shoot at short notice. In January 2017, plans to begin the film again were delayed following the death of Githamani, the wife of co-producer Chandrahasan. Two months after the death of his wife, Chandrahasan also died of a heart attack while visiting London. The film was further delayed as a result of Kamal Haasan's entry into politics, with the actor stating his final film would be Indian 2 (2020) for Lyca Productions.Shruti Haasan opens up on 'Sabaash Naidu'https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/shruti-haasan- interview/article25575515.ece == References == Category:Kamal Haasan Haasan, Kamal Haasan, Kamal ","title":"Kamal Haasan's unrealized projects"},{"id":"56651471","text":"Emiliano Michael Ghan Carranza (born 5 June 1995) is an Uruguayan footballer who plays for Atenas de San Carlos as a midfielder. ==Club career== Ghan was born in Canelones, and was a Danubio youth graduate.

Though comprising a range of trade unionists, Quebec nationalists, students and other leftists raising many different demands (along with a small contingent from McGill's CEGEP), the key objective for which the protest was called was for McGill University to become a French- speaking educational institution. The demonstration took place in Montreal on March 28, 1969 in the midst of Quebec's Quiet Revolution. On this day, approximately 10,000–15,000 protesters, gathered and walked down Sherbrooke street towards the Roddick Gates calling for McGill University to become francophone, along with pro-worker and nationalist demands . These protesters held signs that read slogans such as \\"McGill aux Québécois!\\" and \\"McGill aux travailleurs\\", which loosely translates to \\"McGill to Quebeckers\\" and \\"McGill to workers\\" respectively. Afraid this demonstration might turn violent, 100 police officers were deployed as well as 1,300 police officers on call. Also awaiting the demonstrators at the Roddick Gates were 3,000 spectators. The demonstration was mostly peaceful, with some altercations taking place between demonstration supporters and some English students who responded to the demonstration by chanting \\"God save the Queen\\". == Background == The political agenda of this demonstration largely coincided with the current of Quebec nationalist ideology that emphasised decolonisation and the construction of a socialist Francophone-dominated Quebec, especially that espoused in the political review Parti Pris. Those taking part in Opération McGill saw McGill University as a key symbol of Anglo-Saxon power in Quebec and the idea to \\"francise\\" the university coincided with the larger aim of decolonizing Quebec. Though the call to turn McGill into a French-speaking university was very popular symbolically within the far-left of the Quebec nationalist movement, there was a much broader political consensus around the need to create a network of public francophone higher educational establishments to redress both the linguistic imbalance in higher education and the lack of access for Francophone students (at the time, only three of the six publicly supported universities were French-speaking, while all universities were still privately run), something which came to fruition less than a month after \\"Operation McGill\\" with the establishment of the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) as the flagship metropolitan university within the public francophone University of Quebec network. Leading the charge of this demonstration were former McGill professor Stanley Gray and nationalist Raymond Lemieux who spoke to the crowd of people demanding equal rights for francophones and also demanded that McGill become a francophone educational institution. Prior to the demonstration, key demonstrator, Stanley Gray was fired from his position as a political science professor at McGill University in 1969. However, prior to his firing, he had established a group named the Students for a Democratic University (SDU) on November 23, 1967. It consisted of 150 students and professors who were also in favour of the idea of decolonisation and instituting more power to French people not only at McGill but throughout Quebec as well. The SDU had begun many demonstrations, with each getting larger than the previous one. During the early months of 1969, before the operation, Gray and the other members of the SDU had interrupted a Senate meeting on January 24, 1969 echoing similar chants such as \\"Revolution\\", \\"Long live the Socialist Quebec\\" and \\"Long live Quebec\\". The group would then again take similar actions on January 27, 1969 when they impeded a meeting of the Assembly of the Board of Governors. Later, the SDU would be renamed as the Radical Student Association (RSA). Gray was also a founding member of the Movement for the Integration of School (MIS), who organised the demonstration on that day. The SDU and the MIS would work together for the same goals. Another key member of the MIS was Raymond Lemieux, an American with French-Canadian heritage. He, along with fellow founding member Stanley Gray would gather approximately 3,000 members leading up to the demonstration. The MIS would then strengthen the Saint-Léonard crisis when elected on June 28, 1968. The Saint-Léonard crisis largely developed from leftist thinkings which disallowed bilingual classes and adopted only unilingual French classes. The newspaper, the McGill Daily, also supported the cause heavily and distributed a special edition announcing the preparation of Operation McGill through 100,000 copies instead of its usual 14,000 copies. In it was a document titled \\"Welcome to McGill\\" written entirely in French and sent across the province of Quebec with the aid of students and the members of the major trade union in Québec, the CSN. In short, the document criticized the ruling elites of Quebec and argued that the people of Quebec were exploited both culturally and economically. Concluding the article with the need to democratise McGill for these reasons and why the workers, students and anyone who felt discriminated against should demonstrate. On March 26, 1969 activists Raymond Lemieux, Stanley Gray, Léandre Bergeron and CSN president, Michael Chartrand stated that they would be talking about the Operation via posters throughout campus with would be held in the ballroom of the University Centre. == In the context of the Quiet Revolution == The Quiet Revolution, also known as La révolution tranquille, spanned roughly from 1960-1970 in Quebec, Canada. The Revolution when Jean Lesage, leader of the Liberal party, was elected on June 22, 1960 winning 51% of the popular vote. The Liberal Party of Quebec's manifesto called for a number of important changes to modernise Quebec society after Maurice Duplessis's, and prior reigns, including the creation of a modern welfare state (including garaunteed education, healthcare and income support), the intervention by the state in the economy, an Office of the French Language, as well as several proposals that would go on to form the cornerstone of Quebec- Canada relations (inter-provincial conferences, a Minister for Provincial- Federal Affairs). The beginning of the Quiet Revolution also saw the birth of Women's Liberation Movement, Black Power Movement in Quebec along with the ever-increasing influence and power of both the trade union movement and the modern Quebec nationalist movement, heavily influenced by leftist ideology. Operation McGill included or connected with all of these movements. === Student movements === Francophone students did not fare well in the large scale of Quebec's education system. Very few Francophones were allowed into universities where a large percentage was Anglophone. Only 7% of McGill students had French as their mother tongue while the percentage of French- speaking people was 82%. Students who had English as their mother tongue accounted for 42% of university enrollments in Quebec which in greater context is higher compared to the 18% of students for the provincial population. In a time of increasing awareness and discontent with the economic and social inequalities between Quebec's Anglophone and Franchophone communities, the lack of educational opportunities was seen as a key issue. Motivated by the discrepancies in educational provision and general economic inequality, several student movements adapted leftist thinking such as l'Union générale des étudiants (UGEQ). The UGEQ united the many other student bodies in Quebec, 1964 and would go on to form many student movements which the leaders of the Operation did consider as motivation. In the latter half of 1968, the UGEQ picked up its radical agenda. The CEGEP system was created to expand post- secondary education and these junior colleges were established all throughout Quebec. However, these colleges were seen by many as insufficient and as recreating the inequalities within the university sector. In October, Quebec government officials had declared that about 20,000 students of the CEGEP system would not be allowed the opportunity to study at a university level come the following school year. This led to about 5,000 to 10,000 students protesting this affair on October 21, 1968 shouting \\"étudiants ouvriers\\" and demanding the allowance of a better education for the students under this system. Many student groups decided at this time that conciliation with the government was no longer a viable option, and direct actions and more radical demands became more important. Although a portion of those attending and organising the demonstration had the goal of a general improvement in Quebec's higher educational system, some groups used it to call attention to the perceived notion that McGill University was directly influencing American Imperialism and thus, allowing discrimination against the French peoples. This not only affected the student movement but also all the other movements during the Quiet Revolution as well the fight against racism, to the workers movement and ending with the Women's Liberation Movement. Thus, Operation McGill français was part of a greater effort during the Quiet Revolution to incorporate better education and social equality. ==== Connection to the Parti Pris ==== The journal, Parti Pris', also began around this time in 1963. Two scholars named Jean-Marc Piotte and André Major were attempting to fight for the equality of the French-Canadian population of Quebec (soon to be known as \\"les Québécois\\"). One of their key aims was to create a common fight for the decolonisation of Quebec, with the articles analysing the cultural, social and economic conditions in Quebec through the lens of decolonisation connected with the establishment of a socialist political programme. This journal contributed to the creation of a new political language during the early 1960s. The leaders of Parti Pris also organized discussions, street protests, public meetings and reading groups. The political movements participating in McGill were closely aligned with the objectives and ideas espoused by the authors in Parti Pris. ==== Connection to the Sir George Williams affair ==== Just a couple of months prior to Operation McGill was another large protest known as the Sir George Williams affair. This was a protest in regards to Quebec's discrimination towards its black citizens when 6 black students argued racial discrimination from then assistant professor of biology, Mr. Perry Anderson. Much like the rest of the workers, feminist and student movements, the citizens involved in the Black Power movement felt like they were not being heard. In response to the administrations lack of action, 200 students and protesters peacefully overtook the ninth floor of the Hall building of Sir George Williams University on January 29, 1969. They overtook the computer centre and stayed there until February 11 when they were forcefully taken by police officers after starting a fire to keep around 30 police officers out. Nevertheless, the police officers were successful in detaining and arresting 96 students involved in the affair. It may just be considered the largest school riot in Canadian history. The Sir George Williams affair would turn violent with over 2 million dollars worth of damage to computers and the school, though the initial intention was to remain peaceful. This affair led to other school protests throughout Quebec which included Operation McGill. Both students bodies used their own respective newspapers, The Georgian and The McGill Daily to gain support for their causes. === Workers movements === Quebec's economy in the 1960s and prior was largely ruled by Anglophone elites. Francophones were not happy with this arrangement, since the vast of the majority of the population were French speakers. Anglophones and Francophones often lived in different conditions with the Anglophones living in wealthy areas and the Francophones living in the poorer areas. Anglophones consisted of 56% of Montreal's best-paid workers and only consisted of about 24% of the labor force. Furthermore, Francophones only controlled 20% of the economy and also represented 40% of Canada's total unemployment rate. Even though they lived in a French province, a large percentage were being forced to learn English to be able to work and almost half the time, workers were required to speak to their managers in English. During the early years of the Revolution (1961-1965), there was an average of about 67.6 strikes per year. In the later years (1966-1970), this number nearly doubled to 143 strikes per year. During these strikes, workers argued against poor housing conditions, unemployment, price increases and discrimination. To change this, leftist parties engaging in nationalist ideas started organising worker movements. Such movements were led by then president of the CSN, Marcel Pepin. In 1966, Pepin would go on to change the situation with his 'moral report', which would then go on to explain the urgency for multiple worker movements and if need be, a call for arms and further resistance. This would later influence those involved in the October Crisis and members of the CSN to revolt in Operation McGill. Leftist thinkers believed that the French population as a whole had a right to defend themselves, and this did not exclude workers. Examples of this led to many groups such as the Mouvement de libération du taxi, citizens' and workers' committees, the Chevaliers de l'indépendance, the Comité Vallières-Gagnon and the Montreal Central Council of the CSN assisting the MIS coalition gaining over 50,000 supporters. The CSN and MIS coalition would support the Operation showing how the demonstration was acting in the context of allowing better work for the Francophone people. It would try to allow French to strive in the workplace instead of English, which demonstrated power over the French people much like McGill had. == Post Operation McGill at McGill University == After Operation McGill français, a few other events appeared to protest the discrimination and continue with the fight of decolonisation at McGill University. A major event was the creation of the Birth Control Handbook which affected many women at McGill University and continued debates on whether or not McGill University should become French. === Birth Control Handbook === The Birth Control Handbook was considered part of the Women's Liberation movement as a way of decolonizing Quebec and being accepted into the general population. Women seemed to be tired of men controlling their decisions and life choices. The Birth Control Handbook, created by McGill Students Society, was an attempt to gain their longed for control of their own bodies and choices during the late 1960s. Although it was published in 1968, the handbook took off in the summer of 1969 when it had sold 50,000 copies and two years later it would reach nearly 2 million copies. This handbook demonstrates that there were still persistent problems being argued at McGill university during this time and that Operation McGill played into the bigger picture of decolonized Quebec and better equality for all. === The Legacy of Operation McGill français === There is no true legacy that exists for Operation McGill français. It did bring together thousands of people to protest unequal rights and for better services in the Anglo-Saxon community they lived in, but did not have much significance prior to such. In fact, it is something that historians have barely researched in regards to its influence on the Quiet Revolution and Quebec's history in general. === McGill University today === Today, McGill University continues to be one of three English universities in Quebec, demonstrating that the efforts to make McGill French had failed. However, today the student body is approximately 20.3% Francophone. This is a significant improvement over the Francophone student body during the Quiet Revolution that consisted of approximately 3%. Students now have the opportunity to write any work in English or French even though the language of instruction continues to be predominantly in English. == References == Category:McGill University Category:Demonstrations Category:Decolonisation Category:Quebec nationalism Category:1969 in Quebec ","title":"Operation McGill français"},{"id":"56651770","text":"Colin Keay is a retired Scottish and British athlete who won medals at European, Paralympic, and world level.

In addition, there is a UNESCO City of Literature Creative Writing Course which unites and educates young talents supervised by renowned and experienced writers. === Read PL! === Read PL! is a project created in cooperation with the Woblink.com e-book platform to promote reading through permitting free access to electronic versions of new book arrivals and bestsellers. In public places (mostly at bus/tram stops and in schools) the organisers post posters with QR codes which can be scanned with the Woblink application to offer free access to selected books. === City Codes === Within the City Codes project, the benches in the Krakow Planty Park have been marked with special tablets with the names of writers who have been important for the city of Krakow, together with QR codes that refer to websites with fragments of texts by specific authors, as well as their Polish and English audio versions. === Multipoetry. Poems on the walls === During each first week of month, poems written by authors connected with other Cities of Literature – Dublin, Edinburg, Iowa City, Melbourne, Norwich and Reykjavik – were displayed on the wall of the Potocki Family Tenement House at 20 Main Market Square in 2014 and 2015. === Literary walks === Krakow UNESCO City of Literature organises cyclic literary walks whereby readers led by their guides have an opportunity to see buildings and places that used to be or that are important for the most outstanding writers living in Krakow. Several literary routes have been delineated so far within the project, including those dedicated to Wisława Szymborska, Czesław Miłosz, Stanisław Lem, Stanisław Wyspiański or Joseph Conrad. === Champion Bookstores in Krakow === The project focuses on the cooperation with stationary bookstores in Krakow. It has been developed for the sake of readers, book lovers, and booksellers. Its task is to support the Krakow book market through the integration, coordination and implementation of the rich program of cultural events in Krakow stationary bookstores. The project is to equip booksellers with additional tools and promotion methods, to enrich their cultural offer, and build permanent relationships with readers. === Krakow Book Fair === The Krakow Book Fair is a cyclic event that promotes the idea of second-hand book circulation. It is held once in every several weeks at the St. Mary Magdalene Square in Krakow, where a dozen or so of Krakow antiquarians and second-hand booksellers put up their stands and present their offer. The fair is always accompanied by discussions, literary meetings, and open-air shows. === Independent Bookstore Festival === Independent Bookstore Festival is a project implemented in bookstores by the Copernicus Foundation under the patronage of Krakow UNESCO City of Literature. The Festival is a year-round series of events organised by booksellers for all readers who want to talk with one another about books. === Read locally === The project aims at promoting bookstores as cultural centres and places where social ties begin.

The project includes a series of interviews with the staff and with famous frequent visitors of most interesting bookstores in Krakow. === The Second Life of a Book === The action facilitates free book exchange. It is held cyclically at most interesting places that are connected with literature. == International Cooperation == === ICORN (International Cities of Refuge Network) === ICORN is an independent network of cities that offer a shelter to writers and artists persecuted for their creative work. It acts in defence of the freedom of expression and of democratic values. It also acts for international solidarity. The network’s member cities offer refuge to those who cannot freely live and create in their own homelands due to persecutions. ICORN’s main objective is to ensure asylum to as many persecuted writers and artists as possible, and to establish a permanent global network to defend the freedom of expression together with its sister organisations. Within the ICORN program in 2011-2017, Krakow hosted seven writers: Maria Amelie (born Madina Salamowa – North Ossetia, today in Norway), Kareem Amer (Egypt/today in Norway), Mostafa Zamaninij (Iran), Lawon Barszczewski (Belarus), Asli Erdogan (Turkey), Felix Kaputu (Congo), and Monem Mahjoub (Libya). While implementing the ICORN program, Krakow City of Literature cooperates with the Villa Decius Association that coordinates the residents’ stay and offers them space for their creative work. === Drop the Mic. Nordic-Baltic Slam Poetry Network === Drop the Mic is a project that aims at creating an international space for poets, writers, authors of texts, and organisers of festivals and poetry slams that support performative literature. The project is to popularize the idea of poetry slams and to integrate poets and other authors at international level through their joint participation in projects. So far, events within the Drop the Mic (meetings, workshops, poetry slams) have been held in Reykjavik (Iceland), Tartu (Estonia), Copenhagen (Dania), Heidelberg (Germany), and Krakow === Engage! Young Producers === Engage! Young Producers is an international educational project aimed at promoting young people’s committed participation in literary and cultural life interpreted as a means to develop their critical thinking skills and better comprehension of multicultural reality. The project is addressed mainly to secondary school students (between 16 and 19 years of age), especially those with little access to culture, and to all local organisations and cultural institutions whose activity involves literature. Engage! is held simultaneously in several European cities (Barcelona, Norwich, Vaxjo, Krakow), and always with the support of secondary schools, libraries and cultural institutions that develop their own customized programs so as to best apply the general objectives of the complete Engage! project. Within the Engage! Young Producers project the Krakow Festival Office implements a yearly education program for secondary school students – Word for Word. Poetry is my language. === Krakow UNESCO City of Literature Residency Program === The residency program is addressed to writers and authors from the other UNESCO Cities of Literature. During their stipend stay in Krakow, residents have an opportunity to experience Krakow literary life, establish contacts with the local literary industry and writers.

Moore complaining writing, \\"Is the book honest? I guess; is it salacious? You bet; is it worth more the read? Not if you’ve evolved past dick jokes.\\" Barker said it was hard doing the press for the book due to frequently being asked to comment on the plane crash and his addiction problems on talk shows and said was disappointed by the headlines of articles about the book focussing on his relationships and the more outrageous parts of the memoir. However, Barker told The Toronto Sun that he was happy with how honest the book was saying, \\"Some of the stuff in the book makes my skin crawl with shame.

The county was established by the Minnesota Legislature in 1862, but the government was not organized until 1873, when Governor Horace Austin appointed three county commissioners. They did nothing, so Governor Cushman Kellogg Davis appointed three replacement commissioners in 1874. The county seat was established at Ortonville in 1874 and three elected commissioners took office in the beginning of 1877. The organization was challenged in court, and the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that the county had not properly been organized. The county was declared organized in 1881 by the Minnesota Legislature. The first courthouse, a wood frame structure, was built in October 1882, but was destroyed by fire on October 31, 1885. A new wood frame courthouse was built in 1886, and the county later built a granite jail building in 1895. In 1901, the county decided to replace the wood-frame courthouse with a brick building. Architect Fremont D. Orff designed the building, and Ole H. Olsen of Stillwater, Minnesota was awarded the construction contract. The building was completed in 1902. The previous wooden courthouse was donated to the local school district, which used it for a classroom until it was demolished in 1918. The 1895 jail building was demolished during the 1940s. The building is faced with light brown brick and is accented with Ortonville granite trim. During a 1983-1984 study, the Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office surveyed seven counties in west central Minnesota, and noted that the courthouse was the largest turn-of-the-century building in Big Stone County and one of its best examples of large-scale Victorian architecture. It is historically significant as one of a shrinking number of Victorian-style Minnesota courthouses, and it has served as the seat of government since it was built. ==References== Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Minnesota Category:Government buildings completed in 1902 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Big Stone County, Minnesota Category:County courthouses in Minnesota ","title":"Big Stone County Courthouse"},{"id":"56652051","text":" Huddart was launched in 1803 as an East Indiaman.

Utemuratov is widely believed to be holding these assets for the benefit of Nazarbayev.\\" This close relationship with President Nazarbayev led to Utemuratov being given the nickname “the grey cardinal” in Kazakhstan.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/glencore-bought- jet-from-kazakh-dictators-sidekick-bulat-utemuratov-fz2lxrm56 He was also described as President Nazarbayev's “personal financial manager” in a US diplomatic cable leaked by Wikileaks. == Utemuratov and Glencore == Glencore International, the Swiss-based mining and commodities company, acquired the Vasilkovskoye gold mine in Kazakhstan from Utemuratov's Verny Capital.https://www.marketscreener.com/GLENCORE- PLC-8111440/pdf/278842/Glencore%20PLC_Annual-Report.pdf As part of this transaction, Verny was given shares in Kazzinc – Glencore's copper subsidiary in Kazakhstan. When Glencore announced its initial public offering (IPO) in London in 2011, the company said that some of the proceeds would be used to buy back the Kazzinc shares held by Verny Capitalhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/commodities/8496018/Glencore-float- could-create-Kazakhstans-richest-man.html In 2012, Glencore bought the Kazzinc shares back from Verny Capital for $1.359 billion,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/glencore-in-new-deal-to- buy-1891-kazzinc-stake-2012-09-25 including $400 million in cash and the rest in Glencore shares.

The school was opened by President Nazarbayev. The Times quoted a spokeswoman for Utemuratov saying he: \\"is neither a middleman, nor proxy for President Nazarbayev\\" and that he had not profited from his relationship with the President. In 2013, Glencore gave a loan to Astana Property Management (APM), a company owned by Bulat Utemuratov via Verny Capital. The loan was to finance APM's construction of the Talan Towers hotel and apartment complex in Astana, Kazakhstan.

Other rebel groups were suspicious of Aboud and Liwa Dawud for being extremists and Islamic State affiliates in Idlib. Aboud and one of his brothers fought American forces during the Iraq War, according to locals. Some suggested that the pair returned to Syria as a sleeper cell tied to Al Qaeda in Iraq. Prior to the foundation of Liwa Dawud Hassan Aboud joined Suqour al-Sham in 2011. Other members of Jaysh al-Sham saw Liwa Dawud as a fifth-column element, Abboud also made frequent meetings with ISIL's leadership in 2013. After the 2013 meetings a campaign began of secret operations to sabotage other groups and it was during this period Aboud assumed leadership over Liwa Dawud. Also in 2013 Abu Ali al-Anbari met with various rebel leaders in the Idlib Governorate including Aboud and gave $2 million and weapons to Aboud and Liwa Dawud. The brigade has also been accused of assassinating Ahrar al-Sham leaders and of holding James Foley before turning him over to ISIL. Through the course of the group's existence its members had been suspected of carrying out assassinations against rivals and individuals who betrayed the group as part of their secret operations campaign. ==History== ===Suqour al-Sham=== The group began as a subunit in Suqour al-Sham in 2012 under the leadership of Hassan Aboud and became notable for its use of IEDs against government forces on highways and seizing weapons and vehicles including tanks from the Syrian Army. While being a subunit in Suqour al-Sham the group also participated in the Battle of Taftanaz, they conducted an ambush against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and National Defense Forces near the border between the Aleppo Governorate and Idlib Governorate. During the battle of Taftanaz the rebels captured or destroyed between 15 to 20 Syrian military helicopters in the city's air base. In February 2014, ISIL signed a cease-fire agreement with Suqour al-Sham after a series of clashes between ISIL and Syrian opposition groups in early 2014. The agreement stated both groups would end hostilities and not interfere in the other's affairs, the agreement was signed by representatives from ISIL and Suqour al-Sham, as well as a Liwa Dawud commander acting as a third party witness. ===Jaysh al-Sham=== In early 2014 Aboud announced that Liwa Dawud was to join Jaysh al-Sham while simultaneously following ISIL's instructions. ===ISIL=== In July 2014 he declared his loyalty to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Liwa Dawud officially defected and the remaining members of Liwa Dawud numbering 1,000 departed to Raqqa. Aboud along with remnants of the group fought in multiple battle for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant including the battle of Kobane against the Kurdish People's Protection Units and Free Syrian Army-linked Arab factions exiled to the city after coming into conflict with ISIL, the group also took part in the Palmyra Offensive, and members of the group also staffed courts run by ISIL. In June 2018, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham arrested remnants of the group at checkpoints established in a triangle spanning from Misbin to Nayrab to Sarmin where the group was formerly based, due to high ISIL-linked activity and presence of ISIL affiliated cells in the area, along with remnants of Liwa Dawud, former members of Jaysh al-Sham which Liwa Dawud was part of were arrested as well as former Liwa al-Haqq members. ==References== Category:Anti-government factions of the Syrian Civil War ","title":"Liwa Dawud"},{"id":"56652155","text":"Innovation Credit Union is a Canadian credit union.

He is best known for organizing several attempts to get the pirates of Madagascar to accept a pardon and bring their wealth home to England. ==Biography== Rumor had long held that pirates on and around Madagascar, such as those concentrated around the pirate trading posts on Ile Ste.-Marie, kept vast sums of money from their plundering. As early as 1697 Breholt approached MP Charles Egerton with a plan to induce the pirates of Madagascar to accept a general pardon and return their wealth to England. His plans came to nothing so with the backing of the Earl of Carlisle he sailed in 1699 for the Caribbean (in a ship named Carlisle) with a scheme for looting shipwrecks. That August he briefly sailed alongside a flotilla attempting to hunt down associates of William Kidd before heading to Havana to search for the wrecks. When he tried to stop a Spanish vessel in October to hire a local pilot, the Spaniards fled from him; incensed, his crew looted their vessel instead, and giving up on finding the wrecks, sailed to the Carolinas. He arrived in December but a dispute with his crew led them to accuse him of piracy. Breholt was tried but acquitted. Leaving the Carolinas in early 1700, he hinted that he might sail for Virginia or Cape Verde. Instead he headed to the Azores where he was arrested by the Portuguese. Tried for piracy yet again, he was transported to Lisbon and imprisoned. Crewmen remaining aboard the Carlisle escaped under fire and took the ship to Madagascar, where the ship was lost; while there Breholt's brother George (who had served as the Carlisle’s first mate) was captured by the Royal Navy and accepted a pardon. Breholt was released from prison in Lisbon in 1701 and made his way back to England. He spent the next three years trying to convince various aristocrats to back another wreck-salvaging venture which may have been a ruse; a former sailor who had served aboard the Carlisle later testified that \\"Breholt only acted behind the curtain, that his ill charectar might not defeat their reall design, which was to get out to sea and then to carry the said ships to Madagascar.\\" In 1705 he returned to his plans to arrange a pardon for the Madagascar pirates who would bring their riches back with them, petitioning Queen Anne directly and claiming that he had ships ready to depart. He tried to enlist the New East India Company’s help in 1707 and convinced Daniel Defoe to advocate for his plan; Edgerton once again backed his scheme. He organized over 40 pirate wives who had been left behind in England to petition in support of the plan as well, and produced a woman he claimed was the wife of legendary pirate Henry Every. Former Madagascar castaway John Benbow (son of Admiral Benbow) also spoke in support of the plan, confirming that the Madagascar pirates would accept a pardon. Breholt was still pushing his Madagascar plan in 1709. Author Penelope Aubin (who had advised Breholt's backers during his failed 1702-1704 salvaging ploy), some of the pirate wives, and a former sailor aboard the Carlisle all testified that Breholt himself was a pirate and schemer; this plus a rival plan pushed by the Marquis of Carmarthen helped doom his efforts. After failing to get the South Sea Company to back his Madagascar plans, he turned to other efforts such as lighthouse-building and was not heard from again. ==See also== *Adam Baldridge, Abraham Samuel, and James Plaintain – leads of the pirate communities on or near Madagascar, whose wealth Breholt and others hoped to bring back to England. *Francis Nicholson – Governor of Virginia who warned his guard ships to be on the lookout for Breholt. ==Notes== ==References== Category:18th-century pirates Category:17th-century pirates Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:British pirates Category:Caribbean pirates Category:Piracy in the Indian Ocean ","title":"John Breholt"},{"id":"56652283","text":"Gaw is a surname with at least four different origins.

Second, it may have originated by shortening the name McGaw, which is an Anglicised form of meaning \\"son of Adam\\". Third, it may be an old spelling of the German surname Gau, which originated as a toponymic surname; see Gau (territory). Finally, it may be an Anglicisation of the Southern Min pronunciation of the Chinese surname pronounced Wú () in Mandarin; this spelling came into use in Hong Kong by a family of Chinese immigrants from Myanmar.

Several lawsuits were filed to attempt to prevent the construction of the arena, which would ensure no nearby arena would compete with The Madison Square Garden Company-owned Forum. In December 2018, the Clippers filed a countersuit against The Madison Square Garden Company alleging that they tried to prevent competition with The Forum. In March 2019, leaked emails revealed that Irving Azoff attempted to lure the Los Angeles Lakers back to The Forum after their lease at Staples Center was up. Despite nothing coming of the proposal, Azoff's proposal to re- purpose The Forum was seen as a way of preventing the LA Clippers from building their own arena in Inglewood and ensuring that the Madison Square Garden Company got an unfair advantage over rival AEG, which already owns part of the Lakers. In November 2019, a judge tossed a lawsuit by Uplift Inglewood seeking to stop the arena's construction.

The last episode of the 2016 season featured the season's chosen singers performing several of his brother's well- known hits, including \\"Helt nära dig\\" (interpreted by Little Jinder), \\"Sommarlängtan\\" (by Magnus Carlson), \\"Himlen är oskyldigt blå\\" (by Jill Johnson), \\"505 to Casablanca\\" (by Freddie Wadling), \\"Sol, vind och vatten\\" (by Lisa Ekdahl), \\"I den stora sorgens famn\\" (by Tommy Nilsson) and \\"För kärlekens skull\\" (by Danny Saucedo). == Architecture work == Gärdestad was head architect at Kunskapsskolan from 2008 until his death, and designed many of the schools' rooms. Kunskapsskolan (literally The Knowledge School) is a Swedish network of independent schools that provides education for students from grades 4 to 9 (ages 10 to 16). It also provides gymnasium schools for grades 10 to 12 (ages 16 to 19) in different areas of Sweden. Designed by Gärdestad, the architecture is very open, with glass and colourfully painted walls. There are 36 Kunskapskolan schools in Sweden. == Activism == Gärdestad worked to educate and create understanding about psychological illness after his brother Ted's mental illness and suicide in 1997. He was the creator of the annual \\"Ted Gärdestad Stipend\\" awarded to amateur singers and songwriters since 1999 to promote their work. The prize includes a tribute concert. == Personal life == Gärdestad's brother Ted was a noted Swedish singer who represented Sweden in Eurovision with one of Kenneth's songs. Their other brother Kjell (1944–2000) was also a songwriter who co-wrote the song \\"Viking\\" with Ted.Sveriges dödbok 1947–2006, CD-ROM, Sveriges Släktforskarförbund ==Death== Kenneth Gärdestad revealed in 2014 that he was suffering from skin cancer and latent lymphoma.

It is considered Divetia's magnum opus and a milestone in the history of modern Gujarati poetry. The poems were written in the manner of English lyrical poetry. The work was well received by the new school writers while criticised by old school writers. ==Origin== Divetia was interested in and influenced by English romantic poetry, especially the work of William Wordsworth. He therefore wrote lyrics in the pattern of English lyrical poetry compiled in the Palgrave's Golden Treasury. In the introduction to Kusumamala, Divetia wrote: ==Content== The Kusumamala contains 62 poems on various subjects, including love, nature, social conditions, and historical places and events. The poems are written in various metres as well as in traditional and folk melodies and rhythms. The collection includes short and long poems, with some having nearly one hundred lines. The shortest poem is \\"Mangalacharan\\" (\\"The Auspicious Stanza\\"), which consists of just four lines, while the longest poem is \\"Chanda\\" (\\"The Moon\\"), consisting of 112 lines which are divided into 28 stanzas of four lines each. Some other long poems are \\"Asthir Ane Sthir Prem\\" (\\"Unsteady and Steady Love\\") (68 lines), \\"Vidhvano Vilap\\" (\\"The Lamentation of the Widow\\") (96 lines), and \\"Megh\\", a translation of \\"The Cloud\\" by English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (92 lines). ==Reception== The Kusumamala was well received by readers. Its first edition was published in 1887, followed by a second edition in 1902, third edition in 1907, and fourth edition in 1912. The Kusumamala was received positively by the new or Western school writers but negatively by the old or orthodox school writers. Navalram Pandya's review was very short and terse. He found the verses, modelled as they were on those of Shelley and Wordsworth, were intended to give an idea to the Gujarati reader as to the sort of poetry the West produced. He praised the poems as being delightful and on the whole easy to understand, although the language and style were cultured (fully developed). Kusumamala received negative criticism from Manilal Nabhubhai Dwivedi, who called it \\"foreign exotic flowers, bright coloured but without beauty or fragrance, nothing better than a garland of flowers skilfully woven in obedience to the alluring vogue then prevalent of considering everything coming from the West worthy of imitation\\". Dwivedi criticised the collection for months in the Priyamavada and Sudarshana magazines which he edited, arousing controversy. Ramanbhai Neelkanth responded with a series of articles in Jnan Sudha. He contested Dwivedi's criticism and hailed the collection as \\"an oasis in the desert of Gujarati poetic literature\\". Manishankar Bhatt 'Kant' and Balwantray Thakore also criticised the collection, while Anandshankar Dhruv appreciated it. Govardhanram Tripathi quoted a few lines from Chanda, a poem in Kusumamala, in his epic novel Saraswatichandra. Divetia's second poetry collection, Hridayavina, aroused similar controversy. Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi, in Gujarat and Its Literature, noted that with Kusumamala, Divetia launched the age of romantic poetry in the Gujarati language. ==ReferencesCategory:1887 books Category:Gujarati-language poetry collections Category:1887 poems Category:Indian poetry collections Category:19th-century Indian books ","title":"Kusumamala"},{"id":"56652396","text":"Nathalie Lemmens (born ) is a Belgian female volleyball player.

The conservation park occupies land in section 339 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Rivoli Bay. In 1971, the land was offered by its owner, A. McArthur of Rendelsham, to the “then National Parks Commission” for “dedication as a Reserve.” On 27 April 1972, it was proclaimed as the Belt Hill Conservation Park when the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 came into force. As of 2016, it covered an area of . In 1990, the conservation park was described as consisting of “a consolidated calcarenite dune overlain by weakly-structured sandy soils” that “extends from the east” with a “swale or low-lying plainwhich continues into adjacent farmland” on its western side. The vegetation cover was described as consisting of “an open scrub formation” of blackwood, and golden wattle” on the dune with “mainly introduced pasture grasses with some kangaroo grass… and knobby club-rush… covering the swale in the west. It was reported that native vegetation within the conservation park “has been considerably disturbed mainly through grazing by stock and rabbits” and during the early 1950s, a “row of pine trees was planted on the southern boundary to control sand drift”. In 1990, it was reported that two archaeological sites are located on the dune as evident by a “thin scatter of artefacts” on its surface. It is speculated that “the area supported a substantial Aboriginal population as it is elevated, well sheltered and watered, and would have offered many sources of food.” Also, there was an abandoned stone quarry on the southern side of the conservation park and a sand pit in its north from which material was extracted for road construction by state government agencies.

In 2008 she joined Georgia Tech as an assistant professor. She worked on the parasites that feed on small freshwater crustaceans (Daphnia), using them as a \\"model system for understanding host-parasite interactions in general\\". She found that ecological context was important when gauging epidemic size, and that when some parasites are \\"battling an epidemic of a deadly parasite, less resistance can sometimes be better than more\\". In 2012 she won the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, which was presented to her by Barack Obama. Duffy joined University of Michigan in 2012. Her research concentrates on rapid evolutionary responses in novel host- parasite associations. She is currently researching the influences of food webs and eco-evolutionary dynamics on host-parasite interactions and multi- host, multi-parasite interactions. Duffy is concerned about cuts to basic research funding. === Public engagement === Duffy established the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) Mentor Match, which pairs undergraduate students from minority-serving institutions with mentors to help with graduate school and fellowship applications. Duffy created Diversity EEB, a list of ecologists / evolutionary biologists who are women or from a group traditionally underrepresented in the sciences to help people identify scientists who might diversify seminar series or for award nominations. Duffy is one of the 2017/2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science Leshner Leadership Institute Public Engagement Fellows. She is interested in how scientists can engage with policy makers. She delivered the opening address at the 2017 March for Science.

The system was first identified as a weak tropical low on the morning of 11 February over the Northern Territory's Tiwi Islands by the Bureau of Meteorology. The low moved southwestwards over land and emerged over the Indian Ocean near Broome on 16 February. The storm intensified into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the following day, becoming the sixth named cyclone of the 2017–18 season. Kelvin subsequently moved slowly eastwards and proceeded to rapidly intensify in the hours prior to landfall. The system crossed the coast along Eighty Mile Beach as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, and a high-end Category 1 hurricane-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Kelvin weakened at a very slow rate over the next few days, and was downgraded to a tropical low on 19 February. Kelvin brought widespread heavy rainfall to the Kimberley region which had already been saturated by other tropical cyclone systems. As a result, significant flooding occurred in parts of the Kimberley, including in the towns of Broome and Bidyadanga. Property damage was sustained at Broome and Anna Plains Station, where the cyclone made landfall, as well as infrastructural damage to the Great Northern Highway as a result of the heavy rainfall and flooding. == Meteorological history == During the morning of 11 February, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) identified a developing tropical low pressure system near the Tiwi Islands, off the northwest coast of the Northern Territory. During the following days, Tropical Low 17U tracked along a general west-southwesterly course over land while gradually intensifying. As the system approached the coast, the BOM began issuing warnings, and forecast the low to potentially strengthen to a category 3 severe tropical cyclone in the coming days. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also issued a tropical cyclone formation alert around this time. The system emerged over the Indian Ocean at about 8:00 am AWST on 16 February, but contrary to previous forecasts was generally slow to develop. The JTWC assessed the system as having attained one-minute sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) twelve hours later, and hence upgraded it to Tropical Storm 10S at 12:00 UTC. The system continued to slowly strengthen, and was upgraded to a category 1 tropical cyclone by the BOM at 2:00 pm local time on the following day, and was named Kelvin. Tropical Cyclone Kelvin's movement speed slowed considerably at this stage, and it proceeded to turn sharply to the east. As the system approached the coast, the period of rapid intensification that had been forecast finally eventuated. This intensification, fuelled by warm sea surface temperatures and very favourable atmospheric conditions, and compounded by the small size of the system, continued until landfall. The cyclone crossed the coast near Anna Plains Station along Eighty Mile Beach at 00:00 UTC on 18 February as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale with 10-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph), and a central barometric pressure of 955 hPa (28.20 inHg). The JTWC assessed the system as a high-end category 1 hurricane-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with one-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph), and a central barometric pressure of 963 hPa (28.44 inHg). After making landfall, Tropical Cyclone Kelvin turned to the south-southeast, and began to track inland over the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Despite losing the ocean as its primary source of energy, the cyclone was slow to weaken, partially due to the flat nature of the terrain and possibly also as a result of the brown ocean effect. The system was only downgraded below tropical cyclone intensity by the BOM after approximately 30 hours over the flat desert of Western Australia, at 2:00 pm AWST on 19 February. Gale-force winds did persist in the southeastern quadrant, however, due to the influence of a high-pressure ridge to the southeast of the system. Unlike the BOM, The JTWC maintained the system's classification as a tropical storm for another 36 hours after this, only downgrading it to a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on 20 February. The remnants of the system continued to track south-southeastwards across the Great Sandy, Gibson and Great Victoria Deserts before emerging over the Great Australian Bight. == Impacts == Severe Tropical Cyclone Kelvin and its precursor tropical low brought widespread heavy rainfall to the regions of Western Australia across which it tracked. These parts of Australia had already experienced record rainfall totals prior to the arrival of the system, with significant amounts being delivered by Tropical Cyclone Hilda, Tropical Cyclone Joyce, and Tropical Low 11U. Broome Airport received 376.8 mm (14.8 in) of precipitation in the 24 hours prior to 9:00 am on 17 February, while West Roebuck received 370.0 mm (14.6 in) during this time. The rain delivered by Tropical Cyclone Kelvin led Broome to record a record annual rainfall total of 1506.0 mm (59.3 in) by 9:00 am on 19 February, despite being less than two months into the calendar year. The heavy rainfall caused the already saturated water catchments in the region to overflow, and significant flooding ensued in areas such as Broome, Kalumburu and along the Great Northern Highway. Property damage was reported at Anna Plains Station, where the cyclone made landfall, as well as minor damage in Broome. Infrastructural damage in excess of A$16 million (US$12.7 million) also occurred along the Great Northern Highway due to the heavy rainfall and flooding, causing some parts of the highway to be closed and cutting off several towns in the Kimberley region for some time. In addition to the heavy precipitation, Tropical Cyclone Kelvin also generated a 0.5 metre (1.6 foot) storm surge at Broome Port. == See also == *2018 Broome flood *Cyclone Rusty *Cyclone Christine *Cyclone Emma == References == ==External links== * Australian Bureau of Meteorology Kelvin Kelvin 2018 Kelvin 2018 Kelvin ","title":"Cyclone Kelvin"},{"id":"56652628","text":"PEN/Jean Stein Book Award is awarded by the PEN America to honor a \\"a book- length work of any genre for its originality, merit, and impact\\".

Johnson signs the Gun Control Act of 1968 into law. With passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968, an increasing number of NRA members, who has previously downplayed gun control issues, became more involved in gun politics and gun rights. Along with the creation of its lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA), with activist Harlon Carter as director, in 1976 the NRA established its non-partisan political action committee (PAC), the Political Victory Fund, in time for the 1976 elections. The NRA-PVF endorsed Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential campaign, the first NRA presidential endorsement.Facts on File 1980 Yearbook, p.844 By 1998, the NRA-PVF ranked as \\"one of the biggest spenders in congressional elections\\". In the 2004 elections, 95% of the NRA-PVF endorsed federal candidates and 86% of the endorsed state candidates were elected. By 2008, during the elections, the PVF spent millions \\"on direct campaign donations, independent campaign expenditures and on mobilizing the most aggressive grassroots operation in NRA history.\\" In 2012, NRA-PVF income was $14.4 million and expenses were $16.1 million. By 2014, the NRA-PVF income rose to 21.9 million with expenses of 20.7 million. ==Mandate== The NRA-PVF political action committee (PAC) was established in 1976 as a NRA subsidiary. The NRA-PVF created a rating system for political candidates to measure their support for gun-rights. It also helps its members locate an NRA Election Volunteer Coordinator (EVC) for their area and to register to vote. ==Rating political candidates== Through the Political Victory Fund, the NRA began to rate political candidates \\"irrespective of party affiliation - based on voting records, and public statements\\" on their positions on gun rights on a point scale of A+ to F. An NRA \\"A+\\" candidate, such as Todd Tiahrt, is one who has \\"not only an excellent voting record on all critical NRA issues, but who has also made a vigorous effort to promote and defend the Second Amendment\\", whereas an NRA \\"F\\" candidate is a \\"true enemy of gun owners' rights\\". Mike Spies, who has been reporting on the gun lobby since 2015, wrote a series called \\"The Gunfighters\\", which investigated the influence of the National Rifle Association (NRA) on state gun policy and politics. In his March 17, 2016 article published in The Trace, Mike Spies described how the NRA began to use their scoring system to influence judicial nominations. The first attempt was during the confirmation proceedings of Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 at the request of Mitch McConnell and again in 2010 with Elena Kagan. In 2011, the NRA opposed Caitlin Halligan's nomination to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and as a result, Senate Republicans blocked her confirmation. In 2016, the NRA opposed the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court because he did not \\"respect the individual right to bear arms\\" - in 2007, Garland had \\"cast a vote in favor of allowing his court to review a crucial opinion by a three-judge panel that had found D.C.’s handgun ban unconstitutional.\\" This article was cited in The Second Amendment and Gun Control: Freedom, Fear, and the American Constitution which presented both sides of the debate between those who \\"favour more gun controls and those who would prefer fewer of them.\\" ==References== Category:National Rifle Association Category:Organizations established in 1978 Category:1978 establishments in the United States ","title":"Political Victory Fund"},{"id":"56652687","text":"Sir Frederick Henniker (1 November 1793 – 6 August 1825) was a traveller and author. ==Family and friends== He was the eldest son of the Hon. Sir Brydges Henniker, 1st Baronet of Newton Hall in Great Dunmow by his wife Mary, eldest daughter of William Press, and a grandson of John Henniker, 1st Baron Henniker. He was educated at Eton and at St. John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1815. He succeeded his father as second baronet on 3 July 1816. Scientist and inventor Francis Ronalds, who had a similar sense of adventure and wit, was one of his friends. Henniker’s uncle Lord John Henniker-Major FRS was a scientific mentor to Ronalds, and had viewed his pioneering electric telegraph in operation. ==Travels== In the period 1818–21 Henniker travelled through France and Italy to Malta, and thence to Alexandria, Upper Egypt and Nubia. After revisiting Cairo he went to Mount Sinai and Jerusalem, returning home by Smyrna, Athens, Constantinople, and Vienna. While on his way from Jerusalem to Jericho he was severely wounded by banditti, and left stark naked. He had met up with Ronalds in Sicily but not, as planned, in Egypt, Ronalds being delayed by financial and passport issues. In 1823 Henniker published an account of his travels and a second edition appeared, with a slightly altered title, in the following year. Ronalds assisted with the draft and in analysing objects Henniker had brought home. Some of Henniker’s sketches and notes are held in the Ronalds Archive at the Institution of Engineering and Technology. ==Politics== In the spring of 1825 he canvassed Reading with a view of contesting that borough in the event of a dissolution, but withdrew his candidature, and died soon after in the Albany, Piccadilly, in the thirty-second year of his age. He was buried at Great Dunmow, Essex. He was unmarried, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his brother, the Hon. and Rev.

Il-Maqluba is a Special Area of Conservation – Candidate Site of International Importance and designated as a Tree Protection Area, forming part of Natura 2000 sites, a network of nature protection areas within the European Union. In the last feast in Qrendi there was a fire in maqluba. Visitors are forbidden to in the bottom-most layer of the sinkhole, due to a see-through wooden fence, == Geological formation == Like all sinkholes, this cavity was formed by the collapse of a limestone floor situated above a cavity hollowed out by water flowing in a karstic relief. The diameter is around 50m, and the depth is around 15m, the area approximately and the perimeter 300m. It is composed of blue clay and globigerina limestone that top the lower coralline limestone or żonqor. The area is a place of natural interest formed via the power of storm water runoff water which percolated through cracks and crevices. This gradual, yet constant, penetration created caverns which became larger with the passing of time thus producing a hollow that was eventually unable to support the overlying top layer, which eventually collapsed and created the doline that can be seen today. == Appearance of the cavity == The cavity appeared violently on 23 November 1343 during a violent storm, or possibly an earthquake. == Legends == The spectacular formation is at the origin of numerous legends. One of them recounts that the place was inhabited by people who lived such dissolute lives that a neighbour warned them against their sinful ways, without them taking notice. God therefore wished to punish the sinners by engulfing the hamlet, saving only the wise neighbour. The angels then threw a fragment into the sea, creating the isle of Filfla. A variant of this legend speaks of a nun as saved while praying in the small San Mattew Crypt during the occurrence. == St Matthew's Chapel == A chapel consecrated to Saint Matthew was built on the edge of the sinkhole, and has been in existence since at least the 14th century, probably dating back to the 11th century.Cini, George. \\"Filfla too had a chapel dedicated to Our Lady\\", Times of Malta, Malta, 4 January 2005. Retrieved on 18 September 2016. ==Flora and fauna== Dominant trees identified in this site include the laurel tree (siġra tar-rand) not too widely found in the Maltese islands; the fig tree (siġra tat-tin), the pomegranate tree (siġra tar-rummien) the carob tree (siġra tal- ħarrub), the hawthorn (siġra tal-anżalor) along with reeds (qasab) and the bramble (għollieq). One particular species that merits special mention is the sandarac gum tree (siġra tal-għargħar) which naturally occurs in North Africa, Southern Spain, and in Malta growing only at Maqluba and Imġiebagħ and in the Mellieha area Under these trees other plants thrive such as the large-leafed nettle (ħurrieq) and the cleavers (ħarxajja komuni). On the sides of the Maqluba many other flora species cling to the steep rocky flanks that enclose this depression. Thus one notices the Maltese salt tree (xebb), the ivy (liedna) and the caper (kappara), but also the prickly pear (bajtra tax-xewk) and the omnipresent Bermuda buttercup (ħaxixa Ingliża) along with many other plants. The list of fauna identified in the Maqluba is also interesting especially as some of these creatures are endemic to Malta, including a number of species of beetle, slug, types of rare ants, a rare woodlouse including the grey long-eared bats and free-tailed bats, known to inhabit this zone. == Natural environment == The sinkhole is the only one in Malta that is not covered in sediment. The natural environment is protected and integrated in the list of Natura 2000 in Malta. Dense scrubland is dominated by laurel and includes the presence of Malta's national tree, Tetraclinis articulata, known in Maltese as għargħar, as well as Maltese Salsola, (Salsola melitensis), an endemic species on the archipelago. The sinkhole is also a nesting site for the national bird of Malta, the blue rock thrush (Monticola solitarius).

It was produced, engineered, and mastered by XTC's Andy Partridge, and recorded in his shed on a budget less than £12,000. The album was well-received by critics and ultimately became the most acclaimed of Newell's career. ==Background== Partridge was contacted to produce the album after his band XTC had gone on strike against their label Virgin Records. Newell submitted 20 of what he considered his best songs to Partridge, but most were rejected. Partridge thought \\"Martin was a bit shocked at me telling him this. But I started the way I intended to go on which was to be honest with him. ... He wrote some great stuff after that.\\" The available budget for the album was less than £12,000. Normally, his rate was £3000 per song as a producer, but he agreed to take on the project anyway, provided that he receive the entirety of the budget \\"and handle everything - production, engineering, mastering.\\" ==Recording== Sessions lasted from January to August 1993 at Partridge's home studio shed in Swindon. The album was recorded using an eight-track ADAT and a Macintosh computer. Both musicians recalled that the album's making was not particularly difficult. Martin remembered: \\"He [Andy] has the hearing of a bat. Things I would've just left, he had me go back and do seven, eight, nine times. He was exacting, but he wasn't cruel. He was fabulous to work with.\\" Partridge similarly described the sessions as \\"funny and intense. A lot of laughs were had.\\" On the album's songs, Newell denied that he was significantly influenced by the Kinks, and \\"although I was pretty familiar with the Beach Boys, at the time we were making the record, I'd never heard Pet Sounds. Andy was incredulous when I told him and he immediately made me a cassette copy of it.\\" However, by that time, the album's songs were already composed. XTC member Dave Gregory made frequent visits to the studio and was credited on the sleeve as \\"Pop Mastermind\\". Partridge played most of the album's drum tracks with a Yamaha drum pad, since the shed studio was too small to reasonably hold a real full-sized drum kit. The album's title was originally planned to be Great New Product and credited to \\"Martin Newell featuring the New & Improved Andy Partridge\\". Humbug label owner Kevin Crace explained that \\"by the time we'd finished, it had become obvious that Andy had done so much on this album that he should have some other credit besides 'producer'\\". It was decided that the album should actually be called The Greatest Living Englishman, but on initial pressings, the credit to a \\"new and improved\\" Andy Partridge was retained. He said: \\"we were going to make it like a soap packet ... [I was credited] like an ingredient. And then suddenly, without me knowing it, the album title changed but for some reason they kept that credit. It made sense when the whole concept was like a soap packet, but then the title changed and it all went out the window.\\" ==Release== The Greatest Living Englishman was warmly received in the US and was met with critical acclaim in France. It also sold well in Germany and Japan. Newell played a small tour in the last three counties with a band that included Dave Gregory, Captain Sensible, the Brotherhood of Lizard's Peter Nice, and the Damned's Garrie Dreadful. In later years, the album went on to become the most acclaimed of Newell's career. He responded that the work was \\"not necessarily my best album but it's got some good kit on it.\\" Partridge expressed that the \\"songs are excellent. I'm proud of it.

He was the second son of eleven children born to Margaret Astor (née Ward) Chanler (1838–1875) and John Winthrop Chanler (1826–1877), a U.S. Representative from New York. He and his siblings became orphans after the death of their mother in December 1875 and their father in October 1877, both to pneumonia. The children, known as the \\"Astor Orphans\\", were raised at their parents' estate in Rokeby, New York, built by John Armstrong Jr., his mother's great-grandfather.Rokeby Mansion, Barrytown New York His father's estate was valued between $1,500,000 (equivalent to $) and $2,000,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars). John Winthrop Chanler's will provided $20,000 a year for each child for life (equivalent to $470,563 in 2018 dollars), enough to live comfortably by the standards of the time.Thomas, Lately. The Astor Orphans: A Pride of Lions, W. Morrow, 1971. Winthrop himself inherited all of his father's personal property in his New York City home, located at 192 Madison Avenue, all of his real estate in Delaware County, and a house on Cliff Lawn in Newport. Chanler prepared for University at Eton College and at St. John's Military Academy in Sing Sing, New York. In 1885 Winthrop graduated from Harvard College, which his brother William also attended from 1886 to 1888. While at Harvard, Winthrop was part of a prank played on Oscar Wilde when he appeared before the College to give a speech at the Boston Music Hall in 1882. Chanler, along with 60 other Harvard students, \\"marched down the center aisle in pairs, all carrying sunflowers and wearing Wildean costumes of knee breeches, black stockings, wide-spreading cravats, and shoulder length wigs.\\" His great-aunt Julia Ward Howe, who considered Winthrop her favorite, was in the audience and was apparently aghast at the prank. ===Family=== Through his mother, he was related to the Ward and Astor families, and through his father, he was related to the Dudley–Winthrop, Livingston, and Stuyvesant families. Of his ten brothers and sisters, many were prominent including John Armstrong Chaloner, a writer, William Astor Chanler, a noted soldier and explorer who served in the U.S. House of Representatives like their father, Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler, the Lt. Gov. of New York, and Robert Winthrop Chanler, an artist. His sister Margaret Livingston Chanler was married to critic Richard Aldrich and served as a nurse with the American Red Cross during the Spanish–American War, and sister Elizabeth Astor Winthrop Chanler was married to author John Jay Chapman. ==Career== After his marriage, the Chanlers moved to Washington, D.C. where the surrounded themselves with a group of friends including Theodore Roosevelt, who was then the Civil Service Commissioner, and later President of the United States. ===Military service=== During the Spanish–American War, Chanler did not enlist in the U.S. Army but instead joined a group of American Rough Rider volunteers, including his younger brother William, to join the Cuban volunteers under General Emilio Núñez. His brother received a Captain's commission from President William McKinley to serve under U.S. General Joseph Wheeler and Winthrop received a conditional commission as Lieutenant colonel under the Cuban government. On June 30, 1898 in the Battle of Tayacoba, Chanler led twenty-five Rough Riders. Chanler, Captain Jose Manuel Núñez (brother of General Núñez), and William Louis Abbott and about 30 men went ashore near Trinidad, Cuba to ensure the safety of the landing site. They were discovered by Spanish scouts and came under heavy fire.\\"In a Hot Engagement: Captain Nunez was Killed, Winthrop Chanler and Five Others Wounded.\\" The Spokesman-Review, Spokane, WA July 14, 1898, p. 2. During the battle, Captain Núñez was killed and Chanler was shot through the right elbow. They had to take cover in a mangrove swamp until they could be rescued by the American steamship Florida. Chanler returned to his home in Barrytown to recover from his injuries. By the time his arm healed, the war was over, so Chanler sailed to Europe where he stayed for several years in Sorrento, Italy taking a \\"life of hunting.\\" During World War I, he served as an aide to General John J. Pershing, who served as the commander of the American Expeditionary Force on the Western Front from 1917 to 1918. ===Society life=== Chanler's cottage in Tuxedo Park, NY, about 1886. Due to his elder brother's mental issues, Winthrop became the de facto head of the Chanler family. The Chanler's spent the winter of 1891 to 1892 in New York where three of his sisters were introduced to society. Thereafter, they moved to Tuxedo Park, New York which according to his wife, \\"seemed dull in its exclusiveness; the tendency of Anglo-Saxons to separate into 'social sets and hierarchies' was in striking contrast to the hospitality and cosmopolitanism of Roman society\\" where she had grown up. In the late 1890s, they lived in Newport, Rhode Island where Chanler paid taxes on an estate valued at $96,300 in 1895. In 1892, both Chanler and his wife Margaret were included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. His wife described the list of New York's elite as \\"not unlike Dante's description of Paradise.\\" Chanler, a member of the Society of Patriarchs, attended the Patriarch's Ball organized by McAllister for his fellow \\"American aristocrats\\" at Delmonico's in December 1892. In 1903, Chanler moved from Newport to Geneseo, New York in Livingston County. While in Genseo, he served as master of the hounds of the Genesee Valley Hunt Club. He reportedly spent most of his time fox hunting and horse breeding at his estate, Sweet Briar Farms, which was once owned by the Wadsworth family. In 1913, his wife, who was Catholic, built the Chapel of St. Felicity at the Farm. ==Personal life== On December 16, 1886, Chanler was married to Margaret Louisa Terry (1862–1952), a first cousin, once removed, in Rome, Italy. Margaret's grandparents (Julia Rush Cutler and Samuel Ward Jr) were also Chanler's maternal great grandparents. Margaret, who grew up in the Palazzo Odescalchi in Rome, was the daughter of Louisa (née Ward) Crawford Terry and artist Luther Terry (d. 1900), a half-sister of F. Marion Crawford and a niece of Julia Ward Howe. Together, they were the parents of: * Laura Astor Chanler (1887–1984), who married Lawrence Grant White (1887–1956), an architect with McKim, Mead & White and the son of Stanford White, in 1916. * John Winthrop Chanler II (1889–1894), who died young. * Beatrice Margaret Chanler (1891–1974), who married Pierre Francis Allegaert (1896–1961). * Hester Marion Chanler (1893–1990), who married Edward Motley Pickman, a descendant of Dudley Leavitt Pickman, in 1915. Hester was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Ethel Roosevelt Derby in 1913. * Marion Winthrop Chanler (1895–1931), who drowned. * Margaret Gabrielle \\"May\\" Chanler (1897–1958), who married Porter Ralph Chandler (1899–1979). * Hubert Winthrop Chanler (1900–1974), who married Gertrude Laughlin (1914–1999), daughter of Ambassador Irwin B. Laughlin. * Theodore Ward Chanler (1902-1961), who married Maria De Acosta Sargent (1880–1970). Theodore's godfather was President Theodore Roosevelt, who attended his christening in Newport in 1902. On August 5, 1926, Chanler suffered a stroke following a fall from his horse. He died at Brigham Hall in Canandaigua, New York on August 24, 1926. He was buried at St. Mary's Catholic Cemetery in Geneseo, New York. After his death, his widow wrote several novels and a memoir entitled Roman Spring, published in 1934. ===Descendants=== Through his son Hubert, he was the grandfather of Susanne Felicity Chanler, who married Stephen Young; Gay Chanler, who married John Andrew Gunther; and Elizabeth Chanler, who married Bruce Chatwin (1940–1989), the English writer, novelist, and journalist. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources ==External links== * Category:1863 births Category:1926 deaths Winthrop Astor Chanler Winthrop Astor Chanler Category:Astor Orphans Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Harvard University alumni Category:People included in New York Society's Four Hundred ","title":"Winthrop Astor Chanler"},{"id":"56652900","text":"The 1991 Regal Welsh Professional Championship was a professional non-ranking snooker tournament, which took place in May 1991.

The film stars Duplass and Ray Romano. The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on February 1, 2019. It was released on February 22, 2019, by Netflix to generally favorable reviews from critics. ==Plot== Middle-aged Michael receives a diagnosis of terminal stomach cancer and plans to end his life. This upsets his older, upstairs neighbor Andy, as they are each other's best (and only) friends and escape from their menial jobs. Andy encourages Michael to try to fight the cancer, but Michael refuses to prolong any suffering. As per Michael's wishes, the two make pizzas together, watch kung fu movies, solve jigsaw puzzles, and play Paddleton, a game of their own creation. Andy promises to finally tell Michael a rousing halftime speech that he has been working on in secret. Andy is reluctant to help Michael end his own life, but agrees to join him on a road trip to the closest pharmacy that will fill the prescription, which is six hours away. During their drive, they discuss genie-in-a-bottle style wishes and stop to visit an ostrich farm along the way. They pick up Michael's prescription and check into a hotel, where they are mistaken for a gay couple. While Michael naps, Andy goes back to the pharmacy and buys a child-proof safe where he stashes Andy's medication and withholds the combination. This upsets Michael, who sees Andy's behavior as overbearing and childish. The two go to an open mic night, where a nervous Andy finally delivers his halftime speech to himself in the bathroom mirror before helping Michael perform a scene from their favorite kung fu movie onstage. The two later break hotel rules by using a Jacuzzi after-hours while drinking. They are caught by the hotel owner, who ends up joining them and flirts with Andy, leading Michael to go back to their room. Andy becomes uncomfortable after she mentions her deceased husband, whom she believes is \\"all around her.\\" Andy wakes up the next morning to find Michael and the safe missing. He panics, and runs all over the town trying to find Michael, only to discover him in the hotel lobby, waiting to meet up for breakfast. Andy takes and attempts to keep hold of the safe, until an annoyed Michael forces him to come to terms with the fact that he is dying, and that Andy needs to respect his wishes. The two drive back to Michael's apartment, where his condition quickly deteriorates. As they sit on the kitchen floor preparing the lethal dose of medicine, Michael reveals that he used to be married, but quickly felt uncomfortable within the marriage. In contrast, he felt a sense of belonging with Andy as soon as they met. Andy replies that when he first saw Michael, he thought he was a serial killer in hiding. They discuss Andy's halftime speech (which Michael has already heard through the apartment's vents) and the possibility of an afterlife where Michael could haunt Andy. With Michael ready to die, they deliver the lethal dose of medication. After a brief moment of fear, Michael dies peacefully in his own bed after the two reaffirm their platonic love for each other, leaving Andy devastated. Andy tries to live his usual life of kung fu movies, puzzles, and Paddleton, but appears lonely and unfulfilled. Some time later, Andy encounters a single mother named Kiersten and her son Evan moving into Michael's old apartment. He reassures them that they have the best apartment in the complex and explains the game of Paddleton to the Evan. Promising to give him a rousing halftime speech if he ever needs it, Andy returns to his own apartment with a smile. ==Cast== * Mark Duplass as Michael Thompson, a man who has terminal cancer * Ray Romano as Andy Freeman, Michael's neighbor and best friend * Christine Woods as Doctor Hagen * Kadeem Hardison as David * Marguerite Moreau as Kiersten * Dendrie Taylor as Nancy * Alexandra Billings as Judy * Matt Bush as Stewart * Jack McGraw as Evan ==Production== In February 2018, it was announced Alex Lehmann had directed a film, from a screenplay written by him and Mark Duplass.

Key findings of his research include: * In Egypt, the government's employment guarantee for graduates and the fact that public sector wages in the 1990s were at least as high as in the private sector have jointly encouraged queuing for government jobs, reduced the employment of graduates in the private sector, and thereby contributed to high youth unemployment rates and unsustainable growth of public sector employment.Assaad, R. (1997). The Effects of Public Sector Hiring and Compensation Policies on the Egyptian Labor Market. World Bank Economic Review, 11(1), pp. 85-118. * The differences between Egyptian men and women's access to wage employment has increased during the 1990s, in part because women have less geographic mobility and thus cannot pursue job opportunities to the same degree as men.Assaad, R., Arntz, M. (2005). Constrained Geographic Mobility and Gendered Labor Market Outcomes under Structural Adjustment: Evidence from Egypt. World Development, 33(3), pp. 431-454. * Labour market relations in settings where formal institutions are absent or ineffective, e.g. in Egypt's construction market in the late 1980s, may still be shaped by informal institutions such as customs, kinship groups, or other social networks.Assaad, R. (1993). Formal and informal institutions in the labor market, with applications to the construction sector in Egypt. World Development, 21(6), pp. 925-939. * Egyptian women in urban areas respond differently to their husbands working abroad than in rural areas: whereas in urban areas, female labour market participation decreases in response to male international migration, female work in rural areas simply shifts towards unpaid family and subsistence work.Binzel, C., Assaad, R.

It featured two hit singles; \\"Undecided\\" and \\"Buried and Dead\\". ==Background== In mid-1966 Adelaide-based rock group, the Masters Apprentices, shared a gig with pop star, Bobby Bright (of Melbourne duo, Bobby & Laurie), who was impressed and recommended them to his label, Astor Records. A few weeks later, they were contacted by Astor's Max Pepper, who requested a four-track demo. The band went to Pepper's local two-track studio to record it, : \\"Hot Gully Wind\\", \\"Buried and Dead\\", \\"She's My Girl\\" and \\"Undecided\\". The demo became their debut extended play, The Masters Apprentices (February 1967). \\"Undecided\\" was released as the group's debut single, \\"Undecided\\" backed by \\"Wars or Hands of Time\\", was released in October 1966 and gradually climbed the Adelaide charts, due to support from local DJs, peaking at No. 4. The B-side, \\"Wars or Hands of Time\\", written solely by Bower, is the first Australian pop song to directly address the issue of the Vietnam War, which was then affecting the lives of many young Australians because of the controversial introduction of conscription in 1965. Teen pop newspaper, Go-Set, started publishing their national singles charts in October 1966. By February of the following year the group had relocated to Melbourne and issued their four-track EP (which was self-titled) on Astor. \\"Undecided\\" peaked at No. 13 on the Go-Set National Top 40 in June 1967, spending sixteen weeks in the charts. Due to the success of \\"Undecided\\" and the EP, Astor requested additional tracks to be recorded for a full length album. The album itself is a compilation of the four tracks featured on the EP, five cover songs (\\"Dancing Girl\\", \\"I Feel Fine\\", \\"My Girl\\", \\"Don't Fight It\\" and \\"Johnny B Goode\\") and two new originals (\\"But One Day\\" and \\"Theme For A Social Climber\\") written by then chief songwriter and guitarist Mick Bower. The album was released by Astor Records in June, 1967. It was later reissued on the budget Summit Records label in 1971. In 2009 a 2 CD special edition was released by reissue label Aztec Music. ==Reception== In a retrospective review Allmusic was mixed on the album saying that the \\"Debut mixes sloppy covers of popular '60s rock and soul tunes with some fine originals\\". ==Track listing== All songs written by Mick Bower except as noted. == Personnel == ;The Masters Apprentices * Mick Bower – rhythm guitar * Jim Keays – lead vocals * Rick Morrison – lead guitar * Brian Vaughton – drums * Gavin Webb – bass guitar ;Production Team * Producer – Max Pepper == References == ;General * Note: limited preview for on-line version. * * Note: Archived [on-line] copy has limited functionality. * Note: [on-line] version was established at White Room Electronic Publishing Pty Ltd in 2007 and was expanded from the 2002 edition.

Players can fight enemies/friends, mine for ore, trade commodities, and complete jobs such as freelance missions. ==Plot== The game follows the adventures of Keith T. Maxwell, as he is sent forwards in time after a malfunction with his hyperdrive, caused by damage from a skirmish in an asteroid belt. His craft, hurtling out of control with Keith unconscious, is put in an orbit around Var Hastra by the onboard flight computer, before being salvaged by an ore dealer and towed to the orbiting space station. The dealer, Gunant Breh, tells Keith of events that happened while Keith was unconscious. Breh then tasks Keith with collecting ore from an old mining ship. While mining, the ship comes under attack by pirates, and Keith flies back to the station. Unhappy with having to run away from the pirates, Keith convinces Gunant to help him take out the pirates in the area. After fighting off the pirates, Keith is told to visit a neighbouring planet, as the space station there recently lost contact. While investigating, Keith comes across his old friend Mkkt Bkkt, who explains that the crew of the station have been infected with 'neuro-algae', and are subsequently intoxicated. After being given control of completing side quests, Keith is informed of a Terran convoy in the system, and that he could be picked up and sent back to Terran space. Upon arrival, the convoy is under attack by pirates. One of the gunners of the main vessel mistakes Keith's ship as another pirate, and disables it with an EMP blast. Keith is then transported aboard the ship as a prisoner. After arriving at Alioth station, Keith meets commander Brent Snocom. While they are talking, the conversation is suddenly interrupted by a Void attack outside the station. Keith, along with other pilots, are sent to defend the station. The Void fighters destroy a group of freighters, before escaping through a wormhole back into their territory. Back at the station, Snocom explains to Keith about the Voids. Keith is told to meet a scientist,a certain Lieutenant Thomas Boyle who can provide more information on the Voids, but Boyle is held hostage by pirates. Keith then rescues Boyle and defeats the pirates, before taking him to a secret research facility at Thynome. From there, Keith meets Dr Carla Paolini, a scientist, and is told to return samples of Void technology, by travelling to a raid on another convoy. The Voids escape, but not after Keith destroys one of their fighters. It is from here that Keith meets Khador, an advanced alien who is developing a 'Khador Drive', which can transport a vessel instantly to another part of the galaxy, eliminating the need of jump gates. Khador sends Keith on a mission to mine Void crystals, accessing Void space through a wormhole. After collecting 50 crystals, Khador has enough to construct the Khador Drive, and gives it to Keith. As these events are going on, the Terran and Vossk Empire agree to develop a strategy for ending the Void threat. They use a converted Vossk freighter, packed with explosives, which is sent through a wormhole, to destroy the Void 'mothership'. Keith provides escort to the freighter as it comes under fire. The Voids manage to cripple the freighter, so the pilot on board has to manually guide the freighter into the mothership. The freighter collides with the vessel, killing the pilot on board. After escaping through another wormhole, Keith flies back to Thynome, and goes on a date with Carla. ==DLCs== Galaxy on Fire 2 included a few DLCs to add on to the experience. These DLCs include two new campaigns, and the player's own personal space station at the Shima system. The official names to these DLCs are \\"Valkyrie,\\" \\"Supernova,\\" and \\"Kaamo Club.\\" ==Kaamo Club== The Kaamo Club is the player's own personal space station where the player can store an unlimited number of ships, weapons, equipment, and commodities. When acquired, the Kaamo Club is usable when Keith leaves the tutorial section of the game at Var Hastra. It will be found in the Shima system, orbiting a lone planet called Kaamo. Officially, it is in Midorian space, which is why it has a Midorian jump gate. Inside the Kaamo Club, in the Space Lounge, there are six specialists. They can sell the player specialty weapons, ships, and mods to the player's space craft at a cost proportional to the ship cost. These services include upgrading overall armor, handling, cargo hold, and an additional equipment slot. The two other specialists will sell the player unique ships and weapons/equipment, which are sold for a given time and at a fixed cost. ==HD and full HD releases== Galaxy On Fire 2 was re- released for newer devices as an HD version, which features more detail and better graphics. A 'Full HD' version was also released, specifically for the Apple Mac and Windows computers. However, some content was cut from this version, such as the Valkyrie and Supernova DLCs, and the systems Loma and Shima. ==Reviews== The game received a 6/10 review on GameSpot, and a 90% score on Metacritic ==References== ==External links== Category:2010 video games Category:IOS games Category:Video games developed in Germany Category:Space trading and combat simulators Category:Windows games ","title":"Galaxy On Fire 2"},{"id":"56653705","text":"Wing House may refer to: *Wing House Museum, Coldwater, Michigan *Andrews-Wing House, Boonville, Missouri *Tabor-Wing House, Dover Plains, New York *Helen Wing House, Glen Falls, New York *Asa and Caroline Wing House, Mexico, New York *Brown-Wing House, Bloomfield Township, Trumbull County, Ohio, listed on the National Register of Historic Places *Wing Fort House, East Sandwich, Massachusetts ==See also== *747 Wing House *The WingHouse Bar & Grill ","title":"Wing House"},{"id":"56653719","text":"Lisa Berkani (born May 19, 1997) is a French professional basketball player for USO Mondeville of the Ligue Féminine de Basketball (LFB).

The obverse features a head of Roma, while the reverse depicts Juno Caprotina in a biga driven by two goats. The gens Rennia, occasionally written Renia, was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. No members of this gens obtained any of the higher offices of the Roman state, but the family is known from inscriptions, and coins issued by a certain Gaius Renius, depicting the head of Roma on the obverse, and on the reverse Juno Caprotina in a chariot pulled by two goats.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 645 (\\"Renia Gens\\").Eckhel, vol. v, pp. 291, 292.PW, s. v. Renius.Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, pp. 264, 265. ==Origin== The appearance of Juno Caprotina suggests that the Rennii may have originated at Lanuvium, where Juno was particularly revered. The etymology of the nomen Rennius is uncertain; Chase suggests a possible connection with the Latin renes, kidneys.Chase, p. 131. ==Praenomina== Like other families known chiefly from imperial times, the Rennii seem to have confined themselves to the most common praenomina, and particularly Lucius, Gaius, and Marcus. The only other names found among the Rennii are Publius, Quintus, and Decimus, of which only the last was relatively uncommon. ==Branches and cognomina== The Rennii do not appear to have been divided into distinct families, and all of their surnames appear to have been personal cognomina, many of them probably having been the original names of freedmen of the gens. Of those that were more typical of Roman surnames, Aestivus refers to the summer, and was probably given to someone born during that season. Candidus means gleaming white, and could refer to one's hair or clothing. Crispinus, a diminutive of Crispus, referred to someone with curly hair.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. aestivus, candidus, crispus.Chase, p. 110. Faustus, fortunate, and Proculus were old praenomina, which came to be used as surnames in the later Republic and imperial times. Felix, happy, and Firmus, strong, Hilarus, cheerful, Rufus, red, and Venustus, charming or handsome, were all common names; Laetus, glad, and Orientis, eastern, were more distinctive.

Her father, an Army veteran, was a sharecropper who went to work for Cargill Granary and was eventually paralyzed and disabled. Her mother was a domestic worker. She attended Lakeview School, the only school for black children in the area, and graduated in 1956, where she was a good student and basketball player. Scissum's father was convinced that she would attend college and repeatedly told her this from a very young age. Scissum was awarded a small scholarship to study at Alabama A&M; University which she supplemented by working at a telephone switchboard. She earned her bachelor's and master's degree in mathematics before returning to graduate school to get her PhD in computer science after 13 years at Marshall Space Flight Center. == Career == Page from \\"Survey of Solar Cycle Prediction Models\\" Scissum started teaching at Councill Training School, Huntsville's only black high school. Here she very quickly realised that teaching was not for her as she worried about the students a lot. Scissum joined NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center as an entry level mathematician in 1964 after a recommendation from a friend and was the first African-American mathematician to be employed by Marshall. She published a NASA report in 1967, “Survey of Solar Cycle Prediction Models,” which put forward techniques for improved forecasting of the sunspot cycle. In the mid-1970s she worked as a space scientist in the Space Environment Branch of Marshall’s Space Sciences Laboratory and she led activities in Marshall’s Atmospheric, Magnetospheric, and Plasmas in Space project. Following the completion of her PhD, she later moved to Maryland to work in Goddard Space Flight Center as a computer systems analyst responsible for analyzing and directing NASA management information and technical support systems. She retired in 2005. Scissum's accomplishments have earned her recognition by Mathematically Gifted & Black as a Black History Month 2018 Honoree. == Diversity == Scissum was passionate about inclusion and volunteered to be an equal employment opportunity officer. Her contributions in this role were recognised by an award from NASA Administrator James Fletcher, but she did note that fighting for others sometimes put her own career in jeopardy. She was warned by a top female supervisor that management were unhappy with the number of complaints that she was handling. In 1975, Scissum wrote an article for the National Technical Association, \\"Equal Employment Opportunity and the Supervisor – A Counselor’s View,\\" which argued that many discrimination complaints could be avoided \\"through adequate and meaningful communication.\\" She noted that her progression and the progression of her black colleagues was limited at NASA and expressed frustration and anger at this. \\"The problem (blacks) had was moving into management and being over people,\\" Scissum said. \\"I guess (NASA) was afraid people would fight against it. I guess. It's hard to understand. It's always been hard for me to understand – the motivation for all this discrimination, because most of it seems unnecessary. It doesn't even have a reason.\\" == References == Category:Living people Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:American women mathematicians Category:African- American mathematicians Category:People from Guntersville, Alabama Category:Alabama A&M; University alumni Category:20th-century women mathematicians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Jeanette Scissum"},{"id":"56654707","text":"The 1976 Canadian Open was the third edition of the professional invitational snooker tournament, the Canadian Open, which took place in September 1976.

The embodiment of the network is often physical or informational. An entropy network is composed of entropy containers which are often called nodes, elements, features, or regions and entropy transfer occurs between containers. The transfer of entropy in networks was characterized by Schreiber in his transfer entropy. ==Physical basis== A discrete physical basis for entropy networks can be found in the observation, and discussions of discrete observations appear briefly in the work of Prokopenko, Lizier & Price. More complete discussions of observations were offered by Leo Szilárd and Léon Brillouin. ==Structures and motifs== Network motifs have been proposed to be scale independent. Networks have been classified by total entropy. The entropy content of graphs has been considered throughout fields of math and computer science. Design of entropy networks and in depth investigation has been publicized by Wissner-Gross and Freer who have proposed a time entropy relation (where entropy is maximized of a lifespan) through which predictions of the emergence of complexity can be shown. ==Domains of study== The role of entropy networks in formation of structures is critical in engineering and its physical implications determine chirality, organize biological molecules, and quantify the topologies of condensed matter (mass) networks. ==References== Category:Entropy ","title":"Entropy network"},{"id":"56654735","text":"Crystal Canyon may refer to: * Crystal Canyon, a small canyon on the northeastern slopes of Coso Mountain in the Coso Range in southwestern Inyo County, California, United States * Crystal Canyon, a canyon that runs southeast of the ghost town of Crystal in the White River National Forest in northern Gunnison County, Colorado, United States * Crystal Canyon, a canyon on the south end of the Hotcreek Range in central Nye County, Nevada, United States * Crystal Canyon (Utah), a small canyon in the western slopes of the East Tintic Mountains in Juab County, Utah, United States ==See also== * Crystal Springs Canyon, a small canyon in the Chuckwalla Mountains in east‑central Riverside County, California, United States * Crystal Springs Canyon, a side canyon of Glen Canyon in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area on the western edge of San Juan County, Utah, United States ==References== ","title":"Crystal Canyon"},{"id":"56654742","text":"Xylosandrus is a genus of beetles with approximately 54 species globally.

Four of the ships, , , , and , parted company with the main convoy. They were never heard of again. Hugh Inglis was the last vessel to see Jane, Duchess of Gordon and Lady Jane Dundas; was the last vessel to see Bengal and Calcutta.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 26, p.218. The hull of one of the four missing vessels was sighted overturned off Mauritius the following October, but sank before it could be identified. Hugh Inglis reached the Cape on 10 April and St Helena on 30 April; she arrived at The Downs on 13 July. EIC voyage #5 (1810-1812): Captain Wood sailed from Portsmouth on 14 March 1810, bound for Madras and Bengal. Hugh Inglis reached Madras on 9 July and arrived at Diamond Harbour on 28 July. There the British government hired her as a transport for the Île de France (Mauritius). Hugh Inglis was at Saugor on 4 September and Mauritius on 29 November. By 10 February 1811 she was back at Diamond Harbour. There the government again hired her, this time for the invasion of Java. Hugh Inglis arrived at Malacca on 4 May. She was part of the Second Division of transports and left on 11 June. She was at \\"Rendezvous Island\\", Borneo, on 12 July, and Batavia on 10 August. She returned to Calcutta on 31 October. Homeward bound she was at Saugor on 28 December, and on 4 April 1812 \\"towards England\\". Hugh Inglis returned to The Downs in mid-summer 1812. She brought with her two Mauritian slaves, originally from Madagascar, who had stowed away to escape slavery. Once they had been discovered the crew accepted them and named them John and Florrie. When the ship arrived in England they had a little money in their pockets and they disappeared into the Docklands. EIC voyage #6 (1813-1814): Captain \\"James\\" Fairfax acquired a letter of marque on 19 February 1813. Captain William Fairfax sailed from Torbay on 24 March 1813, bound for Madras and Bengal. Hugh Inglis was at Tenerife on 11 April, Johanna on 13 July, Madras on 9 August, and Vizagapatam on 29 August. She arrived at Diamond Harbour on 8 September. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 14 December, Madras again on 25 January 1814, Colombo on 14 February, and the Cape on 24 April. She reached St Helena on 19 May and arrived at The Downs on 6 August. EIC voyage #7 (1816-1817): Captain William Fairfax sailed from The Downs on 17 April 1816, bound for China. Hugh Inglis arrived at Whampoa on 6 September. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 21 December, reached St Helena on 20 March 1817, and arrived at The Downs on 29 May. ==Fate== On her return in 1817, her owners sold Hugh Inglis for breaking up. ==Citations and references== Citations References * * * Category:1799 ships Category:Age of Sail merchant ships of England Category:Ships of the British East India Company ","title":"Hugh Inglis (1799 EIC ship)"},{"id":"56654873","text":"\\"Latigazo\\" (English: \\"Whiplash\\") is a single by Puerto Rican rapper Daddy Yankee from his second studio album El Cangri.com, released on June 20, 2002.

Taking place in Pripyat, Ukraine, it was designed by Mohammad Alavi, and is unusual for its stealth gameplay in a game that is otherwise action-oriented, and the choices it offers the player. During development, its enemy artificial intelligence was secretly added to the game due to its unusual complexity. \\"All Ghillied Up\\" has since been recognized by critics as one of the greatest levels in video games, being praised for its atmosphere and player freedom. The level is also included in the remastered version of the game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered. The name refers to the ghillie suits worn by the characters in the mission. == Level content == \\"All Ghillied Up\\" is the thirteenth level in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare single-player campaign. Set in Pripyat, Ukraine, the player's character proceeds through a timber building within a field, past a house, and through an abandoned church whilst taking out enemies with the assistance of Captain MacMillan. The player proceeds to another field where they encounter a platoon with tanks advancing across it. They hide from the enemies in the foliage using the ghillie suits in prone. They proceed past further areas containing inactive tanks, helicopters and shipping units whilst dealing with enemies. They encounter another platoon with helicopters and military vehicles. In stealth, they crawl under a series of military vehicles. Soon after, they traverse various buildings, including the famous Azure Swimming Pool, encountering wild dogs, culminating in them setting up in the abandoned Polissya hotel to prepare for an assassination. Throughout the level the player is presented with numerous choices, which MacMillan responds appropriately to. One instance of this is found near that start of the level, once the player passes the abandoned churchyard, MacMillan will warn of an enemy helicopter flying above telling the player get down. However, the player can choose to shoot the helicopter down using a FIM-92 Stinger found in the church and MacMillan will say \\"now you're just showin' off.\\" During other examples, MacMillan will criticize the player character when he ruins their cover, and correct them when the player aims at the incorrect target. ===Plot=== \\"All Ghillied Up\\" is presented as a flashback in which the player assumes control of Captain Price, as a lieutenant. Set in 1996, fifteen years before the events of the game, Price has to sneak across an irradiated wasteland in Pripyat, Ukraine with Captain MacMillan. Pripyat is a town near Chernobyl which was abandoned after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. The mission ends with MacMillan and Price setting up in the abandoned Polissya hotel preparing for an assassination. The next mission, \\"One Shot, One Kill\\", concludes with a failed assassination attempt, a hurried retreat, and a final stand-off in front of the Pripyat amusement park ferris wheel. \\"All Ghillied Up\\" introduces parallels between Captain Price and the game's main player character Soap MacTavish. == Development == \\"All Ghillied Up\\" was designed by Mohammad Alavi, who also designed \\"Crew Expendable\\", another level in Modern Warfare, and \\"No Russian\\", a controversial level in the sequel Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. The level was based on game mechanics used in Half-Life and Metal Gear Solid. In it, non-player characters (NPCs) react differently to the player based on distance and angle, rather than a simple proximity trigger. For example, a player might lie prone in the grass and an enemy will not notice them. This code was created in secret by Alavi due to the difficulty of explaining its intricacies to the AI programmer, who was already swamped with work. Alavi called the internal code \\"garbage\\", but said that it still \\"did exactly what [he] wanted it to do\\", and that he did not \\"have to compromise on the feel of the gameplay\\". It took Alavi three months and more than 10,000 lines of code to make the first minute of gameplay for the level. The lead designer, Steve Fukuda, played the first minute ten different ways and had fun each time, making Alavi consider it a success. The script was later used as the basis for the AI in Modern Warfare 2. == Reception == === Initial reception === Official Xbox Magazine Ryan McCaffrey appraised \\"All Ghillied Up\\" and noted it was the best level in the game and one of the best stealth levels in gaming. He commended the section where the player has to lie in a grassy field while a platoon, including tanks, walks past for its high tension. === Retrospective commentary === GB Buford of Kotaku called \\"All Ghillied Up\\" one of the best levels in video game history, citing its heavy freedom of choice in approaching the level. Comparing it to the game's previous level, \\"Safehouse\\", he remarked that while the player's commanding officer could be obeyed to get through the level successfully, the player could also win by disobeying his orders and he will still back up the player, rather than simply killing the player for failing to obey. He also complemented the \\"incredibly tense\\" prone section as implementing the mechanic in an interesting way. PC Gamer said \\"All Ghillied Up\\" was one of the strongest levels in Modern Warfare and that it \\"demonstrates the real craft of a linear story-driven first-person shooter\\". They went on to compare it to DayZ with its equally dramatic scenarios and allowing for \\"personality and freeform set pieces\\". IGN called the level one of the best stealth missions in games, and Digital Trends described it as among the greatest in any first- person shooter.\\" Ars Technica Sam White compared the level's atmosphere and tension to that seen in the Fallout series. Sam Sant of Game Revolution said it was one of gaming's most iconic missions, also noting the ghillie suits worn in the mission were a fan favourite. PlayStation Official Magazine – UK called the level a \\"stealth masterclass\\" and considered it to be the greatest level in a first-person shooter and likely the best video game flashback of all time, particularly praising the pacing and level of player agency. In a 2019 poll of LADbible readers, \\"All Ghillied Up\\" was voted the best Call of Duty mission with 67% of the 6,180 votes, above \\"Vendetta\\" from World at War and \\"Vorkuta\\" from Black Ops. == Legacy == \\"All Ghillied Up\\" was referenced in the movie Hardcore Henry, whose director, Ilya Naishuller called it \\"one of the best levels of all time\\". In 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, a soft reboot of the sub series, players can unlock the \\"All Ghillied Up\\" pack which allows players to wear a ghillie suit and wield a bolt-action sniper rifle, in camouflage with additional netting and silencer similar to that seen in the mission. == References == Category:Video game levels Category:Call of Duty Category:Chernobyl disaster in fiction ","title":"All Ghillied Up"},{"id":"56654876","text":"The 1974 Canadian Open was the first edition of the professional invitational snooker tournament, the Canadian Open, which took place in September 1974.

Cunninghamia 7, 631-650. Situated in the Cumberland Plain, it is made up of dry sclerophyll woodlands, grasslands and/or forests, reminiscent of Mediterranean forests and temperate grasslands. Currently, less than 6% of the Woodlands remain in small parts distributed across the western suburbs of Sydney, totaling only around 6400 hectares. Cumberland Plain Woodland was listed as an Endangered Ecological Community under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 in June 1997. The greatest threats to the Cumberland Plain Woodland include land clearing for agriculture, urban sprawl and the introduction of harmful weed species.Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 (NSW Act of Parliament, online edition). ==Geography== A typical rural grassland dotted with eucalyptus trees in Luddenham. In 1877, Cumberland Plain Woodlands covered 107,000 hectares and filled around 30% of the Sydney Basin. At the time of European settlement, the Cumberland Plain contained 1,070 km² of woodlands and forests. The westward expansion of Sydney over the plain has placed enormous pressure on the woodlands and other local ecological communities, only 13% of which remain uncleared.Benson DH, Howell J (1990a) ‘Taken for granted: the bushland of Sydney and its suburbs.’ Kangaroo Press and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. Situated in the cities of Fairfield, Liverpool, Cumberland, Campbelltown, Blacktown and Penrith, and surrounds, they contain approximately 2000 ha (one-fifth) of the remaining Cumberland Plain Woodland. The ecoregion contains clay soils derived from Wianamatta Shale. The ecoregion is located on a rain shadow area, usually getting 700–900 mm of annual rainfall, to the west of Sydney CBD. Its range does not extend to slightly wetter Sydney Turpentine-Ironbark Forest, or high-rainfall ridges (such as Blue Gum High Forest in the upper North Shore).Benson DH, Howell J (1990b) Sydney’s vegetation 1788-1988: utilization, degradation and rehabilitation. Proceedings of the Ecological Society of Australia 16, 115-127. The biotic community is mostly found on flat or hilly terrains up to about 350 m in elevation, but it may also be present on locally precipitous sites and at slightly higher elevations. Some parts of the community may have a forest structure. The Woodland features an open tree canopy, groundcover prevailed by grasses and herbs, sometimes with layers of shrubs and small trees.Benson DH (1992) The natural vegetation of the Penrith 1:100 000 map sheet.

Having hints, and being a component, of Western Sydney Dry Rainforest, some of its species would include hairy clerodendrum (Clerodendrum tomentosum) and slender grape (Cayratia clematidea). Although most of its habitat has been cleared for housing and urbanization, there are pockets of it in the southwest parts of the Fairfield City Council area and northwest of Liverpool near Green Valley and Cecil Hills.James T, Benson DH, Howell J (1999) Rare plants of western Sydney. Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. *Cumberland Shale Hills Woodland – It's one of the widespread grassy woodland communities within Cumberland Plain Woodland and is restricted to mean annual rainfall of between 750 and 900 millimetres and elevations between 50 and 350 metres above sea level. An open woodland mainly containing grey box (Eucalyptus moluccana and Eucalyptus microcarpa) and forest red gum trees, it is mostly prevalent in Prospect near Prospect Reservoir, and also on the western edges of Fairfield City, Campbelltown LGA and Liverpool LGA.Keith D, Pellow B, Tozer M (2005) Can’t see the biodiversity for the trees?

Spotted gum (Corymbia maculata) may occur in the Fairfield LGA. It also contains a thin to reasonable cover of shrubs and a high cover of grasses and forbs. It is mostly spread in around Wetherill Park in Fairfield LGA, Prospect and Greystanes in Blacktown LGA, Cecils Hills and to the southwest as well, in Liverpool LGA.Knox KJE, Clarke PJ (2006) Fire season and intensity affect shrub recruitment in temperate sclerophyllous woodlands.

Grey myrtle (Backhousia myrtifolia) is the most prevalent species with a ground cover being sparsely made up of herbs and ferns. Other salient species include fig (Ficus rubiginosa), wild quince (Alectryon subcinereus) and whalebone tree (Streblus brunonianus). The rainforest canopy may include spotted gums, wattles and paperbarks. Shrubs such as hairy clerodendrum (Clerodendrum tomentosum) and large mock olive (Notelaea longifolia) are also present. Rainfall is usually below 900 millimeters per annum in the rainforests within Cumberland Plain.Fairley A and Waterhouse D 2005, West Sydney Wild – Exploring Nature in Sydney’s Western Suburbs. Rosenberg Publishing Pty Ltd, Dural, NSW. *Cumberland Shale-Sandstone Ironbark Forest – Found on the peripheries of the Cumberland Plain, it is one of a series of woodlands that are associated with the impalpable transition between clay-rich shale soil and the coarse sandy substrates of the sandstone plateau. It is present on the western bounds of the Woronora Plateau and above the Nepean and Georges rivers between Appin and the Holsworthy defence area. It is a modestly tall eucalyptus forest with a mixed understorey of sclerophyll shrubs and grasses with some sparse blanket of tall casuarinas (Allocasuarina littoralis and Allocasuarina torulosa). Its ground cover contains varies species of shrubs that are common on shale substrates such as blackthorn (Bursaria spinosa) and those linked with sandstone soils such as geebungs (Persoonia).Leary T (2005) Fauna survey of Parks and Wildlife Division estate on the Cumberland Plain with some observations on the remnant mammal fauna.

The long-awaited first EMI single was moderately successful, and even though it was something of a false start artistically, \\"Linda Linda\\" / \\"Merry-Go-Round\\" (March 1969) marked the beginning of a short but successful collaboration with New Zealand-born producer Howard Gable. The bubblegum pop A-side, \\"Linda Linda\\" fell into the same faux-music hall category as UK songs like \\"Winchester Cathedral\\" but the rocky B-side showed hints of how the group was developing. The single missed out on the Top 40 but gained radio airplay and helped to revive their waning popularity. Their next single, the rocky \\"5:10 Man\\", released in July, which peaked at No. 16 on the Go-Set Singles Chart and initiated a string of Top 20 hits. It was a deliberate move towards a heavier sound, as the band were keen to move away from the current bubblegum craze that their manager and producer wanted. During this period, Ford/Keays struggled to write new material due to the band's hectic live performance schedule . In February 1970, their long delayed second LP Masterpiece was finally issued. Although something of a hodgepodge—as Keays freely admits—it showed the band developing a much broader range.Keays, p. 152–153 It included the singles \\"Linda Linda\\" and \\"5:10 Man\\" and album tracks, \\"A Dog, a Siren & Memories\\", and \\"How I Love You\\", although it omitted the song \\"Merry-Go- Round\\". By then they were coming to grips with the album format and emulated the current fad for concept albums by linking the songs with a short guitar- and-string arrangement, crossfaded between tracks. The title track, a live recording, provides a vivid aural snapshot of their live show during 1968, complete with the deafening screams of fans. The album also includes their own version of \\"St John's Wood\\", a track Ford and Keays wrote for Brisbane band The Sect, who had released it as a single on Columbia during the year. ==Reception== The album's retrospective reviews have been mixed. Allmusic's Richie Unterberger said \\"It's a respectable but oddly schizophrenic effort, finding them searching for an identity with competent forays into hard rock, early progressive rock, and poppy folk-rock, with orchestral instrumental links between many of the tracks adding to the confusion (as there's no concept driving the LP).\\" When writing about the album in Freedom Train, Australian rock journalist Ian McFarlane was complimentary of several of the album's tracks, but said that \\"Linda, Linda\\" and \\"Piece Of Me\\" were \\"just plain bad\\". \\"Part of the problem lays in the fact that the band are concerned with making the obligatory profound musical statement (the first side had all the tracks segued into one another in the manner of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's, each linked by a short orchestral piece). As a result the album comes over as all solemn and self consciously arty, and is totally overblown. \\" ==Track listing== All songs written by Doug Ford and Jim Keays. == Personnel == ;The Masters Apprentices * Doug Ford – lead guitar, acoustic guitar, banjo, vocal * Jim Keays – vocal, percussion * Colin Burgess – drums, percussion, vocal * Glenn Wheatley – bass, tambourine, marraccas, vocals ;Other Musicians * The Chiffons \\\\- backing vocals on \\"5:10 Man\\" * Gavin Webb \\\\- bass guitar * Peter Tilbrook \\\\- guitars, bass ;Production Team * Producer – Howard Gable * Engineers \\\\- John Sayers, Roger Savage ;Artwork * Photography \\\\- Allan Kleinman * Cover Design \\\\- Whaite & Emery == References == ;General * Note: limited preview for on-line version. * * Note: Archived [on-line] copy has limited functionality. * Note: [on-line] version was established at White Room Electronic Publishing Pty Ltd in 2007 and was expanded from the 2002 edition.

Confiscation of property was defined as a kind of punishment while adopting the Criminal Code. However, this punishment has been abolished according to the Amending Law dated 7 March 2012. === Classification of Punishments === The Code classifies the punishments into basic and additional types.

The most severe punishment defined in the Criminal Code is life imprisonment. == Abolition of death penalty == The death penalty was legally abolished in Azerbaijan in 1998. Before the adoption of the Criminal Code in 1999, the Criminal Code of Azerbaijan USSR dated 8 December 1960 was in force. Article 22 of the Code of Azerbaijan USSR regulated the death penalty. The death penalty was abolished on February 10, 1998 by Law “On Amendments and Supplements to the Criminal, Criminal Procedure and Correctional Labor Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan concerning the abolition of the death penalty in the Republic of Azerbaijan.” Additionally, on January 22, 1998, Azerbaijan acceded to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty. Following the accession, on December 11, 1998, the National Assembly passed the Law regarding the accession to the Second Optional Protocol. Finally, Azerbaijan signed Protocol No. 6 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms concerning the Abolition of the Death Penalty on 25 January 2001, ratified it on April 15, 2002, and the Protocol entered into force in the country on 1 May 2002.

Pardon decrees are passed about certain individuals. == Criminal liability of legal persons == Only natural persons were subject to criminal liability when the Criminal Code was adopted on December 30, 1999. The Law on the Amendments to the Criminal Code dated 7 March 2012 introduced the criminal liability of legal persons. The Amendment law is not carried into force upon its adoption. The Article 2 of the Amendment Law states that the criminal liability of legal entities shall enact after the adoption of relevant amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Code on Execution of Sentences. Not all criminal sanctions under the Code may be applied to the legal persons. The Code defines certain circles of crimes (Articles 144-1, 144-2, 193-1, 194, 214, 214-1, 271–273, 308, 311, 312, 312-1, 313, 316-1 and 316-2) for which the legal persons may be subject to criminal liability. The Code specifies four kinds of punishment for the criminal acts of legal entities: # Fine # Special confiscation # Deprivation of right to engage in certain activities # Liquidation of legal entity == Criminal liability of minors == The Criminal Code describes “minors” who have reached the age of 14, but under the age of 18.

Under the Code, only 5 kinds of punishments may be appointed to minors: # penalty; # public works; # corrective works; # restriction of freedom; # imprisonment on a certain term. == Humanization of penal policy and punishment system == On February 10, 2017, the presidential decree has been approved about “Improving the penitentiary system, humanization of punishment policy and enhancing the alternative punishment and procedural coercive measures.” The Decree mainly dealt with: # the decriminalization of crimes, in particular, in economic sphere; # improvement of application grounds of existing alternative sentences to imprisonment; # development of grounds for non-custodial measures of restraint and sentences alternative to imprisonment. Following the Decree, the relative amendments to the Criminal Code were drafted, and submitted to the agenda of the National Assembly in October, 2017. On October 20, 2017, the National Assembly approved the amendments to the Criminal Code. The number of amendments amounted to 300. The amendments may be classified under 4 headings: # 15 actions have been removed from the Code, and therefore, decriminalized; # New kind of punishment- restriction of freedom has been introduced, and included in the sanctions of 152 Articles; # 4 crimes have been moved from the category of serious crimes to less serious crimes; # 18 crimes have been moved from the category of less serious crimes to crimes not causing great public danger.

This collection of hymns influenced the Cistercian Order's identity, since early abbots emphasized the compositions' musical quality. The hymnal developed in the course of the centuries. ==Origins== The first Cistercian Hymnal is dated approximately 1108, under the abbacy of Stephen Harding. He sent monks from his Abbey in Burgundy to Milan in order to copy the hymnal kept there. It was considered to be Saint Ambrose’s original, and Ambrosian hymns enjoyed great prestige in the Rule of St. Benedict since they were purported to have been in use at Milan since the 4th Century. The Cistercians, working from what they found in Milan, compiled a hymnal of 34 texts on 19 different melodies and used this for about twenty years.Chrysogonus Waddell, The Primitive Cistercian Breviary (Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, Preussischer Kulturbesitz, Ms. Lat. Oct. 402) with variants from the \\"Bernardine\\" Cistercian breviary (Fribourg 2007). At the end of the 1130s, after Stephen Harding’s death, the General Chapter entrusted Bernard of Clairvaux with the revision of the hymnal (and other parts of the Office) because they considered the first version to be repetitive, and the Ambrosian melodies grated on their Burgundian sensibilities. ==Revision under Bernard of Clairvaux== Respecting Abbot Stephen’s solemn warning and knowing that the Benedictine Rule mentions the Ambrosianum four times (for vigil RB 9:4, lauds RB 12:4/13:11 and vespers RB 17:8), Bernard included the major hymns from Milan. But for the small hours of terce, sext and none, the Rule uses the word hymnus; on this basis they added 21 non-Milanese texts to the hymnal for use at terce and compline. That made it possible to again sing the great classics such as Vexilla regis for Holy Week, Conditor alme siderum in Advent, or Quem terra pontus for the Marian feasts. Consciously following the same principles as the first generation, they kept the 34 primitive hymns, except for a few textual variants made for the sake of orthodoxy. For a greater variety of texts, they chose to use the principle of division, commonly practiced at the time: The hymn is sung in full at vespers, half is taken at vigil and the other at lauds.Alicia Scarcez, Liturgie et musique à l’Abbaye Cistercienne Notre-Dame de la fille Dieu (Romont). Histoire et catalogue des sources de sept siècles de vie chorale (Fribourg 2015). The melodies, on the other hand, were treated with less respect: most were modified, six simply eliminated, while others, mostly traditional, were added. Chrysogonus Waddell identifies seven new melodies, the last four of which are Cistercian creations: Optatis votis omnium, Almi prophet (used today for Aurea lucis), O quam glorifica, Deus tuorum militum, Mysterium ecclesiae, Iesu nostra redemptio and Iam Christus astra, all very expressive and of great emotional intensity.Chrysogonus Waddell, The Twelfth Century Cistercian Hymnal, 1984, vol. 1, p. 100. They ended up with a set of 55 texts for 37 melodies, which were faithfully passed down up to the Council of Trent, with some additions to mark new liturgical feasts: the solemnities of the Blessed Sacrament, Saint Bernard, the Visitation; the feasts of St. Anne, St. Joseph, and the Guardian Angels. ==Post-Tridentine Revisions== In 1656, following the demands of the Council of Trent, Abbot General Claude Vaussin published the Breviarium cistercium iuxta ritum romanum: except the Veni Creator, all the festive hymns of Terce and Compline were moved to the Major Hours. Otherwise, all the melodies of the hymnal were retained, and some texts written by Cistercians appear in the Office: for example the hymns composed at that time for the Feast of All Saints of the Order, or the poem Iesu dulcis memoria, written by an English Cistercian of the Twelfth century for the feast of the Holy Name of Jesus. The Ambrosian roots largely disappeared; after centuries of habit, the Cistercians were eager to preserve their textual versions of the hymns, even when scholarly research showed that the Cistercian texts did not always correspond with the Ambrosian originals.Conditor alme siderum instead of Creator alme siderum in Advent, Iam Christe Sol iustitiae instead of O sol salutis intimis in Lent, Ad cenam Agni instead of Ad regias dapes in Eastertide etc. or even different hymns for the special liturgical times.Summi largitor praemii in Lent, Chorus novae Ierusalem in Eastertide, Iesu nostra redemptio for the Feast of the Assumption etc. And whereas the modern Roman breviary had different hymns for every liturgical hour of every day, the Cistercians wanted to keep a single feria hymn for the entire week at vigil, another hymn for the entire week at lauds, and another at vespers. The only variation for them was between the seasons of winter and summer. ==After the Second Vatican Council== During the twentieth century, the liturgical renewal granted, among other things, a prominent place to the Ambrosian hymns in the Roman Breviary of 1974: for example, Veni Redemptor gentium, Iam surgit hora tertia, Hic est dies verus Dei. The concerns of the Council for textual criticism, historical truth, theological renewal, variety in the choice of texts, prompted the writers of Liturgia Horarum to revise the everyday texts or replace them with new texts, especially for saints' feast days. Cistercian communities have since been trying, according to their different sympathies, to achieve a harmonious synthesis between the preservation of Cistercian heritage and an adaptation to the needs of our time and the liturgy of the universal Church. ==Historical Editions Online== *Hymnarium cisterciense – Lichtenthal 28 (Mid 1200s) *Lichtenthal 28 et 32, c. 1250, Badische Landesbibliothek Karlsruhe *Sedletz Abbey (1700) *Unidentified Hymnal from the 17th or 18th Century *The Westmalle edition from 1952 ==Printed Editions in the 20th Century== * Hymnarium Cisterciense, issued under Abbot Augustine Marre, Rome, 1909. * Hymnarium Cisterciense, issued under Abbot Edmund Bernardini, Westmalle, 1941. * Hymnarium Cisterciense, issued under Abbot Matthew Quatember, Rome, 1952. ==References == Category:Cistercians Category:Catholic hymnals Category:Latin-language Christian hymns Category:Liturgy of the Hours ","title":"Cistercian Hymnal"},{"id":"56655799","text":"Self-portrait of painter Michelangelo Ricciolini Michelangelo Ricciolini (29 September 1654 – 10 December 1715) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period.

La promesse faite à ma soeur tells the story of Jean who returns to Rwanda to find his family, visit his twin brother in prison and look for answers to a multitude of questions. The story's protagonist was noted as having a past similar to Ndwaniye, with the text being described as \\"autofictional\\" and \\"implicitly autobiographical\\". Ndwaniye denies that the book is an autobiography, but does state that it features autobiographical elements, adding \\"I don't know any novelist who doesn't write about himself\\".

The mausoleum was discovered accidentally by the local population in 1979. The top tower of the tomb is destroyed, but the tomb is in satisfactory condition. ==Architectural features== The plan of the tomb is octagonal internally, and rectangular externally. Inside of the monument there is a low pavement that does not fit with the environment of the interior. The tomb of the Gilan mausoleum differs from the octagonal tombs of medieval architecture that are spread in Azerbaijan and neighboring countries. Center of cover of the Gilan mausoleum is supported by mushroom-shaped - expanding upward column in center of the interior. The column is also octagonal in the plan. General composition of Gilan mausoleum is in a style with the XII century mausoleums of Central Azerbaijan, especially the Red Dome mausoleum. The Gilan mausoleum was built of layers of broken rock fragments from surrounding rocks. Unlike its interior, exterior of the monument is neatly built. In the interior the ceiling and floors are completely, as well as spaces between stones of the wall and central support are plastered with white solution. Dark gray stone cuttings and roughness creates natural decorative order.

The corner of the body were covered with cylindrical brick columns. The bottom part of one of these columns remains. In decoration of the monument, blue glazed bricks were used as well. ==Research== There is no evidence of the time of the mausoleum construction. However, according to the architectural features mentioned above, it is possible to predict the period of the tomb of Gilan for architectural patterns and geometric patterns. The architectural style of the Gilan mausoleum is in same line with the architectural style of the churches built in the XII century in Central Azerbaijan. Gilan mausoleum can be dated back to the XII century as a result of absence of inscription. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 13th century Category:Islamic architecture Category:Mausoleums in Azerbaijan Category:Tourist attractions in Azerbaijan Category:Tourist attractions in Nakhchivan Category:Buildings and structures in Azerbaijan Category:Azerbaijani building and structure stubs ","title":"Gilan Mausoleum"},{"id":"56655925","text":"Fenglin may refer to the following places: __NOTOC__ ==China== ===Towns=== * Fenglin, Liling, a town in Liling City, Hunan * (丰林镇), a town in De'an County, Jiangxi ===Subdistricts and townships=== * Fenglin Subdistrict, a subdistrict of Xinhua County, Hunan * (枫林街道), a subdistrict of Yushan County, Jiangxi * (凤林街道), a subdistrict of Huancui District, Weihai, Shandong * (凤林乡), a township in Xuanhan County, Sichuan ==Taiwan== * Fenglin, Hualien, a township in central Hualien County ==See also== *Zhang Fenglin (born 10 March 1993), a Chinese swimmer *He Fenglin (1873–1935), a general of the Republic of China ","title":"Fenglin"},{"id":"56655968","text":"The Only Juan is a live album by drummer Jerry Granelli and keyboardist Jamie Saft which was recorded in Southport, Connecticut and released on the Love Slave label in 2002.Tzadik catalogue accessed January 9, 2014 ==Reception== In his review for Allmusic, David R.

Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Program (LEEP). Delhi. The government defines an MMLP as a freight-handling facility encompassing a minimum area of 100 acres (40.5 hectares), with various modes of transport access, and comprising mechanized warehouses, specialized storage solutions such as cold storage, facilities for mechanized material handling and inter-modal transfer container terminals, and bulk and break-bulk cargo terminals.Government of India, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. 2017. Draft Policy Document: Development of Multimodal Logistics Parks. Delhi. Logistics parks will further provide value-added services such as customs clearance with bonded storage yards, quarantine zones, testing facilities, and warehousing management services. Provisions will also be made for late-stage manufacturing activities such as kitting and final assembly, grading, sorting, labelling and packaging activities, re-working, and returns management (Arora, 2017). == Background == Keeping pace with India's rapid economic growth is the expansion of the country's logistics sector. The movement of freight in the country nearly doubled to around 2,300 billion ton-kilometers in fiscal year 2015 from 1,200 billion ton-kilometers in fiscal year 2008.A ton-kilometer is a unit of transport measurement equivalent to moving 1 ton of cargo a distance of 1 kilometer. The government expects freight movement in the country to continue its growth trajectory, with expected annual growth of 8%–10% over the next 10 years. The logistics sector as a whole, according to a study commissioned by MoRTH, is poised to expand at roughly 1.2 times the rate of India's gross domestic product growth through 2032, by which time it is expected to generate $360 billion in value added, up from $115 billion in 2017.H.Y. Jeong. 2017. What Multimodal Parks Can Do for Logistics in India. 27 September. https://blogs.adb.org/blog/what-multimodal-parks-can-do-logistics- india In 2016, India managed to improve its performance in the Logistics Performance Index (LPI), a ranking published by the World Bank to measure the logistics performance of countries.The World Bank. 2016. Connecting to Compete 2016: Trade Logistics in the Global Economy—The Logistics Performance Index and Its Indicators. Washington: The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank. India's LPI ranking rose to 35th in 2016, up from 46th in 2012. India's ranking, however, still lags behind some of its economic peers, including other Asian countries. The best logistics performer in Asia is Singapore, which was ranked 5th in 2016, followed by Hong Kong, China (9th); Japan (12th); the Republic of Korea (24th); and the People's Republic of China (PRC) (27th). Among the grouping of so-called BRICS—comprising Brazil, Russia, India, the PRC, and South Africa—aside from the PRC, South Africa also outperformed India in 2016 with a ranking of 20th (World Bank, 2016). However, there remain significant challenges to the sector's development. Logistics costs are high in India relative to costs in developed countries. Logistics costs as a percentage of gross domestic product stood at approximately 13% in 2015. In comparison, the logistics cost in developed countries is approximately 8%–10%. In more specific terms, India's road freight cost per ton-kilometer, adjusted for purchasing power parity, is ₹1.90 ($0.03), which is almost double that of the United States.Government of India, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. 2017. Concept Note: Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Program (LEEP)—Development of Multimodal Logistics Parks. Delhi. Higher logistics costs in India are primarily driven by five key factors. One is an unfavorable inter-modal mix, with 60% of freight movement skewed toward road transport despite the lower freight cost of rail transport. Second is India's inefficient fleet mix, which is characterized by smaller, inefficient trucks. Third is the underdeveloped material handling infrastructure that is characterized by a fragmented industry consisting largely of small, unorganized warehouses with limited mechanization. Fourth is the underdeveloped road infrastructure with a limited presence of 4- and 6-lane national highways. Lastly, the lack of a national logistics policy, institutional and regulatory bottlenecks, such as complicated documentation and procedures related to toll collections, adversely impact logistics costs in India. == Government policy initiatives == Along with its initial efforts, including the Make in India program and improvements in infrastructure, Government of India has made a number of decisions aimed at transforming the country's logistics sector. According to R. Goyal and S. Singh, adviser and young professional in the infrastructure–connectivity vertical section of NITI Aayog, the government is committed towards an integrated development of logistics sector through policy amendments, infrastructural development, tax reforms and technology adoption.R. Goyal and S. Singh. 2018. Indian Logistics Sector: On the Path of Transformation. Government of India, NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India). http://niti.gov.in/content/indian-logistics-sector-path-transformation These decisions include the nationwide imposition of a goods and services tax (GST), which came into effect 1 July 2017. This levy on the supply of goods and services, which replaced many indirect tax laws that previously existed in India, should expedite the conversion of informal logistics operations into formal ones and speed up freight movement at interstate borders as check posts are dismantled. The government further established a new logistics division in the Department of Commerce to coordinate integrated development of the sector via policy changes, improvement in existing procedures, identification of bottlenecks and gaps, and introduction of technology-based interventions. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry is aiming to develop an integrated logistics portal to connect buyers, logistics service providers and relevant government agencies. The logistics sector has been reclassified by the government with its inclusion under the Harmonized Master List of Infrastructure Subsector. With this, the logistics sector can access long-term credit, the approval process for the construction of MMLPs is simplified, and investments by debt and pension funds into recognized logistics projects would be encouraged by the regulated sector's market accountability (Goyal & Singh, 2018). == Purpose and design == The development of MMLPs is envisaged as a key policy measure to reduce logistics costs and help address three of the five constraining issues identified above. Specifically, these include an unfavorable modal mix, inefficient fleet mix, and underdeveloped material handling infrastructure. In July 2017, the Government of India approved a plan to build 35 MMLPs. State governments will provide the land needed for the projects, which will then be taken up through public–private partnerships. According to MoRTH, these MMLPs are expected to serve five key functions: freight aggregation and distribution, multi-modal freight transport, integrated storage and warehousing, information technology support, and value-added services. 600x600px == ADB role and support == In 2017, the Government of India launched a program to develop 35 multi-modal logistics parks across the country over the succeeding years and invited Asian Development Bank (ADB) to become a lead partner and provide the necessary support (Jeong, 2017). ADB then conducted a pre-feasibility study to assess the suitability of MMLP locations and identify the requisite infrastructure, connectivity, and regulatory reforms in two selected locations: Bengaluru in Karnataka and Guwahati in Assam. In this regard, the state government identified Dabaspete as the site for the park for Bengaluru in Karnataka. Bengaluru is ideally located for an MMLP in south India, with good connections via rail and road networks, and proximity to 17 million potential consumers in Chennai. ADB sees the Bengaluru MMLP as having the potential to become a model for other multimodal logistics parks in India. ADB also supported the pre-feasibility study for a MMLP in Jogighopa, Assam, which incorporates rail, road, and inland-waterway connectivity. The proposed site is located along National Waterway 2 and on the Indo-Bangladesh road route, making it suitable for the MMLP with multi modal access.K. Rathi. 2018.

The doctrine is a presumption \\"that women, especially Filipinos, would not admit that they have been abused unless that abuse had actually happened.\\" ==Etymology== The doctrine was named after María Clara from José Rizal's novel Noli Me Tángere. Clara is characterized as reserved and shy and was later considered an \\"ideal\\" role model for women in Filipino culture, although such notion was imposed by Spanish colonizers. This contrasted the ideal of women being more assertive, independent and courageous which dates back to the precolonial era. ==Legal history== The doctrine became a part of the Supreme Court of the Philippines' jurisprudence some time in 1960 following the People v. Taño case. The high court through Justice Alejo Labrador asserted a \\"well known fact\\" that women, especially Filipinos \\"would not admit that they have been abused unless that abuse had actually happened.\\" The court said that women's natural instinct is to protect their honor. The case involved three armed robbers who the court found liable for taking turns in raping a woman. About 58 years later since the doctrine entered the high court's jurisprudence, the Third Division of the Supreme Court reversed a ruling on January 17, 2018 by a Davao court on two people convicted of rape. The 2018 decision was released in late February. The case involved an alleged rape that happened in 2009 and the two accused were sentenced of reclusión perpetua, or forty years of imprisonment, in 2012. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in 2016. The court described the doctrine as causing a \\"travesty of justice\\" by putting the accused at an \\"unfair disadvantage\\", criticizing the doctrine for assuming that no Filipina woman of \\"decent repute\\" would falsely claim that she was abused. It urged for the acceptance of the \\"realities of a woman’s dynamic role\\" in Philippine society today so one can \\"evaluate the testimony of a private complainant of rape without gender bias or cultural misconception\\". It also stated that the discrepancies in the alleged victim's testimonies had cast doubt on whether the rape incident did or did not happen. This has led to concerns and speculations that the high court has abandoned the doctrine. The Gabriela Women's Party condemned the decision which it viewed made the Maria Clara doctrine invalid saying the ruling reversal will empower rapists and disagreed with the court's assessment of the societal status of women. On February 21, 2018, Supreme Court's spokesperson, Theodore Te has clarified that it was not the case since the high court can abandon a doctrine only during a full session. ==References== Category:Legal doctrines and principles Category:Philippine law Category:Women's rights in the Philippines Category:Rape in the Philippines ","title":"María Clara doctrine"},{"id":"56656190","text":"The Prairie is a 1947 American western film based on the novel The Prairie by James Fenimore Cooper. ==Cast== *Lenore Aubert as Ellen Wade *Alan Baxter as Paul Hover *Russ Vincent as Abiram White *Jack Mitchum as Asa Bush *Charles Evans as Ishmael Bush *Edna Holland as Esther Bush *Chief Thundercloud as Eagle Feather *Fred Coby as Abner Bush *Bill Murphy as Jess Bush *David Gerber as Gabe Bush *Don Lynch as Enoch Bush *George Morrell as Luke ==Production== The film was made by a new company, a co-operative venture between director Frank Wisbar, production manager Edward Finney and writer Arthur St Claire.

Spong grew up in Auckland, New Zealand, in a family of Balinese origin. She studied at Elam School of Fine Arts, graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 2001. Her first exhibitions were in not-for-profit spaces in New Zealand, Australia and Germany. In 2003 she had her first solo show, at the Anna Miles Gallery. Spong also holds a master's degree from Piet Zwart Institute in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Much of her work is in film and video, and reflects her training in classical ballet by focusing on dance and movement. In 2010 she presented a multi-dimensional film at Art Basel, a re-imagining of a lost ballet, George Balanchine’s The Song of the Nightingale. The ballet was originally choreographed in 1925 however all that remains are fragments of a film of it, the score, and photographs of the costumes. Spong also published a companion book to her film. == Women mystics == Spong's practice has been partly influenced by the works of medieval women mystics, which she first encountered while at Piet Zwart Institute in 2014. In an interview with Ocula in 2018, Spong mentioned the Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector, the Christian mystics Margery Kempe and Hildegard von Bingen, among others, as her inspirations. For Spong, who considers \\"art history' as largely the history of male looking—and predominantly white male looking\\", women mystics' writings led her to examine \\"the idea of breaking and entering the practice of a much-lauded male modernist painter and stealing a work, only to remake it into something of my own\\". == Recognition == In 2005 Spong's work Nightfall won the Contemporary Art Award at Waikato Museum. In 2012 her work Fanta Silver and Song was shortlisted for the Walters Prize. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1979 births Category:People from Auckland Category:Elam Art School alumni Category:21st-century New Zealand artists ","title":"Sriwhana Spong"},{"id":"56656257","text":"Agra catbellae is a species of carabid beetle.

He was Bishop of Digne in 1747, Bishop of Orléans in 1757, and made commander in the Order of the Holy Spirit in 1762. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Born into a family of old Provençal nobility, Louis-Sextius de Jarente de La Bruyère was the son of Geoffroy-Alexandre de Jarente (b. 1670) and his wife Marie-Elisabeth de Lallier de La Tour (b. 1680). ===Ecclesiastical career=== He was first canon of the Abbey of Saint-Victor de Marseille, where he knew the famous Belsunce, Bishop of Marseille. Bishop of Digne in 1747, he was named abbot of Saint-Honorat de Lérins in 1752. He was made Bishop of Orleans in 1757 and commander of the Order of the Holy Spirit in 1762. The following year, he is named Abbot of Saint Vincent. Well liked in court, he was appointed Minister of Profit Sheets and was responsible for distributing the revenues of the various abbeys, churches and their farmland from 1757 to 1771. During this period, 75 bishoprics and 337 abbeys are attributed, which alludes to the importance of this very coveted and lucrative position. The solicitors crowd around him.

The cities and villages under siege were Douma, Mesraba, Arbin, Hamouria, Saqba, Modira, Eftreis, Jisrin, as well as suburbs of Damascus Beit Sawa, Harasta, Zamalka, Ein Tarma, Hazeh and Kafr Batna. By 2016, around 400,000 people were trapped in an area just over 100 square kilometres in size, thus with a population density around 4,000 inhabitants/km2. United Nations Security Council Resolution 2401, adopted on 28 February 2018, called for a nationwide ceasefire in Syria for 30 days, including Eastern Ghouta, but the Syrian Army continued the offensive. In March 2018, the Syrian Army split the enclave into three parts, reaching an agreement with the rebels to withdraw to the north, to Idlib. This action displaced 105,000 people from the area. Douma was the only city left by the end of that month that was not under Syrian government control. On 8 April 2018, an agreement had been reached to evacuate remaining fighters and civilians from the last rebel-controlled pocket of Douma after an alleged chemical weapons attack that reportedly killed 70 people.Syrian opposition and Russia reach agreement over Douma Sky News, 08 April 2018 The Syrian Government denied responsibility, together with its ally involved in the war, Russia. More than 50,000 people, including fighters from the Jaish al-Islam and their families, have been evacuated out of the city as part of the deal, to northern Syria. Around 200 hostages loyal to the Syrian Government have reportedly been released by the rebels. Russian military police were deployed to Douma to enforce the agreement. Thousands of people were killed during this 5-year siege period. Numerous war crimes allegations were made during the siege, among others from the United Nations Human Rights Council, including the use of prohibited weapons, attacks on civilians, attacks against protected objects (schools, hospitals), starvation as a method of warfare and denial of medical evacuation. ==Background== Prior to the Syrian Civil War, the total population of Eastern Ghouta, a collection of farms and cities near Damascus, was around 1.5 million people. During the civil unrest that began in Syria in March 2011, some of the eastern Ghouta residents took part in the protests against the Syrian president Bashar Al- Assad and joined the Syrian rebels and expelled Syrian government forces by November 2012. In February 2013, Syrian rebels captured parts of the ring road on the edge of Damascus and entered the Jobar district of the capital city. Backed by Iran and Hezbollah, the Syrian Arab Army counterattacked and in April 2013 began a siege of Eastern Ghouta, which is just 15 km or a half hour's drive outside the capital Damascus. Cut off from the rest of the country, the population of Eastern Ghouta resorted to incineration of plastics to generate electricity. In early 2015, when the Syrian government cut off water supplies to Duma, the population adapted yet again and dug over 600 underground wells, using manual pumps to supply water. ==History== left In mid-2017, the main rebel faction in the area was Jaysh al-Islam, based in Douma (with an estimated 10-15,000 fighters in the region in early 2018Which rebel groups are fighting in Syria's eastern Ghouta?, Deutsche Welle, 20.02.2018). The second largest was Faylaq al-Rahman, an official affiliate of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), controlling much of central and western parts of Ghouta, including the Jobar and Ain Terma districts. Ahrar al-Sham (based in Harasta) and Tahrir al-Sham (HTS - controlling smaller districts such as Arbin, al-Ashari and Bait Naim, with an estimated strength in the area of 500 in February 2018Explainer: Who's fighting whom in Syria's Ghouta?, BBC Monitoring, 22 February 2018) had a far smaller presence.Wisam Franjieh In Besieged Eastern Ghouta, Rebel Infighting Increases Civilian Suffering, Syria Deeply, Aug. 1, 2017 In August 2013, the area was subjected to a chemical attack that killed hundreds of people, after which an agreement was made to ban chemical weapons in Syria. From 14 to 30 November 2017, the Russian-Syrian forces conducted more than 400 airstrikes in the area, hitting markets, schools and houses, and during some of those airstrikes allegedly using banned cluster munition. Despite efforts at turning Ghouta into a de-escalation zone, reports of bombs allegedly containing weaponised chlorine were registered again in early 2018. By January 2018, the area had only a single doctor per 3,600 people. Inter-rebel fighting in 2016 and once again in 2017 deteriorated the situation even further, showing a lack of unity among the rebel groups. left After a series of offensive operations launched by Syrian rebels against positions of the Syrian Arab Army in Harasta, a northeastern suburb of Damascus, and other locations in Ghouta, the Syrian Arab Army launched an operation to capture the rebel-held part of Ghouta in February 2018. The escalation of hostilities led to a United Nations Security Council meeting held on 24 February 2018, voting unanimously in favor of a 30-day cease-fire in Syria, and demanded immediate lifting of the siege of eastern Ghouta. In March 2018 the government offensive continued, being supported by the Russia both diplomatically and militarily.Amid Outcry Over Ghouta, Russia Vows To Back Assad Against 'Terror Threat' Radio Liberty, 28 February 2018.Assad vows to press Ghouta assault, as civilians flee government advances Reuters, 4 March 2018. On 11 March, the Syrian government took control over several areas and split the enclave into three pockets. These pockets included Duma and its northeastern outskirts, eastern Harasta, and Zamalka and surrounding area. In mid-late March after a series of negotiations, a deal was finally reached between the Syrian government and rebels that controlled parts of Eastern Ghouta. The deal involved a transfer of remaining rebel fighters from the areas of eastern Harasta, Zamalka and surrounding areas to the province of Idlib. 105,000 people were displaced by this evacuation from the area. By the end of March, Douma was the last pocket controlled by the rebels, the Jaish al-Islam fighters. For at least 10 days, there were minimal attacks on the rebel pocket of Douma as talks with the Jaish al-Islam continued. It was reported later that the Jaish al-Islam shelled residential areas in Damascus, causing casualties and material damage. By 6 April, talks had \\"faltered\\" between the two sides and the SAA renewed their offensive in response to the attack. The Jaish al-Islam denied responsibility. The rebel group had also reportedly refused to release detainees loyal to the Syrian government it was holding in Douma. The shelling on 8 April 2018, which left several civilians dead, drew allegations of chemical weapons use in Douma, though the UN could not verify the claim initially. ==Casualties== In February 2018, the Syrian Network for Human Rights, a UK-based non-governmental organization, founded in June 2011, published a report alleging that 12,783 civilians were killed in and around Eastern Ghouta from March 2011 to February 2018, including 1,463 children and 1,127 women. According to local hospital sources, which were cited in the French newspaper Le Monde, approximately 18,000 people were killed in the enclave by October 2017. Médecins Sans Frontières claimed that 70 percent of the enclave's population lived underground by November 2017 to escape bombardments. It also registered that, on average, 71 people were being killed daily since the 18 February 2018 offensive. It registered 1,005 people killed and 4,829 wounded in two weeks alone, between 18 February and 3 March 2018. ==War crimes allegations== === Government and allies === Numerous war crimes allegations were made during the battle, including the use of prohibited weapons, attacks on civilians, attacks against protected objects (schools, hospitals), starvation as a method of warfare and denial of medical evacuation. The siege by the Syrian government left the enclave under a humanitarian crisis, leading to famine and a lack of food. According to a 2014 United Nations report, the denial of food as a military strategy began during July and August 2013: Eastern Ghouta's crops and farms were shelled and burned. The report also alleged that Syrian forces \\"blocked access roads and systematically confiscated food, fuel and medicine at checkpoints\\". Some inhabitants had to rely on tree leaves as an alternative for vegetables to survive. The rebels established a web of tunnels to smuggle supplies, but they were destroyed by the government forces. left UNICEF Representatives said that at least 12% of children under 5 were acutely malnourished in the enclave in early 2018. On 27 October 2017, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, warned that \\"the deliberate starvation of civilians as a method of warfare constitutes a clear violation of international humanitarian law\\" and called for access of humanitarian workers to deliver aid to the people of Eastern Ghouta. The Syrian government restricted humanitarian aid to the enclave. On 30 October 2017, supplies were allowed to only 40,000 residents in the two cities of Kafr Batna and Saqba. One U.N. aid convoy arrived to Eastern Ghouta in February 2018, only after it had no access for 78 days. 2013 chemical attack The Syrian government also used chemical weapons against the armed groups in Eastern Ghouta in July 2017, specifically in Ein Tarma (1 July), Zamalka (2 July) and Jobar (6 July), and on Harasta on 18 November 2017. The agents included chlorine gas and organophosphorous pesticide. The Syrian government also used internationally banned incendiary weapons. In one such incident reported on 16 March 2018, at 11:48am, these weapons were dropped on Kafr Batna, killing at least 61 and wounding over 200 people. In December 2017, satellite imagery analysis by UN experts concluded that 3,853 buildings were destroyed, 5,141 severely damaged and 3,547 moderately damaged in the western parts of the enclave. The suburb of Jobar was 93% destroyed, Ein Tarma 73%, and Zamalka 59%. Hospitals in Eastern Ghouta were reported to have been shelled: Syrian army forces destroyed a field hospital in Al-Zemaniyah during a ground operation in July 2013, while shells landed near Al-Fatih hospital, where victims of the chemical attack were treated, forcing it to discharge its patients. Between 4 and 21 February 2018, the Syrian-Russian bombardments killed 346 people in Eastern Ghouta. Local counts reported 700 deaths in the three months up to mid-February 2018, many of them civilians.'It's not a war. It's a massacre': scores killed in Syrian enclave, Guardian, 20 February 2018 On 7 December 2017, the United Nations Senior Advisor Jan Egeland called east Ghouta the \\"epicenter of suffering\\". After the end of the siege, tens of thousands of people have been unlawfully interned by the Syrian Government forces in rural Damascus, including Ghouta. Amnesty International has called the \\"unlawful siege and unlawful killing of civilians, including the use of internationally banned cluster munitions\\" by the Syrian government and Russia a war crime and a crime against humanity. === Rebel groups === The United Nations also found the four largest rebel factions that were active in eastern Ghouta, namely Jaysh al-Islam, the Al-Rahman Legion, Ahrar al-Sham, and Tahrir al-Sham, guilty of crimes against humanity. They were known to arrest and torture members of religious minority groups, and regularly fired mortars and rockets from eastern Ghouta at government-held areas. These attacks aimed at spreading terror, and killed many civilians. ==Reactions== ===United Nations=== 2013: After the alleged chemical weapons attack in the Ghouta area of Damascus, the UN sent an inspection team to begin an investigation. The final report concluded that evidence suggests that \\"surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used in Ein Tarma, Moadamiyah and Zamalka\\". The Russian government dismissed the initial UN report after it was released, calling it \\"one-sided\\" and \\"distorted\\". 2018: After the start of the renewed SAA offensive called \\"Rif Dimashq offensive\\" during mid-February, the UN proposed a 30-day ceasefire aimed at allowing aid deliveries to enter besieged areas, as well as medical evacuations. This ceasefire was \\"ignored\\" as the SAA continued its advances into the rebel-controlled areas. It was reported that in the following month, some 25 food trucks were allowed in. Some argued that this was simply not enough for the people living in war-torn areas. ===USA, France, UK=== The governments of the United States, United Kingdom and France accused the Syrian government of a chemical attack against the population of Douma on April 2018. As a consequence, the three states conducted a series of airstrikes targeting sites associated with Syria's chemical weapons capabilities in Damascus and Homs on 14 April 2018. The next day, Russia tried to pass a resolution condemning these US-UK-French airstrikes, but it was not adopted by the U.N. Security Council. ==Gallery== White Helmets Arbin 6-2-2018.jpgWhite Helmets looking for survivors in Arbin Ghouta 22-2-2018 (2).jpgAerial bombardments of East Ghouta in February 2018 Ghouta Arbin 27-2-2018 (4).jpgRuins in Arbin on 27 February 2018 Ghouta Arbin 27-2-2018 (2).jpgA family in Ghouta on 28 February 2018 Ghouta Arbin 27-2-2018 (1).jpgStreets of Arbin in 2018 ==References== ==External links== *Syria: Left to Die Under Siege Amnesty International report in 2015 Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War in 2013 Category:Rif Dimashq Governorate in the Syrian Civil War Category:Crimes against humanity Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Syrian government Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving Hezbollah Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Free Syrian Army Category:Sieges of the Syrian Civil War Category:Syrian Civil War crimes Category:Conflicts in 2013 Category:Conflicts in 2014 Category:Conflicts in 2015 Category:Conflicts in 2016 Category:Conflicts in 2017 Category:Conflicts in 2018 Category:Russian war crimes Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving chemical weapons ","title":"Siege of Eastern Ghouta"},{"id":"56656397","text":"Northern Islands High School (NIHS) is a secondary school in Wotje, Marshall Islands.

He is Professor of Archaeological Science at the University of Oxford, UK, best known for his work in dating the Neanderthal extinction and the arrival of modern humans in Europe. == Early life and education == Higham grew up in Dunedin, New Zealand, the eldest of four children of Polly and Charles Higham; his father is an archaeologist specialising in the prehistory of southeast Asia. He studied Archaeology at the University of Otago, receiving a BA Honours degree in 1988 and a master's degree in 1990. Higham became interested in radiocarbon dating and moved to the University of Waikato where, in 1993, obtained a doctorate degree. == Career and research == Higham worked as the Deputy Director of the radiocarbon dating laboratory at Waikato, before joining the Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art, at the University of Oxford in 2001. He is currently the Director of the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit (ORAU) and a Fellow of Keble College. Higham's work focuses on the development and reliable application of radiocarbon dating in archaeology. His main interests lie in the refinement of the protocols used for the purification of ancient samples prior to radiocarbon dating. His early work focused on the peopling of New Zealand. Upon arrival in Oxford, Higham became involved in testing and improving the ultrafiltration method for dating archaeological bones. In 2002, Higham met British archaeologist Roger Jacobi and the two worked closely together on the dating of several key Palaeolithic sites from the British Isles, until Jacobi's death in 2009. The most notable result of this work was the redating of the Red Lady of Paviland, an iconic early modern human from Britain. Later, Higham reported an age estimate for the Kents Cavern maxilla from Devon, England, the earliest modern human fossil in northwestern Europe. Since 2006, Higham and his team at Oxford have worked on defining the timing of Neanderthal replacement by anatomically modern humans in western Eurasia and quantifying the overlap between the two human groups. In 2014, results of this work reported in Nature placed Neanderthal extinction at around 41000–39000 years ago, and suggested a Neanderthal-modern human overlap of 3000–5000 years in Europe. In 2013, funded by the European Research Council, Higham launched the \\"PalaeoChron\\" Project that focuses on the dating of late Neanderthals, early modern humans and Denisovans at hundreds of sites across northern Eurasia. Higham has featured in CNN's series Finding Jesus. In 2018, Higham was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand. == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:New Zealand archaeologists Category:University of Otago alumni Category:University of Waikato alumni Category:University of Waikato faculty Category:Fellows of Keble College, Oxford Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of New Zealand ","title":"Thomas Higham"},{"id":"56656432","text":"Lieutenant General Torsten Reinhold Engberg (28May 1934 - 7February 2018) was a senior Swedish Coastal Artillery officer.

He is the founder of Erber KG, later known as Biomin GmbH; the animal health and nutrition company specializes in feed additives and premixes. It continues to be family-owned and operated. == Early life and education == Erich Erber was born on April 30, 1953 in Sankt Pölten, the capital of the state of Lower Austria, and was raised on a small farm in the Mostviertel region. He studied agriculture at the Francisco Josephinum Secondary College and Research Institute, obtaining the equivalent of a high school diploma in 1975. From 1976-1978, Erich Erber worked as an Operations assistant at Kettaneh Pt Ltd, located in Accra, Ghana. He was involved in the production of construction materials. At the same time, he acquired expertise in the field of international trade while majoring in export sales at the Vienna University of Economics and Business from 1978-1980. Concurrently, he began to study macroeconomics at the University of Vienna (without obtaining a degree). From 1980 - 1982, he was the Head of Sales at Chemagrar, a subsidiary of Werfft Chemie, which specializes in feed additives for the Central European compound feed industry. He received his MBA, with a focus on strategic marketing, from the University of Hull in Singapore. == Biomin == In 1983, Erich Erber and Margarete Erber founded Biomin GmbH together in Pottenbrunn, Lower Austria. The company's first products were developed in a former slaughterhouse. It continues to be family-owned and operated. Biomin GmbH acquired Interpremix, a company with its own tank mixer and the product Antitox Plus, in 1985. Following extensive research, the product was developed further under the name Mycofix and subsequently became a global benchmark product. One year later, it was exported to Asia for the first time. In 1988, Biomin GmbH concluded a research agreement with the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. Its goal was to continue to improve Antitox Plus's effectiveness in deactivating a wide variety of mycotoxins. == Erber Group == In 1992, Erich Erber founded Biomin's first subsidiary with a local partner in Kuala Lumpur. In later years, additional subsidiaries were created abroad: examples include the first Biomin production site in Vietnam in 1995 and regional headquarters which opened in Singapore and the U.S. in 1997. In 1996, Erber AG was also founded as an unlisted public company; it was a holding company for the two group members at the time as well as for all future organizations. By creating an interdisciplinary in-house research team, Erich Erber established another forward-thinking milestone. Research and development have been part of Biomin's key cornerstones ever since. The next step on his path to success took place when he acquired Romer Labs Missouri in 1999. In doing so, he was able to develop a business segment that was completely new: diagnostics in the field of feed and food safety. Romer Labs thus became the second division of Erber Group. In 2004, Erich Erber created the Biomin World Nutrition Forum, with the goal of actively involving customers and promoting trust in the organization. Scientists, customers and managers come together to exchange ideas regarding current developments. It takes place once every two years, with approximately 800 participants (event organizers, keynote speakers, etc.). In 2005, Mr. Erber took additional steps to ensure the group's development by opening the first Biomin Center of Applied Animal Nutrition. Erber Group's third and fourth divisions joined in 2007: Sanphar, a Brazilian company specializing in animal health, and EFB. EFB, together with the subsidiary Bio-ferm, focuses on innovative biotechnological pesticides and their research, international registration and marketing. The construction of a state-of-the-art yeast fermentation facility in Brazil has been the group's largest investment thus far; it became operational in 2010. This site makes direct shipments to regional markets possible. Erber Group sees itself as an organization of experts and is the global market leader in mycotoxin risk management, its original core business. The high-performance research and development within the group provides a basis for the development of customer- oriented and innovative solutions. This is made possible, in particular, by cooperating with renowned universities and research centers on various projects. Erber Group is now one of the global leaders in the field of food and feed safety. Headquartered in Getzersdorf, Lower Austria, it specializes in natural feed additives, feed and food analyses as well as plant protection.

Nesbitt met Scott while both were serving time in Pentridge Prison. Growing up in a poor household with an abusive father, Nesbitt turned to crime at a young age and had been in and out of jail for petty theft since he was a teenager. Little is known about their relationship in Pentridge except that a day was added to Nesbitt’s sentence for ‘taking tea to Prisoner Scott’. Scott was released from Pentridge after serving less than 7 years, his sentence being reduced from 10 for good behaviour. Nesbitt, who had been released a year before, waited for him at the gates. Together they moved into a rundown boarding house in Fitzroy. == The Wantabadgery Bushrangers == Late October 1879 Andrew George Scott lead a group of men out of Melbourne looking for work. This group included Nesbitt, 19-year-old Frank Johns, 22-year-old ex-con Thomas Rogan and young 15-year-old Augustus Warnecke. Latter 18-year-old Graham Bennet joined their group. When no work was to be found hunger and desperation got the better of them and they held up Wantabadgery Station earning them the reputation as the Wantabadgery Bushrangers. While they were holed up in the farmhouse of Edmund McGlede the police pursued them, leading to a gunfight. During the gunfight Nesbitt was shot in the head. It was reported that Scott pulled Nesbitt into his arms and held him as he died, sobbing uncontrollably. Augustus Warnecke also died in the gunfight at the McGlede farm. One police officer, Constable Bowen was mortally wounded in the gunfight; it is unknown who shot him but forensic evidence suggests it was not Scott or Nesbitt. == References == Category:Bushrangers Category:1858 births Category:1879 deaths ","title":"James Nesbitt (bushranger)"},{"id":"56656788","text":"Billy McCarthy is an Irish hurler who plays as a forward for the Tipperary senior team.

The story of the film begins with a few bomb blasts in Mumbai. A burkha clad lady, Yasmin aged in between 22/23 years took a taxi from Zaveri Bazaar she was going to VT station. There were ambulances, police vehicles on the way. It was a scary afternoon. The taxi suddenly stopped, it was a comparatively lonely area. The taxi driver refused to give any reason but firmly said that he would not go towards VT. Yasmin was trying to get a lift but the vehicles didn’t stop. After a few minutes a car stopped and agreed to give her a lift. The person inside introduced himself as Abir Chatterjee; he was also going to VT station. On the way to VT Yasmin had a phone conversation with her father whom we found to be a half paralysed old man in his Kolkata house. She assured her father, who was watching TV news regarding Bomb blasts in Mumbai. The car reached VT stn, Yasmin got down, thanked Abir. She rushed to the station. Going inside the station she found that the Duronto Express was late for 2hrs, so she went to upper class waiting room. Yasmin & Abir met again in the compartment, they both were going to Howrah. Kabir flirts with Yasmin though she is irritated, shares food with her and then enquires about her. A matter of courtesy, Yasmin decides to ask more about Abir. Much to her shock, he reveals a live video of her father held hostage and a video of her cousin sister, Ruksana. He threatens to kill them if she doesn't reveal the location of Imtiaz. Her attempts to contact a few friends fail and she is asked to reveal his location before the train reach Howrah. The next day he reveals that he is a jihadi and a majority of the passengers in their compartment are his aides. He adds that Imtiaz was a jihadi who foiled their attempts back in 2012 by informing the police. They badly want to murder the traitor. This changes Yasmin's attitude who in turn narrates another version of his story according to which it was the owner of the house who betrayed the terrorists; Imtiaz was killed by the special task force and she herself is a jihadi. Abir ,who in the meanwhile has changed his name to Altar Kabir which he claims to be his original name, refuses to believe her as the photos of those dead jihadis and the rooms in which they lived had a different description from what she told. She is irritated by his behaviour and contacts the Syed, Indian Mujahideen third-in-command and gives information about Kabir through his unique code number(a unique code to identify the jihadis). Parallel to this a few police officers struggling to decode those codes manage to trace Syed through Yasmin's phone call and arrest him. Kabir reveals himself to be a special task officer assigned to bring down the Indian Mujahideen gang. Yasmin says that there is no use of arresting her as the Indian police will be forced to hand over her to their head gang in exchange of a few hostages. Kabir understanding the meaning of her statement kills her and shoot his hand as if to show that he killed her while trying to defend himself from her. ==Cast == * Dev as DSP Altaf Kabir Kapoor(STF Officer)/Abir Chatterjee * Rukmini Maitra as Yasmin Khatun * Priyanka Sarkar as Damayanti Patekar (STF Officer) * Shataf Figar as Parvez * Krishnendu Dewanji as Ashfaq * Pradip Mukhopadhyay * Arno Mukhopadhyay as Imtiaz * Kamaleshwar Mukherjee as Tamal Da * Ambarish Bhattacharya as Tanmay * Barun Chanda as Indian Mujahideen third-in-command, Syed Abdul Rahim Tunda * Srijit Mukherjee (cameo appearance) * Joy Badlani as local don ==Soundtrack== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2018 films Category:2010s Bengali-language films Category:2018 action thriller films Category:Indian films Category:Indian action thriller films Category:Films about terrorism in India Category:Films produced by Dev (Bengali actor) Category:Films directed by Aniket Chattopadhyay ","title":"Kabir (film)"},{"id":"56656968","text":"Facade Interior.

Although there is no direct evidence for Sounion, Xerxes certainly had the temple of Athena and everything else on the Acropolis of Athens, razed as punishment for the Athenians' defiance.Herodotus, Histories VIII.53. After they defeated Xerxes in the naval Battle of Salamis, the Athenians placed an entire captured enemy trireme (warship with three banks of oars) at Sounion as a trophy dedicated to Poseidon.Herodotus, Histories, VIII.121. The temple of Poseidon at Sounion was constructed in 444–440 BC. This was during the ascendancy of the Athenian statesman Pericles, who also rebuilt the Parthenon in Athens. It was built on the ruins of a temple dating from the Archaic period. Strabo noted: :\\"Geraistos [in Euboia] . . . is conveniently situated for those who are sailing across from Asia to Attica, since it comes near to Sounion. It has a temple of Poseidon, the most notable of those in that part of the world, and also a noteworthy settlement.\\"Strabo, Geography 10. 1. 7 ==Architecture== Floor plan The design of the peripteros temple is a typical hexastyle, i.e.,, it had a front portico with six Doric columns.Perseus Digital Library @ www.perseus.tufts.edu (search term: 'Sounion'). 16 out of the 38 columns are standing today (of which four were re-erected in the 20th century). The temple closely resembles the contemporary and well-preserved Temple of Hephaestus beneath the Acropolis, which may have been designed by the same architect. The Poseidon building was rectangular, with a colonnade on all four sides encompassing the peristasis. The total number of original columns of the outer colonnade was 34, of which 15 still stand today (with the addition of 1 out of 4 columns of the inner naos). The columns are of the Doric Order. They were made of white marble quarried locally at Laureotic Olympus. They were 6.10 m (20 ft) tall, with a diameter of 1 m (3.1 ft) at the base and 79 cm (31 inches) at the top.Perseus Digital Library, for search term 'Sounion At the centre of the temple, beyond the colonnade, there would have been the hall of worship (naos), a windowless rectangular room, similar to the partly intact hall at the Temple of Hephaestus.

Efforts at restoring and preserving the remains of the Poseidon temple began in 1875. The monument's present state is due to the work performed in the 1950s by the Greek Archaeological Service, led by Anastasios Orlandos.

Its aims are \\"to promote, encourage and support the study of the history of medicine\\", with a particular interest in Scottish Medicine. Founded at a time when the study of history of medicine was dominated by medical doctors, the society aimed, from the start, to have a broad based membership, to interest others in the subject. Historians, librarians, scientists, pharmacists and others have all played an active role in its activities, and representatives from these professions have become presidents. ==Origins== The Society was founded by Douglas Guthrie, an Edinburgh ENT surgeon who became a medical historian. Early in 1948 Guthrie wrote to a number of individuals throughout Scotland inviting them to a meeting to discuss the formation of a Scottish history of medicine society. The meeting was held in the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh on 23 April 1948. Those present agreed with Guthrie’s suggestion that it be called the Scottish Society of the History of Medicine and further agreed to adopt the constitution which he had prepared. Office bearers were appointed with Guthrie elected as the first president.Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Douglas Guthrie archive GD/15/17/1. From the outset the Society aimed to be broad based and the initial members included medical doctors, dentists, pharmacists and librarians. Among the first papers heard at the society was one on quarantine from plague and another on the periodic devastation of Scotland by famines and epidemics. At the end of the first year it was decided that meetings should be held in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and St Andrews. In addition there would be ‘outings to places of interest to medical historians', the first of which , on 18 June 1949, was to Lanark and Hamilton places associated with William Smellie and William Cullen. This was followed by a visit to the Hunter House Museum at Long Calderwood, birthplace of the brothers John and William Hunter. Subsequent outings included visits to Torphichen Preceptory (1950), Greyfriars Churchyard (1954), Liddesdale Heritage Centre, Newcastleton. (1955), the John Leyden Memorial at Denholm (1964) and the David Livingstone Centre, Blantyre (1973). By the end of the second year the membership had exceeded 100 and by 1978 exceeded 150. In 1965 the society was one of four founder societies of the British Society for the History of Medicine, to which it remains affiliated.Dr Douglas Guthrie A distinguished medical historian (Obituaries) The Times Tuesday, 10 June 1975; pg. 18; Issue 59418; col F> ==Activities== The Society holds an autumn meeting in Edinburgh, a spring meeting in Glasgow and a summer meeting at a chosen venue elsewhere in Scotland. In addition an annual lecture and dinner in honour of Dr Haldane Tait, a former President and long-serving Secretary to the Society, is held in the summer, usually in Edinburgh. Since the inaugural meeting in 1948, papers given to the society have been published as the Report of Proceedings of the Scottish Society of the History of Medicine. These are now freely available online. The Society has been registered as a charity in Scotland (SC008621) since 1973. The Society's archives (1949–1995) are held at University of St Andrews Special Collections (Reference GB 227 msdep87) and the archives of the Douglas Guthrie Trust are held at the archive of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. ==Douglas Guthrie Trust== Established as a result of a bequest from Douglas Guthrie, the Trust is administered by the SSHM whose officers act as trustees.

It was edited by Justin Hall and published by Fantagraphics Books on August 1, 2012. The anthology traces the turning points in the history of LGBT comics over the 40-year period, including events such as the AIDS crisis. It features work from established cartoonists such as Alison Bechdel, Howard Cruse, Roberta Gregory, Eric Shanower, and Paige Braddock, as well as then-up-and-coming cartoonists including Ellen Forney, Erika Moen, and Ariel Schrag. ==Development== Editor Justin Hall was inspired to put together the anthology after curating a show of LGBT comics at the Cartoon Art Museum for the San Francisco Pride in 2006. According to Hall, despite the prevalence of gay male erotica in the underground comics scene since the late 1950s, LGBT literary comics become a sub-genre only after the 1969 Stonewall riots, when a \\"sense of community\\" emerged and the queer underground comix scene began to thrive in San Francisco. With this anthology, Hall wanted to document, preserve and celebrate the \\"hidden history\\" of queer comics. Hall selected the works to include based on, in decreasing order of importance, \\"artistic merit, historic merit and representational merit\\". He explained that: \\"First and foremost, No Straight Lines should be a tremendously good read. After that, it should leave the reader with a better understanding of the complex history and diversity of LGBTQ comics\\". ==Themes== To put the material into an \\"historical and cultural context\\", the anthology is organized into three sections. The first section, \\"Comics Come Out: Gay Gag Strips, Underground Comix, and Lesbian Literati\\", covers the late-1960s and 1970s. It collects gag cartoons from early gay newspapers and magazines that emerged after the Stonewall riots, as well as works from the feminist and lesbian-oriented underground comix, concluding with the creation of the anthology series Gay Comix. This section includes Trina Robbins' Sandy Comes Out, which according to Hall was the first literary comic that \\"offered gay people a representation of themselves that validated, as opposed to degraded, their experience.\\" The second section, \\"File Under Queer: Comix to Comics, Punk Zines, and Art During the Plague\\", covers the 1980s and 1990s time period, focusing on the artistic responses to the AIDS crisis, as well as the emergence of punk zines and mini-comics. The third section, \\"A New Millenium: Trans Creators, Webcomics, and Stepping Out of the Ghetto,\\" features work from the increasing number of transgender cartoonists, and details the shift in queer comics from queer comics media towards the internet and crossing over into the mainstream. ==Reception== Publishers Weekly noted that many of the comics \\"hit on concerns and experiences that cut to the heart of the human soul, not just the gay one\\", and concluded that Hall was \\"quite successful\\" at gearing the anthology towards a wider audience beyond the LGBT community, \\"but without softening the edges that define the genre\\". Writing for The New York Times Book Review, Glen Weldon felt that \\"the decision to restrict selections to the Western world is disappointing but understandable\\", and concluded that No Straight Lines was a \\"useful, combative and frequently moving chronicle of a culture in perpetual transition\\". Lee Mandelo of Tor.com wrote that the book was \\"a great read, not just for the stories alone but for what they represent together: a history, a genealogy, or LGBTQ writers and artists telling stories that reflect their experiences and knowledge of the world\\". Writing for The American Library Association's Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table, Talia Earle called the book \\"absolutely fascinating, especially in giving the reader a wide variety of topics impacting the GLBT community\\". Cathy Camper of the Lambda Literary Foundation praised Hall for taking on the \\"mountainous\\" task of compiling a historical collection of queer comics, concluding that he \\"delivered a classic compilation of stories that promises readers of comics everywhere something wonderful to read\\". No Straight Lines was nominated for the 2013 Eisner Award for Best Anthology. ==Documentary Film== A feature-length documentary film inspired by the book is currently in production.

Her first solo show, Ontology at 36 (1981), however, marked a shift that would continue, toward experimentation with mixed materials, representational elements such as the figure, landscape or symbolic imagery, and more emphatic themes. The \\"Morphogenic Fields\\" series (1983)—its title referencing the aura of radiation that emanates from living beings—features the female form, rendered in soul- baring, tenuous outline. Shaffer uses a shifting figure/ground relationship calling to mind the flow of energy in, out and through us, depicting women enveloped within fields of gestural DNA-like marks or packed with radiating color strokes like bursts of energy set against darker voids. Evoking both the personal and universal, these works address women's identity on the threshold of exploring, and perhaps realizing, the possibilities for fulfillment opened up by feminism. The monumental paintings of Shaffer's Greenhouse Effect exhibition (1991) demonstrate a shift in theme, as she employed minimal color- fields to suggest haunted landscapes affected by eco-devastation.McCracken, David. (May 24, 1991). Review, Chicago Tribune, Sect. 7, p. 56. Describing them, critic Michelle Grabner wrote, \\"This ecological commentary combined with Shaffer's choice of scale, interest in color, and seductive mark making evokes the ‘tainted sublime.'\\" In her \\"Healing Plants\\" works (1994–Present), in works such as Aloe, Lungwort or Gingko (1994), Shaffer combines \\"careful study, connection and fine draftsmanship\\" to create \\"portraits\\" of plants that echo Matisse cutouts, and which convey and pay tribute to the endurance, healing powers, and necessity of plants to human survival. Shaffer's recent paintings, Passenger Pigeons, reflect on the extinction of wildlife species in the modern era. === Performance & Ritual Works === In 1980, inspired by her interest in Edgar Cayce, Mircea Eliade and Michael Harner, and prompted by ecological concerns shared with her collaborator Othello Anderson, Shaffer began enacting self-designed shamanistic rituals as a form of spiritual intervention.Griffin, David Ray. Sacred Interconnections: Postmodern Spirituality, Political Economy, and Art, New York: SUNY Series in Constructive Postmodern Thought, 1991. Anderson documented the rituals in sequential photographs that were later exhibited with elements (ceremonial garments and objects) from the performances.Museum of Contemporary Art, ed. Lynne Warren.

The Plutei of Theodota are named after her. A biography of her appears in Book 5 of Paul the Deacon's Historia Langobardorum. This calls her \\"a girl from a most noble Roman [ie Byzantine, probably Ravennese Lida Capo, Commento in Paolo Diacono, Storia dei Longobardi, pp. 556-557.] family\\". She was noticed by Cunipert's wife Ermelinda in the baths which had been built by Damian of Pavia - the Lombard kings at the end of the 7th century still followed a Byzantine style of living, including bathing. Ermelinda described Theodota's beauty, especially her elegant and ornate long blonde hair. Cunipert did not indicate any explicit interest in the girl but instead immediately organised a hunt outside Pavia and ordered Ermelinda to take part in it with him. However, when night fell Cunipert secretly returned to the city and slept with Theodota - Paul initially states that Cunipert \\"cum ea concubit\\" (went to bed with her), leaving it unclear whether it was consensual or not, but later on in Book 5 (Chapter 37) writes \\"de stupro Theodotae\\" (about the rape of Theodota). Damian concludes by writing that Cunipert later placed Theodota in a nunnery in Pavia \\"that was named after her\\", meaning Santa Maria alla Pusterla, later renamed Santa Maria Teodote. ==References== category:7th-century Lombard people category:People from Ravenna Category:7th-century Italian women Category:7th-century Byzantine people Category:7th-century Byzantine women ","title":"Theodota"},{"id":"56657621","text":"Hans-Jörg Rheinberger (born 12 January 1946) is an historian of science who comes from Liechtenstein. He was director of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin from 1997 to 2014. His focus areas within the history of science are the history and epistemology of the experiment, and further the history of molecular biology and protein biosynthesis. Additionally he writes and publicizes essays and poems.Edition Isele: Rheinberger, Hans Jörg, visited 11. Januar 2016. == Life == Hans-Jörg Rheinberger was born in Grabs, Switzerland on 12 January 1946. He is the great-grandnephew of the composer Josef Rheinberger and grandchild of the artist and architect . He studied philosophy, linguistics and biology at the University of Tübingen, the Free University of Berlin and the Technical University of Berlin. After completing his magister degree in philosophy (1973) he earned his doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) in 1982 with a dissertation concerned with protein biosynthesis and habilitated 1987 in molecular biology at the FU Berlin. From 1982 until 1990 Rheinberger worked as research assistant and research group superintendent at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin-Dahlem. The following two years he spend as visiting professor at the universities of Salzburg and Innsbruck. After a sabbatical at Stanford University (1989/90 within the program \\"History of Science\\"), he was senior lecturer at the Institute for the History of Medicine and Science of the University of Lübeck from 1990 until 1994. Subsequently, Rheinberger was associate professor at the University of Salzburg until 1996.MPI-Website Since 1996 Rheinberger is scientific member of the Max Planck Society and has been director at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science from 1997 until 2014. Since then he is Emeritus scientific member of the institute. From 1993 until 1994 he has been fellow at the Berlin Institute for Advanced Study. In 2000 Rheinberger taught in the capacity of visiting scholar at the Collegium Helveticum of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, 2006 at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and 2016 at the Northwestern University in Evaston. He is honorary professor at the TU Berlin, member of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, as well as the P.E.N.-Club Liechtenstein. == Research == Rheinbergers primary field of activity within the history of science is the epistemologcal exploration of the experiment and of the research practices of the natural sciences with focus on the biology of the 19th and 20th century. In his studies he describes \\"experimental systems\\" to be the driving forces within the development of the modern natural sciences.Wissenswerkstatt – „Experimentalsysteme“ He developed his corpus of theoratical categories in dependence to the philosophy of Jacques Derrida and draws many inspirations form the works of Gaston Bachelard. His main focus is aimed at the \\"structures of the experiment\\", which he deciphers by applying reconstructive analysis to the work in laboratories concerned with biological research. In contrast to the common self-image the researching science themselves hold Rheinberger shows that planning and control is less defining the every-day-business of research than improvisation and chance. According to Rheinberger promising \\"experimental systems\\" are distinguished by the amount of space the grant an \\"epistemic thing\\" to unfold itself. This is, as he puts it, imperative to \\"deal prodictively the unknown\\". == The \\"epistemic thing\\" == The \\"epistemic thing\\" is the object of investigation during the research process, which can develop to become a \\"technical object\\" over the course of the investigation, therefore becoming something that can be used to research other \\"epistemic things\\". The boundary between \\"epistemic thing\\" and \\"technical object\\" is not static and identifying something as either or not permanent. Therefore, insight is neither inevitable nor complete. Rheinberger's experiences as a molecular biologist has brought the \\"materiality of the natural sciences\\" into the focus of the history of science. == Awards and distinctions == * 1998: Honorary Professor at the Technischen Universität Berlin * 2006: Honorary doctorate at the ETH ZürichNorbert Staub: ETH-Tag 2006: Ambition und Wandlungsfreude, ETH Life, Website of the ETH Zürich, 20.

She was imprisoned for eight months for breaking and entering, and attempted arson, where she went on hunger strike. == Early life == Born in Denistoun, Glasgow, Elizabeth Dorothea Lyness graduated from medicine from the University of Glasgow in 1894, and worked at the Royal Samaritan Hospital for Women in Glasgow. She married Reverend William Chalmers Smith, minister of Calton Church, Glasgow in 1901. They had six children born between 1900 and 1911. == Political Activity == Chalmers Smith joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1912, but her enthusiasm for extreme militancy was not welcomed by her husband, who believed adamantly that a woman's place was in the home. WSPU poster 1914 - Museum of London Chalmers Smith, alongside artist Ethel Moorhead, attempted to set fire to a house at 6 Park Gardens in Glasgow on 23 July 1913. They were caught red-handed by multiple witnesses. In one room firefighters found matches, firelighters, six flasks of paraffin, candles, and a postcard bearing the words: 'A protest against Mrs Pankhurst's re-arrest'. The case was tried in the High Court at Jail Square and hundreds of Suffragettes attended the trial. Chalmers Smith and Moorhead both conducted their own defence and refused to plead. Moorhead interrupted the Judge saying \\"We do not want to hear any more. We refused to listen to you. Please sentence us.\\" When both women were sentenced to eight-months imprisonment, the women rose from all sections of the court and protested, crying out \\"Pitt Street, Pitt Street\\" whilst others starting throwing apples at the Judge and counsel. Both women went on hunger strike immediately. When they became physically weak they were released from prison under the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act , known as the Cat and Mouse Act, which was introduced in April 1913, and allowed for the re-arrest of prisoners once their health improved. Detectives were posted on the door of her house to make sure that she did not escape. She managed to escape on occasion by dressing up in her younger sister's school uniform. Chalmers Smith had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU. == Later life == Chalmers Smith and her husband divorced after the First World War, it is said due to pressure from the Kirk Session (parish group) at a time that it was difficult for a Church of Scotland minister to do so. She left with her three daughters, but she was not allowed to see her three sons again. After the Great War, Chalmers Smith worked in the newly established child welfare clinics in Glasgow. She did pioneering work in child-care and raised her daughters to be doctors. She died in 1944, and her silver WSPU Hunger Strike medal was donated to the People's Palace by one of her daughters. These medals were first presented by the WSPU at a ceremony in August 1909. The Suffragette Oak on Kelvinway was planted in 1918 to celebrate women’s first opportunity to vote in a general election and stands as a memorial to the likes of Helen Crawfurd, Dorothea Chalmers Smith, Jessie Stephen and Frances McPhun. == References == == Further reading == * History of feminism * Women's Suffrage in the UK * Representation of the People Category:1874 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Suffrage Category:Scottish suffragettes Category:Women's Social and Political Union Category:British women's rights activists Category:Women physicians Category:First-wave feminism Category:Scottish suffragists Category:Alumni of the University of Glasgow Category:Hunger Strike Medal recipients ","title":"Dorothea Chalmers Smith"},{"id":"56657670","text":"Elizabeth Woolsey (December 28, 1908 - January 11, 1977) was an American alpine skier.

It was the first systematic exposition of Christian theology. Origen composed it as a young man between the years 220 and 230 while he was still living in Alexandria. Fragments from Books 3.1 and 4.1-3 of Origen's Greek original are preserved in Origen's Philokalia. A few smaller quotations of the original Greek are preserved in Justinian's Letter to Mennas. The vast majority of the text has only survived in a heavily abridged Latin translation produced by Tyrannius Rufinus in 397. Rufinus was convinced that Origen's original treatise had been interpolated by heretics and that these interpolations were the source of the heterodox teachings found in it. He therefore heavily modified Origen's text, omitting and altering any parts which disagreed with contemporary Christian orthodoxy. Jerome was so appalled by Rufinus's lack of fidelity to the original Greek that he resolved to produce his own Latin translation of On the First Principles in which he would translate every word exactly as it was written and lay bare Origen's heresies to the whole world. Jerome's translation, however, has been lost in its entirety. On the First Principles begins with an essay explaining the nature of theology. Book One describes the heavenly world, and includes descriptions of the oneness of God, the relationship between the three persons of the Trinity, the nature of the divine spirit, reason, and angels. Book Two describes the world of man, including the incarnation of the Logos, the soul, free will, and eschatology. Book Three deals with cosmology, sin, and redemption. Book Four deals with teleology and the interpretation of the scriptures. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * ==External links== * English translation of De Principiis at New Advent Category:3rd-century Christian texts Category:Works by Origen Category:Christian theology books Category:220s Category:Greek literature (post-classical) ","title":"On the First Principles"},{"id":"56657682","text":"Flicker is a directly visible change in brightness of a light source which can be due to fluctuations of the light source itself, or due to external causes such as due to rapid fluctuations in the voltage of the power supply (power- line flicker) or incompatibility with an external dimmer. == Effects == Various scientific committees have assessed the potential health, performance and safety-related aspects resulting from temporal light modulations (TLMs) including light flickerIEEE Std 1789:2015, IEEE Recommended Practices for Modulating Current in High-Brightness LEDs for Mitigating Health Risks to Viewers (link).SCENIHR (Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks), Health effects of artificial light, 19 March 2012 ().SCHEER (EC Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks), Final Opinion on potential risks to human health of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), June 2018.. Adverse effects of flicker of include annoyance, reduced task performance, visual fatigue, headache and epileptic attack by photosensitive persons. The visibility aspects of flicker are given in a technical note of CIE; see CIE TN 006:2016. In general, undesired effects in the visual perception of a human observer induced by light intensity fluctuations are called Temporal Light Artefacts] (TLAs). == Root causes == Light emitted from lighting equipment such as luminaires and lamps may vary in strength as function of time, either intentionally or unintentionally. Intentional light variations are applied for warning, signalling (e.g. traffic-light signalling, flashing aviation light signals), entertainment (like stage lighting) with the purpose that flicker is perceived by people. Generally, the light output of lighting equipment may also have unintentional light level modulations due to the lighting equipment itself. The magnitude, shape, periodicity and frequency of the TLMs will depend on many factors such as the type of light source, the electrical mains-supply frequency, the driver or ballast technology and type of light regulation technology applied (e.g. pulse-width modulation). If the modulation frequency is below the flicker fusion threshold and if the magnitude of the TLM exceeds a certain level, then such TLMs are perceived as flicker. These TLM-properties may vary over time due to aging effects. Component failure within lighting equipment or end-of-life behavior of lighting equipment can also give rise to flickerFluorescent lamp end-of-life flicker problems.Fluorescent lamp#Flicker problems. Furthermore, external factors such as incompatibility with dimmers or presence of mains-supply voltage fluctuations (power-line flicker) are root causes of flickerR. Cai, Flicker interaction studies and flickermeter improvement, PhD thesis , Eindhoven : Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, 2009.. Flicker can also be perceived from naturally modulated light sources like candle light or a sunlit water surface or it may be experienced while driving along a row of trees lit by the sun. TLMs and resulting flicker can be seen also while driving with a certain speed along a street or through a tunnel lit by lighting equipment positioned with a regular spacingSee flicker problems in the Queensway Tunnel.. == Visibility == Temporal light modulations become visible if the modulation frequency is below the flicker fusion threshold and if the magnitude of the TLM exceeds a certain levels. There are much more factors that determine the visibility of TLMs as flicker: * The shape properties of the light waveform (e.g. sinusoidal, rectangular pulse and its duty cycle); see Figure 1; * The average light level of the light source and its contrast with the background light level within the environment; * The viewing angle and changes in direction of view by the observer; * Physiological factors such as age and fatigue. All observer-related influence quantities are stochastic parameters, because not all humans perceive the same light ripple in the same way. That is why perception of flicker is always expressed with a certain probability. Detailed explanations on the visibility of flicker and other temporal light artefacts are given in CIE TN 006:2016CIE TN 006:2016, Visual Aspects of Time-Modulated Lighting Systems – Definitions and Measurement Models (pdf). and in a recorded webinar “Is it all just flicker?”D. Sekulovski, Recording of webinar “Is it all just flicker?” (YouTube). == Objective assessment of flicker == === Light flickermeter === Figure 1: Flicker visibility threshold curves for three different types of light modulations ; values of modulation depth as a function of modulation frequency at which flicker is perceivable on average (PstLM=1 curves) For objective assessment of flicker, a widely applied and IEC-standardized metric, the short-term flicker indicator (PstLM) is used. This metric is derived from the short term flicker severity metric PstV that is applied in the power quality domain for testing electrical apparatus for their potential to cause flicker via voltage fluctuations on the electrical mains network (see the IEC publications IEC 61000-3-3IEC 61000-3-3 (ed. 3.1), Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) – Part 3-3: Limits – Limitation of voltage changes, voltage fluctuations and flicker in public low-voltage supply systems, for equipment with rated current ≤ 16 A per phase and not subject to conditional connection. and IEC 61000-4-15IEC 61000-4-15 (ed. 2), Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) –Part 4-15: Testing and measurement techniques – Flickermeter –Functional and design specifications.). The short-term flicker indicator PstLM is implemented in a light flickermeter which processes the light measured by means of a light sensor. The light flickermeterJ. Drápela, J. Šlezingr, A light-flickermeter – Part I: Design, Proceedings 11th International Scientific Conference Electric Power Engineering 2010, pp. 453.Lance Frater, Light Flicker and Harmonic Modelling of Electrical Lighting, PhD thesis, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand, 2015. consists of four processing blocks which include weighting filters to account for frequency dependency of the visibility of TLMs as well as statistical processing to enable assessing a-periodic TLMs. The specification of the light flickermeter and the test method for objective flicker assessment of lighting equipment is published in IEC technical report IEC TR 61547-1IEC TR 61547-1 (ed. 3), Equipment for general lighting purposes – EMC immunity requirements – Part 1: An objective light flickermeter and voltage fluctuation immunity test method.. It is recommended to calculate the value of PstLM using a light waveform recorded for at least three minutes. This enables proper assessment of flicker occurring at low repetition frequencies. NOTE - Several alternative metrics such as Modulation Depth, Flicker Percentage or Flicker Index are being applied. None of these metrics are suitable to predict actual human perception because human perception is impacted by modulation depth, modulation frequency, wave shape and if applicable the duty cycle of the TLM. === Matlab toolbox === A Matlab light flicker assessment toolbox including a function for calculating PstLM and some application examples are availableLight flicker assessment toolbox Matlab Central. on the Matlab Central via the Mathworks Community. === Acceptance criterion === The perceptibility scale of PstLM (and PstV) is chosen such that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a level at which 50% of human test subjects judge the flicker to be both noticeable and irritating (Figure 1). Figure 2: Generic setup to test lighting equipment for its flicker performance. === Test and measurement applications === The objective light flickermeter can be applied for different purposes (see Figure 2 and IEC TR 61547-1): * Measurement the intrinsic flicker performance of lighting equipment when supplied with a stable mains voltage; * Testing the immunity of lighting equipment against voltage fluctuation disturbances on the AC mains; * Testing the effect of light regulation of lighting equipment or the effect of an external dimmer (dimmer compatibility). == Publications of standards development organisations == # IEC TR 61457-1:2017: light flickermeter specification and verification method, and test procedure for voltage fluctuation immunity and dimmer compatibility. # NEMA 77-2017NEMA 77-2017: Temporal Light Artifacts: Test Methods and Guidance for Acceptance Criteria.: among others, flicker test Methods and guidance for acceptance criteria. == See also == * Temporal light artefacts * Temporal light effects * Power-line flicker * Power quality * Flicker fusion threshold * Flicker problems in fluorescent lamps *Stroboscopic effect (lighting) == References == Category:Lighting Category:Vision Category:Optical illusions ","title":"Flicker (light)"},{"id":"56657688","text":"Helen Boughton-Leigh (January 15, 1906 – December 28, 1999) was an American alpine skier.

She appears as a \\"teacher of drawing\\" living at 3 Elder Street in Edinburgh's First New Town in 1875.EDinburgh Post Office Directory 1875 Lavinia visited Dollar Institution (now Dollar Academy), and fell in love with one of its English teachers, Richard Malcolm FRSGS (1840–1926). Richard was still married to his first wife, Lizzie Halley, when they met. Lizzie died in 1878, which then permitted Lavinia to marry him.Malcolm grave, Dollar churchyard She married him and moved to Dollar. They lived at Burnside House just north of Academy Place. The Malcolms hosted boarders from the school. Their child, Richard, died when he was eight-years-old, and both the Malcolms then entered local political life with Richard becoming Provost first (1896–9). Lavinia was the only woman elected to the council and returned unopposed, then later unanimously elected as provost by her fellow councillors in 1913. == Supporter of women's rights == Malcolm is stated as the 'most famous' Provost on Dollar community website where her picture in full ceremonial robes appears. > \\"She wanted women to have the vote but she was against doing anything > militant or violent,\\" said Janet Carolan, the curator of the Dollar Museum > who has spent 20 years researching Malcolm's background. Throughout the World War I she served in the Provost role and was one of the first women to attend the national Convention of Scottish Burghs. She was one of the first women to be appointed as a Justice of the Peace. She campaigned to reduce infant mortality and the underlying causes of poverty and poor sanitation. She died in Dollar on 2 November 1920 and is buried in Dollar churchyard, close to her home.

It has been discussed since at least 1979 when a book was published relating to the Vietnam War. The War on Terror and particularly the 2003 Invasion of Iraq saw a resurgence in coverage, as there was a rapid increase in the number of medals awarded by the American forces. There was, however, a significant reduction in the volume of medals as the war entered the counter-insurgency phase. == United States == General Sherman in 1865 wearing a single medal Various parts of the American media have discussed the perceived problem of medal inflation; most frequently since the start of the War on Terror in 2001 including articles in the Huffington Post (Dorian De Wind), Newsweek (Evan Thomas) and the NBC News (Michael Moran). It has also been discussed in a 2006 book by Paul Robinson and a 2016 work by Michael P. Kreuzer. Earlier treatments of the subject include a 1979 book (Crisis in Command) discussing the situation in the Vietnam War and a 1996 article in the New York Times. The question discussed frequently is whether the medals are deserved or being awarded at too high a rate, leading to \\"devaluation\\" of the award. Historically the US armed forces have relied heavily upon individual commanding officers to apply for and approve medals, leading to significant variability in the criteria required for each award. One critic, Colonel Jack Jacobs, who received the Medal of Honor in Vietnam said, in 2004: \\"it's an age old problem with the Army and Air Force, too. The authority to approve awards is at a very low level, and that has a tendency to increase their frequency. Plus, there's always a political motive, or component, to giving out awards, to keep morale high and create a positive story for the home front\\". A counterpoint is that in the modern US military a serviceman's medals serve as his \\"resumé\\" indicating his career achievements, rather than serving to show only the most valorous or meritorious service. === Early history === The United States Army, perhaps conscious of the founding fathers' democratic principles, was sparing with its medals. Some distinguished generals including the Civil War leaders Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman wore few if any medals on their uniform. Indeed, the US Army had no medal to recognise valor on the battlefield until the Civil War when the Medal of Honor was introduced. The Medal of Honor was the only such medal until the US involvement in the First World War when a number of other medals were introduced. Controversy over the number of medals issued dates back to at least the Second World War. During the early US involvement in North Africa two US generals visited the front and issued 60 Legion of Merit medals. These medals criteria should have limited them only to very senior officers and the majority of the 60 issued were outside of the criteria. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt disapproved of this action but did not veto the awards. The Second World War as a whole saw a significant increase in the number of medals issued to individual servicemen. === Later 20th century === General Colin Powell stated that his award of the Legion of Merit was devalued by medal inflation during the Vietnam War A large number of service awards (for \\"time served\\") were introduced following the Second World War, which increased the number of medals servicemen could expect to receive. The Vietnam War brought about the use of military bravery medals as a means of raising force morale. Historians Richard A. Gabriel and Paul L. Savage state that \\"medal packages\\" were common in which an officer received a set of medals merely for holding a certain rank or appointment; leading to a reduction in the perceived value of these medals. Later, US General Colin Powell described the practice saying that: Tim O'Brien, who processed awards in Vietnam for his unit, said of the time: \\"we dispensed awards - purple hearts, one and the same for a dead man or a man with a scraped fingernail; bronze stars for valor, mostly for officers who knew how to lobby\\". One award singled out as an example of medal inflation is the Army Service Ribbon, awarded for completing basic initial training, introduced by the US Army in peacetime in 1981. The 1983 Invasion of Grenada has also been cited as an example: some 8,600 campaign medals were awarded despite only 7,200 troops actually serving in the country. The New York Times also notes the awarding of combat medals to seamen of the USS Vincennes who shot down a civilian airliner, Iran Air Flight 655, in 1988 and the issue of a Purple Heart wound medal to a paratrooper who suffered heat stroke during the 1989 United States invasion of Panama were controversial. The Gulf War of 1990–91 saw almost 3.5 million US service members awarded the National Defense Service Medal, though the majority remained in the United States during this time. A study in 1994 showed that there was some disparity between the services with regards the frequency of awards. The United States Air Force issued 287 decorations per 1,000 service members in that year, the US Navy 148 and the US Marine Corps just 70. At the time there was pressure on the Marine Corps to increase the number of medals issued to \\"catch up\\" to the other services. === War on Terror === Retired Colonel David Hackworth was critical of medal inflation he perceived during the War on Terror The conquest of Iraq in 2003 drew complaints from some that the number of medals awarded was out of proportion with the danger experienced by the troops and that bravery awards were more likely to be issued to officers than enlisted personnel. Of the 26 Silver Stars awarded for the 2003 capture of Baghdad 4 were awarded to colonels, 11 to captains and just 11 to NCOs, none went to privates; of the 104 Bronze Stars with valor device, 32 were awarded to officers and 72 to other ranks (only 4 of whom were privates) and of the 274 plain Bronze Stars 149 went to officers, 133 to NCOs and just 3 to privates. The Purple Heart, which is awarded automatically for being wounded and so perhaps is more reflective of the danger individual soldiers experience was awarded 88 times, only 10 times to officers, 36 to NCOs and 42 to privates. The US Air Force came in for criticism for the number of medals awarded during the invasion: some 69,000 medals were handed out, significantly more than the army (who awarded 40,000) despite that fact that army personnel were, in general, posted to more dangerous locations. The ratio of bronze stars awarded per fatality in the US Air Force was 91:1 and in the army 27:1. The US Marine Corps took active steps to limit the number of medals awarded during the invasion and was praised by some at the time for having \\"kept the inflation in check\\"; it awarded just three bronze stars per fatality suffered. Some critics noted that the air force awards, on average, twice the number of medals per service member that the US Navy does. A noted critic of medal inflation, Colonel David Hackworth was particularly critical of the air force for awarding the Distinguished Flying Cross to a pilot for a mission which missed its target in Baghdad and killed 16 civilians. He compared this to what would have been needed to receive the medal in the Second World War: \\"in World War II, when I saw a Distinguished Flying Cross, that meant the guy had made 25 or 30 missions over dangerous places like Hamburg or Berlin. Those places sometimes had 50 percent casualty rates. Now, they give medals out to guys who fly bombers invisible to radar whose bombs miss Saddam and kill civilians in a restaurant. It's an outrage\\". There were in fact a relatively large number of Distinguished Flying Crosses awarded for the invasion: between its establishment in 1927 and 2002 only 3,300 of the medals had been awarded but between March 2002 and February 2004 463 were approved. Once the war settled down into the counter-insurgency phase the number of medals awarded decreased significantly. Up until 2009 the rate of Medals of Honor awarded was just 0.1 per 100,000 service members, significantly under the ratio in the Korean War (2.3) and the Second World War (2.9). The reasons cited for this were that the technological development of warfare had reduced the number of face-to-face engagements with the enemy; that the shift by the insurgents towards improvised explosive devices, mortars and sniper attacks away from standard infantry tactics had also reduced the number of traditional engagements and that the awards system had been made more rigorous. == Other countries== The term has also been used in discussions on the awarding of medals to the British armed forces. Prior to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the British Army had a reputation for rarely awarding gallantry medals, outside of special forces units. The Telegraph noted in 2009 that there had been a significant rise in the number awarded since 2003. However, the process relies heavily upon the wording of the commanding officer's medal citation which can lead to variability. As an example the 1st battalion of the Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment was awarded 37 medals (including one Victoria Cross, the nation's highest award for gallantry) for a single tour, but similar units engaged in similar tours in 2003 and 2006 received only a single mention in dispatches. In the Canadian armed forces, there has been some discontent over the awarding of campaign medals, particularly as there was no means of differentiating between those who served regularly on patrol and those that never left the relative safety of the base. Anne Irwin, a military anthropologist at the University of Calgary's Centre for Strategic and Military Studies, proposed two new awards: a rosette on the campaign medal for those who had been off- base and a combat badge for those who fought. This would be similar to the US Army's practice of awarding the Combat Infantryman Badge, Combat Medical Badge and Combat Action Badge (the latter introduced to solve a similar problem in 2005). == See also == * Grade inflation == References == Category:Military awards and decorations Category:Orders, decorations, and medals Category:Inflation ","title":"Medal inflation"},{"id":"56657852","text":"The imperial election of 1208 was an imperial election held to select the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.

She worked within Britain and Egypt. ==Early life and education== Born and brought up in Northumberland, the daughter of John Charlesworth, a county court judge and academic lawyer, Dorothy Charlesworth was educated at Cheltenham Ladies' College and Somerville College, Oxford. She took an interest in the study of ancient glass with the encouragement of Donald Benjamin Harden, for whom she then worked at Oxford and London. ==Career== Charlesworth was appointed by the British Committee on Ancient Glass to undertake the British census of ancient glass, which was completed in 1955 although its publication was prevented by the committee's lack of funds. In 1965 she joined the Egypt Exploration Society’s excavations at Buto (Tell el-Farâ'în), taking part in each season's excavation until it ended in 1969. At Buto she supervised the excavation of the furnace site, and published her findings. While in Cairo she recorded the working of a local 'primitive' glass furnace, comparing its functioning with that of a contemporary furnace at Damascus, and with medieval glasshouse furnaces in Britain. In the final year of excavations at Buto she became field director, taking over from Veronica Seton-Williams. Alongside her work in Egypt, she continued to work with Donald Benjamin Harden, publishing a summary of his catalogue for the 1969 British Museum exhibition Masterpieces of Glass. Once the excavations at Buto had concluded, Charlesworth focused on her work within Britain. She first held a Leverhulme research fellow at the Museum of London, before serving as Inspector of Ancient Monuments. Under these auspices she directed excavations within northern Britain, notably Carlisle, where she discovered the south gate and rampart of the Roman fort in Carlisle, finally locating the fort's exact position. Here she discovered surviving timbers that could be dated by dendrochronology, and shown to have been felled in the autumn or winter of AD72/3. These offered new evidence in the debate over the chronology of the Roman conquest of northern Britain, which may have been under Petillius Cerialis, or Agricola. At Housesteads she excavated the Commandant's house and the hospital with John Wilkes in the late 1960s and 1970s. She also excavated Carrawburgh fort, Hadrian's Wall turret 51A (Piper Sike) in 1970 34A (West Grindon) in 1971, and 29A (Black Carts). Excavation of Hadrian's Wall at Walton was carried out under her direction in the 1970s. Charlesworth was one of the founding members of the Association for the History of Glass in 1978, and served as its Secretary from 1979-1981. As well as her expert contributions to the study of ancient glass, she also wrote for a more general readership, contributing to guidebooks, e.g., for the museum at the Roman site of Wall in Staffordshire (1958), Aldborough Roman town and Museum, Yorkshire (1970) and Hardknott Fort (1972). A memorial lecture was held in her name by the Cumberland and Westmorland Archaeological Society in 1982. == Publications == * Charlesworth, Dorothy (1967) Excavations on the Carrawburgh car park site, 1964. in Archaeologia Aeliana, 1-16 * Charlesworth, Dorothy (1971). \\"A GROUP OF VESSELS FROM THE COMMANDANT'S HOUSE, HOUSESTEADS\\".

Her research investigates polymer-based organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Her public engagement work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) champions women in physics as well as tackling systemic biases such as gender bias on Wikipedia and racial bias on Wikipedia. == Education == The daughter of two physicians, Wade was educated at South Hampstead High School, graduating in 2007. She subsequently enrolled on a foundation course in art and design at the Chelsea College of Art and Design, and in 2012 completed a Master of Science (MSci) degree in physics at Imperial College London. She continued at Imperial, completing her PhD in physics in 2016, where her work in nanometrology in organic semiconductors was supervised by Ji-Seon Kim. == Research and career == Wade's research interests are in materials science, chiral materials and circular polarisation. , Wade is a postdoctoral research associate in plastic electronics in the solid-state physics group at Imperial College London, focusing on developing and characterising light-emitting polymer thin films working with Alasdair Campbell and Matthew Fuchter. Her research has been published in scientific journals such as the Journal of Physical Chemistry C, the Journal of the American Chemical Society, the Journal of Materials Chemistry, ACS Nano, Advanced Functional Materials, The Journal of Chemical Physics, Advanced Electronic Materials, ChemComm and Energy & Environmental Science. She has co-authored research papers with James Durrant, Henning Sirringhaus, Jenny Nelson, Donal Bradley, and Ji-Seon Kim. , according to Web of Science, she is the first author of four papers and a middle author on another 14. Her research (first author) has been cited 25 times, and her middle author papers have been cited 420 times. Her h-index is 8, and her m-quotient is 1.1.Web Of Science, accessed 7 February 2020. Note that there are two Jessica Wades, publishing as J Wade and JF Wade, and WOS returns both in a simple search. === Public engagement === Wade has contributed to public engagement to increase gender equality in Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. She represented the UK on the United States Department of State funded International Visitor Leadership Program Hidden No More, and served on the WISE Campaign Young Women's Board and Women's Engineering Society (WES) Council, working with teachers across the country through the Stimulating Physics Network (including keynote talks at education fairs and teacher conferences). Wade has been critical of expensive campaigns to encourage girls into science where there is an implication that only a small minority would be interested, or that girls can study the \\"chemical composition of lipsticks and nail varnish\\". She estimates that £5m or £6m is spent in the UK to promote a scientific career for women but with little measurement of the results. Wade has made a large contribution to a Wikipedia campaign that encourages the creation of Wikipedia articles about notable female academics, in order to promote female role models in STEM. Wade has created new Wikipedia biographical articles to raise the profile of minorities in STEM. She told Chemistry World in mid-2019 that of the 600 articles about female scientists she has written, 6 have been deleted because of the notability issue. Yet, Wade said, the site has articles about the most obscure sports players and forgotten pop songs. As of February 2020, she had written over 900 biographies on Wikipedia. Wade coordinated a team for the 6th International Women in Physics Conference, resulting in an invitation to discuss the Institute of Physics (IOP) gender balance work in Germany. She also supports the engagement of school students through school activities and festivals, and the organisation of a series of events for girls at Imperial College London, which she has funded with grants from the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng), the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) and the Biochemical Society. In 2015 Wade won the science engagement activity I'm a Scientist, Get me out of here! and received £500, which she used to run a greenlight4girls day in the department of physics at Imperial College London. Wade serves on the IOP London and South East Committee, the IOP Women in Physics Committee and the Juno transparency and opportunity committee at Imperial.

Wade was interviewed as part of TEDx London Women, held on 1 December 2018.A voice for diversity in science Video of Wade's TEDxLondonWomen interview 1 December 2018 With Ben Britton and Christopher Jackson, she co-authored The reward and risk of social media for academics in the journal Nature Reviews Chemistry. ===Gender bias on Wikipedia=== A controversy regarding allegations that insufficient coverage within the English-language Wikipedia is being given to women making contributions to science became widely noted when the 12 April 2019 Washington Post published an op-ed entitled The Black Hole Photo Is Just One Example of Championing Women in Science, co-authored by Zaringhalam and Wade. In part, the article decried that previous discussions among Wikipedia's volunteer editors resulted in the biographical entries originally created by Wade for some female scientists non-inclusion on the website, one from among hundreds of articles on women scientists that Wade had contributed to that time, with perhaps approximately one percent of these submissions declined. With regard to one such article, Wade had heard about nuclear chemist Clarice Phelps from Kit Chapman, who had been conducting research for his book Superheavy: Making and Breaking the Periodic Table (2019) with intention \\"to make science more accessible. I hope that looking back and seeing this cast and some of the diversity that’s reflected in the past, we can get more diversity in the future.\\" Wade created a short Wikipedia biography of Phelps in September 2018. The deletion of that article on 11 February 2019 led to a prolonged editorial discussion and, approaching a type of dispute discouraged among the website's volunteer administrators, its repeated restoration and re-deletion. Chemistry World said: Wade told Chemistry World she believes such omissions of scientific researchers from coverage in Wikipedia are regrettable, stating her impression that it accepts entries for even the most obscure popular-media figures. By January 2020, there was a consensus to restore the article, as by then new sources had become available. ===Publications=== Wade's publications include: * * ===Awards and honours=== Wade has received several awards for contributions to science, science communication, diversity, and inclusion.

It was built in a Rococo Gothic style for James West in the early 18th century. The house itself is built of limestone ashlar to a T-shaped plan with a hipped slate roof and has a two-storey frontage of 7 bays. It stands in 4000 acres of park and farmland, which is Grade II listed and bisected by the River Stour. Several other associated buildings, such as stables and entrance lodges, are also listed. A number of former features of the estate, such as pleasure grounds, an obelisk and a Chinese pavilion have since been lost. ==History== Alscot Park in 1818 At one time Alscot belonged to Deerhurst Priory in Gloucestershire before ownership passed to Tewkesbury Abbey. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539, it passed into private hands such as the Marriett family. In 1747 the manors of Preston and Alscot, together with the adjacent ones of Whitchurch, Wimpstone and Crimscote, were bought by James West, then secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the MP for St Albans. Pending his retirement from his final post as Secretary to the Treasury in 1762 he created the present house in two stages from an older house on the site. The north wing was remodelled in 1747 and the south wing added in 1762. Stables and a conservatory were added between 1762 and 1766. A gothic entrance porch was later (1815 to 1820) designed and added to the south front. Gothic lodges at the Stratford Road entrance were built in 1838. James West the younger, the only son of West and his wife Sarah Steavens, heiress of a wealthy timber merchant, died in 1795, predeceasing his mother. Alscot Park thereby passed to James West the younger's son, James Robert West, who died in 1838 and has passed down in the West family until the present day (2018). Currently occupied by Emma Holman-West and her family, the estate has been developed to house residential properties, offices, studios and industrial space, winning the Bledisloe Gold Medal in 2011 from the Royal Agricultural Society for estate management. ==References== Category:Country houses in Warwickshire Category:Grade I listed buildings in Warwickshire ","title":"Alscot Park"},{"id":"56658265","text":"Exterior Sant'Antonio delle Monache a Port'Alba or Sant'Antoniello was a monastery and monastic church on Piazza Bellini in the historic city-centre of Naples, Italy.

Dr. LeBlanc has served as principal investigator or co-principal investigator on eight federally-funded research initiatives.GW Today - Thomas LeBlanc Named 17th President of The George Washington University ==Controversies== On February 1, 2020, a video was posted to the George Washington University Overheard Facebook page where a freshman at the university asked President LeBlanc about divestment from fossil fuels.https://www.facebook.com/archer.gallivan/videos/1498813073606531/?fref=nf In the video, LeBlanc admitted for the first time that 3% of the University's endowment is indirectly invested in the fossil fuels industry through buying funds that invest in \\"whatever they want to invest in\\" which includes the carbon industry. This, along with other points the president made about the university's relationship with climate change activism and deniers, sparked a student protest and several petitions demanding for the university to divest immediately. At one of the protests, a student was pushed down the stairs of the President's home. In the same video, LeBlanc criticized majority rule over GW policy by saying, \\"What if the majority of the students agreed to shoot all the black people here?\\"https://www.facebook.com/archer.gallivan/videos/1498813073606531/?fref=nf Students quickly condemned the president's comments as \\"racially insensitive\\" and \\"thoughtless.\\"https://www.gwhatchet.com/2020/02/02/leblanc-apologizes-for- insensitive-analogy-amid-backlash-from-sa-divestment-activists/ The president later apologized, saying \\"The point I was making – that majority rule should never suppress the human rights of others – was obscured by the example I used...I regret my choice of words and any harm I unintentionally inflicted on a community I value greatly.\\"https://www.gwhatchet.com/2020/02/02/leblanc- apologizes-for-insensitive-analogy-amid-backlash-from-sa-divestment-activists/ Le Blanc additionally hired Heather Swain, who was expected to begin as Vice President of communications and marketing in the fall of 2020. Heather Swain had purposely withheld information and buried evidence on Larry Nassar, former USA Olympic gymnastics team doctor and professor at Michigan State University who was sentenced for child pornography and countless (at least 250) charges of sexual assault on minors. Swain eventually withdrew from the position due to student and faculty backlash, and after her withdrawal, Le Blanc issued a lackluster apology, in which he said, \\"I accept full responsibility\\" regarding her hiring, and that he \\"should have recognized the sensitivities and implications of this hire. It is a mistake I deeply regret.\\" ==References== ==External links== *GWU Office of the President About President LeBlanc Category:Presidents of George Washington University Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:University of Wisconsin-Madison alumni Category:State University of New York at Plattsburgh alumni ","title":"Thomas LeBlanc"},{"id":"56658368","text":"Yongding Subdistrict () is a subdistrict of Yongding District in Zhangjiajie Prefecture-level City, Hunan, China.

Elsie Inglis went on to become a leader in the suffrage movement and found the Scottish Women's Hospital organisation in World War I, but when she jointly founded the College she was still a medical student. Her father, John Inglis, had been a senior civil servant in India, where he had championed the cause of education for women. On his return to Edinburgh he became a supporter of medical education for women and used his influence to help establish the college. The college was founded in 1889 at a time when women were not admitted to university medical schools in the UK. ==Origins== The College was set up as a result of a dispute within the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women. This had been established in 1886 by Sophia Jex-Blake, who was regarded by many of her students as a strict disciplinarian. When two students, Grace Cadell and her sister Martha, were dismissed in 1888 for a breach of rules, they successfully sued Jex-Blake and the school. Another student, Elsie Inglis, emerged as the leader of a group of students sympathetic to the Cadell sisters and increasingly hostile to Jex- Blake. John Inglis her father had a circle of influential friends, including the Principal of the University of Edinburgh, Sir William Muir. They set up the Scottish Association for the Medical Education of Women, which soon had an impressive list of supporters and financial backers. The first president was Sir Alexander Christison, who was striving to reverse the anti-female stance of his father Prof Robert Christison.British Medical Journal 19 October 1918The Association rented a large building at 30 Chambers Street, which was well suited to the needs of the College with lecture rooms and laboratories. The College opened in 1889. ==College activities== The College was set up in direct competition to Jex-Blake's Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women, which was to close in 1898. It aimed to prepare the women students for the examinations of the Triple Qualification (TQ) offered by the Scottish medical Royal Colleges. Successful candidates were able to register with the General Medical Council and practice medicine in Britain, throughout much of the then British Empire and in some states of the United States of America. When the Scottish universities allowed women to graduate in medicine, many of the College's graduates were awarded the university degrees of MB, CM until 1899 or MB, ChB thereafter. In the first session the College had 18 lecturers whose lectures covered the syllabus of subjects required by the TQ. The TQ also required a series of clinical placements in a variety of specialities in approved hospitals. The main teaching hospital, the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, refused to allow women medical students on its wards. Jex-Blake's School of Medicine had arranged clinical teaching at a smaller teaching hospital Leith Hospital, and its wards were therefore not available to the College. The College arranged for its clinical teaching at Glasgow Royal Infirmary where two surgeons, Sir William Macewen and James Hogarth Pringle were ardent supporters of medical education for women. There was still much opposition to medical education for women and much of the success of the College resulted from the influential supporters of the Scottish Association for the Medical Education of Women. These included the Association's first president Sir Alexander Christison Bt, who ironically was the son of Sir Robert Christison who had been a leading opponent of medical education for women. Among the first Vice Presidents were Dr Robert Craig Maclagan and Sir Robert Philip the pioneer of tuberculosis treatment. In July 1892 the College had sufficient funds and sufficient influence to have two wards in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh opened to the women medical students of the College at a cost of £700. The students were initially taught in the medical ward by Dr William Russell and Dr (later Sir) Byrom Bramwell and in the surgical ward by Mr (later Professor Sir) Joseph M Cotteril. The College merged with the School of Medicine of the Royal Colleges in 1916. == Early lecturers == At the time of the College's foundation there was still opposition to medical education for women. By choosing to lecture at the College the lecturers were effectively making public their support for women in medicine. Most were young men several of whom would become well known in later life. The first lecturers included: *John W Ballantyne (Midwifery and gynaecology) who made significant contributions to improving antenatal and perinatal care, publishing over 500 papers and books on obstetrical topics. *William Craig FRSE, FRCSEd (Therapeutics) became better known as a botanist in later life. *James Hodsdon FRCSEd (Surgery) who went on to be knighted and elected president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. *William Keiller (Anatomy), who from 1891 became Professor of Anatomy at the University of Texas at Galveston. *Harvey Littlejohn FRCSEd (Public Health) who became professor of Forensic Medicine at the University of Edinburgh and as an expert on medical jurisprudence became an expert witness at celebrated criminal trials. * William Ivison Macadam FRSE, FIC (Chemistry) who continued chemistry research and teaching in the extramural school, supporting the cause of women's education until his tragic murder in his laboratory in 1912.Scotsman 25 June 1902 *Robert Philip FRSE, FRCP (Medicine) who became a pioneer in the treatment of tuberculosis and went on to become president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and president of the British Medical Association. He was knighted for services to medicine. *William Russell FRCPE (Pathology) who became Professor of Medicine at the University of Edinburgh and president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.

His failed canal project through Dayton's South Park neighborhood came to be known as \\"Seely's Ditch\\" or \\"Seely's Folly\\" and still has an impact today of projects in the area. == Early life and business career == Morris Seely was born in 1795 in Ontario County, New York. Little is known about his early life, until Seely arrives on public record in a land transfer in 1819. On April 25, 1827, Morris Seely married Catherine Huffman, the daughter of businessman William Huffman. That same year, Seely worked as a contractor leading four sections the Miami Canal through Dayton. The terrain proved tough to excavate, and vastly underbid the project. Following the experience, Seely pursued a new idea: \\"a new navigable canal through the undeveloped area east of town and east of the new Miami Canal connecting the canal's Mad River feeder from near today's Wayne Avenue to the main line of the canal below town near the Fairgrounds hill.\\" Much of the land Seely sought to purchase and plat was owned by Daniel Cooper and his estate. The Cooper estate sued, and a land ordeal followed. Eventually parts of the land Seely needed for his project was leased by the state elsewhere, which eliminated the chance for a canal, even though the Ohio Supreme Court later ruled against the Cooper estate. The section that had been dug remained for almost 60 years as nothing more than a drainage ditch, and become known as \\"Seely's Ditch.\\" Eventually Seely's work on the ditch led to his financial demise, filing bankruptcy in 1842. == Political career == Prior to Seely's Ditch, Seely served in the Ohio Senate from 1829–1830. In 1833 Seely won election to the Ohio House of Representatives, where he served one term. In 1838, Seely joined others as they attempted to shift the path of the first interstate highway, \\"National Road\\" (US-40 today), through Dayton instead of directly west to Indiana from Springfield. While the road came close, the committee valued a straight road that would not dip south. In 1841, Seely was elected mayor of Dayton. He served one month, and resigned. == Death == Morris Seely died in 1847, at the age of 52. There are many questions about the location of his grave. By many accounts, he is believed to be buried in single grave purchased by his son, William Morris Seely, across from his wife Catherine who passed away two years earlier. Allegedly this is because Seely's failures did not gain him approval with his in-laws, the Dayton's prestigious Huffman family, and they would not allow them to be buried together. < == References == Category:Mayors of Dayton, Ohio Category:Ohio state senators Category:Members of the Ohio House of Representatives Category:People from Ontario County, New York Category:1795 births Category:1847 deaths ","title":"Morris Seely"},{"id":"56658411","text":"Edgar Allan Forbes was an international reporter from the U.S. in the early 20th century.
