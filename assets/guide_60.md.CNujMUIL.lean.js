She is the mother of Tony Soprano. A young Livia, played by Laila Robins and later by Laurie J. Williams, is sometimes seen in flashbacks. Series creator David Chase has stated that the main inspiration for the character was his own mother. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked her #3 of their \\"40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\\". ==Character biography== Olivia Pollio Soprano was born in Providence, Rhode Island to Teresa and Faustino \\"Augie\\" Pollio, Italian immigrants from Avellino. Livia's childhood was poverty-stricken and miserable and her marriage to the tough and charismatic Johnny Soprano was Livia's ticket out of her parents' house. Together they had three children: Janice, Tony, and Barbara. She also suffered a miscarriage years after her youngest child was born and almost died from heavy bleeding. Life as a housewife was unfulfilling to Livia and she felt overwhelmed by her three children and unappreciated by her unfaithful husband. She liked listening to Connie Francis and The Pajama Game when she was younger. Cagey, manipulative, and self-absorbed, Livia Soprano seemingly derives little pleasure from life other than making the people around her miserable. On her son's wedding day, she tells her new daughter-in-law Carmela that marrying Tony was a mistake and eventually Tony would get bored with her. Her older daughter Janice moved to the West Coast when she was 18 and her younger daughter Barbara married into a successful family in New York. This left Tony with the sole responsibility of looking after Livia following Johnny's death. As she gets older, her misery and mental state get worse. Years later on season one of the show, Livia causes problems for Tony as revenge for putting her in a retirement home, Green Grove, and putting her house up for sale. This results in Tony almost getting killed on two occasions. Tony narrowly avoids being killed by two hitmen after Junior Soprano finds out from Livia that Tony was subverting his power. Tony's best friend Artie Bucco draws a rifle on Tony after Livia reveals that he burned down his restaurant. Tony was able to convince him otherwise and Artie smashes his gun in frustration. It is later discovered that the FBI had bugged Livia's retirement home, and the recordings of Livia conspiring with Junior were played to Tony. Tony's plot for revenge is foiled when Livia suffers a stroke (said to be induced by repressed rage) and is taken into a hospital. Tony appears to be ready to smother her with a pillow, but she is rushed to the emergency room. He then publicly threatens to kill her, informing her that he had heard her conspiring with Junior from the FBI. However, Tony settles for cutting off all contact with her. In season two, Livia's daughter Janice returns to New Jersey. She takes up residence in Livia's home and convinces Tony not to sell the house and instead let her take care of Livia. Livia is cautious of Janice's sudden concern for her well-being and correctly guesses that Janice has ulterior motives. While Tony and Carmela avoid all contact with Livia, her grandchildren Meadow and A.J. still visit her, unaware of past events. Livia grows paranoid and more difficult when AJ inadvertently reveals to her that Janice and Tony were discussing possible \\"do not resuscitate\\" options for her. When Janice is forced to flee the state, Tony gives Livia a stolen plane ticket so she can stay with her sister. However, before she is set to leave, she is detained at the airport. Tony hires a home assistant to look after Livia at the beginning of season three. Livia dies soon after from a stroke. After her death, Janice discovers that Livia kept many of Tony's old childhood artifacts while only keeping some of Barbara's and none of Janice's. Livia appears as a younger woman in several flashbacks afterwards, as well as being frequently referenced, with Tony still far from resolving his feelings towards her. For season three, a storyline was planned where Livia would be called to testify against her son in court, giving evidence on stolen airline tickets she had received from him, but Marchand died on June 18, 2000, before it could be filmed. Existing footage and computer-generated imagery was used to create a final scene between Tony and Livia in the season three episode \\"Proshai, Livushka\\" before the character, too, died. The cost was approximately $250,000. Based on her conversations with Tony, Dr. Melfi speculates that Livia might suffer from some form of borderline or narcissistic personality disorder. Additionally, Tony tells Adriana (in \\"Irregular Around the Margins\\") that Livia suffered from irritable bowel syndrome all her life. Janice, during a conversation with Carmela, calls into question whether or not her mother loves them. She goes on to say that her therapist explained to her that Livia did indeed love them, but did not know how to express it. During the sixth-season episode \\"Mayham\\" when Tony is comatose from a gunshot wound, he has a vivid dream that ends with Tony being beckoned into a house by his dead cousin Tony Blundetto; a woman who looks similar to Livia can briefly be seen in the doorway of the house. Tony then hears a child's voice calling \\"Daddy, don't go, come back.\\" He then awakens to see his daughter Meadow and wife Carmela standing over him. ==Character origins== David Chase, the creator of The Sopranos, based Livia heavily on his own mother, Norma Chase. He described her as being paranoid, sharp-tongued, abusive, and disregarding of her son's career achievements. Many of Livia's memorable lines, such as \\"Poor you\\" or \\"daughters are better at taking care of their mothers than sons,\\" are what Norma Chase would say. Just like Tony Soprano, David Chase spent time in psychotherapy. ==References== ==External links== * HBO Profile: Livia Soprano Category:The Sopranos characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1999 Category:Fictional child abusers Category:Fictional characters with borderline personality disorder Category:Fictional characters from Rhode Island Category:Fictional characters from New Jersey Category:Fictional smokers sv:Lista √∂ver rollfigurer i Sopranos#Livia Soprano ","title":"Livia Soprano"},{"id":"516752","text":"The Allegheny Mountain Range , informally the Alleghenies and also spelled Alleghany and Allegany, is part of the vast Appalachian Mountain Range of the Eastern United States and Canada and posed a significant barrier to land travel in less technologically advanced eras. The barrier range has a northeast‚Äìsouthwest orientation and runs for about from north-central Pennsylvania, through western Maryland and eastern West Virginia, to southwestern Virginia. The Alleghenies comprise the rugged western-central portion of the Appalachians. They rise to approximately in northeastern West Virginia. In the east, they are dominated by a high, steep escarpment known as the Allegheny Front. In the west, they slope down into the closely associated Allegheny Plateau, which extends into Ohio and Kentucky. The principal settlements of the Alleghenies are Altoona, State College, and Johnstown, Pennsylvania; and Cumberland, Maryland. ==Name== The name is derived from the Allegheny River, which drains only a small portion of the Alleghenies in west- central Pennsylvania. The meaning of the word, which comes from the Lenape (Delaware) Native Americans, is not definitively known but is usually translated as \\"fine river\\". A Lenape legend tells of an ancient tribe called the \\"Allegewi\\" who lived on the river and were defeated by the Lenape.Stewart, George R. (1967), Names on the Land, Boston. Allegheny is the early French spelling (as in Allegheny River, which was once part of New France), and Allegany is closer to the early English spelling (as in Allegany County, Maryland, Allegany County, New York, or Alleghany County, Virginia). The word \\"Allegheny\\" was once commonly used to refer to the whole of what are now called the Appalachian Mountains. John Norton used it (spelled variously) around 1810 to refer to the mountains in Tennessee and Georgia.Norton, Major John (1816), The Journal of Major John Norton (Toronto: Champlain Society, Reprinted 1970) Around the same time, Washington Irving proposed renaming the United States either \\"Appalachia\\" or \\"Alleghania\\". In 1861, Arnold Henry Guyot published the first systematic geologic study of the whole mountain range.Guyot, Arnold, \\"On the Appalachian Mountain System\\", American Journal of Science and Arts, Second Series, XXXI, (March 1861), 167-171. His map labeled the range as the \\"Alleghanies\\", but his book was titled On the Appalachian Mountain System. As late as 1867, John Muir‚Äîin his book A Thousand Mile Walk to the Gulf‚Äîused the word \\"Alleghanies\\" in referring to the southern Appalachians. There was no general agreement about the \\"Appalachians\\" versus the \\"Alleghanies\\" until the late 19th century. ==GeographyExtent=== From northeast to southwest, the Allegheny Mountains run about . From west to east, at their widest, they are about . Although there are no official boundaries to the Allegheny Mountains region, it may be generally defined to the east by the Allegheny Front; to the north by the Susquehanna River valley; and to the south by the New River valley. To the west, the Alleghenies grade down into the dissected Allegheny Plateau (of which they are sometimes considered to be a part). The westernmost ridges are considered to be the Laurel Highlands and Chestnut Ridge in Pennsylvania, and Laurel Mountain and Rich Mountain in West Virginia. The mountains to the south of the Alleghenies‚Äîthe Appalachians in westernmost Virginia, eastern Kentucky, and eastern Tennessee‚Äîare the Cumberlands. The Alleghenies and the Cumberlands both constitute part of the Ridge and Valley Province of the Appalachians. ===Allegheny Front and Allegheny Highlands=== George Washington and Jefferson National Forests lie on the eastern slopes of the Alleghenies. The Monongahela NF lies within the central Alleghenies. The eastern edge of the Alleghenies is marked by the Allegheny Front, which is also sometimes considered the eastern terminus of the Allegheny Plateau. This great escarpment roughly follows a portion of the Eastern Continental Divide in this area. A number of impressive gorges and valleys drain the Alleghenies: to the east, Smoke Hole Canyon (South Branch Potomac River), and to the west the New River Gorge and the Blackwater and Cheat Canyons. Thus, about half the precipitation falling on the Alleghenies makes its way west to the Mississippi and half goes east to Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic seaboard. The highest ridges of the Alleghenies are just west of the Front, which has an east/west elevational change of up to . Absolute elevations of the Allegheny Highlands reach nearly , with the highest elevations in the southern part of the range. The highest point in the Allegheny Mountains is Spruce Knob (4,863 ft/1,482 m), on Spruce Mountain in West Virginia. Other notable Allegheny highpoints include Thorny Flat on Cheat Mountain (4,848 ft/1478 m), Bald Knob on Back Allegheny Mountain (4,842 ft/1476 m), and Mount Porte Crayon (4,770 ft/1,454 m), all in West Virginia; Dans Mountain (2,898 ft/883m) in Maryland, Backbone Mountain (3360 ft/1024 m), the highest point in Maryland; Mount Davis (3,213 ft/979 m), the highest point in Pennsylvania, and the second highest, Blue Knob (3,146 ft/959 m). ===Development=== There are very few sizable cities in the Alleghenies. The four largest are (in descending order of population): Altoona, State College, Johnstown (all in Pennsylvania) and Cumberland (in Maryland). In the 1970s and '80s, the Interstate Highway System was extended into the northern portion of the Alleghenies, and the region is now served by a network of federal expressways‚ÄîInterstates 80, 70/76 and 68. Interstate 64 traverses the southern extremity of the range, but the Central Alleghenies (the \\"High Alleghenies\\" of eastern West Virginia) have posed special problems for highway planners owing to the region's very rugged terrain and environmental sensitivities (see Corridor H.) This region is still served by a rather sparse secondary highway system and remains considerably lower in population density than surrounding regions. In the telecommunications field, a unique impediment to development in the central Allegheny region is the United States National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ), a large rectangle of land‚Äîabout ‚Äîthat straddles the border area of Virginia and West Virginia. Created in 1958 by the Federal Communications Commission, the NRQZ severely restricts all omnidirectional and high-power radio transmissions, although cell phone service is allowed throughout much of the area. ===Protected areas=== Much of the Monongahela (West Virginia), George Washington (West Virginia, Virginia) and Jefferson (Virginia) National Forests lie within the Allegheny Mountains. (No part of the wooded Alleghenies in Maryland or Pennsylvania, however, is managed by the U.S. Forest Service.) The Alleghenies also include a number of federally designated wilderness areas, such as the Dolly Sods Wilderness, Laurel Fork Wilderness, and Cranberry Wilderness in West Virginia. The mostly completed Allegheny Trail, a project of the West Virginia Scenic Trails Association since 1975, runs the length of the range within West Virginia. The northern terminus is at the Mason‚ÄìDixon line and the southern is at the West Virginia-Virginia border on Peters Mountain.Rosier, George L., Compiler, Hiking Guide to the Allegheny Trail, Second edition, West Virginia Scenic Trails Association, Kingwood, W. Va., 1990. ==Geology== The bedrock of the Alleghenies is mostly sandstone and metamorphosed sandstone, quartzite, which is extremely resistant to weathering. Prominent beds of resistant conglomerate can be found in some areas, such as the Dolly Sods. When it weathers, it leaves behind a pure white quartzite gravel. The rock layers of the Alleghenies were formed during the Appalachian orogeny. Because of intense freeze-thaw cycles in the higher Alleghenies, there is little native bedrock exposed in most areas. The ground surface usually rests on a massive jumble of sandstone rocks, with air space between them, that are gradually moving down-slope. The crest of the Allegheny Front is an exception, where high bluffs are often exposed. Mineral springs in the High Alleghenies attracted Native Americans and 18th century white settlers and provided a modest incentive to the local economy. The spas developing around these geological features include celebrated resorts that continue to cater to an exclusive clientele, such as The Greenbrier (White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia; hotel built 1858) and The Homestead (Hot Springs, Virginia; original lodge built 1766). ==EcologyFlora=== The High Alleghenies are noted for their forests of red spruce, balsam fir, and mountain ash, trees typically found much farther north. Hardwood forests also include yellow birch, sugar and red maple, eastern hemlock, and black cherry. American beech, pine and hickory can also be found. The forests of the entire region are now almost all second- or third-growth forests, the original trees having been removed in the late 19th and (in West Virginia) early 20th centuries. The wild onion known as the ramp (Allium tricoccum) is also present in the deeper forests. Certain isolated areas in the High Alleghenies are well known for their open expanses of sphagnum bogs and heath shrubs (e.g., Dolly Sods, Cranberry Glades). Many plant communities are indeed similar to those of sea-level eastern Canada. But the ecosystems within the Alleghenies are remarkably varied. In recent decades, the many stages of ecologic succession throughout the area have made the region one of enduring interest to botanists. ===Fauna=== The larger megafauna which once inhabited the High Alleghenies‚Äîelk, bison, mountain lion‚Äîwere all exterminated during the 19th century. They survived longer in this area, however, than in other parts of the eastern United States. Naturalist John James Audubon reported that by 1851 a few eastern elk (Cervus canadensis canadiensis) could still be found in the Alleghany Mountains but that by then they were virtually gone from the remainder of their range. Mammals in the Allegheny region today include whitetail deer, chipmunk, raccoon, skunk, groundhog, opossum, weasel, field mouse, flying squirrel, cottontail rabbit, gray foxes, red foxes, gray squirrels, red squirrels and a cave bat. Bobcat, snowshoe hare, wild boar and black bear and coyote are also found in the forests and parks of the Alleghenies. Mink and beaver are much less often seen. These mountains and plateau have over 20 species of reptiles represented as lizard, skink, turtle and snake. Some of the icterid birds visit the mountains as well as the hermit thrush and wood thrush. North American migrant birds live throughout the mountains during the warmer seasons. Occasionally, osprey and eagles can be found nesting along the streams. The hawks and owls are the most common birds of prey. The water habitats of the Alleghenies hold 24 families of fish. Amphibian species number about 21, among them hellbenders, lungless salamanders, and various toads and frogs. The Alleghenies provide habitat for about 54 species of common invertebrate. These include Gastropoda, slugs, leech, earthworms and grub worm. Cave crayfish (Cambarus nerterius) live alongside a little over seven dozen cave invertebrates.West Virginia DNR - Wildlife Resources, West Virginia Division of Wildlife. and http://lutra.dnr.state.wv.us/cwcp/appendix2.shtm ==HistoryPre-contact Native Americans=== The indigenous people inhabiting the Allegheny Mountains emerged from the greater region's archaic and mound building cultures, particularly the Adena and Eastern Woodland peoples with a later Hopewellian influence. These Late Middle Woodland culture people have been called the Montaine (c. A.D. 500 to 1000) culture.McMichael, WV 1968Dragoo, Pa 1963 Their neighbors, the woodland Buck Garden culture, lived in the western valleys of the central Allegheny range. The Montaine sites extend from the tributaries of the upper Potomac River region south to the New River tributaries. These also were influenced by the earlier Armstrong culture of the more southwestern portions northern sub-range of the Ouasioto (Cumberland) Mountains and by the more easterly Virginia Woodland people. The Late Woodland Montaine were less influenced by Hopewellian trade from Ohio, although similarly polished stone tools have been found among the Montaine sites in the Tygart Valley.McMichael, Edward V., \\"Introduction to West Virginia Archeology\\", 2nd Edition, 1968, West Virginia Archeological Society Small groups of Montaine people appear to have lingered much beyond their classically defined period in parts of the most mountainous valleys.McMichael 1968 The watershed of the Monongahela River is within the northwestern Alleghenies, and it is from it that the Monongahela culture takes its name. The Godwin-Portman site (36AL39) located in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, had a possible Fort Ancient (c. AD 850 to 1680) presence during the 15th century.THE LATE PREHISTORIC COMPONENTS AT THE GODWIN-PORTMAN SITE, 36AL39, abstract RICHARD L. GEORGE. It had several Late Prehistoric occupations. This multicomponent site was destroyed in 1979. The Pennsylvania Archaeologist; Volume 77(1), Spring 2007 Washington Boro ceramics have been found on the Barton (18AG3) and Llewellyn (18AG26) sites in Maryland on the northeastern slopes of the late Susquehannock sequence. The early Monongahela (c. AD 900 to 1630) are called the Drew Tradition in Pennsylvania. According to archeologist Richard L. George: \\"I believe that some of the Monongahela were of Algonquin origin.... Other scholars have suggested that Iroquoian speakers were interacting with Late Monongahela people, and additional evidence is presented to confirm this. I conclude that the archaeologically conceived term, Monongahela, likely encompasses speakers of several languages, including Siouan.\\"\\"Revisiting the Monongahela Linguistic/Cultural Affiliation Mystery\\", ABSTRACT by Richard L. George, Pennsylvania Archeology Society. According to Dr Maslowski of West Virginia in 2009: \\"The New River Drainage and upper Potomac represents the range of the Huffman Phase (Page) hunting and gathering area or when it is found in small amounts on village sites, trade ware or Page women being assimulated into another village (tribe).\\" Finally, according to Prof Potter of Virginia, they [the people represented by the Huffman Phase of Page pottery] had occupied the eastern slopes of the Alleghenies on the upper Potomac to the northern, lower Shenandoah Valley region before the A.D. 1300 Luray phase (Algonquian) peoples' \\"invasion\\". It is thought that these ancient Alleghenians were pushed from the classic Huffman Phase of the eastern slopes of the Alleghenies to the Blue Ridge Mountains in western Virginia, which was eastern Siouan territory. Detail of a French map of 1671. The Alleghenies are in the lower center portion. In 1669, John Lederer and members of his party became the first Europeans to crest the Blue Ridge Mountains and the first to see the Shenandoah Valley and the Allegheny Mountains beyond. ===Native Americans in the 17th century=== The proto-historic Alleghenies can be exampled by the earliest journals of the colonists. According to Batts and Fallows' September, 1671 Expedition, they found Mehetan Indians of Mountain \\"Cherokee-Iroquois\\" mix on the New River tributaries. This journal does not identify the \\"Salt Village\\", but, that the \\"Mehetan\\" were associated with these and today thought to be \\"Monetons\\", Siouans. However, this journal does not identify the \\"Salt Village\\" below the Kanawha Falls, but, that simply the \\"Mehetan\\" were associated with these. He explained, below the \\"Salt Villages\\", a mass of hostile Indians had, implied, arrived and some believe these to be \\"Shanwans\\" of Vielles Expedition of 1692~94, ancient Shawnee. In 1669, John Lederer of Maryland for the Virginia Colony and the Tennessee Cherokee had visited the mouth of the Kanawha and reported no hostilities on the lower streams of the Alleghenies. The Mohetan representative through a Siouan translator explained to Mr Batts and Mr Fallon, Colonel Abraham Woods explorers 1671‚Äì2, that he (Moheton Native American) could not say much about the people below the \\"Salt Village\\" because they (Mountain Cherokee) were not associated with them. The Mohetan was armed by this time of 1671 for the Mohetan Representative was given several pouches of ammunition for his and the other's weapons as a token of friendship. Somebody had already been trading within the central Alleghenies before the Virginians historical record begins in the Allegheny Mountains. Some earlier scholars found evidence these Proto-historics were either Cistercians of Spanish Ajacan Occuquan outpost on the Potomac River or Jesuits and their Kahnawake Praying Indians (Mohawk) on the Riviere de la Ronceverte. The \\"Kanawha Madonna\\" may date from this period or earlier. Where the New River breaks through Peters' Mountain, near Pearisburg Virginia the 1671 journal mentions the \\"Moketans had formerly lived\\". According to a number of early 17th century maps, the Messawomeake or \\"Mincquas\\" (Dutch) occupied the northern Allegheny Mountains. The \\"Shatteras\\" (an ancient Tutelo) occupied the Ouasioto Mountains and the earliest term Canaraguy (Kanawhans otherwise CanawestRelocated Subjects of the 5 Nations, To my friend Winjack, King of the Ganawese Indians on Sasqua- hanna, \\"Brother : I have heard that your friends the Nanticokes are now at yr.

They were associated with the Allegheny \\"Cherokee\\" and Eastern Siouan as trade-movers and canoe transporters. The Calicuas, an ancient most northern Cherokee, migrated or was pushed from the Central Ohio Valley onto the north eastern slopes of the Alleghenies of the ancient Messawomeake, Iroquois tradesmen to 1630s Kent Island, by 1710 maps. Sometime before 1712, the Canawest (\\"Kanawhans\\"-\\"Canallaway\\"-\\"Canaragay\\") had moved to the upper Potomac and made a Treaty with the newly established trading post of Fort Conolloway which would become a part of western Maryland during the 1740s. ===Trading posts and other settlements=== Prior to European exploration and settlement, trails through the Alleghenies had been transited for many generations by American Indian tribes such as the Iroquois, Shawnee, Delaware, Catawba and others, for purposes of trade, hunting and, especially, warfare.Smith, J. Lawrence, The High Alleghenies: The Drama and Heritage of Three Centuries, Tornado, West Virginia: Allegheny Vistas; Illustrations by Bill Pitzer, 1982. Western Virginia \\"Cherokee\\" were reported at Cherokee Falls, today's Valley Falls of the Tygart Valley.Wonderful West Virginia articles \\"Allegeny\\" and Wonderfull W. Virginia September 1973, p.30, \\"Valley Falls Of Old\\", Walter Balderson Indian trader Charles Poke's trading post dates from 1731 with the Calicuas of Cherokee Falls still in the region from the previous century. The \\"London Scribes\\" (The Crown's taxation records) vaguely mentions the colonial Alleghenian location of only a few other early colonial trading locations. A general knowledge of these few outposts are more of traditional telling of some local people. However, an example is the \\"Van Metre\\" trading house mentioned in an earlier edition of the \\"Wonderful West Virginia Magazine\\" being on the South Branches of the upper reaches of the Potomac. Another very early trading house appears on a lower Greenbrier Valley map during the earlier decades of the 18th century. As early as 1719, new arrivals from Europe began to cross the lower Susquehanna River and settle illegally in defiance of the Board of Property in Pennsylvania, on un-warranted land of the northeastern drainage rivers of the Allegheny Mountains. Several Indian Nations requested the removal of \\"Maryland Intruders\\".\\"AN EARLY HISTORY OF HELLAM TOWNSHIP\\", Kreutz Creek Valley Preservation Society, (4/28/2009). 2009-10-25. Some of these moved onward as territory opened up beyond the Alleghenies. The first permanent European settlers west of the Alleghenies have traditionally been considered to have been two New Englanders: Jacob Marlin and Stephen Sewell, who arrived in the Greenbrier Valley in 1749. They built a cabin together at what would become Marlinton, West Virginia, but after disputing over religion, Sewell moved into a nearby hollowed-out sycamore tree. In 1751, surveyor John Lewis (father of Andrew Lewis) discovered the pair. Sewell eventually settled on the eastern side of Sewell Mountain, near present-day Rainelle, West Virginia. They may well have been the first to settle what was then called the \\"western waters\\"‚Äîi.e., in the regions where streams flowed westward to the Gulf of Mexico rather than eastward to the Atlantic. ===First surveys=== The Fry-Jefferson Map (1751) prominently features \\"The Allagany Ridge of Mountains\\". Among the first whites to penetrate into the Allegheny Mountains were surveyors attempting to settle a dispute over the extent of lands belonging to either Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron or to the English Privy Council. An expedition of 1736 by John Savage established the location of the source of the North Branch Potomac River. In March 1742, a frontiersman named John Howard‚Äîalong with his son and others‚Äîhad been commissioned by Governor Gooch to explore the southwest of Virginia as far as the Mississippi River. Following Cedar Creek through the Natural Bridge, they floated in buffalo-skin boats down the New, Coal, Kanawha, and Ohio Rivers to the Mississippi. Although captured by the French before he reached Natchez, Howard was eventually released and (in 1745) was interviewed by Fairfax. Howard's description of the South Branch Potomac River resulted in the definite decision by Fairfax to secure his lands in the region.Brown, Jr., Stuart E. (1965), Virginia Baron: The Story of Thomas 6th Lord Fairfax, Berryville, Virginia: Chesapeake Book Company, pp 98-99. An expedition under Peter Jefferson and Thomas Lewis in the following year emplaced the \\"Fairfax Stone\\" at the source of the North Branch and established a line of demarcation (the \\"Fairfax Line\\") extending from the stone south-east to the headwaters of the Rappahannock River. Lewis' journal of that expedition provides a valuable view of the Allegheny country before its settlement.The Fairfax Line: Thomas Lewis's Journal of 1746; Footnotes and index by John Wayland, Newmarket, Virginia: The Henkel Press (1925 publication). Jefferson and Joshua Fry's \\"Fry-Jefferson Map\\" of 1751 accurately depicted the Alleghenies for the first time. In the following decades, pioneer settlers arrived in the Alleghenies, especially during Colonial Virginia's Robert Dinwiddie era (1751‚Äì58). These included squatters by the Quit-rent Law. Some had preceded the official surveyors using a \\"hack on the tree and field of corn\\" marking land ownership approved by the Virginia Colonial Governor who had to be replaced with Governor John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore. ===First roads=== A 1775 map of the Allegheny Plateau and Mountain Range. Trans- Allegheny travel had been facilitated when a military trail‚ÄîBraddock Road‚Äîwas blazed and opened by the Ohio Company in 1751. (It followed an earlier Indian and pioneer trail known as Nemacolin's Path.) Braddock Road connected Cumberland, Maryland (the upper limit of navigation on the Potomac River) and the forks of the Ohio River (the future Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). It received its name from the British leader of the French and Indian War (1754‚Äì63), General Edward Braddock, who led the ill-fated Braddock expedition four years later. In addition to the war, hunting and trading with Indians were primary motivations for white movement across the mountains. Permanent white settlement of the northern Alleghenies was facilitated by the explorations and stories of such noted Marylanders as the Indian fighter and trader Thomas Cresap (1702‚Äì90) and the backwoodsman and hunter Meshach Browning (1781‚Äì1859).Browning, Meshach (1859), Forty-Four Years of the Life of a Hunter; Being Reminiscences of Meshach Browning, a Maryland Hunter; Roughly Written Down by Himself, Revised and illustrated by E. Stabler. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott & Co.. In the late 18th century, a massive migration to the Monongahela River basin took place over three main routes: along the old Braddock Road via Winchester, Virginia; through the Shenandoah Valley to the head of the Cheat River and from there to the Monongahela; and along the Lincoln Highway to Ligonier, Pennsylvania, and thence along Jacob's Creek to the Monongahela. These immigrants were predominantly Scotch-Irish, German, and, to a lesser extent, British stock.Leckey, Howard Louis, The Tenmile Country and Its Pioneer Families: A Genealogical History of the Upper Monongahela Valley; Waynesburg Republican, 1950, with index 1977. The Braddock Road was superseded by the Cumberland Road‚Äîalso called the National Road‚Äîone of the first major improved highways in the United States to be built by the federal government. Construction began in 1811 at Cumberland and the road reached Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia) on the Ohio River in 1818. Just to the south, the state-funded Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike was constructed to provide a direct route for the settlements of the Shenandoah Valley to the Ohio River by way of the Tygart Valley and Little Kanawha Rivers. Planned and approved in 1826 and completed in 1848, the Staunton and Parkersburg was maintained by fees (tolls) collected at toll houses placed at regular intervals. ===First railroads and canals=== Construction on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad began at Baltimore in 1828; the B&O; traversed the Alleghenies, changing the economy and society of the Mountains forever. The B&O; had reached Martinsburg, (West) Virginia by May 1842, Hancock, (West) Virginia, by June, Cumberland, Maryland, on November 5, 1842, Piedmont, (West) Virginia on July 21, 1851, and Fairmont, (West) Virginia on June 22, 1852. (It finally reached its Ohio River terminus at Wheeling, (West) Virginia on January 1, 1853.) The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal‚Äîalso begun in 1828, but at Georgetown‚Äîwas also a public work of enormous economic and social significance for the Alleghenies. It approached Hancock, Maryland, by 1839. From the beginning, the B&O; Railroad and the C&O; Canal operated in bitter legal and commercial competition with one another as they vied for rights to the narrow strips of land along the Potomac.Lynch, John A., Justice Douglas, the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal, and Maryland Legal History, University of Baltimore Law Forum 35 (Spring 2005): 104‚Äì125 When the Canal finally reached Cumberland in 1850, the Railroad had already arrived eight years before.Mackintosh, Barry (1991), C&O; Canal: The Making of A Park, Washington, D.C.: National Park Service, Department of the Interior, pg 1. Debt-ridden, the Canal company dropped its plan to continue construction of the next of the Canal into the Ohio Valley.Hahn, Thomas F. Swiftwater (1984), The Chesapeake & Ohio Canal: Pathway to the Nation's Capital, Metuchen, New Jersey: The Scarecrow Press, Inc., pg 7. The company had long realized‚Äîespecially with the difficult experience of digging the Paw Paw Tunnel‚Äîthat the original plan of construction over the mountains and all the way down the Youghiogheny River to Pittsburgh was \\"wildly unrealistic\\".Kytle, Elizabeth (1983), Home on the Canal, Cabin John, MD: Seven Locks Press, pg 61 [Note #10]. Public works financed at the state level were not lacking during this period. The Main Line of Public Works was a railroad and canal system across southern Pennsylvania between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Built between 1826 and 1834 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, it included the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad, the Allegheny Portage Railroad and the Pennsylvania Canal system. Actual and proposed routes of the C&O; Canal through the Alleghenies. ===Civil War=== Lying astride the border separating the Union and Confederacy, the Alleghenies were among the areas most directly affected by the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865). One of the earliest campaigns of the War was fought for control of the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike and for the access it provided to the B&O; Railroad. The Battle of Rich Mountain (July 11, 1861) gave the Federals control of the turnpike, of Tygart's Valley, and of all of the territory of western Virginia to the north and west, including the railroad. (Union General George McClellan's victory in this theater would ultimately bring him promotion to commander the Army of the Potomac.) The Federals fortified at Cheat Summit, and the Confederates established strongholds at Camp Bartow and Camp Allegheny. Here they faced each other warily through the fall of 1861 and the following winter. General Robert E. Lee's attempt to attack Cheat Summit Fort (September 12‚Äì15, 1861) and Federal attempts to attack Bartow and Allegheny, all failed to change the strategic stalemate. Finally, the harsh, high elevation winter achieved what the troops had failed to accomplish, and in the spring of 1862 both armies moved on down the pike to the Battle of McDowell (May 8, 1862), and then on to fight what became General Stonewall Jackson's Shenandoah Valley Campaign (spring 1862). Two years later, much of this contested area (along with much else) became part of the new state of West Virginia. The very rugged terrain of the Alleghenies was not at all amenable to a large-scale maneuver war and so the actions that the area witnessed for the remainder of the conflict were generally guerrilla in nature. ===Coal and timber industries=== With the further spread of the railroad networks in the 1890s and early 1900s, many new towns developed and thrived in the Alleghenies. The lumbering and coal industries that boomed in the wake of the railroads brought a measure of prosperity to the region, but most of the revenues flowed out of the mountains to the cities of the eastern seaboard where the captains of industry were headquartered. This inequity created a bitter legacy that would last for generations and form the foundation of the mountaineers' poverty and the area's immense environmental degradation. The most momentous disaster to afflict the people of the Alleghenies was the Johnstown Flood‚Äîlocally known as the \\"Great Flood of 1889\\"‚Äîwhich occurred on May 31 of that year after the catastrophic failure of the South Fork Dam on the Little Conemaugh River upstream of the town of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The dam broke after several days of extremely heavy rainfall, unleashing 20 million tons of water (18 million cubic meters) from the reservoir known as Lake Conemaugh. (This body of water had been built as part of the Main Line of Public Works, then abandoned.) With a flow rate that temporarily equalled that of the Mississippi River,Sid Perkins, \\"Johnstown Flood matched volume of Mississippi River\\" , Science News, Vol.176 #11, 21 November 2009, accessed 14 October 2012 the flood killed 2,209 people and caused US$17 million of damage (about $425 million in 2012 dollars). The American Red Cross, led by Clara Barton and with 50 volunteers, undertook a major disaster relief effort. Support for victims came from all over the United States and 18 foreign countries. After the flood, survivors suffered a series of legal defeats in their attempts to recover damages from the dam's owners. Public indignation at that failure prompted the development in American law changing a fault-based regime to strict liability. ===20th century=== In the 1920s and '30s, Allegheny highways were extensively paved to provide access for automobiles. From the 1950s to 1992, the United States government maintained a top secret continuity program known as Project Greek Island at The Greenbrier hotel in the Alleghenies of southern West Virginia. In August 1963, at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. referenced the Allegheniesamong several in an evocative list of mountainsin his famous \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech, when he said \\"Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!\\" ===21st century=== The Flight 93 National Memorial is located at the site of the crash of United Airlines Flight 93‚Äîwhich was hijacked in the September 11 attacks‚Äîin Stonycreek Township, Pennsylvania, about north of Shanksville. The memorial honors the passengers and crew of Flight 93, who stopped Al-Qaeda terrorists from reaching their intended target. ==Photo gallery== File:North Fork Mountain - Looking South from Nelson Sods.jpgNorth Fork Mountain, West Virginia, looking south Image:Dome 3136.jpgBlue Knob, Pennsylvania, the northernmost 3,000 footer in the Alleghenies.

The Donghae Nambu Line is a railway line connecting Busan to Pohang in South Korea. The line runs along South Korea's east coast. On December 30, 2016, it was merged into Donghae Line. ==History== On October 31, 1918, an extension of the Daegu Line reached Pohang. The section from Gyeongju to Pohang would become the oldest part of the future Donghae Nambu Line. On October 25, 1921, a branch of the Daegu Line from Gyeongju to Ulsan (Taehwagang) was opened. On December 16, 1935, Busan and Ulsan were linked up through the opening of the section Jwacheon‚ÄìUlsan. The new line and the two older sections built as part of the Daegu Line were combined into the new Donghae Nambu Line, with a length of from Busanjin to Pohang. ===Upgrade=== As of 2010, most of the line remains single-track and unelectrified. The entire line is to be upgraded to an electrified-double-tracked railway. Busan‚ÄìUlsan Planning for the upgrading of the line started in 1990 already, with the primary aim to improve commuter traffic; construction started in June 2003. The section gets a new 72.1 km long alignment with several tunnels. Korea Rail Network Authority, Busan, and Ulsan city government is undertaking the upgrade. As of 2010, construction progress reached 32% of the total budget of 2,268.9 billion won. The completion of the upgrade is foreseen for 2015. On September 1, 2010, the South Korean government announced a strategic plan to reduce travel times from Seoul to 95% of the country to under 2 hours by 2020. As part of the plan, the Busan‚ÄìUlsan section of the Donghae Nambu Line is to be further upgraded for 230 km/h. Ulsan‚ÄìGyeongju‚ÄìPohang The line is to be replaced by a completely new alignment that circumvents downtown Gyeongju and connects to the Gyeongbu High Speed Railway at Singyeongju Station. In 2003, a feasibility study was prepared for the section. Detailed design was started, and in May 2007, the government expected to realise the project from 2008 to 2011 at the earliest. The project was finally approved by the government on April 23, 2009, and a ground-breaking ceremony was held. The altogether 76.56 km line was slated to be opened in December 2014, with a total budget of 2,328.899 billion won. In January 2010, the early completion of the Pohang branch was confirmed by the government. ==Stations== Major stations and junctions along the line include (in order): *Busan Station, terminus of the Gyeongbu Line; *Busanjin Station, also on the Gyeongbu Line, just north of Busan Station; *Beomil Station, terminus of the Gaya Line; *Bujeon Station, terminus of the Bujeon Line; *Dongnae Station *Sinhaeundae Station, a popular resort beach in eastern Busan; *Gijang Station *Namchang Station, terminus of the Onsan Line; *Taehwagang Station (formerly Ulsan), major industrial city and terminus of the Jangsaengpo and Ulsanhang Lines; *Gyeongju Station, historic city and terminus of the Jungang Line; *Hyoja Station, terminus of the Goedong Line; and *Pohang Station, seaport and industrial city. ==Services== The line sees passenger and freight traffic. As of October 2010, from Bujeon Station in Busan, cross-country Mugunghwa-ho trains travel in around 1 hour 25 minutes to Ulsan and in around 2 hours 40 minutes to Pohang. Via the Gyeongbu, Daegu and Jungang Lines, Pohang and Ulsan are connected to Seoul with both intercity Saemaul-ho and cross-country Mugunghwa-ho services. As of 2010, the shortest travel times from Seoul to Pohang are around 5 hours 15 minutes by direct Saemaul service and around 3 hours 40 minutes with transfer to KTX trains at Dongdaegu. After its upgrade is finished, the role of the line as a corridor for freight traffic will be enhanced. == Reuse Abandoned Old Railroad of Donghae Nambu Line == Reuse Abandoned Old Railroad of Donghae Nambu LineThis is an abandoned railroad.

This causes the electron to be emitted (ejected) from the atom.M.E. Rose: \\"Theory of Internal Conversion\\", in: Alpha-, Beta- and Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy, ed. by Kai Siegbahn, North-Holland Publishing, Amsterdam (1966), Vol. 2 Thus, in an internal conversion process, a high-energy electron is emitted from the radioactive atom, but not from the nucleus. For this reason, the high-speed electrons resulting from internal conversion are not called beta particles, since the latter come from beta decay, where they are newly created in the nuclear decay process. Internal conversion is possible whenever gamma decay is possible, except in the case where the atom is fully ionised. During internal conversion, the atomic number does not change, and thus (as is the case with gamma decay) no transmutation of one element to another takes place. Since an electron is lost from the atom, a hole appears in an electron shell which is subsequently filled by other electrons that descend to that empty, lower energy level, and in the process emit characteristic X-ray(s), Auger electron(s), or both. The atom thus emits high-energy electrons and X-ray photons, none of which originate in that nucleus. The atom supplied the energy needed to eject the electron, which in turn caused the latter events and the other emissions. Since primary electrons from internal conversion carry a fixed (large) part of the characteristic decay energy, they have a discrete energy spectrum, rather than the spread (continuous) spectrum characteristic of beta particles. Whereas the energy spectrum of beta particles plots as a broad hump, the energy spectrum of internally converted electrons plots as a single sharp peak (see example below). ==Mechanism== In the quantum mechanical model of the electron, there is a non-zero probability of finding the electron within the nucleus. During the internal conversion process, the wavefunction of an inner shell electron (usually an s electron) is said to penetrate the volume of the atomic nucleus. When this happens, the electron may couple to an excited energy state of the nucleus and take the energy of the nuclear transition directly, without an intermediate gamma ray being first produced. The kinetic energy of the emitted electron is equal to the transition energy in the nucleus, minus the binding energy of the electron to the atom. Most internal conversion (IC) electrons come from the K shell (the 1s state), as these two electrons have the highest probability of being within the nucleus. However, the s states in the L, M, and N shells (i.e., the 2s, 3s, and 4s states) are also able to couple to the nuclear fields and cause IC electron ejections from those shells (called L or M or N internal conversion). Ratios of K-shell to other L, M, or N shell internal conversion probabilities for various nuclides have been prepared. Internal conversion branch tables] An amount of energy exceeding the atomic binding energy of the s electron must be supplied to that electron in order to eject it from the atom to result in IC; that is to say, internal conversion cannot happen if the decay energy of the nucleus is less than a certain threshold. There are a few radionuclides in which the decay energy is not sufficient to convert (eject) a 1s (K shell) electron, and these nuclides, to decay by internal conversion, must decay by ejecting electrons from the L or M or N shells (i.e., by ejecting 2s, 3s, or 4s electrons) as these binding energies are lower. Although s electrons are more likely for IC processes due to their superior nuclear penetration compared to electrons with orbital angular momentum, spectral studies show that p electrons (from shells L and higher) are occasionally ejected in the IC process. After the IC electron has been emitted, the atom is left with a vacancy in one of its electron shells, usually an inner one. This hole will be filled with an electron from one of the higher shells, which causes another outer electron to fill its place in turn, causing a cascade. Consequently, one or more characteristic X-rays or Auger electrons will be emitted as the remaining electrons in the atom cascade down to fill the vacancies. == An example: the decay of 203Hg == Decay scheme of 203Hg Electron spectrum of 203Hg, according to Wapstra et al., Physica 20 (1954) 169 The decay scheme on the left shows that 203Hg produces a continuous beta spectrum with maximum energy 214 keV, that leads to an excited state of the daughter nucleus 203Tl. This state decays very quickly (within 2.8√ó10‚àí10 s) to the ground state of 203Tl, emitting a gamma quantum of 279 keV. The figure on the right shows the electron spectrum of 203Hg, measured by means of a magnetic spectrometer. It includes the continuous beta spectrum and K-, L-, and M-lines due to internal conversion. Since the binding energy of the K electrons in 203Tl amounts to 85 keV, the K line has an energy of 279 - 85 = 194 keV. Because of lesser binding energies, the L- and M-lines have higher energies. Because of the finite energy resolution of the spectrometer, the \\"lines\\" have a Gaussian shape of finite width. ==When the process is expected== Internal conversion (often abbreviated IC) is favoured whenever the energy available for a gamma transition is small, and it is also the primary mode of de-excitation for 0+‚Üí0+ (i.e. E0) transitions. The 0+‚Üí0+ transitions occur where an excited nucleus has zero-spin and positive parity, and decays to a ground state which also has zero-spin and positive parity (such as all nuclides with even numbers of protons and neutrons). In such cases, de-excitation cannot take place by way of emission of a gamma ray, since this would violate conservation of angular momentum, hence other mechanisms like IC predominate. This also shows that internal conversion (contrary to its name) is not a two-step process where a gamma ray would be first emitted and then converted. Internal Conversion Coefficient for E1 transitions for Z = 40, 60, and 80 according to the tables by Sliv and Band, as a function of the transition energy.The competition between internal conversion and gamma decay is quantified in the form of the internal conversion coefficient which is defined as \\\\alpha = e/{\\\\gamma} where e is the rate of conversion electrons and \\\\gamma is the rate of gamma-ray emission observed from a decaying nucleus. For example, in the decay of the excited state at 35 keV of 125Te (which is produced by the decay of 125I), 7% of the decays emit energy as a gamma ray, while 93% release energy as conversion electrons. Therefore, this excited state of has an internal conversion coefficient of \\\\alpha = 93/7 = 13.3. For increasing atomic number (Z) and decreasing gamma-ray energy, internal conversion coefficients are observed to increase. As an example, calculated IC coefficients for electric dipole (E1) transitions, for Z = 40, 60, and 80, are shown in the figure.L. A. Sliv and I. M. Band, Table of Internal Conversion Coefficients, in: Alpha-, Beta- and Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy, ed. by Kai Siegbahn, North- Holland Publishing (1966), Vol. 2, Appendix The energy of the emitted gamma ray is a precise measure of the difference in energy between the excited states of the decaying nucleus. In the case of conversion electrons, the binding energy must also be taken into account: The energy of a conversion electron is given as E = (E_i - E_f)-E_B, where E_i and E_f are the energies of the nucleus in its initial and final states, respectively, while E_B is the binding energy of the electron. ==Similar processes== Nuclei with zero-spin and high excitation energies (more than about 1.022 MeV) are also unable to rid themselves of energy by (single) gamma emission due to the constraint imposed by the conservation of momentum, but they do have sufficient decay energy to decay by pair production. E0 rules In this type of decay, an electron and positron are both emitted from the atom at the same time, and conservation of angular momentum is solved by having these two product particles spin in opposite directions. The internal conversion process should not be confused with the similar photoelectric effect. When a gamma ray emitted by the nucleus of an atom hits a different atom, it may be absorbed producing a photoelectron of well-defined energy (this used to be called \\"external conversion\\"). In internal conversion, however, the process happens within one atom, and without a real intermediate gamma ray. Just as an atom may produce an internal conversion electron in place of a gamma ray if energy is available from within the nucleus, so an atom may produce an Auger electron in place of an X-ray if an electron is missing from one of the low-lying electron shells. (The first process can even precipitate the second one.) Like IC electrons, Auger electrons have a discrete energy, resulting in a sharp energy peak in the spectrum. The electron capture process also involves an inner shell electron, which in this case is retained in the nucleus (changing the atomic number) and leaving the atom (not the nucleus) in an excited state. The atom missing an inner electron can relax by a cascade of X-ray emissions as higher energy electrons in the atom fall to fill the vacancy left in the electron cloud by the captured electron. Such atoms also typically exhibit Auger electron emission. Electron capture, like beta decay, also typically results in excited atomic nuclei, which may then relax to a state of lowest nuclear energy by any of the methods permitted by spin constraints, including gamma decay and internal conversion decay. ==See also== *Internal conversion coefficient == References == ==Further reading== * * * R.W.Howell, Radiation spectra for Auger-electron emitting radionuclides: Report No. 2 of AAPM Nuclear Medicine Task Group No. 6, 1992, Medical Physics 19(6), 1371‚Äì1383 == External links == * HyperPhysics Category:Radioactivity Category:Nuclear physics ","title":"Internal conversion"},{"id":"516757","text":"A display of a variety of early experimental video camera tubes from 1954, with Vladimir K. Zworykin who invented the iconoscope vidicon tube ( in diameter) Video camera tubes were devices based on the cathode ray tube that were used in television cameras to capture television images prior to the introduction of charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensors in the 1980s. Several different types of tubes were in use from the early 1930s to the 1980s. In these tubes, the cathode ray was scanned across an image of the scene to be broadcast. The resultant current was dependent on the brightness of the image on the target. The size of the striking ray was tiny compared to the size of the target, allowing 483 horizontal scan lines per image in the NTSC format, or 576 lines in PAL.NTSC#Lines and refresh rate ==Cathode ray tube== Any vacuum tube which operates using a focused beam of electrons, originally called cathode rays, is known as a cathode ray tube (CRT). These are usually seen as display devices as used in older (i.e., non-flat panel) television receivers and computer displays. The camera pickup tubes described in this article are also CRTs, but they display no image.\\"Cathode-ray tube.\\" McGraw-Hill Concise Encyclopedia of Science & Technology. Third Ed., Sybil P. Parker, ed., McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1992, pp. 332-333. ==Early research== In June 1908, the scientific journal Nature published a letter in which Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton, fellow of the Royal Society (UK), discussed how a fully electronic television system could be realized by using cathode ray tubes (or \\"Braun\\" tubes, after their inventor, Karl Braun) as both imaging and display devices. He noted that the \\"real difficulties lie in devising an efficient transmitter\\", and that it was possible that \\"no photoelectric phenomenon at present known will provide what is required\\". A cathode ray tube was successfully demonstrated as a displaying device by the German Professor Max Dieckmann in 1906, his experimental results were published by the journal Scientific American in 1909. Campbell-Swinton later expanded on his vision in a presidential address given to the R√∂ntgen Society in November 1911. The photoelectric screen in the proposed transmitting device was a mosaic of isolated rubidium cubes. His concept for a fully electronic television system was later popularized by Hugo Gernsback as the \\"Campbell-Swinton Electronic Scanning System\\" in the August 1915 issue of the popular magazine Electrical Experimenter. In a letter to Nature published in October 1926, Campbell- Swinton also announced the results of some \\"not very successful experiments\\" he had conducted with G. M. Minchin and J. C. M. Stanton. They had attempted to generate an electrical signal by projecting an image onto a selenium-coated metal plate that was simultaneously scanned by a cathode ray beam. These experiments were conducted before March 1914, when Minchin died, but they were later repeated by two different teams in 1937, by H. Miller and J. W. Strange from EMI, and by H. Iams and A. Rose from RCA. Both teams succeeded in transmitting \\"very faint\\" images with the original Campbell-Swinton's selenium-coated plate, but much better images were obtained when the metal plate was covered with zinc sulphide or selenide, or with aluminum or zirconium oxide treated with caesium. These experiments would form the base of the future vidicon. A description of a CRT imaging device also appeared in a patent application filed by Edvard-Gustav Schoultz in France in August 1921, and published in 1922, although a working device was not demonstrated until some years later. ==Image dissector== Farnsworth image dissector tube from 1931 An image dissector is a camera tube that creates an \\"electron image\\" of a scene from photocathode emissions (electrons) which pass through a scanning aperture to an anode, which serves as an electron detector.Horowitz, Paul and Winfield Hill, The Art of Electronics, Second Edition, Cambridge University Press, 1989, pp. 1000-1001. . Among the first to design such a device were German inventors Max Dieckmann and Rudolf Hell, who had titled their 1925 patent application Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerr√∂hre f√ºr Fernseher (Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television). The term may apply specifically to a dissector tube employing magnetic fields to keep the electron image in focus, an element lacking in Dieckmann and Hell's design, and in the early dissector tubes built by American inventor Philo Farnsworth. Dieckmann and Hell submitted their application to the German patent office in April 1925, and a patent was issued in October 1927. Their experiments on the image dissector were announced in the volume 8 (September 1927) of the popular magazine Discovery and in the May 1928 issue of the magazine Popular Radio. However, they never transmitted a clear and well focused image with such a tube. In January 1927, American inventor and television pioneer Philo T. Farnsworth applied for a patent for his Television System that included a device for \\"the conversion and dissecting of light\\". Its first moving image was successfully transmitted on September 7 of 1927, and a patent was issued in 1930. Farnsworth quickly made improvements to the device, among them introducing an electron multiplier made of nickel and using a \\"longitudinal magnetic field\\" in order to sharply focus the electron image. The improved device was demonstrated to the press in early September 1928.Farnsworth, Elma, Distant Vision: Romance and Discovery on an Invisible Frontier, Salt Lake City, PemberlyKent, 1989, pp. 108-109. The introduction of a multipactor in October 1933 and a multi-dynode \\"electron multiplier\\" in 1937 made Farnsworth's image dissector the first practical version of a fully electronic imaging device for television.Abramson, Albert (1987), The History of Television, 1880 to 1941. Jefferson, NC: Albert Abramson. p. 159. . Unfortunately, it had very poor light sensitivity, and was therefore primarily useful only where illumination was exceptionally high (typically over 685 cd/m¬≤). However, it was ideal for industrial applications, such as monitoring the bright interior of an industrial furnace. Due to their poor light sensitivity, image dissectors were rarely used in television broadcasting, except to scan film and other transparencies. In April 1933, Farnsworth submitted a patent application also entitled Image Dissector, but which actually detailed a CRT-type camera tube. This is among the first patents to propose the use of a \\"low-velocity\\" scanning beam and RCA had to buy it in order to sell image orthicon tubes to the general public. However, Farnsworth never transmitted a clear and well focused image with such a tube. ===Operation=== The optical system of the image dissector focuses an image onto a photocathode mounted inside a high vacuum. As light strikes the photocathode, electrons are emitted in proportion to the intensity of the light (see photoelectric effect). The entire electron image is deflected and a scanning aperture permits only those electrons emanating from a very small area of the photocathode to be captured by the detector at any given time. The output from the detector is an electric current whose magnitude is a measure of the brightness of the corresponding area of the image. The electron image is periodically deflected horizontally and vertically (\\"raster scanning\\") such that the entire image is read by the detector many times per second, producing an electrical signal that can be conveyed to a display device, such as a CRT monitor, to reproduce the image. The image dissector has no \\"charge storage\\" characteristic; the vast majority of electrons emitted by the photocathode are excluded by the scanning aperture, and thus wasted rather than being stored on a photo-sensitive target, as in the iconoscope or image orthicon (see below), which largely accounts for its low light sensitivity. ==Iconoscope== Zworykin holding an iconoscope tube Diagram of the iconoscope, from Zworykin's 1931 patent An iconoscope is a camera tube that projects an image on a special charge storage plate containing a mosaic of electrically isolated photosensitive granules separated from a common plate by a thin layer of isolating material, somewhat analogous to the human eye's retina and its arrangement of photoreceptors. Each photosensitive granule constitutes a tiny capacitor that accumulates and stores electrical charge in response to the light striking it. An electron beam periodically sweeps across the plate, effectively scanning the stored image and discharging each capacitor in turn such that the electrical output from each capacitor is proportional to the average intensity of the light striking it between each discharge event. The problem of low sensitivity to light resulting in low electrical output from transmitting or camera tubes would be solved with the introduction of charge- storage technology by the Hungarian engineer K√°lm√°n Tihanyi in the beginning of 1925.\\"K√°lm√°n Tihanyi (1897‚Äì1947)\\", IEC Techline, International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), 2009-07-15. His solution was a camera tube that accumulated and stored electrical charges (photoelectrons) within the tube throughout each scanning cycle. The device was first described in a patent application he filed in Hungary in March 1926 for a television system he dubbed Radioskop.\\"K√°lm√°n Tihanyi's 1926 Patent Application 'Radioskop'\\", Memory of the World, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), 2005, retrieved 2009-01-29. After further refinements included in a 1928 patent application, Tihanyi's patent was declared void in Great Britain in 1930,Tihanyi, Koloman, Improvements in television apparatus. European Patent Office, Patent No. GB313456. Convention date UK application: 1928-06-11, declared void and published: 1930-11-11, retrieved: 2013-04-25. and so he applied for patents in the United States. In 1923, while employed by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Russian- born American engineer Vladimir Zworykin presented a project for a totally electronic television system to the company's general manager. In July 1925, Zworykin submitted a patent application titled Television System that included a charge storage plate constructed of a thin layer of isolating material (aluminum oxide) sandwiched between a screen (300 mesh) and a colloidal deposit of photoelectric material (potassium hydride) consisting of isolated globules. The following description can be read between lines 1 and 9 in page 2: \\"The photoelectric material, such as potassium hydride, is evaporated on the aluminum oxide, or other insulating medium, and treated so as to form a colloidal deposit of potassium hydride consisting of minute globules. Each globule is very active photoelectrically and constitutes, to all intents and purposes, a minute individual photoelectric cell\\". Its first image was transmitted in late summer of 1925, and a patent was issued in 1928. However the quality of the transmitted image failed to impress H.P. Davis, the general manager of Westinghouse, and Zworykin was asked \\"to work on something useful\\". A patent for a television system was also filed by Zworykin in 1923, but this filing is not a definitive reference because extensive revisions were done before a patent was issued fifteen years later and the file itself was divided into two patents in 1931. The first practical iconoscope was constructed in 1931 by Sanford Essig, when he accidentally left a silvered mica sheet in the oven too long. Upon examination with a microscope, he noticed that the silver layer had broken up into a myriad of tiny isolated silver globules. He also noticed that, \\"the tiny dimension of the silver droplets would enhance the image resolution of the iconoscope by a quantum leap.\\" As head of television development at Radio Corporation of America (RCA), Zworykin submitted a patent application in November 1931, and it was issued in 1935. Nevertheless, Zworykin's team was not the only engineering group working on devices that used a charge storage plate. In 1932, the EMI engineers Tedham and McGee under the supervision of Isaac Shoenberg applied for a patent for a new device they dubbed the \\"Emitron\\". A 405-line broadcasting service employing the Emitron began at studios in Alexandra Palace in 1936, and patents were issued in the United Kingdom in 1934 and in the US in 1937. The iconoscope was presented to the general public at a press conference in June 1933, and two detailed technical papers were published in September and October of the same year. Unlike the Farnsworth image dissector, the Zworykin iconoscope was much more sensitive, useful with an illumination on the target between 4ft-c (43lx) and 20ft-c (215lx). It was also easier to manufacture and produced a very clear image. The iconoscope was the primary camera tube used by RCA broadcasting from 1936 until 1946, when it was replaced by the image orthicon tube. ==Super-Emitron and image iconoscope== The original iconoscope was noisy, had a high ratio of interference to signal, and ultimately gave disappointing results, especially when compared to the high definition mechanical scanning systems then becoming available. The EMI team under the supervision of Isaac Shoenberg analyzed how the Emitron (or iconoscope) produces an electronic signal and concluded that its real efficiency was only about 5% of the theoretical maximum. This is because secondary electrons released from the mosaic of the charge storage plate when the scanning beam sweeps across it may be attracted back to the positively charged mosaic, thus neutralizing many of the stored charges. Lubszynski, Rodda, and McGee realized that the best solution was to separate the photo-emission function from the charge storage one, and so communicated their results to Zworykin. The new video camera tube developed by Lubszynski, Rodda and McGee in 1934 was dubbed \\"the super- Emitron\\". This tube is a combination of the image dissector and the Emitron. It has an efficient photocathode that transforms the scene light into an electron image; the latter is then accelerated towards a target specially prepared for the emission of secondary electrons. Each individual electron from the electron image produces several secondary electrons after reaching the target, so that an amplification effect is produced. The target is constructed of a mosaic of electrically isolated metallic granules separated from a common plate by a thin layer of isolating material, so that the positive charge resulting from the secondary emission is stored in the granules. Finally, an electron beam periodically sweeps across the target, effectively scanning the stored image, discharging each granule, and producing an electronic signal like in the iconoscope. The super-Emitron was between ten and fifteen times more sensitive than the original Emitron and iconoscope tubes and, in some cases, this ratio was considerably greater. It was used for an outside broadcast by the BBC, for the first time, on Armistice Day 1937, when the general public could watch in a television set how the King laid a wreath at the Cenotaph. This was the first time that anyone could broadcast a live street scene from cameras installed on the roof of neighboring buildings. On the other hand, in 1934, Zworykin shared some patent rights with the German licensee company Telefunken. The image iconoscope (Superikonoskop in Germany) was produced as a result of the collaboration. This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron, but the target is constructed of a thin layer of isolating material placed on top of a conductive base, the mosaic of metallic granules is missing. The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and image iconoscope in Europe were not affected by the patent war between Zworykin and Farnsworth, because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image dissector, having submitted a patent application for their Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerr√∂hre f√ºr Fernseher (Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television) in Germany in 1925, two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States. The image iconoscope (Superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the vidicon and plumbicon tubes. Indeed, it was the representative of the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the image orthicon. The German company Heimann produced the Superikonoskop for the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, later Heimann also produced and commercialized it from 1940 to 1955, finally the Dutch company Philips produced and commercialized the image iconoscope and multicon from 1952 to 1958. ===Operation=== The super-Emitron is a combination of the image dissector and the Emitron. The scene image is projected onto an efficient continuous-film semitransparent photocathode that transforms the scene light into a light-emitted electron image, the latter is then accelerated (and focused) via electromagnetic fields towards a target specially prepared for the emission of secondary electrons. Each individual electron from the electron image produces several secondary electrons after reaching the target, so that an amplification effect is produced, and the resulting positive charge is proportional to the integrated intensity of the scene light. The target is constructed of a mosaic of electrically isolated metallic granules separated from a common plate by a thin layer of isolating material, so that the positive charge resulting from the secondary emission is stored in the capacitor formed by the metallic granule and the common plate. Finally, an electron beam periodically sweeps across the target, effectively scanning the stored image and discharging each capacitor in turn such that the electrical output from each capacitor is proportional to the average intensity of the scene light between each discharge event (as in the iconoscope). The image iconoscope is essentially identical to the super-Emitron, but the target is constructed of a thin layer of isolating material placed on top of a conductive base, the mosaic of metallic granules is missing. Therefore, secondary electrons are emitted from the surface of the isolating material when the electron image reaches the target, and the resulting positive charges are stored directly onto the surface of the isolated material. ==Orthicon and CPS Emitron== The original iconoscope was very noisy due to the secondary electrons released from the photoelectric mosaic of the charge storage plate when the scanning beam swept it across. An obvious solution was to scan the mosaic with a low-velocity electron beam which produced less energy in the neighborhood of the plate such that no secondary electrons were emitted at all. That is, an image is projected onto the photoelectric mosaic of a charge storage plate, so that positive charges are produced and stored there due to photo-emission and capacitance, respectively. These stored charges are then gently discharged by a low-velocity electron scanning beam, preventing the emission of secondary electrons. Not all the electrons in the scanning beam may be absorbed in the mosaic, because the stored positive charges are proportional to the integrated intensity of the scene light. The remaining electrons are then deflected back into the anode, captured by a special grid, or deflected back into an electron multiplier. Low-velocity scanning beam tubes have several advantages; there are low levels of spurious signals and high efficiency of conversion of light into signal, so that the signal output is maximum. However, there are serious problems as well, because the electron beam spreads and accelerates in a direction parallel to the target when it scans the image's borders and corners, so that it produces secondary electrons and one gets an image that is well focused in the center but blurry in the borders. Henroteau was among the first inventors to propose in 1929 the use of low-velocity electrons for stabilizing the potential of a charge storage plate, but Lubszynski and the EMI team were the first engineers in transmitting a clear and well focused image with such a tube. Another improvement is the use of a semitransparent charge storage plate. The scene image is then projected onto the back side of the plate, while the low- velocity electron beam scans the photoelectric mosaic at the front side. This configurations allows the use of a straight camera tube, because the scene to be transmitted, the charge storage plate, and the electron gun can be aligned one after the other. The first fully functional low-velocity scanning beam tube, the CPS Emitron, was invented and demonstrated by the EMI team under the supervision of Isaac Shoenberg. In 1934, the EMI engineers Blumlein and McGee filed for patents for television transmitting systems where a charge storage plate was shielded by a pair of special grids, a negative (or slightly positive) grid lay very close to the plate, and a positive one was placed further away. The velocity and energy of the electrons in the scanning beam were reduced to zero by the decelerating electric field generated by this pair of grids, and so a low-velocity scanning beam tube was obtained. The EMI team kept working on these devices, and Lubszynski discovered in 1936 that a clear image could be produced if the trajectory of the low-velocity scanning beam was nearly perpendicular (orthogonal) to the charge storage plate in a neighborhood of it. The resulting device was dubbed the cathode potential stabilized Emitron, or CPS Emitron. The industrial production and commercialization of the CPS Emitron had to wait until the end of the second world war. On the other side of the Atlantic, the RCA team led by Albert Rose began working in 1937 on a low-velocity scanning beam device they dubbed the orthicon. Iams and Rose solved the problem of guiding the beam and keeping it in focus by installing specially designed deflection plates and deflection coils near the charge storage plate to provide a uniform axial magnetic field. The orthicon was the tube used in RCA's television demonstration at the 1939 New York World's Fair, its performance was similar to the image iconoscope's one, but it was also unstable under sudden flashes of bright light, producing \\"the appearance of a large drop of water evaporating slowly over part of the scene\\". ==Image orthicon== Schematic of image orthicon tube A 1960s-era RCA Radiotron Image Orthicon TV Camera Tube The image orthicon (sometimes abbreviated IO), was common in American broadcasting from 1946 until 1968.Abramson, Albert, The History of Television, 1942 to 2000, McFarland, 2003, p. 124. . A combination of the image dissector and the orthicon technologies, it replaced the iconoscope in the United States, which required a great deal of light to work adequately. The image orthicon tube was developed at RCA by Albert Rose, Paul K. Weimer, and Harold B. Law. It represented a considerable advance in the television field, and after further development work, RCA created original models between 1939 and 1940.Abramson, Albert, The History of Television, 1942 to 2000, McFarland, 2003, pp. 7‚Äì8. . The National Defense Research Committee entered into a contract with RCA where the NDRC paid for its further development. Upon RCA's development of the more sensitive image orthicon tube in 1943, RCA entered into a production contract with the U.S. Navy, the first tubes being delivered in January 1944.Remington Rand Inc., v. U.S., 120 F. Supp. 912, 913 (1944). RCA began production of image orthicons for civilian use in the second quarter of 1946.aade.com RCA 2P23, One of the earliest image orthicons While the iconoscope and the intermediate orthicon used capacitance between a multitude of small but discrete light sensitive collectors and an isolated signal plate for reading video information, the image orthicon employed direct charge readings from a continuous electronically charged collector. The resultant signal was immune to most extraneous signal crosstalk from other parts of the target, and could yield extremely detailed images. For instance, image orthicon cameras were still being used by NASA for capturing Apollo/Saturn rockets nearing orbit, although the television networks had phased the cameras out. Only they could provide sufficient detail.The University of Alabama Telescopic Tracking of the Apollo Lunar Missions An image orthicon camera can take television pictures by candlelight because of the more ordered light-sensitive area and the presence of an electron multiplier at the base of the tube, which operated as a high- efficiency amplifier. It also has a logarithmic light sensitivity curve similar to the human eye. However, it tends to flare in bright light, causing a dark halo to be seen around the object; this anomaly was referred to as blooming in the broadcast industry when image orthicon tubes were in operation.dtic.mil Westinghouse Non-blooming Image Orthicon. Image orthicons were used extensively in the early color television cameras, where the increased sensitivity of the tube was essential to overcome the very inefficient optical system of the camera.oai.dtic.mil Non-blooming Image Orthicon. The image orthocon tube was at one point colloquially referred to as an Immy. Harry Lubcke, the then-President of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, decided to have their award named after this nickname. Since the statuette was female, it was feminized into Emmy. ===Operation=== An image orthicon consists of three parts: a photocathode with an image store (target), a scanner that reads this image (an electron gun), and a multistage electron multiplier.roysvintagevideo.741.com 3\\" image orthicon camera project In the image store, light falls upon the photocathode which is a photosensitive plate at a very negative potential (approx. -600 V), and is converted into an electron image (a principle borrowed from the image dissector). This electron rain is then accelerated towards the target (a very thin glass plate acting as a semi-isolator) at ground potential (0 V), and passes through a very fine wire mesh (nearly 200 wires per cm), very near (a few hundredths of a cm) and parallel to the target, acting as a screen grid at a slightly positive voltage (approx +2 V). Once the image electrons reach the target, they cause a splash of electrons by the effect of secondary emission. On average, each image electron ejects several splash electrons (thus adding amplification by secondary emission), and these excess electrons are soaked up by the positive mesh effectively removing electrons from the target and causing a positive charge on it in relation to the incident light in the photocathode. The result is an image painted in positive charge, with the brightest portions having the largest positive charge. acmi.net.au The Image Orthicon (Television Camera) Tube c. 1940 - 1960 A sharply focused beam of electrons (a cathode ray) is generated by the electron gun at ground potential and accelerated by the anode (the first dynode of the electron multiplier) around the gun at a high positive voltage (approx. +1500 V). Once it exits the electron gun, its inertia makes the beam move away from the dynode towards the back side of the target. At this point the electrons lose speed and get deflected by the horizontal and vertical deflection coils, effectively scanning the target. Thanks to the axial magnetic field of the focusing coil, this deflection is not in a straight line, thus when the electrons reach the target they do so perpendicularly avoiding a sideways component. The target is nearly at ground potential with a small positive charge, thus when the electrons reach the target at low speed they are absorbed without ejecting more electrons. This adds negative charge to the positive charge until the region being scanned reaches some threshold negative charge, at which point the scanning electrons are reflected by the negative potential rather than absorbed (in this process the target recovers the electrons needed for the next scan). These reflected electrons return down the cathode ray tube toward the first dynode of the electron multiplier surrounding the electron gun which is at high potential. The number of reflected electrons is a linear measure of the target's original positive charge, which, in turn, is a measure of brightness.fazano.pro.br The Image Converter ===Dark halo=== Dark halo around bright rocket flame in television of John Glenn's liftoff of Mercury-Atlas 6 in 1962 The mysterious dark \\"orthicon halo\\" around bright objects in an IO-captured image is based on the fact that the IO relies on the emission of photoelectrons, but very bright illumination can produce more of them locally than the device can successfully deal with. At a very bright point on a captured image, a great preponderance of electrons is ejected from the photosensitive plate. So many may be ejected that the corresponding point on the collection mesh can no longer soak them up, and thus they fall back to nearby spots on the target instead, much as water splashes in a ring when a rock is thrown into it. Since the resultant splashed electrons do not contain sufficient energy to eject further electrons where they land, they will instead neutralize any positive charge that has been built-up in that region. Since darker images produce less positive charge on the target, the excess electrons deposited by the splash will be read as a dark region by the scanning electron beam. This effect was actually cultivated by tube manufacturers to a certain extent, as a small, carefully controlled amount of the dark halo has the effect of crispening the visual image due to the contrast effect. (That is, giving the illusion of being more sharply focused than it actually is). The later vidicon tube and its descendants (see below) do not exhibit this effect, and so could not be used for broadcast purposes until special detail correction circuitry could be developed.morpheustechnology.com Morpheus Technology 4.5.1 Camera Tubes ==Vidicon== A vidicon tube is a video camera tube design in which the target material is a photoconductor. The vidicon was developed in the 1950s at RCA by P. K. Weimer, S. V. Forgue and R. R. Goodrich as a simple alternative to the structurally and electrically complex image orthicon. While the initial photoconductor used was selenium, other targets‚Äîincluding silicon diode arrays‚Äîhave been used. Schematic of vidicon tube. The vidicon is a storage- type camera tube in which a charge-density pattern is formed by the imaged scene radiation on a photoconductive surface which is then scanned by a beam of low-velocity electrons. The fluctuating voltage coupled out to a video amplifier can be used to reproduce the scene being imaged. The electrical charge produced by an image will remain in the face plate until it is scanned or until the charge dissipates. By using a pyroelectric material such as triglycene sulphate (TGS) as the target, a vidicon sensitive over a broad portion of the infrared spectrum is possible. This technology was a precursor to modern microbolometer technology. Prior to the design and construction of the Galileo probe to Jupiter in the late 1970s to early 1980s, NASA used vidicon cameras on nearly all the unmanned deep space probes equipped with the remote sensing ability. Vidicon tubes were also used aboard the first three Landsat earth imaging satellites launched in 1972, as part of each spacecraft's Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) imaging system. The Uvicon, a UV- variant Vidicon was also used by NASA for UV duties. Vidicon tubes were popular in 1970s and 1980s, after which they were rendered obsolete by solid- state image sensors, with the charge-coupled device (CCD) and then the CMOS sensor. All vidicon and similar tubes are prone to image lag, better known as ghosting, smearing, burn-in, comet tails, luma trails and luminance blooming. Image lag is visible as noticeable (usually white or colored) trails that appear after a bright object (such as a light or reflection) has moved, leaving a trail that eventually fades into the image. The trail itself does not move, rather it progressively fades as time passes, so areas that were exposed first fade before areas that were later exposed fade. It cannot be avoided or eliminated, as it is inherent to the technology. To what degree the image generated by the vidicon is affected will depend on the properties of the target material used on the vidicon, and the capacitance of the target material (known as the storage effect) as well as the resistance of the electron beam used to scan the target. The higher the capacitance of the target, the higher the charge it can hold and the longer it will take for the trail to disappear. The remmanant charges on the target eventually dissipate making the trail disappear. http://www.avartifactatlas.com/artifacts/image_lag.html The electron gun from an RCA Vidicon camera tube. ===Plumbicon (1963)=== Plumbicon is a registered trademark of Philips from 1963, for its lead(II) oxide (PbO) target vidicons. Used frequently in broadcast camera applications, these tubes have low output, but a high signal-to-noise ratio. They have excellent resolution compared to image orthicons, but lack the artificially sharp edges of IO tubes, which cause some of the viewing audience to perceive them as softer. CBS Labs invented the first outboard edge enhancement circuits to sharpen the edges of Plumbicon generated images. Philips received the 1966 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for the Plumbicon. Schematic of a Plumbicon tube. (This image is schematic, not to scale; a Plumbicon has the same shape as a vidicon.) Compared to Saticons, Plumbicons have much higher resistance to burn-in, and comet and trailing artifacts from bright lights in the shot. Saticons though, usually have slightly higher resolution. After 1980, and the introduction of the diode-gun Plumbicon tube, the resolution of both types was so high, compared to the maximum limits of the broadcasting standard, that the Saticon's resolution advantage became moot. While broadcast cameras migrated to solid-state charge-coupled devices, Plumbicon tubes remained a staple imaging device in the medical field. High resolution Plumbicons were made for the HD-MAC standard.https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/techreview/trev_254-tejerina.pdf Until 2016, Narragansett Imaging was the last company making Plumbicons, using factories Philips built in Rhode Island, USA. While still a part of Philips, the company purchased EEV's (English Electric Valve) lead oxide camera tube business, and gained a monopoly in lead-oxide tube production. ===Saticon (1973)=== Saticon is a registered trademark of Hitachi from 1973, also produced by Thomson and Sony. It was developed in a joint effort by Hitachi and NHK Science & Technology Research Laboratories (NHK is The Japan Broadcasting Corporation). Its surface consists of selenium with trace amounts of arsenic and tellurium added (SeAsTe) to make the signal more stable. SAT in the name is derived from (SeAsTe). Saticon tubes have an average light sensitivity equivalent to that of 64 ASA film. A high-gain avalanche rushing amorphous photoconductor (HARP) can be used to increase light sensitivity by up to 10 times that of conventional saticons. Saticons were made for the Sony HDVS system, used to produce early analog high-definition television using Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding. ===Pasecon (1972)=== Originally developed by Toshiba in 1972 as chalnicon, Pasecon is a registered trademark of Heimann GmbH from 1977. Its surface consists of cadmium selenide trioxide (CdSeO3). Due to its wide spectral response, it is labelled as panchromatic selenium vidicon, hence the acronym 'pasecon'. ===Newvicon (1973)=== Newvicon is a registered trademark of Matsushita from 1973. The Newvicon tubes were characterized by high light sensitivity. Its surface consists of a combination of zinc selenide (ZnSe) and zinc cadmium Telluride (ZnCdTe). ===Trinicon (1971)=== Trinicon is a registered trademark of Sony from 1971. It uses a vertically striped RGB color filter over the faceplate of an otherwise standard vidicon imaging tube to segment the scan into corresponding red, green and blue segments. Only one tube was used in the camera, instead of a tube for each color, as was standard for color cameras used in television broadcasting. It is used mostly in low-end consumer cameras, such as the HVC-2200 and HVC-2400 models, though Sony also used it in some moderate cost professional cameras in the 1980s, such as the DXC-1800 and BVP-1 models.\\"Sony DXC-1600\\", LabGuysWorld.com.. Although the idea of using color stripe filters over the target was not new, the Trinicon was the only tube to use the primary RGB colors. This necessitated an additional electrode buried in the target to detect where the scanning electron beam was relative to the stripe filter. Previous color stripe systems had used colors where the color circuitry was able to separate the colors purely from the relative amplitudes of the signals. As a result, the Trinicon featured a larger dynamic range of operation. Sony later combined the Saticon tube with the Trinicon's RGB color filter, providing low-light sensitivity and superior color. This type of tube was known as the SMF Trinicon tube, or Saticon Mixed Field. SMF Trinicon tubes were used in the HVC-2800 and HVC-2500 consumer cameras, as well as the first Betamovie camcorders. ===Light biasing=== All the vidicon type tubes except the vidicon itself were able to use a light biasing technique to improve the sensitivity and contrast. The photosensitive target in these tubes suffered from the limitation that the light level had to rise to a particular level before any video output resulted. Light biasing was a method whereby the photosensitive target was illuminated from a light source just enough that no appreciable output was obtained, but such that a slight increase in light level from the scene was enough to provide discernible output. The light came from either an illuminator mounted around the target, or in more professional cameras from a light source on the base of the tube and guided to the target by light piping. The technique would not work with the baseline vidicon tube because it suffered from the limitation that as the target was fundamentally an insulator, the constant low light level built up a charge which would manifest itself as a form of fogging. The other types had semiconducting targets which did not have this problem. ==Color cameras== Early color cameras used the obvious technique of using separate red, green and blue image tubes in conjunction with a color separator, a technique still in use with 3CCD solid state cameras today. It was also possible to construct a color camera that used a single image tube. One technique has already been described (Trinicon above). A more common technique and a simpler one from the tube construction standpoint was to overlay the photosensitive target with a color striped filter having a fine pattern of vertical stripes of green, cyan and clear filters (i.e. green; green and blue; and green, blue and red) repeating across the target. The advantage of this arrangement was that for virtually every color, the video level of the green component was always less than the cyan, and similarly the cyan was always less than the white. Thus the contributing images could be separated without any reference electrodes in the tube. If the three levels were the same, then that part of the scene was green. This method suffered from the disadvantage that the light levels under the three filters were almost certain to be different, with the green filter passing not more than one third of the available light. Variations on this scheme exist, the principal one being to use two filters with color stripes overlaid such that the colors form vertically oriented lozenge shapes overlaying the target. The method of extracting the color is similar however. ===Field-sequential color system=== During the 1930s and 1940s, field- sequential color systems were developed which used synchronized motor-driven color-filter disks at the camera's image tube and at the television receiver. Each disk consisted of red, blue, and green transparent color filters. In the camera, the disk was in the optical path, and in the receiver, it was in front of the CRT. Disk rotation was synchronized with vertical scanning so that each vertical scan in sequence was for a different primary color. This method allowed regular black-and-white image tubes and CRTs to generate and display color images. A field-sequential system developed by Peter Goldmark for CBS was demonstrated to the press on September 4, 1940,\\"Color Television Achieves Realism\\". New York Times. September 5, 1940, p. 18. A color 16 mm film was shown; live pick-ups were first demonstrated to the press in 1941. \\"Columbia Broadcasting Exhibits Color Television\\". Wall Street Journal. January 10, 1941, p. 4. \\"CBS Makes Live Pick-up in Color Television \\", Radio & Television, April 1941. and was first shown to the general public on January 12, 1950.\\"Washington Chosen for First Color Showing; From Ages 4 to 90, Audience Amazed\\", The Washington Post, January 13, 1950, p. B2. Guillermo Gonz√°lez Camarena independently developed a field-sequential color disk system in Mexico in the early 1940s, for which he requested a patent in Mexico on August 19 of 1940 and in the US in 1941. Gonzalez Camarena produced his color television system in his laboratory Gon-Cam for the Mexican market and exported it to the Columbia College of Chicago, who regarded it as the best system in the world. ==Magnetic focusing in typical camera tubes== The phenomenon known as magnetic focusing was discovered by A. A. Campbell-Swinton in 1896, he found that a longitudinal magnetic field generated by an axial coil can focus an electron beam. This phenomenon was immediately corroborated by J. A. Fleming, and Hans Busch gave a complete mathematical interpretation in 1926. Diagrams in this article show that the focus coil surrounds the camera tube; it is much longer than the focus coils for earlier TV CRTs. Camera-tube focus coils, by themselves, have essentially parallel lines of force, very different from the localized semi-toroidal magnetic field geometry inside a TV receiver CRT focus coil. The latter is essentially a magnetic lens; it focuses the \\"crossover\\" (between the CRT's cathode and G1 electrode, where the electrons pinch together and diverge again) onto the screen. The electron optics of camera tubes differ considerably. Electrons inside these long focus coils take helical paths as they travel along the length of the tube. The center (think local axis) of one of those helices is like a line of force of the magnetic field. While the electrons are traveling, the helices essentially don't matter. Assuming that they start from a point, the electrons will focus to a point again at a distance determined by the strength of the field. Focusing a tube with this kind of coil is simply a matter of trimming the coil's current. In effect, the electrons travel along the lines of force, although helically, in detail. These focus coils are essentially as long as the tubes themselves, and surround the deflection yoke (coils). Deflection fields bend the lines of force (with negligible defocusing), and the electrons follow the lines of force. In a conventional magnetically deflected CRT, such as in a TV receiver or computer monitor, basically the vertical deflection coils are equivalent to coils wound around an horizontal axis. That axis is perpendicular to the neck of the tube; lines of force are basically horizontal. (In detail, coils in a deflection yoke extend some distance beyond the neck of the tube, and lie close to the flare of the bulb; they have a truly distinctive appearance.) In a magnetically focused camera tube (there are electrostatically focused vidicons), the vertical deflection coils are above and below the tube, instead of being on both sides of it. One might say that this sort of deflection starts to create S-bends in the lines of force, but doesn't become anywhere near to that extreme. ==Size== The size of video camera tubes is simply the overall outside diameter of the glass envelope. This differs from the size of the sensitive area of the target which is typically two thirds of the size of the overall diameter. Tube sizes are always expressed in inches for historical reasons. A one-inch camera tube has a sensitive area of approximately two thirds of an inch on the diagonal or about 16 mm. Although the video camera tube is now technologically obsolete, the size of solid-state image sensors is still expressed as the equivalent size of a camera tube. For this purpose a new term was coined and it is known as the optical format. The optical format is approximately the true diagonal of the sensor multiplied by 3/2. The result is expressed in inches and is usually (though not always) rounded to a convenient fraction - hence the approximation. For instance, a has a diagonal of and therefore an optical format of 8.0*3/2=, which is rounded to the convenient imperial fraction of . The parameter is also the source of the \\"Four Thirds\\" in the Four Thirds system and its Micro Four Thirds extension‚Äîthe imaging area of the sensor in these cameras is approximately that of a video-camera tube at approximately . Although the optical format size bears no relationship to any physical parameter of the sensor, its use means that a lens that would have been used with (say) a four thirds inch camera tube will give roughly the same angle of view when used with a solid-state sensor with an optical format of four thirds of an inch ==Decline== Modern charge-coupled device (CCD) and CMOS-based sensors offer many advantages over their tube counterparts. These include a lack of image lag, high overall picture quality, high light sensitivity and dynamic range, a better signal-to-noise ratio and significantly higher reliability and ruggedness. Other advantages include the elimination of the respective high and low-voltage power supplies required for the electron beam and heater filament, elimination of the drive circuitry for the focusing coils, no warm-up time and a significantly lower overall power consumption. Despite these advantages, acceptance and incorporation of solid-state sensors into television and video cameras was not immediate. Early sensors were of lower resolution and performance than picture tubes, and were initially relegated to consumer-grade video recording equipment. Also, video tubes had progressed to a high standard of quality and were standard issue equipment to networks and production entities. Those entities had a substantial investment in not only tube cameras, but also in the ancillary equipment needed to correctly process tube-derived video. A switch-over to solid-state image sensors rendered much of that equipment (and the investments behind it) obsolete and required new equipment optimized to work well with solid-state sensors, just as the old equipment was optimized for tube-sourced video. ==See also== *Monoscope *Professional video camera ==References== ==External links== *Orthicon: Brief history, description and diagram. *The Cathode Ray Tube site *CCD Technology - A Brief History *The German TV museum with a lot of knowledge (in German) *Most of the TV tubes were shown and carefully explained (in German) Category:History of television Category:Television technology Category:Vacuum tubes ","title":"Video camera tube"},{"id":"516759","text":"Bertha Maria J√∫lia Lutz (August 2, 1894 ‚Äì September 16, 1976) was a Brazilian zoologist, politician, and diplomat. Lutz became a leading figure in both the Pan American feminist movement and human rights movement.June E. Hahner, \\"Bertha Maria Julia Lutz\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 3, pp. 474‚Äì75. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. She was instrumental in gaining women's suffrage in Brazil and represented her country at the United Nations Conference on International Organization, signing her name to the United Nations Charter. In addition to her political work, she was a naturalist at the National Museum of Brazil, specializing in poison dart frogs. She has three frog species and two lizard species named after her. == Early life and education == Bertha Lutz was born in S√£o Paulo. Her father, Adolfo Lutz (1855‚Äì1940), was a pioneering physician and epidemiologist of Swiss origin, and her mother, Amy Marie Gertrude Fowler, was a British nurse. Bertha Lutz studied natural sciences, biology and zoology at the University of Paris - Sorbonne, graduating in 1918. Soon after obtaining her degree, she returned to Brazil. ==Career Women‚Äôs suffrage === In 1919, a year after returning to Brazil, Lutz founded the League for Intellectual Emancipation of Women and was appointed to represent the Brazilian government in the Female International Council of the International Labour Organization (ILO). Lutz later created the Brazilian Federation for Women's Progress (1922), a political group which advocated for Brazilian women's rights, most importantly, their right to vote, around the world. Lutz served as a delegate to the Pan-American Conference of Women in Baltimore, Maryland, that same year, and would continue to attend women's rights conferences in the years to follow. In 1925, she was elected president of the Inter-American Union of Women. Lutz's involvement in the fight for women's suffrage made her the leading figurehead of women's rights until the end of 1931, when Brazilian women finally gained the right to vote. === Inter-American feminist campaign === Lutz's advocacy for the rights of women did not end with the right to vote, and she continued to play a prominent role in the feminist campaign. In 1933, after obtaining her law degree from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro Faculty of Law, Lutz participated and introduced several proposals for gender equity in the Inter-American Conference of Montevideo, Uruguay. Most notable of these proposals was her call for the refocusing of the Inter-American Commission of Women on the issue of gender equality in the workplace. In 1935, Lutz decided to run for National Congress of Brazil and came in second behind C√°ndido Pessoa, and replaced him when he died a year later, making Lutz one of the few Brazilian Congresswomen of the time. The first initiative that Lutz presented while in Congress was the creation of the ‚ÄúStatute of women‚Äù, a committee to analyze every Brazilian law and statute to ensure none violated the rights of women. Bertha Lutz with family, feminists, and the Brazilian Federation for Women's Progress on the stairs of the Chamber of Deputies, Rio de Janeiro. (1936) Lutz, however, was unable to push forward her measures when Get√∫lio Vargas was reinstated as dictator in 1937, which led to a suspension of parliament, and the Statute project. Lutz nonetheless continued her diplomatic career. She was one of the four women to sign the United Nations Charter at the Inter-American Conference of Women held in San Francisco in 1945 and served as vice president of the Inter-American Commission of Women from 1953 to 1959. ===Scientific career=== After returning to Brazil in 1918, Lutz dedicated herself to the study of amphibians, especially poison dart frogs and frogs of the family Hylidae.Lutz, Bertha (1973). Brazilian Species of \\"Hyla\\". Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press. 260 pp. . In 1919, she was hired by the Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro. She later became a naturalist at the Section of Botany. Throughout her lifetime, Lutz would publish numerous scientific studies and publications, most notably ‚ÄúObservations on the life history of the Brazilian Frog‚Äù (1943), ‚ÄúA notable frog chorus in Brazil‚Äù (1946), and ‚ÄúNew frogs from Itatiaia mountain‚Äù (1952). In 1958, she described what is now known as Lutz's rapids frog (Paratelmatobius lutzii Lutz and Carvalho, 1958), which is named in honor of her father.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore, Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Lutz, A.\\" and \\"Lutz, B. M. J.\\", p. 163). Lutz is honored in the names of two species of Brazilian lizards, Liolaemus lutzae and Phyllopezus lutzae, as well as three species of frogs, Dendropsophus berthalutzae, Megaelosia lutzae, and Scinax berthae. Bertha Lutz's collections held at the Museu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro were destroyed in the fire that devastated most of the Museum's collections in September 2018. === Political conferences === During the 1919 International Congress of Working Women, Lutz advocated for equality among the sexes and the specific mention of women in the clauses that protect against injustices and abuse. At the 1922 Pan- American Conference of Women, Lutz advocated for the equality of rights and opportunity of women, with a special focus on political inclusion. Lutz came prepared to the 1933 Inter-American Conference of Montevideo with a study of the legal status of women in the Americas and advocated that the nationality of married women should not be contingent on that of their husbands. She also proposed an Equals Rights treaty and pushed the Inter-American Commission of Women to refocus and recommit to analyzing working conditions of women in the Americas. Lutz receiving the Doutor Honoris Causa (Mills College, 1945) Lutz at the UN conference (San Francisco, 1945) During the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco, Lutz, along with Minerva Bernardino, fought for the inclusion of the word ‚Äúwomen‚Äù in the preamble to the United Nations Charter. The first draft didn't mention the word \\"women\\", and against US delegate Virginia Gildersleeve and British female advisors, Lutz and other women from Latin America insisted in the final clause read: \\" ...faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small\\". She further proposed the creation of a special commission of Women whose purpose it would be to analyze the \\"legal status of Women\\" around the world in order to better understand the inequalities they face and be better prepared to combat them. She is credited with being the most prominent and tenacious advocate for the inclusion of women's rights in the charter, and without her work the United Nations would likely not have a mandate to protect women's rights. Lutz in later years. In 1964, Lutz headed the Brazilian delegation at the 14th Inter-American Commission in Montevideo. Additionally, at the 15th annual meeting of the Inter-American Commission of Women held in 1970, she proposed to hold a seminar dedicated to addressing the specific problems faced by indigenous women. Although she was a little over seventy during this stage of her life, Lutz continued to attend conferences and push for the expansion of women's rights, including the World Conference on Women, 1975, in Mexico City.Hahner, \\"Lutz\\", p. 475. == Selected works == * ‚ÄúObservations on the life history of the Brazilian Frog‚Äù (1943) * ‚ÄúA notable frog chorus in Brazil‚Äù (1946) * ‚ÄúNew frogs from Itatiaia mountain‚Äù (1952). == Death == She died in 1976 at the age of 82. == See also == * Women's suffrage * Feminism in Brazil ==References== ==Further reading== *Hahner, June E.

Later on, Cuban exiles and expatriates brought it to Miami, where it is also very popular. The sandwich is made with ham, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, pickles, mustard, and sometimes salami on Cuban bread. Salami is included in Tampa, where there is a large Italian population, but is not usually included in South Florida.Cuban Sandwich History, \\"What's Cooking America The Cuban sandwich is at the center of a long-running friendly rivalry between Miami and Tampa. As part of that rivalry, the \\"Historic Tampa Cuban Sandwich\\" was designated the \\"signature sandwich of the city of Tampa\\" by the Tampa City Council in 2012. ==History== As with Cuban bread, the origin of the Cuban sandwich (sometimes called a \\"Cuban mix,\\" a \\"mixto,\\" a \\"Cuban pressed sandwich,\\" or a \\"Cubano\\"Tom Scherberger, Cuban Sandwich Wars Inflame Passions in Tampa and Miami, Visit Florida (accessed May 31, 2016).) is murky.Tampa claims the Cuban sandwich as its own, but Miami begs to differ - Tampa Bay Times In the late 1800s and early 1900s, travel between Cuba and Florida was easy, especially from Key West and Tampa, and Cubans frequently sailed back and forth for employment, pleasure, and family visits. Because of this constant and largely undocumented movement of people, culture and ideas, it is impossible to say exactly when or where the Cuban sandwich originated. Some believe that the sandwich was a common lunch food for workers in both the cigar factories and sugar mills of Cuba (especially in big cities such as Havana or Santiago de Cuba) and the cigar factories of Key West by the 1860s. Historian Loy Glenn Westfall states that the sandwich was \\"born in Cuba and educated in Key West.\\" The cigar industry in Florida shifted to Tampa in the mid-1880s, when the immigrant community of Ybor City was founded by cigar manufacturer Vicente Martinez-Ybor. Tens of thousands of Cuban, Spanish, and Italian workers moved to the area over following decades, jumpstarting the growth of Tampa from a village to a bustling city. The first recorded mentions of a distinct Cuban sandwich survive in descriptions of workers' caf√©s in Ybor City and nearby West Tampa from around 1900, leading other historians to theorize that the sandwich as now constituted first appeared there.\\"Tampa history is traced in its sandwich\\" - The Tampa Tribune A travel article published by the Mason City Globe Gazette in 1934 said that Tampa's cooking was \\"much more distinctive than elsewhere in the state\\" and lists Cuban sandwiches (along with Cuban bread) among the city's \\"signature foods\\". Researcher Andrew Huse states that \\"the old 'mixtos' coalesced into something more distinct ‚Äì the Cuban sandwiches we know and love ‚Äì an original Tampa creation.\\" By the 1960s, Cuban sandwiches were also common on Miami cafeteria and restaurant menus, as the city had gained a large influx of Cuban residents after Fidel Castro's 1959 rise to power in their native land. The Communist Revolution caused a wave of Cuban expatriates to settle in other locations as well, and they brought their culture and cuisine with them. Cuban sandwiches and variations thereof are now served in various Cuban exile communities in places such as New York City, New Jersey, Chicago, and Puerto Rico, among others. ==Ingredients== Cuban sandwiches being prepared at La Segunda Central Bakery in Ybor City, Tampa Key West version of a \\"Cuban mix\\" with lettuce and tomato Although there is some debate as to the contents of a \\"true\\" Cuban sandwich, most are generally agreed upon. The traditional Cuban sandwich starts with Cuban bread. The loaf is sliced into lengths of 8‚Äì12 inches (20‚Äì30 cm), lightly buttered or brushed with olive oil on the crust, and cut in half horizontally. A coat of yellow mustard is spread on the bread. Then sliced roast pork, glazed ham, Swiss cheese, and thinly sliced dill pickles are added in layers. Sometimes the pork is marinated in mojo and slow roasted. The main regional disagreement about the sandwich‚Äôs recipe is whether or not to include salami. In Tampa, Genoa salami is traditionally layered with the other meats, probably due to the influence of Italian immigrants who lived side-by-side with Cubans and Spaniards in Ybor City. A 1934 travel article describes a Tampa Cuban sandwich as a \\"complete meal\\" consisting of ham, lean pork, Swiss cheese, soft salami, dill pickle and a \\"liberal moistening of mustard\\" served on \\"very crisp and crusty\\" Cuban bread. These ingredients are reiterated 27 years later in the first and all subsequent editions of The Gasparilla Cookbook (1961), a still-popular collection of Tampa cuisine. Salami is not an ingredient in the South Florida version of the Cuban sandwich, and its inclusion or lack thereof is a major point of contention in the Tampa‚ÄìMiami sandwich rivalry. Mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomato are possible additions but are frowned upon by traditionalists. When assembled, the sandwich can be toasted in a sandwich press called a plancha, which is similar to a panini press but without grooved surfaces. The plancha both heats and compresses the sandwich, which remains in the press until the bread surface is slightly crispy and the cheese is melted. It is usually cut into diagonal halves before serving. ==Related dishes== A similar sandwich is the medianoche (\\"midnight\\") sandwich; as the name suggests, the sandwich originated as a late-night snack, likely in the night clubs of Havana. The medianoche contains the same ingredients as the Cuban sandwich, but is smaller and, unlike a Cuban, is served on yellow-colored egg bread (similar to challah), which is softer and sweeter than Cuban bread.Raquel R√°bade Roque, The Cuban Kitchen (Alfred A. Knopf, 2011), p. 80.Glenn M. Lindgren, Ra√∫l Musibay & Jorge G. Castillo, Three Guys from Miami Cook Cuban (Gibbs Smith, 2004), p. 390.Becky Mercuri, American Sandwich: Great Eats From All 50 States (Gibbs Smith, 2004, p. 31. ==Cultural connectionsTampa‚ÄìMiami rivalry=== The Cuban sandwich is at the center of a long-running semi-serious rivalry between Tampa and Miami, with political and community leaders claiming to be home of the best. The debate has been covered by several national and international news outlets, and a related content dispute on this Wikipedia article was the topic of a 2007 newspaper column in the Tampa Tribune. During a 2012 flare-up of the debate, the Tampa City Council voted to name the \\"Historic Tampa Cuban Sandwich\\" as the city's official \\"signature sandwich\\", leading to several more rounds of banter between public figures in Tampa and Miami. ===Other connections=== *In May 2012, Victor Padilla and Jolie Gonzalez-Padilla organized the first Cuban Sandwich Festival, which was held in Tampa and included the building of the \\"World's Longest Cuban Sandwich\\" and a competition for the best Cuban sandwich among local and statewide restaurants. The festival has been held annually since, and the competition has grown to include entrants from across Florida, the US, and other countries competing in several categories. The organizers have also held smaller festivals with preliminary sandwich competitions in Miami and Kissimmee, Florida.Cuban Sandwich Festival official website *In the 2014 film Chef starring Jon Favreau, the main character drives across the United States selling Cuban sandwiches (referred to as \\"Cubanos\\") from a food truck called El Jefe. *In 2016, Christopher Spata, a writer for the Tampa Bay Times, sent press releases to a variety of news organizations and online holiday databases touting a fictional \\"National Cuban Sandwich Day\\" as an experiment to see if people would celebrate a \\"made-up\\" food holiday. Several news sources and websites added the date (August 23) to their list of holidays, and the event has since been celebrated in a growing number of locations ever since. Spata's story about his experiment appeared on the front page of the tbt* tabloid newspaper in Tampa and was picked up by national news outlets.Christopher Spata, (23 August 2016).

Although often focused on schools, curriculum, and educational funding, student groups have influenced greater political events.Fletcher, A. (2005) Guide to Social Change Led By and With Young People Olympia, WA: CommonAction. Modern student activist movements vary widely in subject, size, and success, with all kinds of students in all kinds of educational settings participating, including public and private school students; elementary, middle, senior, undergraduate, and graduate students; and all races, socio-economic backgrounds, and political perspectives.Fletcher, A. (2006)Washington Youth Voice Handbook Olympia, WA: CommonAction. Some student protests focus on the internal affairs of a specific institution; others focus on broader issues such as a war or dictatorship. Likewise, some student protests focus on an institution's impact on the world, such as a disinvestment campaign, while others may focus on a regional or national policy's impact on the institution, such as a campaign against government education policy. Although student activism is commonly associated with left-wing politics, right-wing student movements are not uncommon; for example, large student movements fought on both sides of the apartheid struggle in South Africa. Student activism at the university level is nearly as old as the university itself. Students in Paris and Bologna staged collective actions as early as the 13th century, chiefly over town and gown issues. Student protests over broader political issues also have a long pedigree. In Joseon Dynasty Korea, 150 Sungkyunkwan students staged an unprecedented remonstration against the king in 1519 over the Kimyo purge. Extreme forms of student activism include suicide such as the case of Jan Palach's, and Jan Zaj√≠c's protests against the end of the Prague Spring and Kostas Georgakis' protest against the Greek military junta of 1967‚Äì1974. ==By countryArgentina=== University of C√≥rdoba, 1918. In Argentina, as elsewhere in Latin America, the tradition of student activism dates back to at least the 19th century, but it was not until after 1900 that it became a major political force. in 1918 student activism triggered a general modernization of the universities especially tending towards democratization, called the University Revolution (Spanish: revoluci√≥n universitaria). The events started in C√≥rdoba and were accompanied by similar uprisings across Latin America. ===Australia=== Australian Students have a long history of being active in political debates. This is particularly true in the newer universities that have been established in suburban areas. For much of the 20th century, the major campus organizing group across Australia was the Australian Union of Students, which was founded in 1937 as the Union of Australian University Students. The AUS folded in 1984. It was replaced by the National Union of Students in 1987. ===Bangladesh=== Student politics of Bangladesh is reactive, confrontational and violent. Student organizations act as the armament of the political parties they are part of. Over the years, political clashes and factional feuds in the educational institutes killed many, seriously hampering the academic atmosphere. To check those hitches, universities have no options but go to lengthy and unexpected closures. Therefore, classes are not completed on time and there are session jams. The student wings of ruling parties dominate the campuses and residential halls through crime and violence to enjoy various unauthorized facilities. They control the residential halls to manage seats in favor of their party members and loyal pupils. They eat and buy for free from the restaurants and shops nearby. They extort and grab tenders to earn illicit money. They take money from the freshmen candidates and put pressure on teachers to get an acceptance for them. They take money from the job seekers and put pressures on university administrations to appoint them. === Brazil === On August 11, 1937, the Uni√£o Nacional de Estudantes (UNE) was formed as a platform for students to create change in Brazil. The organization tried to unite students from all over Brazil. However, in the 1940s the group had aligned more with socialism. Then in the 1950s the group changed alignment again, this time aligning with more conservative values. The Uni√£o Metropolitana dos Estudantes rose up in replacement of the once socialist Uni√£o Nacional de Estudantes. However, it wasn't long until Uni√£o Nacional de Estudantes once again sided with socialism, thus joining forces with the Uni√£o Metropolitana dos Estudantes. The Uni√£o Nacional de Estudantes was influential in the democratization of higher education. Their first significant feat occurred during World War II when they convinced their leader to join the side of the Allies. In 1964, the UNE was outlawed after elected leader Jo√£o Goulart was disposed of power by a military coup. The military regime terrorized students in an effort to make them subservient. In 1966, students began protesting anyway despite the reality of further terror. All the protests led up to the March of the One Hundred Thousand in June 1968. Organized by the UNE, this protest was the largest yet. Though, a few months later the government passed Institutional Act Number Five which officially banned students from any further protest. ===Canada=== Bill 78 in Montreal, 2012. In Canada, New Left student organizations from the late 1950s and 1960s became mainly two: SUPA (Student Union for Peace Action) and CYC (Company of Young Canadians). SUPA grew out of the CUCND (Combined Universities Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament) in December 1964, at a University of Saskatchewan conference. While CUCND had focused on protest marches, SUPA sought to change Canadian society as a whole. The scope expanded to grass-roots politics in disadvantaged communities and 'consciousness raising' to radicalize and raise awareness of the 'generation gap' experienced by Canadian youth. SUPA was a decentralized organization, rooted in local university campuses. SUPA however disintegrated in late 1967 over debates concerning the role of working class and 'Old Left'. Members moved to the CYC or became active leaders in CUS (Canadian Union of Students), leading the CUS to assume the mantle of New Left student agitation. In 1968, SDU (Students for a Democratic University) was formed at McGill and Simon Fraser Universities. SFU SDU, originally former SUPA members and New Democratic Youth, absorbed members from the campus Liberal Club and Young Socialists. SDU was prominent in an Administration occupation in 1968, and a student strike in 1969. After the failure of the student strike, SDU broke up. Some members joined the IWW and Yippies (Youth International Party). Other members helped form the Vancouver Liberation Front in 1970. The FLQ (Quebec Liberation Front) was considered a terrorist organization, causing the use of the War Measures Act after 95 bombings in the October Crisis. This was the only peacetime use of the War Measures Act. Since the 1970s, PIRGs (Public Interest Research Groups) have been created as a result of Student Union referendums across Canada in individual provinces. Like their American counterparts, Canadian PIRGs are student directed, run, and funded. Most operate on a consensus decision making model. Despite efforts at collaboration, Canadian PIRGs are independent of each other. Anti-Bullying Day (a.k.a. Pink Shirt Day) was created by high school students David Shepherd, and Travis Price of Berwick, Nova Scotia, and is now celebrated annually across Canada. In 2012, the Quebec Student Movement arose due to an increase of tuition of 75%; that took students out of class and into the streets because that increase did not allow students to comfortably extend their education, because of fear of debt or not having money at all. Following elections that year, premier Jean Charest promised to repeal anti-assembly laws and cancel the tuition hike. ===Chile=== Chilean students demonstrate for greater public involvement in education. From 2011 to 2013, Chile was rocked by a series of student-led nationwide protests across Chile, demanding a new framework for education in the country, including more direct state participation in secondary education and an end to the existence of profit in higher education. Currently in Chile, only 45% of high school students study in traditional public schools and most universities are also private. No new public universities have been built since the end of the Chilean transition to democracy in 1990, even though the number of university students has swelled. Beyond the specific demands regarding education, the protests reflected a \\"deep discontent\\" among some parts of society with Chile's high level of inequality. Protests have included massive non-violent marches, but also a considerable amount of violence on the part of a side of protestors as well as riot police. The first clear government response to the protests was a proposal for a new education fundCadena Nacional de Radio y Televisi√≥n: Presidente Pi√±era anunci√≥ Gran Acuerdo Nacional por la Educaci√≥n Government of Chile.

Other government proposals were also rejected. ===China=== Students from the Peking University protesting on Tiananmen Square in 1919 Since the defeat of the Qing Dynasty during the First (1839‚Äì1842) and Second Opium Wars (1856‚Äì1860), student activism has played a significant role in the modern Chinese history. Fueled mostly by Chinese nationalism, Chinese student activism strongly believes that young people are responsible for China's future. This strong nationalistic belief has been able to manifest in several forms such as Democracy, anti-Americanism and Communism. One of the most important acts of student activism in Chinese history is the 1919 May Fourth Movement that saw over 3,000 students of Peking University and other schools gathered together in front of Tiananmen and holding a demonstration. It is regarded as an essential step of the democratic revolution in China, and it had also give birth to Chinese Communism. Anti-Americanism movements led by the students during the Chinese Civil War were also instrumental in discrediting the KMT government and bring the Communist victory in China. In 1989, the democracy movement led by the students at the Tiananmen Square protests ended in a brutal government crackdown which would later be called a massacre. === Democratic Republic of the Congo === Student activism played an important, yet understudied, role in Congo's crisis of decolonisation. Throughout the 1960s, students denounced the unfinished decolonisation of higher education and the unrealised promises of national independence. The two issues crossed in the demonstration of June 4, 1969. Student activism continues and women such as Aline Mukovi Neema, winner of 100 Women BBC award, continue to campaign for political change in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. ===Eastern Europe and the post-Soviet Union states=== MJAFT! protest in Albania During communist rule, students in Eastern Europe were the force behind several of the best- known instances of protest. The chain of events leading to the 1956 Hungarian Revolution was started by peaceful student demonstrations in the streets of Budapest, later attracting workers and other Hungarians. In Czechoslovakia, one of the most known faces of the protests following the Soviet-led invasion that ended the Prague Spring was Jan Palach, a student who committed suicide by setting fire to himself on January 16, 1969. The act triggered a major protest against the occupation. Student-dominated youth movements have also played a central role in the \\"color revolutions\\" seen in post-communist societies in recent years. Of the color revolutions, the Velvet Revolution of 1989 in the Czechoslovak capital of Prague was one of them. Though the Velvet Revolution began as a celebration of International Students Day, the single event quickly turned into a nationwide ordeal aimed at the dissolution of communism. The demonstration had turned violent when police intervened. However, the police attacks garnered nationwide sympathy for the student protesters. Soon enough multiple other protests unraveled in an effort to breakdown the one party communist regime of Czechoslovakia. The series of protests were successful; they broke down the communist regime and implemented the use of democratic elections in 1990, only a few months after the first protest. Another example of this was the Serbian Otpor! (\\"Resistance!\\" in Serbian), formed in October 1998 as a response to repressive university and media laws that were introduced that year. In the presidential campaign in September 2000, the organisation engineered the \\"Gotov je\\" (\\"He's finished\\") campaign that galvanized Serbian discontent with Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, ultimately resulting in his defeat. Otpor has inspired other youth movements in Eastern Europe, such as Kmara in Georgia, which played an important role in the Rose Revolution, and Pora in Ukraine, which was key in organising the demonstrations that led to the Orange Revolution. Like Otpor, these organisations have consequently practiced non-violent resistance and used ridiculing humor in opposing authoritarian leaders. Similar movements include KelKel in Kyrgyzstan, Zubr in Belarus and MJAFT! in Albania. Opponents of the \\"color revolutions\\" have accused the Soros Foundations and/or the United States government of supporting and even planning the revolutions in order to serve western interests. Supporters of the revolutions have argued that these allegations are greatly exaggerated, and that the revolutions were positive events, morally justified, whether or not Western support had an influence on the events. ===France=== Occupation of the University of Lyon Law School, 1968 In France, student activists have been influential in shaping public debate. In May 1968 the University of Paris at Nanterre was closed due to problems between the students and the administration. In protest of the closure and the expulsion of Nanterre students, students of the Sorbonne in Paris began their own demonstration. The situation escalated into a nationwide insurrection. The events in Paris were followed by student protests throughout the world. The German student movement participated in major demonstrations against proposed emergency legislation. In many countries, the student protests caused authorities to respond with violence. In Spain, student demonstrations against Franco's dictatorship led to clashes with police. A student demonstration in Mexico City ended in a storm of bullets on the night of October 2, 1968, an event known as the Tlatelolco massacre. Even in Pakistan, students took to the streets to protest changes in education policy, and on November 7 two college students died after police opened fire on a demonstration. The global reverberations from the French uprising of 1968 continued into 1969 and even into the 1970s. ===Germany=== Procession of students at Wartburg Festival In 1815 in Jena (Germany) the \\"Urburschenschaft\\" was founded. That was a Studentenverbindung that was concentrated on national and democratic ideas. In 1817, inspired by liberal and patriotic ideas of a united Germany, student organisations gathered for the Wartburg festival at Wartburg Castle, at Eisenach in Thuringia, on the occasion of which reactionary books were burnt. In 1819 the student Karl Ludwig Sand murdered the writer August von Kotzebue, who had scoffed at liberal student organisations. In May 1832 the Hambacher Fest was celebrated at Hambach Castle near Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe with about 30 000 participants, amongst them many students. Together with the Frankfurter Wachensturm in 1833 planned to free students held in prison at Frankfurt and Georg B√ºchner's revolutionary pamphlet Der Hessische Landbote that were events that led to the revolutions in the German states in 1848. In the 1960s, the worldwide upswing in student and youth radicalism manifested itself through the German student movement and organisations such as the German Socialist Student Union. The movement in Germany shared many concerns of similar groups elsewhere, such as the democratisation of society and opposing the Vietnam War, but also stressed more nationally specific issues such as coming to terms with the legacy of the Nazi regime and opposing the German Emergency Acts. ===Greece=== Student activism in Greece has a long and intense history. Student activism in the 1960s was one of the reasons cited to justify the imposition of the dictatorship in 1967. Following the imposition of the dictatorship, the Athens Polytechnic uprising in 1973 triggered a series of events that led to the abrupt end of the regime's attempted \\"liberalisation\\" process under Spiros Markezinis, and, after that, to the eventual collapse of the Greek junta during Metapolitefsi and the return of democracy in Greece. Kostas Georgakis was a Greek student of geology, who, in the early hours of 19 September 1970, set himself ablaze in Matteotti square in Genoa as a protest against the dictatorial regime of Georgios Papadopoulos. His suicide greatly embarrassed the junta, and caused a sensation in Greece and abroad as it was the first tangible manifestation of the depth of resistance against the junta. The junta delayed the arrival of his remains to Corfu for four months citing security reasons and fearing demonstrations while presenting bureaucratic obstacles through the Greek consulate and the junta government. === Hong Kong === Hong Kong Student activist group Scholarism began an occupation of the Hong Kong government headquarters on 30 August 2012. The goal of the protest was, expressly, to force the government to retract its plans to introduce Moral and National Education as a compulsory subject. On 1 September, an open concert was held as part of the protest, with an attendance of 40,000. At last, the government de facto struck down the Moral and National Education. Student organizations made important roles during the Umbrella Movement. Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) made decisions on the Hong Kong political reform on 31 August 2014, which the Nominating Committee would tightly control the nomination of the Chief Executive candidate, candidates outside the Pro-Beijing camp would not have opportunities to be nominated. The Hong Kong Federation of Students and Scholarism led a strike against the NPCSC's decision beginning on 22 September 2014, and started protesting outside the government headquarters on 26 September 2014. On 28 September, the Occupy Central with Love and Peace movement announced that the beginning of their civil disobedience campaign. Students and other members of the public demonstrated outside government headquarters, and some began to occupy several major city intersections. === India === Students Participating in a rally during the Assam Movement The Assam Movement (or Assam Agitation) (1979‚Äì1985) was a popular movement against illegal immigrants in Assam. The movement, led by All Assam Students Union(AASU) and the 'All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad' (AAGSP), developed a program of protests and demonstration to compel the Indian government to identify and expel illegal, (mostly Bangladeshisi), immigrants and protect and provide constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards to the indigenous Assamese people. More than 2 million of students protested in Marina beach, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India against the ban on Jallikatu. On 16 January 2017 a large group of students (more than 2 million) protested in state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry against the ban on Jallikattu. The ban was made by the Supreme Court of India in 2014 when PETA filed a petition against Jallikattu as a cruelty to animals. On 20 January a temporary ordinance was passed, lifting the ban on Jallikattu. The Jadavpur University of Kolkata have played an important role to contribute to the student activism of India. The Hokkolorob Movement (2014) stirred the nation as well as abroad which took place over here. It took place after the alleged police attack over unarmed students inside the campus demanding the fair justice of a student who was molested inside the campus. The Movement finally led to the expulsion of the contemporary Vice Chancellor of the university, Mr. Abhijit Chakraborty, who allegedly ordered the police to do open lathicharge over the students. Some anti-social goons were also involved in the harassment of the students. JU Students Against VC ===Indonesia=== Early delegation of Java Youth Indonesia is often believed to have hosted \\"some of the most important acts of student resistance in the world's history\\". University student groups have repeatedly been the first groups to stage street demonstrations calling for governmental change at key points in the nation's history, and other organizations from across the political spectrum have sought to align themselves with student groups. In 1928, the Youth Pledge (Sumpah Pemuda) helped to give voice to anti-colonial sentiments. During the political turmoil of the 1960s, right- wing student groups staged demonstrations calling for then-President Sukarno to eliminate alleged Communists from his government, and later demanding that he resign. Sukarno did step down in 1967, and was replaced by Army general Suharto. Student groups also played a key role in Suharto's 1998 fall by initiating large demonstrations that gave voice to widespread popular discontent with the president in the aftermath of the May 1998 riots. High school and university students in Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Medan, and elsewhere were some of the first groups willing to speak out publicly against the military government. Student groups were a key part of the political scene during this period. Upon taking office after Suharto stepped down, B. J. Habibie made numerous mostly unsuccessful overtures to placate the student groups that had brought down his predecessor. When that failed, he sent a combined force of police and gangsters to evict protesters occupying a government building by force. The ensuing carnage left two students dead and 181 injured. ===Iran=== Sharif University of Technology students protest over the 2009 presidential election. In Iran, students have been at the forefront of protests both against the pre-1979 secular monarchy and, in recent years, against the theocratic islamic republic. Both religious and more moderate students played a major part in Ruhollah Khomeini's opposition network against the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In January 1978 the army dispersed demonstrating students and religious leaders, killing several students and sparking a series of widespread protests that ultimately led to the Iranian Revolution the following year. On November 4, 1979, militant Iranian students calling themselves the Muslim Students Following the Line of the Imam seized the US embassy in Tehran holding 52 embassy employees hostage for a 444 days (see Iran hostage crisis). Recent years have seen several incidents when liberal students have clashed with the Iranian government, most notably the Iranian student riots of July 1999. Several people were killed in a week of violent confrontations that started with a police raid on a university dormitory, a response to demonstrations by a group of students of Tehran University against the closure of a reformist newspaper. Akbar Mohammadi was given a death sentence, later reduced to 15 years in prison, for his role in the protests. In 2006, he died at Evin prison after a hunger strike protesting the refusal to allow him to seek medical treatment for injuries suffered as a result of torture. At the end of 2002, students held mass demonstrations protesting the death sentence of reformist lecturer Hashem Aghajari for alleged blasphemy. In June 2003, several thousand students took to the streets of Tehran in anti-government protests sparked by government plans to privatise some universities. In the May 2005 Iranian presidential election, Iran's largest student organization, The Office to Consolidate Unity, advocated a voting boycott. After the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, student protests against the government has continued. In May 2006, up to 40 police officers were injured in clashes with demonstrating students in Tehran. At the same time, the Iranian government has called for student action in line with its own political agenda. In 2006, President Ahmadinejad urged students to organize campaigns to demand that liberal and secular university teachers be removed. In 2009, after the disputed presidential election, a series of student protests broke out, which became known as the Iranian Green Movement. The violent measures used by the Iranian government to suppress these protests have been the subject of widespread international condemnation. As a consequence of hash repression, \\"the student movement entered a period of silence during Ahmadinejad's second term (2009‚Äì2013)\\". During the first term of Hassan Rouhani in office (2013-2017) several groups endeavored to revive the student movement through rebuilding student organizations. ===Israel=== In Israel the students were amongst the leading figures in the 2011 Israeli social justice protests that grew out of the Cottage cheese boycott. ===Japan=== Waseda University students rally in support of Tibet, 2008. Japanese student movement began during the Taish≈ç Democracy, and grew in activity after World War II. They were mostly carried out by activist students. One such event was the Anpo Protests, which occurred in 1960, in opposition to the Anpo treaty. In the subsequent student uprising in 1968, leftist activists barricaded themselves in universities, resulting in armed conflict with the Japanese police force. Some wider causes were supported including opposition to the Vietnam War and apartheid, and for the acceptance of the hippie lifestyle. ===Malaysia=== Since the amendment of Section 15 of the Universities and University Colleges Act 1971 (UUCA) in 1975, students were barred from being members of, and expressing support or opposition to, any political parties or \\"any organization, body or group of persons which the Minister, after consultation with the Board, has specified in writing to the Vice-Chancellor to be unsuitable to the interests and well-being of the students or the University.\\" However, in October 2011, the Court of Appeal ruled that the relevant provision in Section 15 UUCA was unconstitutional due to Article 10 of the Federal Constitution pertaining to freedom of expression. Since the act prohibiting students from expressing \\"support, sympathy or opposition\\" to any political party was enacted in 1971, Malaysian students have repeatedly demanded that the ban on political involvement be rescinded. The majority of students are not interested in politics because they are afraid that the universities will take action against them. The UUCA (also known by its Malaysian acronym AUKU) not however been entirely successful in eliminating student activism and political engagement. In Kuala Lumpur on 14 April 2012, student activists camped out at Independence Square and marched against a government loan program that they said charged students high interest rates and left them with debt. The largest student movement in Malaysia is the Solidariti Mahasiswa Malaysia (SMM; Student Solidarity of Malaysia). This is a coalition group that represents numerous student organizations. Currently, SMM is actively campaigning against the UUCA and a free education at primary, secondary and tertiary level. ===Mexico=== A Yo Soy 132 march, 2012 During the protests of 1968, Mexican government killed an estimated 30 to 300 students and civilian protesters. This killing is known as in the Tlatelolco massacre. killing of an estimated 30 to 300 students and civilians by military and police on October 2, 1968, in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in the Tlatelolco section of Mexico City. The events are considered part of the Mexican Dirty War, when the government used its forces to suppress political opposition. The massacre occurred 10 days before the opening of the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. More recent student movements include Yo Soy 132 in 2012. Yo Soy 132 was a social movement composed for the most part of Mexican university students from private and public universities, residents of Mexico, claiming supporters from about 50 cities around the world. It began as opposition to the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate Enrique Pe√±a Nieto and the Mexican media's allegedly biased coverage of the 2012 general election. The name Yo Soy 132, Spanish for \\"I Am 132\\", originated in an expression of solidarity with the original 131 protest's initiators. The phrase drew inspiration from the Occupy movement and the Spanish 15-M movement. The protest movement was self-proclaimed as the \\"Mexican spring\\" (an allusion to the Arab Spring) by its first spokespersons, and called the \\"Mexican occupy movement\\" in the international press. Following the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping, students responded nationally in protest from marches to destruction of property. Through social media, hashtags such as #TodosSomosAyotzinapa spread and prompted global student response. === Norway === Similar to the students of Sweden, many student activists have emerged in Norway to protest climate change. While Norway is commonly viewed as a model country when it comes to combating climate change, students in Norway say there's more to be done. Though the country has put forth many internal climate combating initiatives, students worry over the country's exportation of oil and gas. === Pakistan === Historically throughout Pakistan, university students have led protests against dictatorships and militant regimes. In the 1960s, the National Student Federation and the Peoples student federation worked together to protest against their current militant regime. That regime was run by General Ayub Khan, the second president of Pakistan. In 2012, Malala Yousafzai was shot by the Taliban when standing up for the right of girls in Pakistan to receive an education. Surviving the attack, Yousafzai continued on as an activist for women's education. She has since written two books stressing the importance of girl's education not only in her home of Pakistan, but also around the world. Her first book, I am Malala, details her own experience; while her second book, We Are Displaced, details the lives of girls she met from refugee camps. In 2014, she became the youngest person to receive a Nobel Peace Prize. She was 17 years of age upon accepting the award. ===Philippines=== Student activism in the Philippines started by the time of Marcos regime in the late 1960s or early 1970s during the so-called First Quarter Storm of Martial Law. Until today, student activism continues for various causes such as for free education, corruption within the government, and extrajudicial killings. Some groups that lead these protests are the League of Filipino Students (LFS), National Union of Students of the Philippines (NUSP), Anakpawis, and Kabataan Party-List. === South Africa === In the 1970s, students in South Africa contributed to the movement against the apartheid. On June 16, 1976, students congregated in what would come to be known at the Soweto Uprising. Here, they led a peaceful protest in response to the Bantu Education Act of 1953. In an attempt to break apart the protest, police met the students with violence and force. The violence that ensued during the uprising led many to sympathize with the protesting students. The exposed nature of the apartheid caused an international abhorrence leading to its deconstruction. ===South Korea= Sweden === In 2018, Greta Thunberg caught international attention when she began missing classes to protest climate change. What began as sitting outside Sweden's parliament with fliers in hand, quickly became an international student movement. On March 15 of 2019, students from more than 130 countries skipped school for the global climate strike. === Thailand === The overthrow of Thai leader Field Marshall Thanom Kittikachorn was primarily led by students. Called the 14 October 1973 Uprising, students were successful in overthrowing his military dictatorship and restoring democracy. In addition to Thanom, they also overthrew deputy Field Marshall Praphas Charusathien. After Thanom was overthrown he was forced into exile, but in 1976 returned to become a monk. Although he swore to stay out of politics, the presence of him caused student protests to begin again. On October 6, 1976, many protestors died at the hands of right-wing militants that had torn through Thammasat University. Left-wing students are now known to protest any Thanom-styled regime. Students played a very important role in the ongoing 2020 Thai protests. Students from many parts of Thailand are participating in a series of pro-democracy movements against Thai government under Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha. One instance saw a debate between students and Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan who used to be a part of the anti-democratic People's Democratic Reform Committee that called for Prayuth to staged 2014 Thai coup d'√©tat. === Uganda === Uganda has the second youngest population in the world, with rising numbers of university students seeking improved employment opportunities. Over the last 100 years since the establishment of the first Ugandan university, these students have been especially politically engaged. The structure of the university government system encourages political action, as student leadership positions are viewed as extensions of government elections and parties. During British colonialism and independence, students have played a crucial role in protesting government leadership with varied success. ===Ukraine=United Kingdom=== Student occupation at Cambridge University, 2010 Student political activism has existed in U.K since the 1880s with the formation of the student representative councils, precursors of union organisations designed to present students interests. These later evolved into unions, many of which became part of the National Union of Students formed in 1921. However, the NUS was designed to be specifically outside of \\"political and religious interests\\", reducing its importance as a centre for student activism. During the 1930s students began to become more politically involved with the formation of many socialist societies at universities, ranging from social democratic to Marxist‚ÄìLeninist and Trotskyite, even leading to Brian Simon, a communist, becoming head of the NUS. However, it was not until the 1960s that student activism became important in British universities. The Vietnam war and issues of racism initiated a focus on other local frustrations, such as fees and student representation. In 1962, the first student protest against the Vietnam War was held, with CND. However, student activism did not begin on a large scale until the mid-1960s. In 1965, a student protest of 250 students was held outside Edinburgh's American embassy and the beginning of protests against the Vietnam war in Grovesnor square. It also saw the first major teach-in in Britain in 1965, where students debated the Vietnam War and alternative non- violent means of protest at the London School of Economics, sponsored by the Oxford Union. In 1966 the Radical Student Alliance and Vietnam Solidarity Campaign were formed, both of which became centres for the protest movement. However, the first student sit-in was held at the London School of Economics in 1967 by their Students' Union over the suspension of two students. Its success and a national student rally of 100,000 held in the same year is usually considered to mark the start of the movement. Up until the mid-1970s student activities were held including a protest of up to 80,000 strong in Grosvenor Square, anti-racist protests and occupations in Newcastle, the breaking down of riot control gates and forced closure of the London School of Economics, and Jack Straw becoming the head of the NUS for the RSA. However, many protests were over more local issues, such as student representation in college governance,Smith, P. H. J. (2007)Student revolution in 1960s Britain: Myth or reality? better accommodation, lower fees or even canteen prices. Student protests erupted again in 2010 during the Premiership of David Cameron over the issue of tuition fees, higher education funding cuts and withdrawal of the Education Maintenance Allowance. During the wave of School Strikes for Climate in 2019, student strikes saw up to 300,000 school children on the streets in the UK, at protests organised by a network of local groups of youth climate activists. Umbrella campaign groups such as Scottish Youth Climate Strike in Scotland, Youth Climate Association Northern Ireland in Northern Ireland, and UK Student Climate Network in England and Wales, made demands to respective governments and local authorities on the back of these protests and achieved some successes, and continue to campaign for climate justice. ===United States=== A US demonstration against the Vietnam War, 1967 In the United States, student activism is often understood as a form of youth activism that can be oriented toward change in the American educational system, civil rights, law enforcement, nuclear weapons, to a wide range of issues. Student activism in the United States dates to the beginning of public education, if not before. Some of the first well documented, directed activism occurred on the campuses of black institutions like Fisk and Howard in the 1920s. At Fisk, students' concerns surrounding disciplinary rules designed to undermine black identity coalesced into demands for the resignation of President Fayette Avery McKenzie. Spurred by alum W.E.B. Du Bois' 1924 commencement speech, the students ignored the 10p.m. curfew to protest, and staged subsequent walkouts. After a committee formed to investigate the protests ruled unfavorably on Mckenzie's abilities and handling of the unrest, he resigned on April 16, 1925. Events at Fisk had wide repercussions, as black students elsewhere began to question the repressive status quo of the postwar black university. The next wave of activism was spurred by Depression-era realities of the 1930s. The American Youth Congress was a student-led organization in Washington, DC, which lobbied the US Congress against war and racial discrimination and for youth programs. It was heavily supported by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. The counterculture era of the 1960s and early 1970s saw several waves of student activists gaining increasing political prominence in American society. Students formed social movements that moved them from resistance to liberation.Flacks, 1988. An early important national student group was the Students' Peace Union, established in 1959. Another highlight of this period was Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) launched in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was a student-led organization that focused on schools as a social agent that simultaneously oppresses and potentially uplifts society. SDS eventually spun off the Weather Underground. Another successful group was Ann Arbor Youth Liberation, which featured students calling for an end to state-led education. Also notable were the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Atlanta Student Movement, predominantly African American groups that fought against racism and for integration of public schools across the US. The Free Speech Movement in 1964‚Äì65 at UC Berkeley used mass civil disobedience to overturn restrictions on on-campus political activities. The Free Speech Movement was the first US student movement that became a focus of scholarly attention into student activism. The longest student strike in American history started on November 6, 1968, and lasted until March 21, 1969, at San Francisco State College to raise awareness of third-world student access to higher education. The largest student strike in American history took place in May and June 1970, in response to the Kent State shootings and the American invasion of Cambodia. Over four million students participated in this action. American society saw an increase in student activism again in the 1990s. The popular education reform movement has led to a resurgence of populist student activism against standardized testing and teaching,HoSang, D. (2003). Youth and Community Organizing Today New York: Funders Collaborative on Youth Organizing. as well as more complex issues including military/industrial/prison complex and the influence of the military and corporations in educationWeiss, M. (2004) Youth Rising. There is also increased emphasis on ensuring that changes that are made are sustainable, by pushing for better education funding and policy or leadership changes that engage students as decision-makers in schools. Notably, universities participated in the Disinvestment from South Africa movement; University of California, Berkeley, after student activism became the first institution to disinvest completely from companies implicated in and profiting from apartheid. Major contemporary campaigns include work for funding of public schools, against increased tuitions at colleges or the use of sweatshop labor in manufacturing school apparel (e.g. United Students Against Sweatshops), for increased student voice throughout education planning, delivery, and policy- making (e.g. The Roosevelt Institution), and to raise national and local awareness of the humanitarian consequences of the Darfur Conflict.Rebecca Hamilton (2011) Fighting for Darfur: Public Action and the Struggle to Stop Genocide, Palgrave Macmillan (2011). There is also increasing activism around the issue of global warming. Antiwar activism has also increased leading to the creation of the Campus Antiwar Network and the refounding of SDS in 2006. Following the national growth of the Black Lives Matter Movement, and more intensely since the 2016 election of U.S. President Donald Trump, student activism has been on the rise. Alt-right Breitbart senior editor Milo Yiannopoulos' tour sparked protest at University of California, Davis, where he was scheduled to speak alongside \\"Pharma Bro\\" Martin Shkreli and University of California, Berkeley, all shutting his talks down before they started through large-scale protest. In February 2018 after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, many students began to organise rallies and protests against gun violence. A huge series of protests including the March for our lives followed, drawing millions of protesters and notably attacking the NRA as well as US gun laws. A number of student activists such as Emma Gonz√°lez who helped lead the protests quickly garnered media attention for their action. Today, these students created March for Our Lives (MFOL), a non-profit 501(c)4 organization. A number of other students have followed their lead and created other youth organizations, including Team Enough, which is being overseen by the Brady Campaign, and Students Demand Action, which is being overseen by Everytown for Gun Safety. Youth activism also became popular for other issues after the March for Our Lives movement, including EighteenX18, an organization started by actress Yara Shahidi of ABC's Blacki-sh devoted to increased voter turnout in youth; OneMillionOfUs, a national youth voting and advocacy organization working to educate and empower 1 million young people to vote which started by Jerome Foster II, and This is Zero Hour, an environmentally- focused youth organization started by Jamie Margolin. ===Taiwan=== * Sunflower Student Movement in 2014 * Anti Black Box Movement in 2015 ==See also== * Student government political party * Youth voice * Youth activism * Youth empowerment * Youth participation * List of social movements * Youth rights * International Students Day * LGBT Student Movement * Town and gown * Jeltoqsan * Counterculture of the 1960s ===Organizations=== * 180/Movement for Democracy and Education * All Assam Students Union * Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad *Australian Student Environment Network * Campus Antiwar Network * Canadian Federation of Students * Energy Action Coalition * European Students' Union * The Freechild Project * Federation of Student Nationalists * Idealist on Campus, a program of Action Without Borders * Kyoto Now! * National Youth Rights Association * North American Students of Cooperation * Dwight Hall Socially Responsible Investment Fund * New York Public Interest Research Group * Muslim Students' Association * People & Planet (UK's biggest student campaigning network) * Secular Student Alliance *Students Coalition Against War * Students' Federation of India * Students for a Democratic Society * Students for a Free Tibet * Students for Justice in Palestine * Student/Farmworker Alliance * Students for Sensible Drug Policy * Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry *National Students Federation * Baloch Students Organization * United States Student Association ==References== ==Further reading== * Still the Earth Jumps Back: Student Uprisings Then and Now Santa Barbara, CA, SBDisorientation Collective, 2006. * Guide to Social Change Led By and With Young People Olympia, WA: CommonAction, 2006. * Student activists become more media-savvy by David Linhardt, The New York Times (NYTimes.com). * History of Student Activism from Campus Compact. * Student Activism at Gettysburg College from Gettysburg College Musselman Library * Women's Protest at Gettysburg College, 1965‚Äì1975 from Gettysburg College Musselman Library * Andrews, William. \\"Dissenting Japan: A History of Japanese Radicalism and Counterculture, from 1945 to Fukushima.\\" London: Hurst, 2016. * Brax, Ralph S. \\"The first student movement.\\" Port Washington, NY : Kennikat Press, 1980. * Carson, Claybourne. \\"In Struggle, SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s.\\" Cambridge Massachusetts: Harvard University Press., 1981 * Cohen, Robert. \\"When the old left was young.\\" New York : Oxford University Press, 1993. * Fletcher, Adam.

The line connects Cheonan (on the Gyeongbu Line) to the railway junction city of Iksan. The Janghang Line is served by frequent Saemaeul-ho and Mugunghwa-ho passenger train services between Seoul and Iksan. There is also a link from Asan Station to the KTX network at Cheonan-Asan Station. ==History== The original Janghang Line was opened along its full length between Cheonan and Janghang by the Chosen Gyeongnam Railway on June 1, 1922. ===Upgrade=== The entire Janghang Line is being electrified and double-tracked and upgraded for higher speeds with a straighter alignment. Work started in 1997 from Cheonan. By the end of 2008, the new alignment was in service from Cheonan via Asan and Hongseong to Sinseong, from Jupo to Nampo, and from Ganchi to Janghang, and electrification was put in service on the first 19.4 km between Cheonan and Sinchang, after Asan, on December 15, 2008. The 17.1 km section near Janghang, opened in December 2007, also linked up the Janghang Line with the previously isolated Iksan-Gunsan line via a new bridge over the Geum River, with alignment built for two tracks but initially a single track laid. Currently the Sinseong-Jupo, Nampo-Ganchi and Janghang-Gunsan sections are in construction. The entire line is slated to be finished in 2018. The Janghang Line will link up with Seohae Line at Hongseong station. It will connect Hongseong to Hwaseong in Gyeonggi-do. It will be connected to southern extension of the Sosa‚ÄìWonsi Line and Sinansan Line. Seohae Line will serve 250 km/h speed, which will dramatically reduce travel time between Seoul and Hongseong. ==ServicesSeoul Metropolitan Subway=== The Cheonan‚ÄìSinchang section of this line is a part of Seoul Subway's Line 1. == Stations == { border=1 class= !

Some Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish and African cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor. This results in a blend of the several different cultural influences. A small but noteworthy Chinese influence can also be accounted for, mainly in the Havana area. There is also some Italian influence. During colonial times, Cuba was an important port for trade, and many Spaniards who lived there brought their culinary traditions with them.Rodriguez, H. Cuban Food Profile: Cuban Food History ==Overview== As a result of the colonization of Cuba by Spain, one of the main influences on the cuisine is from Spain. Other culinary influences include Africa, from the Africans who were brought to Cuba as slaves, and French, from the French colonists who came to Cuba from Haiti.Rodriguez, H. \\"Cuban Food Profile: Cuban Food History\\" Another factor is that Cuba is an island, making seafood something that greatly influences Cuban cuisine. Another contributing factor to Cuban cuisine is that Cuba is in a tropical climate, which produces fruits and root vegetables that are used in Cuban dishes and meals.Murray, J. Cuban Cuisine, Cuba History and Their Food A typical meal consists of rice and beans, cooked together or apart. When cooked together the recipe is called \\"congri\\" or \\"Moros\\" or \\"Moros y Cristianos\\" (black beans and rice). If cooked separately it is called \\"arroz con frijoles\\" (rice with beans) or \\"arroz y frijoles\\" (rice and beans). ==Cuban sandwich== A typical Cuban sandwich (picture from South Florida) A Cuban sandwich (sometimes called a mixto, especially in Cuba) is a popular lunch item that grew out of the once-open flow of cigar workers between Cuba and Florida (specifically Key West and the Ybor City neighborhood of Tampa) in the late 19th century and has since spread to other Cuban American communities. The sandwich is built on a base of lightly buttered Cuban bread and contains sliced roast pork, thinly sliced Serrano ham, Swiss cheese, dill pickles, and yellow mustard. In Tampa, Genoa salami is traditionally layered in with the other meats, probably due to influence of Italian immigrants who lived side- by-side with Cubans and Spaniards in Ybor City. Tomatoes and lettuce are available additions in many restaurants, but these are considered by traditionalists as an unacceptable Americanization of the sandwich. After assembly, the Cuban sandwich may be pressed in a grooveless panini-type grill called a plancha, which both heats and compresses the contents. ==List of Cuban dishes and foods== Ropa vieja (shredded flank steak in a tomato sauce base), black beans, yellow rice, plantains and fried yuca with beer * Arroz con leche * Arroz con maiz * Arroz con pollo * Batido * Bistec de Palomilla * Boliche * Bu√±uelo * Butifarra * Camarones * Chivirico * Churros * Croqueta * Cucurucho * Dulce de leche * Empanada * Flan de calabaza * Flan de coco * Flan de guayaba * Flan de huevos * Elena Ruz * Frijoles negros * Frita * Fuf√∫ de Pl√°tano * Guayaba * Majarete * Medianoche * Mermelada * Mojo Criollo * Morcilla * Moros y Cristianos * Natilla * Papa rellena * Papitas fritas * Pasteles * Picadillo * Platano maduro frito * Pud√≠n de pan * Pulpeta * Ropa vieja * Sandwich Cubano * Sopa de pollo * Tamale * Tortilla de patatas * Tasajo * Tostada * Tostones * Tres leches cake * Turrones * Vaca Frita * Yuca con mojo * Yuca frita ==List of Cuban drinks== Two Cuba Libres * Batido - Milkshake coming in flavors such as guanabana and trigo (wheat) * Cafe Cubano - Cuban espresso * Cuba Libre ‚Äì Rum, Coca-Cola, sugar, and lime * Daiquiri - Rum, Lime, syrup (variations with fruit) * El Presidente * Guarapo ‚Äì juice made from pressed sugar cane * Hatuey beer * Ironbeer * Malta (soft drink) ‚Äì malt beverage * Materva * Mojito ‚Äì Rum, mint, sugar, lime, and club soda * Jupina - pineapple soda * Cortadito - Cuban espresso and steamed evaporated milk * Carajillo - Cuban Espresso, Liquor 43 * Pi√±a Colada - rum, pineapple, and coconut ==See also== * Caribbean cuisine * Flattop grill ==References== ==Bibliography== * Ar√≥stegui, Gonzalo, et al.: Manual del Cocinero Criollo, Cuba, 19th century. * Buchmann, Christine. \\"Cuban Home Gardens and Their Role in Social‚ÄìEcological Resilience.\\" Human Ecology: An Interdisciplinary Journal 37.6 (2009): 705-721. 16 Jan. 2010. * Cancio-Bello, Carla. \\"The Growing Popularity of Cuban Cuisine.\\" (2012): http://www.cubancuisine.co.uk * Carris Alonso, Cynthia. \\"A Taste of Cuba: A Journey Through Cuba and its Savory Cuisine.\\" Apollo Publishers, 2018 *Folch, Christine. \\"Fine Dining: Race in Prerevolution Cookbooks.\\" Latin American Research Review 43.2 (2008): 205-223. 3 Feb. 2010. * Hunt, Nigel. \\"The Agriculture History in Cuba.\\" Cuba Agriculture. 2008.

He was a Democratic United States Senator from the state of North Carolina, a position that he filled for a single term from 1975 until 1981. To date he is the only alum of East Carolina University to serve in the US senate, and was succeeded by to date the only faculty of East Carolina University to serve in the US senate, John Porter East. ==Life and career== Born in Lillington, North Carolina, Morgan attended Lillington public schools and later East Carolina College and Wake Forest University School of Law. Morgan's political career began early when political leaders in his home county of Harnett County, including highly respected Democratic stalwart Veneble Baggett, visited him at the Wake Forest Law School and urged him to run for Clerk of Court. Morgan did so and was elected. After building a reputation in that office, he went into the private practice of law. His skill as a trial lawyer caused his practice to grow, and he soon established a reputation that extended across the state. Personal injury, real property and antitrust law were among his specialties. He next ran for the North Carolina State Senate and won. He rose to the Senate's highest office, President Pro Tempore, and chaired key committees. He mastered the legislative process, and the experience he obtained in the State Senate served him well when he was later sent to the United States Senate by the voters of North Carolina. In 1968, Morgan challenged long-time incumbent Attorney General Wade Bruton in the Democratic Party primary, defeated him, and then won the General Election. He served one four-year term and then was re-elected. He served two years of that term and then resigned to run for the U.S. Senate. Early in his political career, Morgan was considered a supporter of segregation because of his allegiance to his former Wake Forest law professor, politician I. Beverly Lake, Sr., who ran an unsuccessful pro-segregation campaign for governor in 1960 against the progressive supporter of civil rights, Terry Sanford. But later, as an influential state senator, as North Carolina attorney general from 1969 to 1974, and as the successful candidate to succeed Democratic U.S. Senator Sam Ervin, Morgan was considered a moderate. After winning the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate in 1974, Morgan resigned as attorney general. He then won the general election over Republican William Stevens, garnering 63% of the vote.2008 North Carolina Election Primer Morgan was defeated for re-election in 1980 by Republican John Porter East, an ally of the state's senior senator, Jesse Helms, in an extremely close race.Our Campaigns - NC US Senate Race - Nov 04, 1980 Morgan returned to the practice of law and also served as director of North Carolina's State Bureau of Investigation under Attorney General Lacy Thornburg. From 2000 to 2003, Morgan served as founding president of the North Carolina Center for Voter Education, a Raleigh, North Carolina based nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that seeks to increase civic engagement in North Carolina.

A paraplegic since 1955, because of polio, East was a professor of political science at East Carolina University in Greenville. == Early life and education == John Porter East was born in Springfield, Illinois on May 5, 1931, the son of an employee of the State of Illinois. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Earlham College in Indiana where he was left tackle on the football team. After his graduation in 1953, he married Priscilla Sherk and was commissioned as an officer in the United States Marine Corps. In 1955, East contracted polio while serving at Camp Lejeune. He would never walk again. He received a LL.B. degree from the University of Illinois College of Law and practiced law in Naples, Florida for one year. He went on to receive his M.A. and Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Florida. == Political career == East was a prot√©g√© of conservative Senator Jesse Helms. In 1966, East ran unsuccessfully for a vacancy in the United States House of Representatives in a special election, a race won by Walter B. Jones, Sr.. In 1980, with the benefit of Ronald Reagan's North Carolina influence, East narrowly defeated incumbent Democratic Senator Robert Burren Morgan, largely on the strength of political advertising about Morgan's involvement with the turnover of the Panama Canal to the government of Panama. In the Senate, he earned a reputation as a staunch social conservative, especially on the issue of abortion. Alongside Jesse Helms, East led opposition to the bill to create a federal holiday to honor Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1983. East was also a national security hawk, and was a member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Security and Terrorism along with Orrin Hatch and Jeremiah Denton. The committee is notable for its accusations of Soviet infiltration of left-wing think tanks, publications and activist groups such as the Institute for Policy Studies and the magazine Mother Jones. East's primary national security staffer on the committee, Samuel T. Francis, later a prominent columnist for the Washington Times, has been cited as an intellectual fore-bearer of the alt-right movement. In 1986, he announced that he would not seek re-election, and would instead return to his teaching position. That summer, East, suffering from hypothyroidism, killed himself (for reasons that are still unclear) at his North Carolina home. == Death == On Friday, June 27, 1986, Senator East completed work on the book galleys of his collected essays. He met with Supreme Court nominee Antonin Scalia. Then, commitments met, the Senator drove to Greenville with his aide, John Petree, and arrived home about noon on Saturday. Petree stayed with him until daughter Kathryn arrived for a visit. Kathryn left her father \\"in good spirits\\" about midnight. Petree returned to East's house on Sunday morning, June 29. He found the front door ajar. The senator was dead in his garage, a victim of suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning.\\"N.C. Sen.

He represented much of the Foothills region of the state in the House from 1963 to 1986, and served in the Senate for four months in 1986.http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/brownlee-brubeck.html He was born in Lenoir, North Carolina, the youngest son of North Carolina furniture magnate J. E. Broyhill. The senior Broyhill was a member of the Republican National Committee for 28 years. However, for most of that time the party was almost nonexistent in the former Confederacy, including North Carolina. After attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Jim Broyhill joined his father's company in 1945 and served in various capacities there until 1962. He was also active in several state industry associations, as well as a civic leader in Lenoir. He made his first run for elected office in 1962 for North Carolina's 9th Congressional District. Broyhill was the unexpected beneficiary of redistricting after the 1960 census, which cost North Carolina a congressional district. The Democratic-controlled General Assembly saw a chance to get rid of the then lone Republican in the congressional delegation, Charles Raper Jonas of the Charlotte area by drawing his district from under him. In the process, they shifted some strongly Republican areas into the 9th, a district where growing Republican influence had kept five-term Democrat Hugh Quincy Alexander from establishing a foothold. At the same time, they shifted some strongly Democratic areas of the 9th into the new 8th District designed to defeat Jonas. However, the plan backfired disastrously when Jonas handily defeated 8th District incumbent A. Paul Kitchin and Broyhill defeated Alexander by just under one percentage point. Broyhill never faced another contest nearly that close again. Due to his very conservative stances on nearly all issues and an emphasis on taking good care of his constituents (most of whom had never been represented by a Republican before), he became very popular in his district. He won reelection by 11 points in the midst of the gigantic Democratic landslide of 1964, in which Lyndon B. Johnson carried 87 of North Carolina's 100 counties. Broyhill won reelection 10 times thereafter, never receiving less than 54 percent of the vote and only winning by less than 10 points twice in what became the most Republican district in North Carolina. His district was renumbered the 10th in 1969. On June 29, 1986, Senator John P. East, who was not seeking reelection, committed suicide. Broyhill had already won the Republican nomination for the race to succeed East, and Governor Jim Martin appointed Broyhill to the seat for the remainder of the term. The plan was to give Broyhill an incumbency advantage over the Democratic nominee, former Governor Terry Sanford. However, Sanford narrowly defeated Broyhill in November and took office immediately. Broyhill later served as Chairman of the North Carolina Economic Development Commission and then as the state's Secretary of Commerce under Martin. Broyhill remains active in North Carolina Republican politics as an \\"elder statesman.\\" He was inducted into the North Carolina Republican Party Hall of Fame and the Lenoir, North Carolina Post Office was renamed in his honor. He now lives in Winston- Salem with his wife, Louise Broyhill. He has a daughter, Marilyn Beach, and two sons, Ed and Phillip. His daughter Marilyn and his son Ed also reside in Winston-Salem. He has six grandchildren: Elizabeth Broyhill Morris, James Broyhill, Penn Broyhill, Laura Beach Dugan, Lindsay Beach and Ashley Beach. His son Ed was a candidate for the Republican nomination in the 5th Congressional District in 2004. ==Notes== ==External links== * Category:1927 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from North Carolina Category:United States senators from North Carolina Category:North Carolina Republicans Category:People from Lenoir, North Carolina Category:Republican Party United States senators Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Jesse Helms Category:State cabinet secretaries of North Carolina ","title":"Jim Broyhill"},{"id":"516818","text":"Japanese Navy can refer to: * the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1868‚Äì1945 * the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, 1954‚Äìpresent ","title":"Japanese Navy (disambiguation)"},{"id":"516826","text":"The Bujeon Line is a short railway line serving Busan, South Korea.

It connects Buffalo, New York, in the United States to Fort Erie, Ontario, in Canada. It is operated and maintained by the binational Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Authority. The Peace Bridge consists of five arched spans over the Niagara River and a Parker deck type truss span over the Black Rock Canal on the American side of the river. The length is . Material used in the construction included of steelwork, 9,000 tons of structural steel and 800 tons of reinforcing steel in the concrete abutments. The Peace Bridge was named to commemorate 100 years of peace between the United States and Canada. It was constructed as a highway bridge to address pedestrian and motor vehicle traffic which could not be accommodated on the International Railway Bridge, built in 1873. ==History== Peace Bridge from Fort retrofit The building of the Peace Bridge was approved by the International Joint Commission on August 6, 1925. Edward Lupfer served as chief engineer. A major obstacle to building the bridge was the swift river current, which averages . Construction began in 1925 and was completed in the spring of 1927. On March 13, 1927, Lupfer drove the first car across the bridge. On June 1, 1927, the bridge was opened to the public. The official opening ceremony was held two months later, on August 7, 1927, with about 100,000 in attendance. The festivities were transmitted to the public via radio in the first international coast-to-coast broadcast. Newspapers at the time estimated that as many as 50 million listeners may have heard the broadcast. The dignitaries who took part in the dedication ceremonies included The Prince of Wales (the future Edward VIII), Prince George, Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, U.S. Vice President Charles Dawes, Secretary of State Frank Kellogg, New York Governor Al Smith and Ontario Premier Howard Ferguson. When the bridge opened, Buffalo and Fort Erie each became the chief port of entry to their respective countries from the other. At the time it was the only vehicular bridge on the Great Lakes from Niagara Falls to New York. The bridge remains one of North America's important commercial ports with four thousand trucks crossing it daily. After new toll facilities were installed on the Canadian side in 2005, the Peace Bridge became the first E-ZPass facility outside the United States. There are no fees for entering the US. ==Alternatives== The Peace Bridge is one of the busiest on the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, with over one million trucks crossing it each year and delays of up to almost four hours. Other nearby bridges between the United States and Canada include the Rainbow Bridge, the Queenston-Lewiston Bridge and the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge. The Queenston-Lewiston Bridge and the Peace Bridge are the only Niagara River crossings that allow heavy trucks. ==Customs inspection and toll plazas== There are customs plazas at both ends of the bridge, with the Canadian plaza the newer and larger of the two. The inbound customs plaza in the United States has seven lanes for trucks and nine for cars. Pedestrians and cyclists are processed to the left of the truck inspection area. The inbound customs plaza in Canada was designed by NORR Limited Architects and Engineers and completed in 2010. There are 14 booths/lanes for cars and a separate area for trucks (handling five trucks at a time). Pedestrians and cyclists are processed in an area on the right side of the inspection area for cars. Once vehicles leave the customs plaza in Canada vehicles approach a smaller toll plaza to pay toll for using the Peace Bridge. Payment for tolls are either cash (US or Canadian), EZPass, as well as old Peace Bridge tokens. There are no toll booths on the US side and no tolls for pedestrians or cyclists. ===Preclearance=== In October 2012 it was announced by the DHS and Public Safety Canada that a pilot program, years in the works, to preclear all truck traffic from Canada into Buffalo would be commenced. The pilot would start in late December 2012 and run for 18 months, after which the economic benefits would be assessed and its feasibility to make permanent would then be recommended to both U.S Congress and Canadian Parliament. ==Road connections== On the New York side, Interstate 190 has a direct northbound off-ramp (exit 9) onto the Peace Bridge. This exit is signed as \\"Ft Erie Can\\" on I-190. On the Ontario side, the Queen Elizabeth Way begins after (and ends at) Canadian Customs plaza. ==Commemorations== US Peace Bridge stamp * Buffalo resident Emma M. Herold-Haft composed the Peace Bridge March in honor of the bridge's opening in 1927. * Canada and the United States, on August 4, 1977, brought out a joint issue of postage stamps to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the bridge.

There are two dugouts, one for the home team and one for the visiting team. In general, the dugout is occupied by all players not prescribed to be on the field at that particular time, as well as coaches and other personnel authorized by the league. The players' equipment (gloves, bats, batting helmets, catcher's equipment, etc.) are usually stored in the dugout. In baseball, the manager, with the help of his assistants, will dictate offensive strategy from the dugout by sending hand signals to the first and third base coaches. To avoid detection, the first and third base coaches will then translate those hand signals into their own set of hand signals and then send them on to the batter and runners. ==Origin== The term dugout refers to the area being slightly depressed below field level, as is common in professional baseball. The prevailing theory of the origin of locating the dugouts below field level is that it allowed spectators seated behind the dugouts to see the field, specifically the home plate area. Unlike most other sports, the primary action in baseball is centered on one area ‚Äì home plate ‚Äì and obstructing this area from fans' view, even if by players on the bench, would not be popular with fans. Action in 1905 at West Side Park, Chicago. Ground-level bench in background. Not all dugouts are located below the field level. At the major league level, the few dugouts that are located at the field level are in multi-purpose stadiums to simplify the conversion from baseball configuration to another sports field configuration. At such ballparks, the seating area is raised such that the dugouts do not obstruct the spectators' view. Dugouts are also at field level at most amateur ballparks, where locating them below field level would be cost prohibitive or otherwise not beneficial. In these cases, the term \\"dugout\\" still applies, as does \\"bench.\\" In the early days of professional baseball, the seating areas were often constructed high enough that the bench was at field level. ==Variations== Most professional and collegiate ballparks feature dugouts that are below the field level, with concrete steps along the entire length of the dugout. Some feature a railing along the top step, or \\"lip\\", while others are open. In most Major League Baseball ballparks, as well as many minor league ballparks, the dugout is directly connected to the clubhouse by a tunnel. Most high school, Little League, and recreational ballparks feature dugouts that are at the field level, usually separated from the playing field by chain-link fencing. Historic Cardines Field, home of the Newport Gulls, uniquely features both dugouts on the first base side. ==Official rules== MLB rule 3.17Official Rules: Game Preliminaries specifies that \\"no one except players, substitutes, managers, coaches, athletic trainers and batboys shall occupy a bench during a game.\\" The rule also stipulates that players on the disabled list are allowed in the dugout, but may not enter the field of play at any time during the game. Players and coaches who have been ejected from the game may not remain in the dugout per Rule 4.07.Official Rules: Starting & Ending the Game Unlike most other sports, where a ball or puck entering a team's bench area has already passed out of bounds and is thus dead before it reaches the bench, it is possible in baseball for a dugout to be a factor in play. MLB rule 6.05(a) states that a fielder may reach into a dugout to catch a fly ball as long as one or both feet is on or over the playing field, and does not have a foot on the ground in the dugout when making the catch. MLB universal ground rules state that the player may subsequently enter the dugout after making the catch if his momentum is carrying him that way, but if he falls in the dugout as a result, the catch is allowed but baserunners advance in accordance with Rule 7.04(c).Official Rules: The Runner A live ball entering a dugout becomes dead and the batter-runner and any base runners advance in accordance with Rule 7.04(c). However, a live ball bouncing off a dugout railing, if present, is still in play (unless a foul ball). Due to the dugouts' location in foul territory, live balls entering dugouts usually only occur after an errant throw by the defensive team. Individual leagues at levels below MLB are free to set their own rules governing the dugouts as is appropriate for their league's ballparks and playing level. For example, the rule governing reaching into dugouts to catch fly balls would not apply in leagues where the dugouts are separated from the field by a chain-link fence that is taller than the players. ==Dugout choice in MLB== The dugout of the Detroit Tigers in Comerica Park is located on the third base side. Which team occupies the dugout on the first-base side or the third-base side is purely arbitrary. The Major League Baseball Rulebook is silent on the subject. There are many anecdotal reasons why one dugout is chosen over the other. In the past, the manager also served as the third base coach, so occupying the third base dugout meant less walking for the manager between innings. Contrarily, the thought is that since more close plays occur at first base than third, the first base dugout is preferred. For a pre-existing facility, the home team might choose the better clubhouse and the dugout on that side of the field. (For example, prior to their 2008 move to Nationals Park, the Washington Nationals occupied the third-base dugout at RFK Stadium because it was the larger and newer of the two dugouts.) Another factor can be the sun angle during day games. In ballparks where one of the dugouts faces direct sunlight for much of the game, which can be problematic on hot summer days, the home club might choose the dugout that is better shaded. In both the National League and American League, more home team dugouts are on the first-base side (9 to 6 each). Even the two oldest parks still in use differ on this point: the Cubs sit on the third-base side at Wrigley while the Red Sox inhabit the first-base dugout at Fenway. Due to the ballpark's orientation, at Wrigley the third-base dugout faces away from the sun from noon onward, whereas the first base dugout faces sunlight in the late innings. At Fenway, the third-base dugout faces the sun for part of a day game, while the first-base dugout remains shaded. === First base side === *Atlanta Braves (SunTrust Park) *Baltimore Orioles (Oriole Park at Camden Yards) *Boston Red Sox (Fenway Park) *Cincinnati Reds (Great American Ball Park) *Colorado Rockies (Coors Field) *Houston Astros (Minute Maid Park) *Kansas City Royals (Kauffman Stadium) *Milwaukee Brewers (Miller Park) *Minnesota Twins (Target Field) *New York Mets (Citi Field) *New York Yankees (Yankee Stadium) *Philadelphia Phillies (Citizens Bank Park) *Seattle Mariners (T-Mobile Park) *St. Louis Cardinals (Busch Stadium) *San Diego Padres (Petco Park) *Tampa Bay Rays (Tropicana Field) *Texas Rangers (Globe Life Park in Arlington) *Washington Nationals (Nationals Park) === Third base side === *Arizona Diamondbacks (Chase Field) *Chicago Cubs (Wrigley Field) *Chicago White Sox (Guaranteed Rate Field) *Cleveland Indians (Progressive Field) *Detroit Tigers (Comerica Park) *Los Angeles Angels (Angel Stadium of Anaheim) *Los Angeles Dodgers (Dodger Stadium) *Miami Marlins (Marlins Park) *Oakland Athletics (Oakland Coliseum) *Pittsburgh Pirates (PNC Park) *San Francisco Giants (Oracle Park) *Toronto Blue Jays (Rogers Centre) == See also == *Bullpen *Technical area == References == Category:Baseball terminology ","title":"Dugout (baseball)"},{"id":"516849","text":"In Judaism, Lifnei Iver (Hebrew: ◊ú÷¥◊§÷∞◊†÷µ◊ô ◊¢÷¥◊ï÷µ÷º◊®, \\"Before the Blind\\") is a prohibition against misleading people by use of a \\"stumbling block\\". The origin comes from the commandment, \\"◊ï÷∞◊ú÷¥◊§÷∞◊†÷µ÷£◊ô ◊¢÷¥◊ï÷µ÷º÷î◊® ◊ú÷π÷•◊ê ◊™÷¥◊™÷µ÷º÷ñ◊ü ◊û÷¥◊õ÷∞◊©÷π◊Å÷ë◊ú (Before the blind, do not put a stumbling block)\\" (). The Hebrew term lifnei iver is one of the offenses which the Talmud argues to be punishable by excommunication in Judaism. The stumbling block as a distinct, and negative, concept is also established in Christian theology: in Catholicism it is known as creating scandal. ==Biblical context== The regulation appears among a brief miscellany of regulations concerning ethical behaviour, covering issues such as consideration of the deaf, an \\"evil tongue\\", not bearing grudges, the impartiality of justice, and leaving gleanings for the poor demonstrate similar concerns against exploiting individuals, but focus on different issues. ==In Jewish oral law== Many halakhic principles are derived from lifnei iver, the oral Torah expanding its ramifications beyond a purely literal interpretation. In classical rabbinical literature, lifnei iver is seen as a figuratively expressed prohibition against misleading people; the Sifra (a midrash from the time of the Mishnah) argues that since the recipient of advice would be metaphorically blind in regard to its accuracy, they would metaphorically stumble if the advice was damaging or otherwise bad.Sifra de- vei Rav, Kedoshim 2:14 The Talmud extends the principle to also prohibit the facilitation of a sinful act by another individual, where the person in question would otherwise have lacked the opportunity or means to have committed the sin;Avodah Zarah 6b for example, the Talmud takes the regulation to prohibit the giving of a cup of wine to someone who has taken the nazirite vow (which includes a vow to not partake in wine or grape products). The Talmud expresses caution in regard to figurative interpretations of this principle, emphasising that the law only really covers those situations where the other individual could not possibly have committed the transgression without the aid of the first person violating the lifnei iver rule; this is known in the Talmud as two sides to the river (Trei Ivrah deNaharah)‚Äîif, for example, the person who took a nazirite vow had been about to take a glass of wine anyway, then handing them a glass of wine would not transgress lifnei iver. Lifnei iver as a principle recurs many times in more practical applications of Jewish law. For example, the Shulchan Aruch, an authoritative codification of Jewish Law (Halacha), warns a father to not physically chastise older children, as this will only entice them to hit back, which in its view would be a capital offence (Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 240:20). ==Academic perspectives== According to the editors of the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia, the prevailing notion in ancient Middle Eastern cultures was that bodily ailments and defects, such as blindness and loss of hearing, as well as circumstantial ailments, such as poverty, were punishments for sin;Jewish Encyclopedia the blind, together with cripples and lepers, were outcast by society and were prevented from entering towns, becoming paupers as a result. The biblical provision of laws to protect individuals afflicted in this manner would have had the effect, perhaps intended, of reducing the prejudice they suffered. ==See also== * Stolpersteine, German expression for \\"stumbling blocks\\" and memorial artwork by Gunter Demnig commemorating those deported and killed by the Nazis * Stumbling block ==References== * Category:Jewish courts and civil law Category:Jewish ethical law Category:Negative Mitzvoth Category:Hebrew words and phrases in Jewish law ","title":"Lifnei iver"},{"id":"516862","text":"Thomas Ollis Hicks Sr. (born February 7, 1946), is an American private equity investor and sports team owner living in Dallas, Texas.

During his tenure as owner of the club, Hicks served as the Stars' Chairman of the Board and the club's representative on the NHL Board of Governors. Hicks played an instrumental role in the development and planning of American Airlines Center.

On September 13, 2011, lenders voted to agree to have the Stars file for bankruptcy and sold at auction. On November 22, 2011, a bankruptcy court judge approved a bid by Vancouver businessman and Kamloops Blazers owner Tom Gaglardi to buy the team for $240 million.\\"Dallas Stars Sale To Tom Gaglardi For $240 Million Pummels Team's Creditors\\", November 22, 2011, Forbes.com; accessed November 23, 2011  In June 1998, Hicks bought the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball‚Äôs American League from George W. Bush. Under Hicks' ownership, the Rangers won the American League West Division crown in 1998 and 1999, but failed to deliver a World Series. Hicks made headlines across all MLB when he personally negotiated and signed shortstop Alex Rodriguez to the biggest contract in MLB history at that time; a ten-year, $252 million deal at the December 2000 winter meetings.Sullivan, T.R. Hicks 'betrayed' by A-Rod's steroid use MLB.com, Accessed June 1, 2013 That contract, however, severely limited the Rangers' ability to sign other players, and they would have only two more winning seasons during Hicks' ownership. Years later, Hicks pointed to the blockbuster contract as \\"one of his biggest regrets\\".Marchand, Andrew Tom Hicks regrets A-Rod contract ESPN.com, accessed June 1, 2013 The Rangers also spent a large amount of money on Chan Ho Park, who signed a $65 million contract with the Rangers following the 2001 season. The Park signing would be a disaster for the Rangers as the new \\"staff ace\\" was unable to adjust to the move from pitcher-friendly Dodger Stadium to the hitter-friendly American League. After finishing in last place for the division three seasons in a row with Rodriguez, Hicks agreed to trade to the New York Yankees before the 2004 season. Five years later, Hicks stated that he felt personally \\"betrayed\\" and \\"deceived\\" after Rodriguez admitted use of steroids while with the club from 2001 to 2003. As part of the agreement, the Rangers would supplement a portion of his remaining contract. This agreement would continue until Rodriguez opted out of his contract in 2007. On January 23, 2010, it was announced Hicks had agreed to sell the Rangers to a group led by Chuck Greenberg and Nolan Ryan. Hicks would have been a minority share holder in the new ownership group. Prior to bids being placed by potential buyers, Hicks told the media the Rangers were operating under normal business with no interference from MLB. Regarding the Rangers' inability to sign 2009 first round pick Matt Purke, he said, \\"We were disappointed that the family insisted on $6 million. The Texas Rangers were not willing to do that. It had nothing to do with MLB restrictions. There is a clear misimpression we didn't sign Matt Purke because MLB wouldn't let us. That's not true. We didn't because of Tom Hicks, Nolan Ryan and Jon Daniels. We were not willing to go to $6 million.\\" After his group had completed the purchase agreement, Ryan told the media the Rangers were unable to offer the first round pick the $6 million signing bonus both parties had verbally agreed upon after the draft because MLB, who were strictly overseeing the Rangers budget by this time, would not approve the amount needed to sign Purke. After the announcement of the pending sale by Hicks Sports Group (HSG), several additional hurdles occurred which had to be remedied before the sale of the team could be finalized. Several of the lenders, who were owed over $500 million, vocally objected to the deal accusing Hicks of rejecting a higher offer by Jim Crane and stated they would not sign off on the deal. Hicks has been sued by three different parties over the land adjacent to the stadium that was sold in a separate transaction as a part of the purchase by Greenberg and Ryan.\\"Hicks Sued Over Glorypark\\", nbcdfw.comDallas News coverage of Tom Hicks, dallasnews.com, February 2, 2010 On May 24, 2010, HSG filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection/separation of the Texas Rangers from HSG and asked the courts to approve of the sale of the Rangers to the group headed by Greenberg and Ryan. The move was made to expedite the sale and resolve the sale prior to the MLB trade deadline and draft signing deadline. Ironically, Alex Rodriguez was the largest unsecured creditor, owed nearly $25 million in deferred payments despite being traded six years earlier. Emails presented in court show that after Hicks agreed to an exclusive negotiation period with Greenberg attorneys for HSG were still in discussion with another bidder, Dennis Crane, about a sale price for the team and emailed the creditors on December 31, 2009 saying, \\"Basically, the response from the MLB was to prohibit us from negotiating with anyone other than Greenberg. Their intent seems to be to lock us into Greenberg even though Crane now has a clearly superior economic deal ‚Äì and may always have had based on Greenberg's current position. We need help here. Unless the lenders weigh in, we are going to be stuck negotiating a deal that is clearly worse than Crane's.\\" The bankruptcy court ordered a public auction to be held on August 4, 2010, and the winning bid was submitted by Greenberg/Ryan. Co-lead investors Ray Davis and Bob R. Simpson were named co-chairmen. In March 2011, Greenberg resigned as chief executive, sold his interest, and Nolan Ryan was named president and chief executive officer. Ryan was subsequently designated the controlling owner of the club by a unanimous vote of the 30 owners of Major League Baseball on May 12, 2011. ===Cruzeiro and Corinthians=== In 1999, Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst entered into a partnership with Cruzeiro Esporte Clube and Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, two popular Brazilian football clubs. Club directors and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst assured the fans that a new stadium was in development, but this never materialized. In 2003, after legal/financial troubles and partner infighting, Hicks retired from the company and the ownership group eventually left the partnership with Corinthians. There was no new stadium. ===Liverpool F.C.=== On February 1, 2007, it was made known through the English press that he was involved in a consortium with one-time friend and Montreal Canadiens owner George N. Gillett Jr. to purchase English Premier League club Liverpool F.C.; this takeover proposal was believed to be the front-runner after Dubai International Capital (DIC) withdrew their bid. On February 6, 2007, Hicks and Gillett's joint offer for Liverpool was formally accepted, valuing the club at ¬£218.9 million ($432.9M) (¬£5,000 per share and ¬£44.8M in debt). Liverpool became the third Premier League club to be acquired by American businessmen, the others being Aston Villa and Manchester United. When taking over the club, Hicks and Gillett made a joint declaration: \\"Liverpool is a fantastic club with a remarkable history and a passionate fanbase. We fully acknowledge and appreciate the unique heritage and rich history of Liverpool and intend to respect this heritage in the future.\\" Hicks stated his foremost priority was gaining silverware, and vowed to build a new stadium for the club at Stanley Park Stadium. The preexisting plans to build the stadium were revised but the stadium never materialized. Hicks became extremely unpopular among Liverpool fans for his failure to deliver on the promise of a new stadium or on the promise that no debt would be placed onto the club and for his allegedly misleading statements about planned and past investment in players. During Hicks and Gillett's period of ownership, Liverpool became associated with frequent boardroom wranglings as the owners fell out with each otherhttps://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/odd-couple- who-agreed-about-everything-except-coach-finance-stadium-2106003.html https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/gillett-admits- failings-to-fans-as-anfield-owners-remain-divided-930999.html https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2327146/Liverpool-owner-Tom-Hicks- to-sell-Anfield-stake.html and engaged in public battles with Parry and Ben√≠tez. Anger was also directed at the Hicks family when Tom Hicks' son, Thomas O. Hicks, Jr., had to resign from the Liverpool board of directors after sending an abusive e-mail to a Liverpool fan saying, \\"Blow me fuck face. Go to hell. I'm sick of you.\\" On January 22, 2008, a majority of Liverpool fans at the game between Liverpool and Aston Villa protested against Gillett and Hicks' running of the club, urging the pair to sell their shares in Liverpool to Dubai International Capital (DIC). Neither owner, nor their representative Foster Gillett, was present at the game. George Gillett was reportedly targeted by DIC to sell his shares. It was reported that he had fallen out with Hicks and he subsequently kept silent over his dealings with the club. On March 7, 2008, it was reported that Gillett had agreed to sell 98% of his Liverpool stock to DIC, but Hicks blocked the sale. In an interview on Prime Time Sports in Canada, Gillett revealed that he and his family had received death threats from angry Liverpool fans: \\"The fans don't want him [Tom Hicks] to have even one share of my stake in the club, based on what they are sending to me. As a result of that we [my family] have received many phone calls in the middle of the night threatening our lives, death threats. A number came to the office and my son, Foster, and daughter-in-law, Lauren, have received them.\\"I can no longer work with Tom Hicks, says George Gillett Jr On April 16, 2010, the club was put up for sale.https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2010-04-16-liverpool-sale_N.htm Hicks claimed that he believed the club had tripled in value during his tenure, and boasted that he would be looking for a price of four times what he purchased his stake for. He claimed that, \\"Liverpool will be the most profitable investment I've ever made.\\" On June 16, 2010, Walton MP Steve Rotheram tabled a motion in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom expressing dismay at the continuing ownership of the club. Hicks and Gillett were described as \\"asset strippers\\" and the club was being \\"drained by their greed\\". In October 2010, as part of a fans' campaign against the ownership, a video entitled Dear Mr Hicks was released virally via YouTube. Produced and directed by Mike Jefferies, it featured celebrity fans of the club giving their reasons why they wanted to see a change of ownership.http://www.wikio.co.uk/video/dear-mr-hicks-4232946 The Independent newspaper praised the video, saying, \\"True to the city's capacity to create something out of adversity, a wonderfully inventive viral film, Dear Mr Hicks, has been published online to make it clear where he ought to go. The fans' view can be summarised thus: away, and soon.\\" It was claimed that the video was watched 400 000 times in 42 hours. On October 15, 2010, Hicks lost ownership of Liverpool. Despite numerous attempts to prevent it, the club was sold to New England Sports Ventures (NESV), for a fee believed to be around ¬£300 million, which was far below Hicks' valuation of \\"between ¬£600M and ¬£1 billion (B)\\", by the club's board of directors in a 3‚Äì2 vote. Hicks is pursuing a (max.) ¬£1 billion suit against NESV and Kop Holdings for damages, claiming that, \\"This outcome... devalues the club...\\" and suggesting that he had been the victim of an \\"epic swindle\\".http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/9098046.stm From the time the club had been put up for sale, however, it had been widely reported that the fee that Hicks and Gillett were asking for was unlikely to be achieved. The Wall Street Journal pointed out that the asking price of ¬£600‚Äì800 million took no account of the fact that a new owner would have to spend ¬£375 million building the new stadium which Hicks and Gillett had promised and failed to deliver. The Daily Telegraph suggested that Hicks and Gillett were unlikely to achieve their estimated price because everyone knew that there was huge debt at the club and that these debts were due to be called in very shortly, meaning that the bankers would subsequently put the club into administration and then sell off the club at a bargain price anyway. The likelihood of the club being placed in administration increased once, on September 7, 2010, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Hicks's main creditor, placed the Texan's indebtedness in the toxic debt category as he was considered unable to find refinancing or to pay off the debt. In the end, none of the offers made were anywhere close to Hicks and Gillett's valuation and with the threat of administration looming the club was sold for ¬£300 million.https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2010/10/lims_new_offer_for_liverpool. html This meant that the sale in 2010 fetched ¬£80 million more than Hicks and Gillett had paid for the club in 2007, but because more than ¬£200 million worth of debt had been piled on to the club, resulting in huge interest rates and penalty payments, the outgoing owners ended up losing an estimated ¬£144 million on their investment. Liverpool fans were delighted to hear that the club had been sold. Steve Horner, from the fans' group Kop Faithful, declared, \\"It‚Äôs like a huge cloud has been lifted off us... Hicks and Gillett leave with no legacy, apart from one of chaos.\\" The chairman of Liverpool Supporters Club, Richie Pedder, announced to the Liverpool Echo, \\"This is the start of a new era. A lot has been taken off the club‚Äôs shoulders now. Good riddance to Hicks and Gillett.\\" Former Liverpool player Tommy Smith expressed his joy at the departure of Hicks and Gillett in his regular newspaper column: \\"But today they are out of our club ‚Äì and I‚Äôm as happy as every one of the Liverpool fans who‚Äôve made it clear they‚Äôre so sick of them. All they were ever interested in was making money ‚Äì not in owning what is for me the greatest football club in the world, investing in it properly and taking good care of it. Good riddance.\\" After selling the club, Hicks admitted that his relationship with the fans had been strained: \\"Something went wrong with my ability to communicate with the fans. I am saddened by it.\\" In the two years before Hicks and Gillett took control of the club, Liverpool won the UEFA Champions League in 2005 and the FA Cup in 2006 under manager Rafael Ben√≠tez. In the three-and- a-half years in which Hicks and Gillett owned the club, they won not a single trophy and at the time they left Liverpool the club were in the relegation zone of the Premier League standings.http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc- news/2010/10/05/relegation-is-stretching-credulity-says-liverpool-fc-manager- roy-hodgson-92534-27401811/ Hicks denied this claim, declaring that during his reign Liverpool's net spend on player transfers was ¬£150 million (sometimes cited as $150 million).http://sportinglife.com/football/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/10/10/15/SOCCER_Liverpool_Hicks.html The newspaper The Sunday Mirror calculated that the net spend probably did not exceed ¬£25.1 million and has accused Hicks of \\"creative accountancy\\", stating \\"what is irrefutable is that Hicks has exaggerated the net spend by probably close to six fold\\". During Hicks and Gillett's period of ownership, the club struggled to meet the interest payments on the loans taken out as part of the leveraged buy-out. Christian Purslow, managing director of Liverpool since June 2009, publicly stated in September 2010 that the debt was an important burden for the club because it limited investment in players: \\"The issue is that too much of that profit is being used to service loans put into place when the club was bought.\\" Hicks admitted after the sale that the club's debt was too great but argued that he had not been given sufficient time by his main creditor, the Royal Bank of Scotland, to repay the debt: \\"It has a little bit too much debt, no question. But we were going to fix that and we were frustrated by others.\\" He has also suggested that the Royal Bank of Scotland prevented him paying back the debt to them: \\"I can't go into the details but I can confirm the funds were available to pay off Royal Bank of Scotland entirely but between Royal Bank of Scotland, the chairman and the employees that conspired against us, they would not let us.\\" After more legal trouble with his other sports team, Hicks decided not to pursue his claims of a conspiracy against him.http://thelfczone.com/site/2011/05/06/fan-power-wins- the-day-liverpool-fc-an-epic-swindle-part-two/ On January 11, 2013, Hicks and Gillett finally decided to drop their case in the English Law Courts against Sir Martin Broughton, Christian Purslow and Ian Ayre, the three directors on the club's board of directors at the time of the sale of the club to NESV; they also agreed to drop their case against NESV and RBS Bank. The terms of the agreement are confidential, though it is believed that no monies were paid to Hicks or Gillett. Earlier in the week, Hicks and Gillett had lost a Court of Appeal bid to delay a High Court Trial so they could have more time to raise the monies needed to fund the multi-million pound lawsuit. ==Philanthropy== In addition to donating the land for aforementioned school in Frisco, Hicks donated a gymnasium to the St. Mark's School of Texas in Dallas. Hicks was also the 1996 co-chair of the Dallas Jewish Coalition for the Homeless \\"Vogel Alcove\\" project, and received the 2000 Henry Cohn Humanitarian Award from the Anti-Defamation League. ==References== ==External links== *Bio at Dallas Stars *Hicks Holdings Official Website Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:American financial businesspeople Category:American soccer chairmen and investors Category:American sports businesspeople Category:Businesspeople from Texas Category:Dallas Stars executives Category:Liverpool F.C. chairmen and investors Category:Major League Baseball owners Category:National Hockey League executives Category:National Hockey League owners Category:Private equity and venture capital investors Category:Sportspeople from Dallas Category:Stanley Cup champions Category:Texas Rangers owners Category:Marshall School of Business alumni Category:McCombs School of Business alumni Category:University of Texas System regents ","title":"Tom Hicks"},{"id":"516870","text":"Lovelace is a surname.

He was the 11th Premier of Quebec from May 24, 1897 to September 25, 1900. Born in what is Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec today, he was the son of Lt.-Colonel Gabriel Marchand (1780‚Äì1852) J.P., and Mary MacNider, a woman of the Anglican faith, daughter of John MacNider, 2nd Seigneur of Metis, Quebec. As a child, Marchand attended English schools and was taught in French at the age of 11. Fluently bilingual, Marchand became a journalist and writer. He became a notary and practised this profession for 45 years, but continued journalism and writing as well. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in the 1867 Quebec provincial election for the district of Saint-Jean and retained his seat for 33 years until his death. He was Leader of the Opposition from 1892 to 1897, and then won the 1897 election as leader of the Liberal Party. As premier, Marchand attempted to create a Ministry of Education in 1898. At the time, education was entirely in the hands of the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church in the province. His legislation was passed by the Legislative Assembly (the lower chamber of Quebec's legislature), but was defeated in the Legislative Council (the upper house). It was not until 1964 that a Ministry of Education was finally created in Quebec. F√©lix-Gabriel Marchand was still in office when he died in 1900 in Quebec City. He is interred in the cimeti√®re Notre-Dame-de-Belmont in Sainte-Foy, Quebec. He won the 1897 election and died in office in 1900.

Scholarpedia. Retrieved 2013-03-21. (The bumblebee bat is regarded as the smallest mammal by skull size and body length.) The Etruscan shrew has a body length of about excluding the tail. It is characterized by very rapid movements and a fast metabolism, eating about 1.5‚Äì2 times its own body weight per day. It feeds on various small vertebrates and invertebrates, mostly insects, and can hunt individuals of the same size as itself. These shrews prefer warm and damp climates and are widely distributed in the belt between 10¬∞ and 30¬∞N latitude stretching from Europe and North Africa up to Malaysia. They are also found in the Maltese islands, situated in the middle of the Mediterranean sea. Although widespread and not threatened overall, they are generally uncommon and are endangered in some countries. ==Description== The Etruscan shrew has a slender (not truncated) body, with a length between excluding the tail, which adds another . The body mass varies between and and is usually about . In comparison, the related greater white-toothed shrew can be twice as long and weighs four to five times more. The head is relatively large, with a long, mobile proboscis, and the hind limbs are relatively small.Suncus etruscus. White-toothed pygmy shrew University of Michigan, Museum of Zoology The ears are relatively large and protuberant. The Etruscan shrew has a very fast heart beating rate, up to 1511 beats/min (25 beats/s) and a relatively large heart muscle mass, 1.2% of body weight. The fur color on the back and sides is pale brown, but is light gray on the stomach. The fur becomes denser and thicker from fall through the winter. The shrew usually has 30 teeth, but the 4th upper intermediate tooth is very small (rudimentary), and is absent in some individuals. Near the mouth grow a dense array of short whiskers, which the shrew actively uses to search for prey, especially in the night. Dimorphism in body features between males and females is absent. ==Activity== Etruscan shrews live alone, except during mating periods. Their lifespan is estimated at typically around two years, but with a large uncertainty.Longevity Records. Table 1. Record Life Spans (years) of Mammals . Demogr.mpg.de. Retrieved 2013-03-21. They protect their territories by making chirping noises and signs of aggressiveness.Stone, R. David (1995) Eurasian insectivores and tree shrews: status survey and conservation action plan, IUCN, p. 30 They tend to groom themselves constantly when not eating, and are always moving when awake and not hiding. The hiding periods are short, and typically last less than half an hour. Clicking sounds are heard when these shrews are moving, which cease when they rest. The shrews are more active during the night when they make long trips; during the day, they stay near the nest or in a hiding place. They reach their maximum level of activity at dawn. The movements of the Etruscan shrew are rapid, with a rate of about 780 min‚àí1 (13 s‚àí1). In cold seasons and during shortages of food, the shrews lower their body temperatures down to about and enter a state of temporary hibernation to reduce energy consumption. Recovery from this state is accompanied by shivering with the frequency of about 3500 min‚àí1 (58 s‚àí1). This induces heating, with the rate up to 0.83 ¬∞C/min, which is among the highest values recorded in mammals; the heart rate increases exponentially with time from 100 to 800‚Äì1200 beats/min, and the respiratory rate rises linearly from 50 to 600‚Äì800 beats/min. Etruscan shrews mate primarily from March to October, though they can be pregnant at any time of the year. Pairs usually form in the spring and may tolerate each other and their young for some time at the nest. The gestation period is 27‚Äì28 days, and they have 2‚Äì6 cubs per litter. Cubs are born naked and blind, weighing only . After their eyes open at 14 to 16 days old, they mature quickly. The mother usually moves the young when they are 9 to 10 days old and if disturbed leads them by caravanning them to a new location. The young Etruscan shrews are weaned at 20 days old. By three to four weeks of age, the young are independent and are soon sexually mature. ==Distribution== The Etruscan shrew inhabits a belt extending between 10¬∞ and 40¬∞N latitude across Eurasia. In Southern Europe, it has been found in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, France, North Macedonia, Malta, Montenegro, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Turkey, with unconfirmed reports in Andorra, Gibraltar and Monaco; it has been introduced by humans to some European islands, such as Canary Islands. The shrew also occurs in North Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia) and around Arabian Peninsula (Bahrain, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Syria, and Yemen including Socotra). In Asia, it was observed in Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bhutan, China (Gengma County only), Burma, Georgia, India, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Laos, Malaysia (Malaysian part of Borneo island), Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Vietnam. There are unconfirmed reports of the Etruscan shrew in West and East Africa (Guinea, Nigeria, Ethiopia) and in Armenia, Brunei, Indonesia, Kuwait and Uzbekistan.Suncus etruscus, Red Book of Kazakhstan (in Russian) Overall the species is widespread and not threatened, but its density is generally lower than of the other shrews living in the area. In some regions it is rare, especially in Azerbaijan, Georgia (included into the Red Book), Jordan and Kazakhstan (Red Book). ==Habitat== The Etruscan shrew favors warm and damp habitats covered with shrubs, which it uses to hide from predators. Areas where open terrain such as grasslands and scrub meet deciduous forests are usually inhabited. It can be found at sea level but is usually confined to the foothills and lower belts of mountain ranges, though has been found up to above sea level. It colonizes riparian thickets along the banks of lakes and rivers, as well as human-cultivated areas (abandoned gardens, orchards, vineyards, olive groves and edges of fields). The shrew, however, avoids intensively cultivated areas, as well as dense forests and sand dunes. It is poorly adapted to digging burrows, so it arranges its nests in various natural shelters, crevices and others' uninhabited burrows. They frequent rocks, boulders, stone walls and ruins, darting quickly in and out between them. ==Hunting and feeding== Because of its high ratio of surface area to body volume, the Etruscan shrew has an extremely fast metabolism and must eat 1.5‚Äì2.0 times its body weight in food per day. It feeds mostly on various invertebrates, including insects, larvae and earthworms, as well as the young of amphibians, lizards and rodents, and can hunt prey of nearly the same body size as itself. It prefers species with a soft, thin exoskeleton, so it avoids ants when given a choice. Grasshoppers, where common, are often regular prey. It kills large prey by a bite to the head and eats it immediately, but takes small insects back to its nest. When hunting, it relies mostly on its sense of touch rather than vision, and may even run into its food at night. ==Predators and threats== The largest threat to Etruscan shrews originates from human activities, particularly destruction of their nesting grounds and habitats as a result of farming. Etruscan shrews are also sensitive to weather changes, such as cold winters and dry periods. Major predators are birds of prey, especially owls. ==References== ==External links== *Videos of Etruscan shrew attacks Category:Suncus Shrew, Etruscan Shrew, Etruscan Category:Mammals described in 1822 Category:Taxa named by Paolo Savi ","title":"Etruscan shrew"},{"id":"516921","text":"A two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) or two-stage rocket launch vehicle is a spacecraft in which two distinct stages provide propulsion consecutively in order to achieve orbital velocity. It is intermediate between a three-stage-to-orbit launcher and a hypothetical single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) launcher. At liftoff the first stage is responsible for accelerating the vehicle. At some point the second stage detaches from the first stage and continues to orbit under its own power. An advantage of such a system over single-stage-to-orbit is that the most of the dry mass of the vehicle is not carried into orbit. This reduces the cost involved in reaching orbital velocity as much of the structure and engine mass is ejected and a larger percentage of the orbited mass is payload mass. An advantage over three or more stages is reduction in complexity and fewer separation events, each of which increases cost and risk of failure. Importance of Structural coefficient and ISP for Single-Stage-to- Orbit (SSTO) and restricted stage Two-Stage-to-Orbit (TSTO) vehicles. Based on a LEO mission of Delta v = 9.1 km/s and payload mass = 4500 kg for range of propellant Isp. GLOW=Gross Lift-Off Weight ==Examples== * Angara 1.2 * Atlas V (401 and 501) * Starship (development) * New Glenn (development) * Cosmos-3M * Delta IV (medium) * Falcon 1 * Falcon 9 * Electron * Miura 5 (development) * Saturn IB * Saturn V-SL1 (Skylab launch) * Titan II GLV * Tsyklon-2 * Vulcan (development) * Zenit-2 It is not always clear when a vehicle is a TSTO. Many designs which use booster rockets at liftoff are referred to as single-stage- to-orbit if there is no additional upper stage. Some have also coined the expression 1.5STO for 'one-and-a-half-stage-to-orbit', e.g. for the Atlas missile (the half stage refers to the booster engines which were jettisoned early in the launch). ==Reusable launch systems== With reference to a reusable launch system this approach is often proposed as an alternative to single- stage-to-orbit (or SSTO). Its supporters argue that, since each stage may have a lower mass ratio than an SSTO launch system, such a system may be built further away from limits of its structural materials. It is argued that a two- stage design should require less maintenance, less testing, experience fewer failures and have a longer working life. In addition the two-stage approach allows the lower stage to be optimized for operation in the Earth's lower atmosphere, where pressure and drag are high, while the upper stage can be optimized for operation in the near-vacuum conditions of the later part of the launch. This allows an increase in the payload mass fraction of a two-stage vehicle over single-stage or stage-and-a-half vehicles, which have to perform in both environments using the same hardware. Critics argue that the increased complexity of designing two separate stages that must interact, the logistics involved in returning the first stage to the launch site, and the difficulties of conducting incremental testing on a second stage will outweigh these benefits. In the case of airplane-like lower stages they also argue how difficult and expensive high speed aircraft (like the SR-71) are to develop and operate, and question performance claims. Many 'mini-shuttle' designs that use transport aircraft as first stages also face similar problems with ice/foam as the Space Shuttle due to the requirement they also carry a large external tank for their fuel. SpaceX is the only launch provider which achieved first-stage reuse of an orbital vehicle with the two-stage Falcon 9 and 2.5-stage Falcon Heavy. ===Helicopter-like first stage=== Taking the view that airplane like operations do not translate to airplane-like appearance, some reusable TSTO concepts have first stages that operate as VTOL or VTOHL aircraft. The DC-X has proven the VTOL option design workable. Other designs like the DH-1 concept take it a step further and use a 'pop-up/pop-down' approach, which delivers the orbiting stage to a point about 60 km above the earth's surface, before dropping down to the launch pad again. In the case of the DH-1, the upper stage is effectively an 'almost SSTO' with a more realistic mass fraction and which was optimised for reliability. ===Airplane- like first stage=== Some TSTO designs comprise an airplane-like first stage and a rocket-like second stage. The airplane elements can be wings, air- breathing engines, or both. This approach appeals because it transforms Earth's atmosphere from an obstacle into an advantage. Above a certain speed and altitude, wings and scramjets cease being effective, and the rocket is deployed to complete the trip to orbit. Saenger (spacecraft) was among the first concepts of this type. While not an orbital vehicle, the successful private SpaceShipOne suborbital spacecraft developed for the Ansari X Prize demonstrated that a two-stage system with a winged aircraft as the \\"lower half\\" can reach the edge of space. The team behind SpaceShipOne has built and flown a commercial sub-orbital launch system ‚Äî SpaceShipTwo ‚Äî based on this technology. The Pegasus rocket while airplane launched, is not a two-stage-to- orbit system because the rocket component itself is composed of multiple stages. ==References== Category:Chinese inventions Category:Space access Category:Rocket propulsion 2 ","title":"Two-stage-to-orbit"},{"id":"516925","text":"Pinus bhutanica, which may be called the Bhutan white pine, is a tree restricted to Bhutan and adjacent parts of northeast India (Arunachal Pradesh) and southwest China (Yunnan and Tibet).

A particularly extensive section of the Canada‚ÄìUS border is in the Great Lakes. The International Joint Commission () is a bi-national organization established by the governments of the United States and Canada under the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909. Its responsibilities were expanded with the signing of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1972 (later amended 1987 and 2012). The commission deals with issues affecting the extensive waters and waterways along their shared border. A six member commission, it has multiple sub-commissions, which deal with particular sections of the border-waters, or topics, and a technical staff to organize and inform task-forces. ==Role of the IJC== Canada and the United States created the International Joint Commission because they recognized that each country is affected by the other's actions in lake and river systems along the border. The two countries cooperate to manage these waters and to protect them for the benefit of today's citizens and future generations. The IJC is guided by the Boundary Waters Treaty, signed by Canada and the United States in 1909. The treaty provides general principles, rather than detailed prescriptions, for preventing and resolving disputes over waters shared between the two countries and for settling other transboundary issues. The specific application of these principles is decided on a case-by-case basis. The IJC has two main responsibilities: approving projects that affect water levels and flows across the boundary and investigating transboundary issues and recommending solutions.The IJC's recommendations and decisions take into account the needs of a wide range of water uses, including drinking water, commercial shipping, hydroelectric power generation, agriculture, ecosystem health, industry, fishing, recreational boating and shoreline property. ==Mission and Mandates== The International Joint Commission prevents and resolves disputes between the United States of America and Canada under the 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty and pursues the common good of both countries as an independent and objective advisor to the two governments. In particular, the IJC rules upon applications for approval of projects affecting boundary or transboundary waters and may regulate the operation of these projects; it assists the two countries in the protection of the transboundary environment, including the implementation of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and the improvement of transboundary air quality; and it alerts the governments to emerging issues along the boundary that may give rise to bilateral disputes. ==AuthoritiesOrders of approval=== The IJC has the authority to issue orders of approval. These orders place conditions on the application and operation of projects, such as dams, diversions or bridges that would affect the natural level of boundary waters. The application process for an order of approval is outlined in the IJC guide to applications. ===References=== The IJC studies and recommends solutions to transboundary issues when asked to do so by the national governments. When the IJC receives a government request, called a reference, it appoints a board with equal numbers of experts from each country. Board members are chosen for their professional abilities, not as representatives of a particular organization or region.https://www.ijc.org/en/who/role ==Activities== The movement of the water near Niagara Falls on the border, is used to generate substantial hydroelectricity ===Regulating shared water uses=== The IJC makes decisions on applications for projects, such as dams and diversions, that affect the natural level and flow of water across the boundary. Changing water levels can affect drinking water intakes, commercial shipping, hydroelectric power generation, agriculture, shoreline property, recreation, fisheries, wildlife, wetlands and other interests. If the IJC approves a project, it may impose conditions on project design or operation to protect interests on either side of the boundary. The IJC may also appoint a board to monitor compliance of operational requirements, such as flows through a dam. Projects approved by the IJC include hydroelectric power projects in the Great Lakes and on the St. Lawrence River, the St. Croix River and the Columbia River. The IJC is also responsible for maintaining emergency water levels in the Lake of the Woods basin and for apportioning water among various uses in the Souris River, St. Mary River and Milk River basins. ===Improving Water Quality=== In the Boundary Waters Treaty, Canada and the United States agreed that neither country will pollute boundary waters, or waters that flow across the boundary, to an extent that would cause injury to health or property in the other country. When asked by governments, the IJC investigates, monitors and recommends actions regarding the quality of water in lakes and rivers along the Canada-United States border. The IJC has water quality responsibilities for the St. Croix River, the Rainy River and the Red River. However, much of the Commission'swork focuses on helping governments clean up the Great Lakes and prevent further pollution. ===Improving Air Quality=== As well as damaging rivers and lakes, air pollution affects human health, especially for people with respiratory illnesses such as chronic bronchitis and asthma. Over the years, the United States and Canadian governments have asked the IJC to bring to their attention, or to investigate, air pollution problems in boundary regions. To support these activities, the IJC created the International Air Quality Advisory Board. As well, under the 1991 Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement, the IJC is required to collect and synthesize public comments on the air quality progress report published by the governments every two years. ===Investigating issues and recommending solutions=== The IJC studies and recommends solutions to transboundary issues when asked to do so by the national governments. When the IJC receives a government request, called a reference, it appoints a board with equal numbers of experts from each country. Board members are chosen for their professional abilities, not as representatives of a particular organization or region. References to the IJC have focused mostly on water and air quality and on the development and use of shared water resources. For example, one reference led to the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (1972), in which the two countries agreed to control pollution and to clean up wastewater from industries and communities. In 1978, a new agreement added a commitment to rid the Great Lakes of persistent toxic substances, which remain in the environment for a long time and can poison food sources for animals and people. Although IJC reference recommendations are not binding, they are usually accepted by the Canadian and United States governments. ==Organization and boards== The Commission is headed by six commissioners, three from each country. The Commissioners are appointed by the government of Canada and the United States. Commissioners do not represent their governments. The Canadian Commissioners appointed in 2019 are Pierre B√©land (Canadian Chair), Merrel-Ann Phare and F. Henry Lickers. The U.S. Commissioners appointed in 2019 are Jane Corwin (U.S. Chair), Robert C. Sisson, and Lance V. Yohe. The Commission has three offices, in Ottawa, Washington, D.C., and Windsor, Ontario. The Windsor Great Lakes Regional Office (GLRO) was created under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA). It is staffed by a bi-national team of U.S. and Canadian scientists and support staff. Separate boards are responsible for particular boundary waters issues. When there are special issues, a Task Force is assigned to make a report or recommendations.

The idea was based on the Korean traditional communalism called Hyangyak (Ìñ•ÏïΩ, ÈÑïÁ¥Ñ) and Doorae (ÎëêÎ†à), which provided the rules for self-governance and cooperation in traditional Korean communities. The movement initially sought to rectify the growing disparity of the standard of living between the nation's urban centers, which were rapidly industrializing, and the small villages, which continued to be mired in poverty. Diligence, self-help and collaboration were the slogans to encourage community members to participate in the development process. The early stage of the movement focused on improving the basic living conditions and environments, whereas later projects concentrated on building rural infrastructure and increasing community income. Though hailed as a great success by force in the 1970s, the movement lost momentum during the 1980s due to the unexpected assassination of Park Chung-hee. ==Overview== The movement promoted self-help and collaboration among the people during its first phase, as the central government provided a fixed amount of raw materials to each of the participating villages free of charge and entrusted the locals to build whatever they wished with them. The government first selected 33,267 villages and provided 335 sacks of cement. 16,600 villages that demonstrated success were then granted additional resources of 500 sacks of cement and a ton of iron bars. The New Community Movement did much to improve infrastructure in rural South Korea, bringing modernized facilities such as irrigation systems, bridges and roads in rural communities. The program also marked the widespread appearance of orange tiled houses throughout the countryside, replacing the traditional thatched or choga-jip houses. Encouraged by the success in rural areas, the movement spread through factories and urban areas as well, and became a nationwide modernization movement. However, despite the Saemaul Movement's great success in reducing poverty and improving living conditions in rural areas during its first phase, income levels in urban areas were still higher than income levels in rural areas after the rapid industrialization of South Korea. The government-led movement with its highly centralized organization proved to be efficient in the 1970s and early 1980s, but it became less effective after South Korea entered into a more developed and industrialized stage, which diminished the momentum of the movement. The relatively low income levels in rural areas compared to urban areas became a major political issue in the late 1980s ‚Äì one that no government intervention was able to fully solve during the first phase ‚Äì and the movement proved ultimately inadequate in addressing the larger problem of migration from the villages to the cities by the country's younger demographic. Moreover, the government-led centralized system caused corruption, such as misuse of funding, and changed South Korea's environment. Recognizing these problems, the South Korean government changed the centralized structure of the movement by empowering civil society to lead the movement. Since 1998, the Saemaul Movement has entered into the second phase, focusing on new issues such as enhancing voluntary services in the community and international cooperation with developing countries. Many developing countries in Africa are paying attention to the implications of the Saemaul Undong.https://asiafoundation.org/resources/pdfs/SaemaulUndongReedSept2010FINAL.pdfhttps://thediplomat.com/2017/10/south- koreas-saemaul-undong-in-africa/ Through the program such as Yonsei-KOICA Master's Degree Program, the Korean government is helping officials working in developing countries to design and implement new policies and programs in the context of national development policies.https://koica.yonsei.ac.kr/contents/about.htm?id=3KOICA ÏÑùÏÇ¨ÌïôÏúÑÏó∞Ïàò Í∞ÄÏù¥ÎìúÎùºÏù∏ == Criticism == During the late 1960s and 1970s when the policy started being implemented under the regime of President Park, local traditions and beliefs were suppressed, akin to the Cultural Revolution in communist China which happened at the same time. The movement Misin tapa undong (\\"to defeat the worship of gods\\"), also described as \\"movement to destroy superstition\\") reached its peak during the Saemaul Undong period. Old zelkova trees that had stood at village entrances and have traditionally served as guardian figures were cut down in order to erase \\"superstition\\". Practitioners of Korean shamanism were harassed, essentially destroying centuries old Korean traditions. ==Basic steps== The Korea Saemaul Undong Center explains how Saemaul Undong was practiced in the 1970s in South Korea in five steps: Step 1.

It is located north of Damascus and north of Homs. It is the provincial capital of the Hama Governorate. With a population of 854,000 (2009 census), Hama is the fourth-largest city in Syria after Damascus, Aleppo and Homs.Updated: Your Cheat Sheet to the Syrian Conflict. PBS. The city is renowned for its seventeen norias used for watering the gardens, which are locally claimed to date back to 1100 BC.

Placenames of the World. London: MacFarland and Company, Inc., 1997. ==History== The ancient settlement of Hamath was occupied from the early Neolithic to the Iron Age. ===Neolithic=== The stratigraphy is very generalized, which makes detailed comparison to other sites difficult. Level M ( thick) contained both white ware (lime-plaster) and true pottery. It may be contemporary with Ras Shamra V (6000‚Äì5000 BC). ===Chalcolithic=== Remains from the Chalcolithic have been uncovered by Danish archaeologists on the mount on which the former citadel once stood.Ring, 1996, p.315. The excavation took place between 1931 and 1938 under the direction of Harald Ingholt. The overlying level L dates to the Chalcolithic Halaf culture. ===Bronze Age=== Mittanni Period Although the town appears to be unmentioned in cuneiform sources before the first millennium BC,Hawkins, J.D. \\"Hamath.\\" Reallexikon der Assyriologie und Vorderasiatischen Arch√§ologie, Vol. 4. Walter de Gruyter, 1975. the site appears to have been prosperous around 1500 BC, when it was presumably an Amorite dependency of Mitanni, an empire along the Euphrates in northeastern Syria. Hittite Period By around 1350 BC, Mitanni was overthrown by the Hittites, who controlled all of northern Syria. In the south, the Hittites were in conflict with the Egyptians. Hamath became an important urban center. The conflict culminated in the famous Battle of Kadesh against Ancient Egypt under Ramesses II near Homs in 1285 BC. In early 19th century, Johann Ludwig Burckhardt was the first to discover Hittite or Luwian hieroglyphic script at Hama.The Decipherment of Hittite James Norman (Schmidt), Ancestral Voices: Decoding Ancient Languages, Four Winds Press, New York, 1975. ===Iron Age=== The Fall of the Hittite Empire saw the Neo-Hittite/Aramaean Hama attested as the capital of one of the prosperous Syro-Hittite states known from the Hebrew Bible as Hamath (Aramaic: ·∏§mt; Hittite: Amatuwana; ·∏§…ôm√•·πØ), which traded extensively, particularly with Israel and Judah. Assyrian inscriptions When the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III (858‚Äì824 BC) conquered the north of Aramea, he reached Hamath (Assyrian: Amat or Hamata) in 835 BC; this marks the beginning of Assyrian inscriptions relating to the kingdom.Hamath's history from the inscriptions was encapsulated by George L. Robinson, \\"The Entrance of Hamath\\" The Biblical World 32.1 (July 1908:7‚Äì18), in discussing the topography evoked by the Biblical phrase \\"the entrance of Hamath\\". Irhuleni of Hamath and Hadadezer of Aram-Damascus (biblical \\"Bar-Hadad\\") led a coalition of Aramean cities against the encroaching Assyrian armies. According to Assyrian sources, they were confronted by 4,000 chariots, 2,000 horsemen, 62,000-foot-soldiers and 1,000 Arab camel-riders in the Battle of Qarqar. The Assyrian victory seems to have been more of a draw, although Shalmaneser III continued on to the shore and even took a ship to open sea. In the following years, Shalmaneser III failed to conquer Hamath or Aram-Damascus. After the death of Shalmaneser III, the former allies Hamath and Aram-Damascus fell out, and Aram-Damascus seems to have taken over some of Hamath's territory. An Aramaic inscription of Zakkur, dual king of Hamath and Luhuti, tells of an attack by a coalition including Sam'al under Ben-Hadad III, son of Hazael, king of Aram- Damascus. Zakir was besieged in his fortress of Hazrak, but saved by intervention of the God Baalshamin. Later on, the state of Sam'al came to rule both Hamath and Aram. In 743 BC, Tiglath-Pileser III took a number of towns in the territory of Hamath, distributed the territories among his generals, and forcibly removed 1,223 selected inhabitants to the valley of the Upper Tigris; he exacted tribute from Hamath's king, Eni-Ilu (Eniel). In 738 BC, Hamath is listed among the cities again conquered by Assyrian troops. Over 30,000 natives were deported to Ullaba (located in Urartu) and replaced with captives from the Zagros Mountains. Destruction under Sargon II After the fall of the northern kingdom of Israel, Hamath's king Ilu-Bi'di (Jau-Bi'di) led a failed revolt of the newly organized Assyrian provinces of Arpad, Simirra, Damascus, and Samara. Styling himself the \\"Destroyer of Hamath,\\" Sargon II razed the city c. 720 BC,\\"Hamath Wrecked to Terrify Small Opponents of Assyria\\" The Science News-Letter. 39:13 (29 March 1941:205‚Äì206.) recolonized it with 6,300 Assyrians, and removed its king to be flayed alive in Assyria. He also carried off to Nimrud the ivory-adorned furnishings of its kings.The ivories were found there by Layard. One of the ivory panels found at \\"Fort Shalmaneser\\" is inscribed \\"Hamath.\\" (R. D. Barnett, \\"Hamath and Nimrud: Shell Fragments from Hamath and the Provenance of the Nimrud Ivories.\\" Iraq. 25:1. [Spring 1963:81‚Äì85.]) Hamath in the Bible The few Biblical reports state that Hamath was the capital of a Canaanite kingdom (; ), whose king congratulated King David on his victory over Hadadezer, king of Zobah (; ). In God's instructions to Moses, Hamath is specified as part of the northern border of the land that will fall to the children of Israel as an inheritance when they enter the land of Canaan (). Solomon, it would seem, took possession of Hamath and its territory and built store cities (; ). names the \\"entrance of Hamath\\", or Lebo-Hamath, as the northern border of Israel at the time of the dedication of the first temple in Jerusalem. The area was subsequently lost to the Syrians, but Jeroboam II, king of Israel, is said to have \\"restored the territory of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah (the Dead Sea)\\".: NKJV translation; cf. NIV translation, which refers to the Dead Sea Assyria's defeat of Hamath made a profound impression on Isaiah (). The prophet Amos also named the town \\"Hamath the Great\\" ). ===Hellenistic and Roman history=== Aqueduct in Epiphania (Hama). In the second half of the 4th century BC the modern region of Syria came under the influence of Greco-Roman culture, following long lasting semitic and Persian cultures. Alexander the Great's campaign from 334 to 323 BC brought Syria under Hellenic rule. Since the country lay on the trade routes from Asia to Greece, Hama and many other Syrian cities again grew rich through trade. After the death of Alexander the Great his Near East conquests were divided between his generals, and Seleucus Nicator became ruler of Syria and the founder of the Seleucid dynasty. Under the Seleucids there was a revival in the fortunes of Hama. The Aramaeans were allowed to return to the city, which was renamed Epiphaneia ( ),Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica, ¬ßE274.17 after the Seleucid Emperor Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Seleucid rule began to decline, however, in the next two centuries, and Arab dynasties began to gain control of cities in this part of Syria, including Hama. The Romans took over original settlements such as Hama and made them their own. They met little resistance when they invaded Syria under Pompey and annexed it in 64 BC, whereupon Hama became part of the Roman province of Syria, ruled from Rome by a proconsul. Hama was an important city during the Greek and Roman periods, but very little archaeological evidence remains. In AD 330, the capital of the Roman Empire was moved to Byzantium, and the city continued to prosper. In Byzantine days Hama was known as Emath or Ematho√πs (ŒïŒºŒ±Œ∏ŒøœçœÇ in Greek). Roman rule from Byzantium meant the Christian religion was strengthened throughout the Near East, and churches were built in Hama and other cities. The Byzantine historian John of Epiphania was born in Hama in the 6th century. An alley in Old Hama Eustathius of Epiphaneia () was a Greek historian. All his works lost. The most famous was the \\"Brief Chronicle\\" ().Suda Encyclopedia, ¬ß eps.3746 Stephanus of Byzantium writes that the Euphrates the Stoic was from Epiphaneia. ===Muslim rule=== Nur al-Din Mosque During the Muslim conquest of Syria in the 7th century, Hama was conquered by Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah in 638 or 639 and the town regained its ancient name, and has since retained it. Following its capture, it came under the administration of Jund Hims and remained so throughout the rule of Umayyads until the 9th century.Dumper, Stanley, and Abu-Lughod, 2007, p.163. Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi writes Hama became a part of Jund Qinnasrin during Abbasid rule.le Strange, 1890, p.39. Although the city's history is obscure at this time period, it is known that Hama was a walled market town with a ring of outlying cities. It came under the control of the Hamdanid rulers of Aleppo in the 10th century and was consequently drawn into the orbit of that city where it remained until the 12th century. These were considered the \\"dark years\\" of Hama as the local rulers of northern and southern Syria struggled for dominance in the region. The Byzantines under emperor Nicephorus Phocas raided the town in 968 and burned the Great Mosque. By the 11th century, the Fatimids gained suzerainty over northern Syria and during this period, the Mirdasids sacked Hama. Persian geographer Nasir Khusraw noted in 1047 that Hama was \\"well populated\\" and stood on the banks of the Orontes River.le Strange, 1890, p.357. Tancred, Prince of Galilee, took it in 1108, but in 1114 the Crusaders lost it definitively to the Seljuks. The governor of Hama in the early 12th century was Ali Kurd, and his sons, Nasir and Kurdanshah became vassals of Toghtekin.Chaliand, Gerard (1993). A People Without a Country: The Kurds and Kurdistan. London: Interlink Books. In 1157 an earthquake shattered the city.Robinson 1908:9. For the next sixty years, Hama was battled for by competing rulers. Nur al-Din, the Zengid sultan, erected a mosque with a tall, square minaret in the city in 1172.Nur al-Din Mosque . Archnet Digital Library. In 1175, Hama was taken from the Zengids by Saladin. He granted the city to his nephew, al-Muzaffar Umar, four years later, putting it under the rule of his Ayyubid family. This ushered in an era of stability and prosperity in Hama as the Ayyubids ruled it almost continuously until 1342. Geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi, who was born in Hama, described it in 1225 as a large town surrounded by a strongly built wall.le Strange, 1890, p.359. Hama was sacked by the Mongols in 1260, as were most other Syrian cities, but the Mongols were defeated that same year and then again in 1303 by the Mamluks who succeeded the Ayyubids as rulers of the region.Ring, 1996, p.317. Hama briefly passed to Mamluk control in 1299 after the death of governor al-Mansur Mahmoud II. However, unlike other former Ayyubid cities, the Mamluks reinstated Ayyubid rule in Hama by making Abu al-Fida, the historian and geographer, governor of the city and he reigned from 1310 to 1332. He described his city as \\"very ancient... mentioned in the book of the Israelites. It is one of the pleasantest places in Syria.\\" After his death, he was succeeded by his son al- Afdal Muhammad who eventually lost Mamluk favor and was deposed. Thus, Hama came under direct Mamluk control. Hama grew prosperous during the Ayyubid period, as well as the Mamluk period. It gradually expanded to both banks of the Orontes River, with the suburb on the right bank being connected to the town proper by a newly built bridge. The town on the left bank was divided into upper and lower parts, each of which was surrounded by a wall. The city was filled with palaces, markets, mosques, madrasas, and a hospital, and over thirty different sized norias (water-wheels). In addition, there stood a massive citadel in Hama. Moreover, a special aqueduct brought drinking water to Hama from the neighboring town of Salamiyah. Ibn Battuta visited Hama in 1335 and remarked that the Orontes River made the city \\"pleasant to live in, with its many gardens full of trees and fruits.\\" He also speaks of a large suburb called al-Mansuriyyah (named after an Ayyubid emir) that contained \\"a fine market, a mosque, and bathes.\\"le Strange, 1890, p.360. In 1400, Timurlane took Hama, along with nearby Homs and Baalbek.le Strange, 1890, p.xxiii. ===Ottoman rule=== Azem Palace in Hama was built in 1742 The prosperous period of Mamluk rule came to an end in 1516, when the Ottoman Turks conquered Syria from the Mamluks after defeating them at the Battle of Marj Dabiq near Aleppo. Hama, and the rest of Syria, came under Ottoman rule from Constantinople.Ring, 1996, p.318. Under the Ottomans, Hama gradually became more important in the administrative structure of the region. It was first made capital of one of the liwas (\\"districts\\") of the vilayet (\\"province\\") of Tripoli. Hama once again became an important center for trade routes running east from the Mediterranean coast into Asia. A number of khans (\\"caravansaries\\"s) were built in the city, like Khan Rustum Pasha which dates from 1556. Syria was later divided into three governorships and Hama was ruled by the governorship based at Aleppo. Then in the 18th century, it became a part of the holdings of the governor of Damascus. The governors of Damascus at this time were the Azems, who also ruled other parts of Syria, for the Ottomans. They erected sumptuous residences in Hama, including the Azem Palace and Khan As'ad Pasha which were built by As'ad Pasha al-Azem, who governed Hama for a number of years until 1742. By then, there were 14 caravansaries in the city, mostly used for the storage and distribution of seeds, cotton, wool, and other commodities.Reilly, 2002, p.72. After the passing of the Vilayet Law in 1864, Hama became the capital of the Sanjak of Hama (gaining the city more administrative powers), part of the larger vilayet of Sham. ===Modern history=== General view The clock tower of Hama Ottoman rule ended in 1918, after their defeat in World War I to the Allied Forces. Hama was made part of the French Mandate of Syria. By then, Hama had developed into what it has remained: a medium-sized provincial town, important as the market for an agricultural area abundant in cereals, but also cotton and sugar beets. It gained notoriety as the center of large estates worked by peasants and dominated by a few magnate families. The 1925 Hama uprising occurred in the city during the Great Syrian Revolt against the French. During the French Mandate, the district of Hama contained within its bounds the municipality of Hama and 114 villages. By an estimate in 1930, only four of these villages were owned outright by local cultivators, while sharing ownership of two villages with a notable family. Thus, the hinterland was owned by landowning elites.Dumper, Stanley, and Abu-Lughod, 2007, p. 164. Starting in the late 1940s, significant class conflict erupted as agricultural workers sought reform in Hama. Syria gained full independence from France in 1946. Akram al- Hawrani, a member of an impoverished notable family in Hama, began to agitate for land reform and better social conditions. He made Hama the base of his Arab Socialist Party, which later merged with another socialist party, the Ba'ath. This party's ascent to power in 1963 signaled the end of power for the landowning elite. Political insurgency by Sunni Islamic groups, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood, occurred in the city, which was reputed as a stronghold of conservative Sunni Islam. As early as the spring of 1964, Hama became the epicenter of an uprising by conservative forces, encouraged by speeches from mosque preachers, denouncing the policies of the Ba'ath. The Syrian government sent tanks and troops into the quarters of Hama's old city to put down the insurrection. In the early 1980s, Hama had emerged as a major source of opposition to the Ba'ath government during the Sunni armed Islamist uprising, which had begun in 1976. The city was a focal point for bloody events in the 1981 massacre and the most notable 1982 Hama massacre. The most serious insurrection of the Syrian Islamic uprising happened in Hama during February 1982, when Government forces, led by the president's brother, Rifaat al-Assad, quelled the revolt in Hama with very harsh means. Tanks and artillery shelled the neighbourhoods held by the insurgents indiscriminately, and government forces are alleged to have executed thousands of prisoners and civilian residents after subduing the revolt, which became known as the Hama massacre. The story is suppressed and regarded as highly sensitive in Syria. The Hama Massacre led to the military term \\"Hama Rules\\" meaning the complete large-scale destruction of a military objective or target. The city was the site of conflict between the Syrian military and opposition forces as one of the main arenas of the Syrian civil war during the 2011 siege of Hama. ==Climate== Its climate is classified as semi-arid (BSk) in K√∂ppen-Geiger system. Hama's inland location ensures that it receives no softening coastal influences and breezes from the Mediterranean Sea. As a result, the city has a much hotter and drier climate than nearby Homs. ==Demographics== A Greek Orthodox church. According to Josiah C. Russel, during the 12th century, Hama had a population of 6,750.Shatzmiller, 1994, p.59. James Reilly accounts the historical population as: 1812‚Äì 30,000 (Burckhardt) 1830‚Äì 20,000 (Robinson) 1839‚Äì 30‚Äì44,000 (Bowring) 1850‚Äì 30,000 (Porter) 1862‚Äì 10‚Äì12,000 (Guys) 1880‚Äì 27,656 (Parliamentary Papers) 1901‚Äì 60,000 (Parliamentary Papers) 1902‚Äì1907 80,000 (Trade Reports) 1906‚Äì 40,000 (al-Sabuni) 1909‚Äì 60,000 (Trade Reports)James Reilly, A Small Town in Syria, Ottoman Hama in the 18th and 19th Centuries, p73. Peter Lang Publishing (2002) In 1932, while Hama was under the French Mandate, there were approximately 50,000 residents. In the 1960 census, there were 110,000 inhabitants. The population continued to rise, reaching 180,000 in 1978 and 273,000 in 1994.Wincler, 1998, p.72. The infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births in the Hama Governorate was 99.4.Wincler, 1998, p.44. A 2005 estimate had Hama's population at around 325,000 inhabitants. Most of the residents are Sunni Muslims (including mostly Arabs, Kurds, and Turkmen), although some districts of the city are exclusively Christian.Dumper, Stanley, and Abu-Lughod, 2007, p.162. Hama is reputed to be the most conservative Sunni Muslim city in Syria since French Mandate times. During that period there was an old saying reflecting this characteristic: \\"In Damascus, it takes only three men to make a political demonstration, while in Hama it takes only three men to get the town to pray.\\" The Christian population mostly adheres to the Greek Orthodox Church or the Syriac Orthodox Church. ===Ecclesiastical status=== The Greek Orthodox Church has a prelacy in Hama under the Patriarch of Antioch.Schaff and Herzog, 1911, p.232. Hama is still a Roman Catholic titular see (referred to as \\"Hamath\\" or Amath\\"), suffragan of Apamea. It is as \\"Epiphania\\" that it is best known in ecclesiastical documents. Lequien mentions nine Greek bishops of Epiphania.Oriens Christianus, II, pp.915‚Äì918. The first of them, whom he calls Mauritius, is the Manikeios whose signature appears in the First Council of Nicaea.Gelzer, Heinrich, Patrum Nicaenorum Nomina. p.lxi. Currently, it has two Catholic archbishops, a Greek Melkite and a Syrian, the former residing at Labroud, the latter at Homs, reuniting the titles of Homs (Emesus) and Hamah.Missiones Catholicae. pp.781‚Äì804. ==Main sights== Hama's most famous attractions are the 17 Norias of Hama (), dating back to the Byzantine times. Fed by the Orontes river, they are up to in diameter. The largest norias are the al-Mamunye (1453) and the al-Muhammediye (14th century). Originally they were used to route water into aqueducts, which led into the town and the neighbouring agricultural areas. Other sights include: *the museum, housed in an 18th-century Ottoman governor residence (Azem Palace). Remains in the exhibition include a precious Roman mosaic from the nearby village of Maryamin (4th century AD) *al-Nuri mosque, finished in 1163 by Nur ad-Din after the earthquake of 1157. Notable is the minaret. *The small Mamluk al-Izzi mosque (15th century) *The mosque and Mausoleum of Abu al-Fida, a celebrated Ayyubid historian who was also governor of the city. *al-Hasanain mosque, also rebuilt by Nur ad-Din after the aforementioned earthquake. *The Great Mosque. Destroyed in the 1982 bombardment, it has been rebuilt in its original forms. It has elements dating from the ancient and Christian structures existing in the same location. It has two minarets, and is preceded by a portico with an elevated treasury. == See also == *Outline of Syria *Cities of the ancient Near East *Hama massacre *Short chronology timeline ==References== ==Bibliography== * *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. ==Further reading== *P.

Its native range in Canada is east of the Rocky Mountains from the Mackenzie River in the Northwest Territories to Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, and the north- central and northeast of the United States from Minnesota to Maine, with the southernmost part of the range just into northwest Indiana and northwest Pennsylvania. It is also known as grey pine and scrub pine. In the far west of its range, Pinus banksiana hybridizes readily with the closely related lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). The species epithet banksiana is after the English botanist Sir Joseph Banks. == Description == Foliage Closed, mature cones Pollen cones Bark Pinus banksiana ranges from in height. Some jack pines are shrub-sized, due to poor growing conditions. They do not usually grow perfectly straight, resulting in an irregular shape similar to pitch pine (Pinus rigida). This pine often forms pure stands on sandy or rocky soil. It is fire-adapted to stand-replacing fires, with the cones remaining closed for many years, until a forest fire kills the mature trees and opens the cones, reseeding the burnt ground. The leaves are in fascicles of two, needle-like, twisted, slightly yellowish-green, and long. Jack pine cones are usually and curved at the tip. The cones are long, the scales with a small, fragile prickle that usually wears off before maturity, leaving the cones smooth. Unusually for a pine, the cones normally point forward along the branch, sometimes curling around it. That is an easy way to tell it apart from the similar lodgepole pine in more western areas of North America. The cones on mature trees are serotinous. They open when exposed to intense heat, greater than or equal to . The typical case is in a fire, however cones on the lower branches can open when temperatures reach due to the heat being reflected off the ground. Additionally, when temperatures reach , the cones will open, due to the nature of the resin. == Ecology == P. banksiana forest with Vaccinium groundcover Kirtland's warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii), a formerly endangered bird, depends on pure stands of young jack pine in a very limited area in the north of the Lower and Upper Peninsulas of Michigan for breeding. Mature jack pine forests are usually open and blueberries are often abundant in the understory. Young jack pines are an alternate host for sweet fern blister rust (Cronartium comptoniae). Infected sweet ferns (Comptonia peregrina) release powdery orange spores in the summer and nearby trees become infected in the fall. Diseased trees show vertical orange cankers on the trunk and galls on the lower branches. The disease does not tend to affect older trees.Blouin, Glen. An Eclectic Guide to Trees: east of the rockies. 2001. Boston Mills Press, Erin, Ontario. pp 152-159. Jack pines are also susceptible to scleroderris canker (Gremmeniella abietina). This disease manifests by yellowing at the base of the needles. Prolonged exposure may lead to eventual death of the tree. Insects that attack jack pine stands include the white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi), jack pine sawfly, and jack pine budworm. == Commercial uses == Like other species of pine, Pinus banksiana has use as timber, although its wood tends to be knotty and not highly resistant to decay. Products include pulpwood, fuel, decking, and utility poles. == References  Bibliography === * * National Geographic Field Guide to Trees of North America. == External links == Category:Pinus Category:Pinus taxa by common names Category:Flora of Eastern Canada Category:Flora of the Northeastern United States Category:Flora of the North-Central United States Category:Flora of the Great Lakes region (North America) Category:Trees of Saskatchewan Category:Trees of Alberta Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States Category:Trees of Ontario Category:Trees of the United States Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America) Category:Least concern flora of North America Category:Least concern flora of the United States ","title":"Jack pine"},{"id":"516956","text":"Chris or Christopher Bell may refer to: *Chris Bell (American musician) (1951‚Äì1978), singer-songwriter and guitarist of the band Big Star *Chris Bell (American football) (born 1976), American football offensive tackle *Chris Bell, Australian musician, half of The Allen Brothers *Christopher Bell (businessman) (born 1957), British businessman *Chris Bell (poker player) (born 1971), American professional poker player *Chris Bell (politician) (born 1959), former US Congressman *Chris Bell (rugby union) (born 1983), rugby union footballer *Chris Bell (director) (born 1973), American director and writer *Christopher Bell (scholar) (1974‚Äì2009), disability studies scholar *Christopher Bell (racing driver) (born 1994), NASCAR driver *Christopher C.

He played professional baseball for 20 years from 1920 to 1939, including 17 years in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers (1923‚Äì1927), St. Louis Browns (1928‚Äì1930), Washington Senators (1930‚Äì1935), Boston Red Sox (1936), Brooklyn Dodgers (1937‚Äì1938), and Pittsburgh Pirates (1938‚Äì1939). After retiring as a player, Manush was a minor league manager from 1940 to 1945, a scout for the Boston Braves in the late 1940s and a coach for the Senators from 1953 to 1954. He also scouted for the expansion Senators in the early 1960s. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1964. A native of Tuscumbia, Alabama, Manush was one of the best batters in baseball in the 1920s and 1930s. He compiled a .330 career batting average, won the American League batting championship in 1926 with a .378 batting average, finished one point short of a second batting championship in 1928, finished among the top four batters in the American League six times (1926, 1928‚Äì1929, and 1932‚Äì1934) and totaled more than 200 hits four times (1928‚Äì1929, 1932‚Äì1933). In 1928, he finished second in the voting for the American League Most Valuable Player (MVP) award after leading the American League with 241 hits and 47 doubles, while also hitting 20 triples and compiling 367 total bases. He also finished third in the MVP voting in 1932 and 1933 and was the leading batter on the 1933 Washington Senators team that won the American League pennant and lost the 1933 World Series to the New York Giants. Manush was also a solid defensive outfielder, appearing in 2,008 major league games, 1,381 as a left fielder, 312 as a center fielder, and 153 as a right fielder. He led the American League with 356 putouts and a .992 fielding percentage in left field in 1928, and five double plays turned by a left fielder in 1935. His 2,855 putouts in left field rank 21st in major league history. ==Early years== Manush was born in 1901 at Tuscumbia, Alabama, a city in the Florence‚ÄìMuscle Shoals metropolitan area that is best known as the hometown of Helen Keller. His father, George Manush, immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1878 and worked as a cabinet maker and carpenter for a railroad company. His mother, Kate Manush, was born in Wisconsin, the daughter of German immigrants.Year: 1910; Census Place: Tuscumbia Ward 1, Colbert, Alabama; Roll: T624_8; Page: 2A; Enumeration District: 0004; FHL microfilm: 1374021.

He was one of eight children in the family, seven boys and one girl. All seven boys took up baseball, five of them playing the game professionally. His brother Frank Manush was 18 years older than Heinie and played professional baseball from 1907 to 1921. Manush was seven years old when Frank made his major league debut in 1908 and later recalled: \\"When I was as young as 7 or 8, Frank used to bring home all his baseball equipment and uniform. I would look at that weird paraphernalia and wish I could wear it. From then on, baseball was all I ever had on my mind.\\" Manush started high school in Tuscumbia but transferred as a senior to Massey Military Academy, located 80 miles northeast of Tuscumbia in Cornersville, Tennessee. In 1918, Manush moved to Iowa to join another brother in the plumbing business. He then moved to California in March 1919 and played semipro baseball with a club in Los Angeles. ==Professional baseballMinor leagues=== Manush began his professional career in 1920, playing six games for the Portland Beavers in the Pacific Coast League.Heinie Manush Minor League Statistics & History Baseball-Reference.com Moving to the Edmonton Eskimos in the Western Canada League in 1921, Manush hit .321 in 83 games. In 1922, he played for the Omaha Buffaloes in the Western League, hitting 20 home runs and compiling a .376 batting average that was second in the league behind only Carl East. ===Detroit Tigers=== Baseball Hall of Fame After Manush's 1922 performance in Omaha, he was purchased by the Detroit Tigers. In early February 1923, Manush returned a signed contract with the Tigers, joining a star-studded Detroit outfield that included future Hall of Famers Harry Heilmann and Ty Cobb, as well as reliable sluggers Bobby Veach (.327 batting average in 1922), Bob Fothergill (.322 average in 1922), and Ira Flagstead (.308 average in 1922). During his rookie season with the Tigers, Manush played well enough to appear in 109 games, 79 as a left fielder, sharing the position with Veach. He compiled a .334 batting average, tenth highest in the American League. He also led the league with 17 times hit by pitch. In 1924, Manush appeared in 120 games, 71 as the starting left fielder, and his batting average dropped 45 points to .289, though he again led the league with 16 times hit by pitch. Ty Cobb later accepted responsibility for Manush's slump in 1924. Cobb believed that, by studying the \\"science\\" of hitting, every batter could improve. Accordingly, he took Manush aside for several days early in the 1924 season to work on improving Manush's technique and batting stance. After working with Cobb, Manush's batting average and self-confidence plummeted. Cobb eventually came to the conclusion that, like Babe Ruth, Manush was a \\"natural\\" hitter rather than a \\"scientific\\" one and that it was a mistake to try to change a natural hitter. In 1925, Manush moved to center field as a backup to Cobb. He appeared in 99 games, including 45 as the team's starting center fielder and 12 as the starting left fielder, and compiled a .302 batting average. In 1926, Manush took over from Ty Cobb as the Tigers' starting center fielder, a position held by Cobb for 20 years. Manush had the best season of his career, compiling a .378 batting average to win the American League batting title. He also ranked among the league's leaders with a .986 on-base plus slugging rating (second behind Babe Ruth) and a .564 slugging percentage (third behind Ruth and Al Simmons). Manush trailed Babe Ruth for the batting championship going into the last day of the 1926 season. On the final day, September 26, the Tigers played a doubleheader, and Manush overtook Ruth by garnering six hits in nine at bats. By taking the batting crown, Manush also denied Ruth the Triple Crown. In a 1964 interview, Manush cited his beating Ruth on the last day of the 1926 season as one of two events in his career (the other was playing in the 1933 World Series) that most stood out for him. Manush's improvement in 1926 was credited to the mentoring of teammate Harry Heilmann, who won American League batting crowns in 1921, 1923, 1925 and 1927. After Manush slumped in 1925, Heilmann, who had a talent for placing his hits, \\"took Manush in tow and taught him some tricks.\\" After Heilmann's lessons, Manush developed a talent for dropping hits over second base between the left and center fielders. In 1927, Manush continued as the Tigers' starting center fielder, appearing in 146 games at the position, but his batting average dropped by 80 points from .378 to .298. He did still rank among the American League leaders, however, with 18 triples (second), 101 runs scored (seventh), 177 hits (tenth), 55 extra base hits (tenth), and 262 total bases (tenth). He also rated among the league's leading center fielders with a .971 fielding percentage (second) and 356 putouts (third). ===St. Louis Browns=== On December 13, 1927, the Tigers traded Manush and first baseman Lu Blue to the St. Louis Browns in exchange for outfielder Harry Rice, pitcher Elam Vangilder, and a player to be named later. The trade was promptly criticized as being one-sided in favor of St. Louis, and proved as much when Manush had an outstanding 1928 season for the Browns. Manush appeared in all 154 games as the Browns' starting left fielder in 1928 and compiled a .378 batting average, narrowly missing a second batting title to Goose Goslin who hit .379, one point higher than Manush. The battle for the batting title was the closest in 18 years, and Manush, who appeared in 19 more games than Goslin, led the league with 241 hits, 68 more than Goslin. Manush also led the American League in 1928 with 241 hits and 47 doubles and finished among the league leaders with 367 total bases (second behind Babe Ruth), 20 triples (second), a 6.8 offensive wins above replacement rating (third behind Ruth and Lou Gehrig), 80 extra base hits (third behind Ruth and Gehrig), a .575 slugging percentage (fourth), and 108 RBIs (fourth). He helped the Browns improve by 23 wins from a 59-94 record in 1927 to an 82-72 record in 1928. He also finished second behind Mickey Cochrane in close voting for the 1928 American League Most Valuable Player award, with Cochrane garnering 53 vote points to 51 for Manush. Manush had another fine season in 1929, appearing in 145 games in left field for the Browns, while compiling the third highest batting average (.355) in the American League. He also finished in a three-way tie for the league lead with 45 doubles and ranked fifth in the league with 204 hits. Manush was a holdout in 1930, refusing to report unless his salary was substantially increased. He finally signed a contract and reported to the club on March 20, 1930. Manush appeared in 48 games as the Browns' starting left fielder and compiled a .328 batting average. ===Washington Senators=== On June 13, 1930, the Browns traded Manush with pitcher Alvin Crowder to the Washington Senators in exchange for left fielder Goose Goslin, with whom Manush had battled for the 1928 batting title. It was reported at the time of the trade that the team owners were trying to rid themselves of players who held out, Manush and Goslin both having been holdouts at the start of the 1930 season. In the second half of the 1930 season, Manush took over Goslin's spot as Washington's left fielder, starting 86 games at the position and batting .362. In 1931, Manush started 146 games in left field and compiled a .307 batting average. In 1932, Manush had one of the best seasons of his career. Continuing as the Senators' left fielder, he compiled a .342 batting average, fourth highest in the American League, and finished third in American League MVP voting behind Jimmie Foxx and Lou Gehrig. He also ranked among the league's leaders with 214 hits (second), 121 runs scored (third), 324 total bases (fifth), 14 triples (fifth), a .520 slugging percentage (sixth), and 116 RBIs (sixth). Manush had another strong season in 1933. Appearing in 150 games in left field, he compiled the second highest batting average (.336) in the American League, trailing only Jimmie Foxx. He led the American League with 221 hits and 17 triples and ranked third in the league with 115 runs scored and 302 total bases. He also had a 33-game hitting streak in 1933 and finished third in the American League MVP voting. He helped lead the 1933 Washington Senators to the American League pennant with a 99-53 record. The Senators lost the 1933 World Series to the New York Giants, four games to one. Manush had only two hits and two walks, though he also scored two runs, in 20 plate appearances during the 1933 World Series. In Game 4, Manush was ejected by umpire Charlie Moran after arguing Moran's calling Manush out on a close play at first base. The Senators lost the game in the 11th inning, and the ejection of Manush was bitterly denounced by the Senators after the loss. After the game, baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis opined that Manush should not have been ejected and ruled that Manush would be permitted to play the next day. Manush confessed 31 years later to his actual conduct on that day. He recalled beating out the throw at first, which would have been a turning point in the game with Goose Goslin already on second base. Manush was so angry at the call that he had pulled on Moran's rubber bow tie: > I didn't lay a hand on Moran, but I did grab that bow tie and pulled it two > feet away from his neck and then I let it snap right back into his gullet. > ... Even before he could recover his breath his thumb went up and I was out. In 1934, Manush appeared in 137 games, 129 as the starting left fielder. He began the season on a torrid pace, batting .411 with 111 hits, 24 doubles and 10 triples by June 25. With his fast start, Manush set a major league record, which still stands, for the fastest player to reach 100 hits, accomplishing the feat in his 60th game of the season. He was selected to play in the 1934 Major League Baseball All-Star Game held on July 10, the second ever All-Star Game. In the first inning, Manush was walked by Carl Hubbell and executed a double steal with Charlie Gehringer. Manush slumped in the second half of the 1934 season, recording only 83 hits after June 25, but he still ranked among the league leaders for the 1934 season with a .349 batting average (third), 11 triples (second), 292 putouts in left field (second), a .980 fielding percentage in left field (second), and a 2.28 range factor per game in left field (second). The slump that struck Manush in the last half of the 1934 season continued through the 1935 season. His batting average plummeted to .273, 76 points lower than his 1934 average, and he started only 109 games, fewer than in any season since 1925. Despite limited playing time, he led the American League's left fielders with five double plays turned in 1935. ===Boston, Brooklyn and Pittsburgh=== On December 17, 1935, the Senators traded Manush to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for Roy Johnson and Carl Reynolds. At the time of the trade, some expressed hope that a change of scenery, and a reunion with manager Joe Cronin who had managed the Senators during Manush's best seasons, would help Manush return to his old form. Instead, the slump followed Manush to Boston, as he appeared in only 82 games, 72 as a starter, and compiled a .291 batting average. He was given an outright release by the Red Sox on September 27, 1936. On December 9, 1936, Manush signed as a free agent with the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Dodgers had been seeking a young outfielder, and The Brooklyn Daily Eagle reacted with surprise to the signing of Manush, its headline reading, \\"Dodgers Search for Youth Unearths Manush, Aged 36\\". In spring training with the Dodgers, Manush broke out of his batting slump, leading the Florida circuit with a .571 average by late March. He became the Dodgers' starting right fielder in 1937, and in his first season facing National League pitching, Manush compiled a .333 batting average, ninth highest in the league. Manush began the 1938 season with the Dodgers, but his batting slump returned as his average fell to .238 in 17 games. He was released by the Dodgers on May 15, 1938. A week after being released by the Dodgers, Manush signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. He appeared in 81 games for Toronto and compiled a .310 batting average in 277 at bats. On August 30, 1938, the Pittsburgh Pirates purchased Manush from Toronto as an \\"insurance outfielder and pinch hitter\\" for the last month of the pennant drive with the Chicago Cubs. Manush appeared as a pinch hitter in 15 games for the 1938 Pirates, batting .308 in 13 at bats. Manush returned to the Pirates in 1939, but played sparingly with no hits in 12 at bats. He appeared in his final major league game on May 22, 1939, at age 37, and was released by the Pirates on June 7, 1939. ===Minor league player and manager=== On June 12, 1939, Manush signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs, with whom he played for most of the 1938 season. He appeared in 66 games for Toronto and compiled a batting average of only .241. Manush spent the next five years as a player-manager in the Piedmont League for the Rocky Mount Red Sox in 1940, the Greensboro Red Sox in 1941 and 1942, the Roanoke Red Sox in 1943. In 1944, he served as manager of the Scranton Miners in the Eastern League, and in 1945 he became manager of the Martinsville A's in the Carolina League. Manush scouted for the Boston Braves until 1948, then served as a coach for the Senators during the 1953 and 1954 seasons. In October 1954, after Chuck Dressen was hired as the Senators' new manager, Manush was dismissed by the Senators. He later scouted for the expansion Washington Senators in 1961-62. ===Hall of Fame and legacy=== In 17 seasons as a player in the major leagues, Manush appeared in 2,008 games, 1,381 as a left fielder, 312 as a center fielder, and 153 as a right fielder, and compiled a .330 batting average with 2,524 hits, 1,288 runs scored, and 1,183 RBIs. His notable career accomplishments include the following: * His .330 career batting average ranks 33rd in major league history. His .378 average in 1926 was the highest in Major League Baseball that year, six points higher than Babe Ruth, thus depriving Ruth of the Triple Crown. * His 241 hits in 1928, a 154-game season, was the fifth highest single-season total to that point in major league history. It still ranks as the 11th highest single-season total. * His 2,855 career putouts in left field rank 21st in major league history. His 1928 total of 356 putouts in left field was the ninth highest single- season total in major league history at the time. * His 33 career double plays turned in left field rank 25th in major league history. In February 1964, Manush was elected by the Veterans Committee to the Baseball Hall of Fame. On learning the news, Manush, at his home in Sarasota, Florida, told reporters, \\"It's quite a shock to me to be picked ... I feel wonderful ... I had no idea this would ever happen to me.\\" The 1942 motion picture Obliging Young Lady opens with a comedic sequence in which Edmond O'Brien keeps repeating \\"Heinie Manush, Heinie Manush\\" in cadence with the sound of the train on which he is riding. At one point, a porter interrupts, \\"Who is Heinie Manush?\\", and O'Brien replies, \\"The great baseball player.\\" In the dining car, O'Brien continues even as he orders, \\"Filet mignon that's for me, filet mignon that's for me, Heinie Manush, Heinie Manush, Heinie Manush, Heinie Manush, filet mignon, medium rare, Heinie Manush, Heinie Manush.\\" The repetitive, onomatopoeic nature of the phrase fit the sound of the train so well that other riders began to pick it up, driving the conductor to distraction. Manush was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1964, and later posthumously into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1972. ==Family and later years== Manush was married, and he and his wife Betty had three daughters, Shirley who died at age 58 in 1987, Lillis, who also died in 1987 at age 56 and Sue McCaw, who lived in Florida and turned 76 in 2009. They lived in Sarasota, Florida, beginning in 1935. His wife died in June 1949 at age 46 after undergoing an operation at Harper Hospital in Detroit. Manush picked up the game of golf in 1935 and he won multiple city golf championships in Sarasota. Manush fought an extended battle against throat cancer, was placed in a Sarasota nursing home on March 11, 1971, and died there on May 12, 1971. He was interred next to his wife Betty at Sarasota Memorial Park. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball career hits leaders * List of Major League Baseball career doubles leaders * List of Major League Baseball career triples leaders * List of Major League Baseball career runs scored leaders * List of Major League Baseball career runs batted in leaders * List of Major League Baseball batting champions * List of Major League Baseball annual doubles leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual triples leaders * List of Major League Baseball triples records * List of Major League Baseball career putouts as a left fielder leaders ==References== == External links == * Category:1901 births Category:1971 deaths Category:American League All-Stars Category:American League batting champions Category:American people of German descent Category:Baseball players from Alabama Category:Boston Braves scouts Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:Brooklyn Dodgers players Category:Deaths from cancer in Florida Category:Deaths from throat cancer Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Edmonton Eskimos (baseball) players Category:Greensboro Red Sox players Category:Major League Baseball coaches Category:Major League Baseball left fielders Category:Martinsville A's players Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:National Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Category:Omaha Buffaloes players Category:People from Tuscumbia, Alabama Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Pittsburgh Pirates scouts Category:Portland Beavers players Category:Roanoke Red Sox players Category:Rocky Mount Red Sox players Category:St. Louis Browns players Category:Scranton Miners players Category:Toronto Maple Leafs (International League) players Category:Washington Senators (1901‚Äì1960) coaches Category:Washington Senators (1901‚Äì1960) players Category:Washington Senators (1961‚Äì1971) scouts ","title":"Heinie Manush"},{"id":"516967","text":"Three Man (also referred to as Mr. Three or Hat Man) is a drinking game played with two dice.

Walker's nickname was \\"The Pink Cat\\", and he gained some attention in the 1990s boxing scene for wearing pink boxing trunks and slicked-back hair, the latter a tribute to his idol, James Dean. He is best known for winning a ten round decision over hall-of- fame champion Alexis Arg√ºello, ending Arguello's ill-conceived bid at a comeback in January 1995. Six months after this victory, Walker won the WBC Continental Americas super lightweight title over Francisco Cuesta on July 17, 1995. This victory led to negotiations for a title shot against another hall- of-famer, Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez. Early in January 1996, Bob Arum's Top Rank Boxing offered Walker $55,000 to fight for Chavez's WBC junior welterweight title. This fight was considered a tune-up for Chavez's June 1996 bout against Oscar De La Hoya. Apparently, Chavez didn't want to risk the possibility that Walker could derail his plans for the de la Hoya fight, so Arum switched the Chavez-Walker fight to a non-title, ten-round event. The fight, nationally televised, took place on February 9, 1996 at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. Walker won the first round on two of the three judges' scorecards, but he got caught with a Chavez right hand half-way through the second round, after which he took a pummeling that referee Joe Cortez stopped at the 2:45 mark of the round, resulting in a knockout loss for Walker. This marked the first time (of only two times) that Walker was knocked out. Walker was paid $62,500 for his effort; Top Rank added $7,500 for withdrawing the title opportunity. He retired with a record of 25‚Äì7‚Äì1 (13 KO's). His last fight was a decision loss against Martin Ramirez in January 2001. In addition to his boxing career, Walker was a guitarist, singer and songwriter, and fronted The Pink Cat Band. They released a six-song CD called Bounty Hunter. Walker was found dead in his home of unspecified causes. He is a member of the Arizona Boxing Hall of Fame. ==ReferencesScott Walker and the Pink Cat Band - \\"Bounty Hunter\\" video Category:Boxers from Arizona Category:Sportspeople from Mesa, Arizona Category:1969 births Category:2004 deaths Category:People from Apache Junction, Arizona Category:American male boxers Category:Light-welterweight boxers Category:Sportspeople from the Phoenix metropolitan area ","title":"Scott Walker (boxer)"},{"id":"516980","text":"Yeongnam (Hangul: ÏòÅÎÇ®, ; literally \\"south of the passes\\") is a region that coincides with the former Gyeongsang Province in what is now South Korea.

Mepham, 1992 thence flowing southeast along the Zambian border. Along this reach it flows in a maze of channels in a swampy corridor 5‚Äì10 km wide (map 1: the border with Zambia is the eastern bank of this floodplain, not the river channel). As with all rivers in south-central Africa its flow varies enormously between the rainy season when it floods and may be several kilometres wide, and the dry season when it may disappear into marshes. The Cuando continues in its marshy channel across the neck of the Caprivi Strip of Namibia (map, 2) and then forms the border between Namibia and Botswana as it continues southeast. Some 10,014 years ago, the Cuando merged with the Okavango River and they flowed south to Lake Makgadikgadi (which is a seasonal wetland in current timesC.M. Hogan, 2008), but the land in that area was uplifted. As a consequence the Cuando now meets slightly higher ground (map, 4) and breaks up into many channels and swamps (called the Linyanti Swamp) dotted with alluvial islands, nearly disappearing into the Kalahari sands like the Okavango (map, 5). But instead it has diverted east and has been captured by the Zambezi. The flow turns sharply east, still forming the border with Botswana. In the dry season there are few open channels through the swamps and marshes. Beginning at this point it is known as the Linyanti (map, 6), and after it flows through a seasonal lake, Lake Liambesi (map, 7), it is called the Chobe (map, 8). The river then flows into the Zambezi just above the Kazungula Ferry (map, 9). In years when the Okavango experiences a good flood some of the water escapes east along the normally dry channel of the Magwekwana River (also known as Selinda Spillway) into the Linyanti Swamp, thus entering the Zambezi basin. The Selinda Spillway and the Boteti River are the only outlets of the Okavango basin. On the north side of the Chobe River are the Caprivi Swamps, on the edge of which is the ruined capital of the Kololo people who conquered Barotseland in the 19th Century. So much of the water of the Cuando, Linyanti and Chobe is lost to evaporation in the various swamps that its contribution to the flow of the Zambezi is very small except in occasional years when it floods excessively. The perennial river bifurcation of Selinda Spillway (or Magweggana River), on the Cuando River, connects the Kalahari Basin to the Zambezi Basin.Is this Harry and Meghan's honeymoon hotel?.

While sharing many similar features to styles like Wuzuquan, Huzunquan, and many others from the same region, this southern style of Chinese boxing has the unique feature of specializing in takedowns, Chin Na, and ground fighting while often taking advantage of utilizing techniques from an inferior position. This martial art also teaches Iron Shirt and Iron Palm fighting methods as well as specialized leaping techniques. Its creation is traditionally credited to a Buddhist nun who developed the style to defend herself from bandits on her travels. ==Origins== One of the legends on the origins of Dog Kung Fu says that in the southern area of China in Fujian Province, resided the White Lotus () temple, where often the nuns who were admitted previously lived secular lives. At that time women were often subjugated to the practice of foot binding. Therefore, any practice that required standing physical exertion was difficult in the least and practically impossible at worst. In response to these physical constraints, the nuns developed a system of fighting that they could use to defend themselves from bandits and wild animals. During the Qing Dynasty imperial regime's destruction of the temples, a nun by the name of Si Yue had left White Lotus Temple and traveled to the northern areas of the province. Supposedly she had fallen ill in the Yongtai region near Fuzhou, it was there that she was assisted by the Chen Family who took care of her until recovery. As she was indebted to the Chen Family she remained and taught their son, Chen Biao, Gouquan. The Chen family kept this art a family secret for several generations. Taiping - History of Dishuquan (Dog Boxing) Another legend suggests that the famous Fong Sai-Yuk was a master of Dishuquan and had passed his skills to monks in the Zhuyuansi Temple (nowadays known as Guanyuan Temple), this was passed through various generations until a monk named Hui Kai taught the style to Zheng Yishan. Taiping - History of Dishuquan (Dog Boxing) ==Chen Yijiu== During the early years of the Republic of China, Chen Ayin, a descendant of Chen Biao, fled to Singapore to escape imprisonment for accidental manslaughter when defending a friend against a village troublemaker. He was taken in by one of the Chinese immigrants, Chen Yijiu. Being ever grateful, Chen Ayin taught Chen Yijiu his art without reservation.

Long relievers often enter in the first three innings of a game when the starting pitcher cannot continue, whether due to ineffective pitching, lack of endurance, rain delays, injury, or ejection. The hope is that the long reliever will be able to get the game under control, and hopefully his team's offense will be able to help get the team back into the game. The hope is also that the long reliever will pitch long enough to save other relievers in the bullpen from having to pitch. Long relievers are usually players who used to be starters either in the major leagues or in the minors (and still can be a temporary starter if one of the normal starters is injured or otherwise unavailable), but whose teams believe they have better starters available. Sometimes a team's long reliever is a former starter who has lost his effectiveness, either through a decline in skills or a series of injuries. Occasionally, long relievers are inexperienced pitchers who may have the potential to become starters or setup pitchers after gaining major league experience. The quality of long relievers can vary, but when the long reliever is known to be an ineffective former starter, he is often called the \\"mop up man\\" or \\"mop.\\" A secondary use of a long reliever is in the late extra innings of a tied game, once the team's other, generally more effective, relievers have already been used. While a long reliever is often a team's least effective pitcher, he is still often a far better choice in an extended game than resorting to one of the team's starting pitchers (which can spread chaos throughout a pitching rotation, as everyone's future schedule gets adjusted), or even worse, resorting to a position player on the mound. A long man generally enters the game somewhere between the 11th and 16th innings in this role, and can be expected to pitch 5 or more innings, before a team will be forced to resort to other options. Occasionally during the season, a team may find itself with enough rest days to allow it to use a four-man rotation rather than the now standard five. In these situations, a team may choose to keep their \\"fifth\\" starter on the roster in the long reliever role. This happens particularly in the post-season, when the fifth starter is a better pitcher than the \\"regular\\" long-reliever, allowing the team to carry either an additional short reliever, or position player, in lieu of the regular long man. In recent years, teams began experimenting with an opener, a relief pitcher who starts a game but only pitches for at least the first inning. In this strategy, the opener usually pitches against the opponent's best batters at the start of a game in hopes of throwing them off guard, before giving way to a long reliever who would normally be a starter in this situation. ==References== Category:Baseball pitching Category:Baseball strategy ","title":"Long reliever"},{"id":"517001","text":"Otto Wilhelm Fischer (1 April 1915 ‚Äì 29 January 2004) was an Austrian film and theatre actor, a leading man of West German cinema during the Wirtschaftswunder era of the 1950s and 1960s. ==Life== He was born in Klosterneuburg near Vienna, where he obtained his Matura degree at the local gymnasium secondary school. Fischer began studying English and German philology and art history at the Vienna University, in 1936, however, he enlisted at the Max Reinhardt Seminar drama school. He had first engagements as an actor at the Vienna Theater in der Josefstadt, the Munich Kammerspiele, and the Vienna Volkstheater. In 1945 he reached the highpoint of his theatre career when he joined the ensemble of the Burgtheater. Fischer began filming in 1936, his performance in the 1942 propaganda movie Vienna 1910 earned him an entry on Goebbel's Gottbegnadeten list. He made his breakthrough after the war starring in A Heidelberg Romance and numerous other romance films, often with female co-stars Maria Schell and Ruth Leuwerik. While Fischer enjoyed a great career, unlike countrymen Oskar Werner, Curd J√ºrgens, Maria Schell and Romy Schneider, he never made it internationally. Worse, his American break ended before it began: he was signed to star with June Allyson in a remake of My Man Godfrey in 1956, but was fired after 16 days of shooting and replaced by David Niven when Fischer reportedly lost his memory during filming. Fischer directed and starred opposite Anouk Aim√©e in a 1956 film, Ich suche Dich, based on the play, Jupiter Laughs, by A. J. Cronin. In 1955, he directed and starred in Hanussen, a movie detailing the life of clairvoyant Erik Jan Hanussen. While the film is considered highly romanticized, it assisted historians and biographers in uncovering previously unknown facts. He also starred in the title role of tragic King Ludwig II of Bavaria in the classic German film, Ludwig II: Glanz und Ende eines K√∂nigs by Helmut K√§utner. In the early 1970s, he retired to live in Vernate, Ticino and to concentrate on linguistics and philosophy, on which he lectured and published a number of books. He died in Lugano, Switzerland of kidney failure. ==Selected filmography== * Court Theatre (1936) * Anton the Last (1939) * My Daughter Lives in Vienna (1940) * Vienna 1910 (1943) * ' (1947) * Don't Dream, Annette (1949) * A Tale of Five Cities (1951) * A Heidelberg Romance (1951) * A Thousand Red Roses Bloom (1952) * Until We Meet Again (1952) * Desires (1952) * Cuba Cabana (1952) * Dreaming Lips (1953) * As Long as You're Near Me (1953) * A Heart Plays False (1953) * Diary of a Married Woman (1953) * Portrait of an Unknown Woman (1954) * Ludwig II: Glanz und Ende eines K√∂nigs (1955) * Hanussen (1955) * Napoleon (1955) * Ich suche Dich (1956) * My Father, the Actor (1956) * Scandal in Bad Ischl (1957) * King in Shadow (1957) * ' (1957) * ' (1958) * Peter Voss, Thief of Millions (1958) * Arms and the Man (1958) * Whirlpool (1959) * And That on Monday Morning (1959) * Menschen im Hotel (1959) * Rebel Flight to Cuba (1959) * Peter Voss, Hero of the Day (1959) * Das Riesenrad (1961) * ' (1961) * Axel Munthe, The Doctor of San Michele (1962) * Breakfast in Bed (1963) * The Secret of the Black Widow (1963) * Uncle Tom's Cabin (1965) ==Honours and awards== * 1950, 1951: Danube females * 1953‚Äì1955: Bambi award * 1955: Filmband in Silver (best actor) for Ludwig II: Glanz und Ende eines K√∂nigs * 1956 ‚Äì San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival: Silver shell (Director, actor) for Ich suche Dich * 1956: Price of Spanish film journalists (screenplay) for Ich suche Dich * 1958‚Äì1961: Bambi award * 1958‚Äì1963: Bravo Otto * 1959: Filmband in Gold (best actor) for Arms and the Man (film) * 1960: Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class * 1961: Europa Prize for Das Riesenrad * 1961: Honorary Member of the Association of the Spanish film journalists * 1970: Appointed Professor * 1977: Filmband in Gold for long and outstanding achievements in German film * 1987, 1990: Bambi award * 1987: Cordon Bleu du Saint Esprit * 1995: Grand Silver Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria * 1996: Grand Gold Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria * Grand Merit Cross of the Federal Republic of Germany ==Publications== * [-?-]: Auferstehung in Hollywood.

It flows from the Angola highlands south to the border with Namibia. It then flows west along the border until it reaches the Atlantic Ocean. It is one of the few perennial rivers in the region. It is about long, with a drainage basin in area. Its mean annual discharge is 174 m3/s (6,145 cfs) at its mouth. The Epupa Falls lie on the river. Olushandja Dam dams a tributary of the river, the Etaka, and helps provide the Ruacana Power Station with water. == Dam controversies == The Namibian government proposed in the late 1990s to build the Epupa Dam, a controversial hydroelectric dam on the Cunene. In 2012 the Governments of Namibia and Angola announced plans to jointly build the Orokawe dam in the Baynes Mountains. According to the indigenous Himba who would have been most affected by the construction of the dam, the dam threatens the local ecosystem and therefore the economic basis of the Himba. During February 2012, traditional Himba chiefs issued a declaration to the African Union and to the United Nations Human Rights Council of the United Nations, titled \\"Declaration of the most affected Ovahimba, Ovatwa, Ovatjimba and Ovazemba against the Orokawe Dam in the Baynes Mountains,\\" which outlines the fierce objections against the dam from the traditional Himba chiefs and communities that reside near the Kunene River. In September 2012, the United Nations special rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples visited the Himba, and heard their concerns. On November 23, 2012, hundreds of Himba and Zemba from Omuhonga and Epupa region protested in Okanguati against Namibia's plans to construct a dam in the Kunene River in the Baynes Mountains, against increasing mining operations on their traditional land and human rights violations against them. On March 25, 2013, over a thousand Himba and Zemba people marched in Opuwo to protest again against Namibia's plans to build the Orokawe dam in the Baynes Mountains at the Cunene River without consulting with the indigenous peoples that do not consent to the construction plans. == Attraction == Tourists frequent campsites or lodges in Epupa which offer water sports on the river including rafting and canoeing.

These can be used to reveal further secret information such as secret keys and code books. The term \\"crib\\" originated at Bletchley Park, the British World War II decryption operation, where it was defined as: ==History== The usage \\"crib\\" was adapted from a slang term referring to cheating (e.g., \\"I cribbed my answer from your test paper\\"). A \\"crib\\" originally was a literal or interlinear translation of a foreign- language text‚Äîusually a Latin or Greek text‚Äîthat students might be assigned to translate from the original language. The idea behind a crib is that cryptologists were looking at incomprehensible ciphertext, but if they had a clue about some word or phrase that might be expected to be in the ciphertext, they would have a \\"wedge,\\" a test to break into it. If their otherwise random attacks on the cipher managed to sometimes produce those words or (preferably) phrases, they would know they might be on the right track. When those words or phrases appeared, they would feed the settings they had used to reveal them back into the whole encrypted message to good effect. In the case of Enigma, the German High Command was very meticulous about the overall security of the Enigma system and understood the possible problem of cribs. The day-to-day operators, on the other hand, were less careful. The Bletchley Park team would guess some of the plaintext based upon when the message was sent, and by recognizing routine operational messages. For instance, a daily weather report was transmitted by the Germans at the same time every day. Due to the regimented style of military reports, it would contain the word Wetter (German for \\"weather\\") at the same location in every message. (Knowing the local weather conditions helped Bletchley Park guess other parts of the plaintext as well.) Other operators, too, would send standard salutations or introductions. An officer stationed in the Qattara Depression consistently reported that he had nothing to report. \\"Heil Hitler,\\" occurring at the end of a message, is another well-known example. At Bletchley Park in World War II, strenuous efforts were made to use (and even force the Germans to produce) messages with known plaintext. For example, when cribs were lacking, Bletchley Park would sometimes ask the Royal Air Force to \\"seed\\" a particular area in the North Sea with mines (a process that came to be known as gardening, by obvious reference). The Enigma messages that were soon sent out would most likely contain the name of the area or the harbour threatened by the mines. The Germans themselves could be very accommodating in this regard. Whenever any of the turned German Double-Cross agents sent a message (written by the British) to their respective handlers, they frequently obligingly re-encrypted the message word for word on Enigma for onward transmission to Berlin. When a captured German revealed under interrogation that Enigma operators had been instructed to encode numbers by spelling them out, Alan Turing reviewed decrypted messages and determined that the number \\"eins\\" (\\"one\\") was the most common string in the plaintext (Benford's law). He automated the crib process, creating the Eins Catalogue, which assumed that \\"eins\\" was encoded at all positions in the plaintext. The catalogue included every possible position of the various rotors, starting positions, and keysettings of the Enigma. The Polish Cipher Bureau had likewise exploited \\"cribs\\" in the \\"ANX method\\" before World War II (the Germans' use of \\"AN\\", German for \\"to\\", followed by \\"X\\" as a spacer to form the text \\"ANX\\").Marian Rejewski, \\"Summary of Our Methods for Reconstructing ENIGMA and Reconstructing Daily Keys, and of German Efforts to Frustrate Those Methods,\\" Appendix C to W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, pp. 243‚Äì44. The United States and Britain used one-time tape systems, such as the 5-UCO, for their most sensitive traffic. These devices were immune to known- plaintext attack; however, they were point-to-point links and required massive supplies of one time tapes. Networked cipher machines were considered vulnerable to cribs, and various techniques were used to disguise the beginning and ends of a message, including cutting messages in half and sending the second part first and adding nonsense padding at both ends. The latter practice resulted in the world wonders incident. The KL-7, introduced in the mid-1950s, was the first U.S. cipher machine that was considered safe against known-plaintext attack.A History of U.S. Communications Security; the David G. Boak Lectures, National Security Agency (NSA), Volumes I, 1973, partially released 2008, additional portions declassified October 14, 2015, Quote: The KL-7 \\"was our first machine designed to serve very large nets which could stand matched plain and cipher text. For the first time, the man in the cryptocenter could take a message and simply type it into the machine as written, without changing the spacing between words, or cutting the message in half and sending the last part first. and without having to paraphrase the message text before it was released.\\" Classical ciphers are typically vulnerable to known-plaintext attack. For example, a Caesar cipher can be solved using a single letter of corresponding plaintext and ciphertext to decrypt entirely. A general monoalphabetic substitution cipher needs several character pairs and some guessing if there are fewer than 26 distinct pairs. ==See also== *Cadix *Cryptanalysis of the Enigma *Kiss (cryptanalysis) *PC Bruno *Polish Cipher Bureau *Ultra ==Notes== ==References== *W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma: How the German Machine Cipher Was Broken, and How It Was Read by the Allies in World War Two, edited and translated by Christopher Kasparek, Frederick, MD, University Publications of America, 1984, . *Marian Rejewski, \\"Summary of Our Methods for Reconstructing ENIGMA and Reconstructing Daily Keys, and of German Efforts to Frustrate Those Methods,\\" Appendix C to W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, pp. 241‚Äì45. * * * Category:Cryptographic attacks Category:Enigma machine ","title":"Known-plaintext attack"},{"id":"517025","text":"Mary-Ellis Bunim (July 9, 1946 ‚Äì January 29, 2004) was an American television producer and co-creator of MTV's The Real World and Road Rules. ==Biography== A native of Massachusetts, Bunim began her career in daytime dramas.

He was also the mayor of the municipality of Saint-Beno√Æt from 1906 to 1923. ==Elections as party leader== Quebec: He lost the 1919 election, 1923 election, and 1927 election. ==See also== *Politics of Quebec *List of Quebec general elections *List of Quebec leaders of the Opposition *Timeline of Quebec history ==References== * * Category:1874 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Canadian senators from Quebec Category:Mayors of places in Quebec Category:Members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Quebec Category:Conservative Party of Canada (1867‚Äì1942) MPs Category:Conservative Party of Canada (1867‚Äì1942) senators Category:Conservative Party of Quebec MNAs Category:People from Mirabel, Quebec Category:Postmasters General of Canada Category:Quebec political party leaders ","title":"Arthur Sauv√©"},{"id":"517038","text":"Stony Brook Southampton is a campus location of Stony Brook University, located in Southampton, New York between the Shinnecock Indian Reservation and Shinnecock Hills Golf Club on the eastern end of Long Island. ==HistorySouthampton College, Long Island University=== Southampton College in May 2006 Southampton College was founded in 1963 by Long Island University. It had its own station on the Long Island Rail Road until 1998 when the station was dismantled because it was lightly used. From 1993, Robert F.X. Sillerman served as the Chancellor, replacing Angier Biddle Duke, ambassador to Spain under Lyndon Johnson. Sillerman took the job on two conditions: that the college scrap ill-defined liberal-arts programs and focus on marine science and creative writing, and that he lead publicity. He named Kermit the Frog as the 1996 commencement speaker: 31 newspapers picked up the story, a free marketing bonanza that raised the college's profile and drew hundreds of new admissions. The refocusing on the marine science curriculum garnered the campus several accolades, including being named in 1998 as the Cousteau Society's sole North American Affiliate. In the course of the campus's tenure under Long Island University, it produced 34 Fulbright scholars, most of which hailed from the Marine Science program. After many years of fiscal mismanagement, the University announced a multimillion-dollar capital campaign, launched a new interdisciplinary CORE curriculum and the construction of a new library (almost completed) to re-vamp the campus. After one year of a 10-year plan however, Long Island University officials ceased all plans and Long Island University decided to effectively close the campus. This forced most students to either move to University's Nassau County location, C.W. Post Campus or transfer elsewhere. Although protests and advocacy including a rally by the non-profit Save The College at Southampton and the student-led organization The Orphans of L.I.U. (Long Island University) made numerous headlines with their actions, Undergraduate Programs ceased and all but a few campus buildings were shuttered by the end of Summer 2005. When Long Island University announced its plans to close the campus, in 2005 the Shinnecock Indian Nation filed a suit seeking return of including both the campus and the golf club. There were local concerns that either the land would be taken over by the Shinnecocks for a casino, or that the land would be used for a housing development in the Hamptons. The undergraduate Marine Biology department was moved to the control of Stony Brook University in summer 2005, and from the fall 2005 SUNY began offering an undergraduate marine sciences program, with teaching and research facilities at the campus leased from LIU. ===Stony Brook Southampton=== Chancellors Hall at Stony Brook Southampton On March 24, 2006 the State University of New York (SUNY) announced a final agreement for the purchase of the Southampton College property from Long Island University (LIU). SUNY paid US $35 million for the campus and its waterfront facility for its famed Marine Biology department, as well as the NPR affiliated WLIU FM 88.3 radio station. In the agreement to take over WLIU is to continue its LIU affiliation and move from its broadcasting studios in Chancellors Hall by April 2010 to another location on Hill Street in Southampton. The station has an agreement to have its broadcast tower on the campus through 2024. Under the new ownership of Stony Brook University starting with a class of 200 in August 2007, the campus featured an innovative curriculum devoted to issues of sustainability and the environment. Southampton‚Äôs interdisciplinary academic programs focused on issues of ecological sustainability, with undergraduate majors in Environmental Studies, Marine Sciences, Marine Vertebrate Biology, Ecosystems and Human Impact, Environmental Design, Policy and Planning and Sustainability Studies. A minor in Business Management with a focus on environmental sustainability was also offered through Stony Brook University's College of Business, and a five-year Fast Track BA/BS-MBA program is also offered in partnership with the College of Business. 800 students were registered for the fall 2010 semester. However, in April 2010, Stony Brook University President Samuel Stanley announced his decision to shut down the branch, due to major state budget cuts and the need for better targeting of funds. The academic programs and students were relocated to the main campus. The undergraduate population staged letter campaigns to raise community awareness and protest the decision. Stanley came to the Southampton campus shortly after the decision to meet with the student body. Six undergraduate students and a non-profit community group filed a lawsuit in NY State Supreme Court to block the closure of the college. The lawsuit was filed against Stony Brook and Stanley, claiming the decision to close the campus was procedurally illegal. On August 30, 2010, the court ruled that the university violated regulations and improperly closed the campus. The students won the lawsuit, but unable to contest financially due to the costs associated with instigating further litigation, agreed to a small settlement. They were permitted to complete their studies on-campus, but not live there. Stanley visited each student's home to personally apologize. As of 2015, the Stony Brook Southampton campus has grown and even prospered. Programs have been added back and the Board of Trustees of the State University of New York approved a long-awaited partnership agreement between Southampton and Stony Brook University hospitals that will ultimately result in a new Southampton Hospital on the Shinnecock Hills campus, a move that likely will bring the most activity those grounds have ever seen. ==Arts Program== The Stony Brook Southampton Campus is currently home to the Graduate Arts Program which offers three graduate programs, undergraduate and graduate marine sciences, health technology and management programs. All of the programs at Southampton Arts are defined broadly, to foster exploration of artistic expression in fields outside traditional program borders, and to promote collaboration between disciplines in the creation of original work. Interdisciplinary study, small class size, and one-on-one advising form the foundation of the Southampton Arts experience, where close student-faculty relationships are a priority. Students are offered practice in teaching, publishing or arts administration to further their real-world knowledge in the industry, and also gain admission to the Southampton Summer Arts Conferences. There are approximately 310 students currently enrolled. Faculty includes Julie Sheehan (Creative Writing MFA Director), Christine Vachon (Film MFA Director), Robert Reeves (author), Roger Rosenblatt, Lou Ann Walker (author), Melissa Bank, Star Black (poet), Annette Handley Chandler, Billy Collins, Jules Feiffer, Neal Gabler, Emma Walton Hamilton, Ursula Hegi, Matthew Klam, Daniel Menaker, Susan Merrell (author), Marsha Norman ===Manhattan Track=== Students accepted into the program may earn an MFA degree by combining coursework at the Manhattan facility during fall and spring terms, and at the Southampton campus during summer by participating in the prestigious Southampton Writers Conferences and International Theatre Workshops. The Manhattan Track is for talented writers seeking advanced training in fiction, poetry, creative nonfiction, essay, memoir, directing, playwriting, screenwriting, and acting. ===Southampton Writing Conference=== Stony Brook Southampton also hosts the prestigious Summer Writing Conferences, which attracts renowned authors from around the world to teach and participate in Creative Writing Workshops, which take place in two sessions throughout July. Remaining hours are devoted to lectures, readings, performances workshops and panel discussions featuring faculty members and distinguished visiting authors, editors, publishers, and agents. Participants also enjoy a myriad of formal and informal social gatherings‚Äî author receptions, an open-mic night, breakfasts, lunches and dinners under the tents, and an issue launch of The Southampton Review. ===Semester by the Sea: Southampton Arts=== Students at Stony Brook have the option to enroll in a 10-week intensive at the Southampton campus for 15 credits. The Semester by the Sea program is arranged around the objective to complete a creative project. The 15-credit load entails five courses, including two writing workshops, two literature courses, and a final project in filmmaking, theater, fiction or poetry. Workshops are limited to groups of 12. During final project, students get individualized attention, with a mentor/advisor to guide them. ==Young Artists and Writers Project== The Young Artists and Writers Project (or YAWP, formerly the Young American Writers Project) created by Stony Brook Southampton's MFA in Creative Writing and Literature Program, is dedicated to mentoring middle and high school students in the development of creative expression and critical thinking through writing. The YAWP curriculum sends professional writers and writing teachers into Long Island schools with a variety of innovative, inter-disciplinary writing workshops, including Playwriting, Screenwriting, Poetry, Personal Essay, Fiction, and Visual Arts. YAWP Programs are offered throughout the school year, and can be custom designed to fit the needs of an individual school. They can be offered in \\"push-in\\" format, as enrichment to Creative Writing, English, Theatre or other academic classes, as extra-curricular programs or in retreat format. YAWP programs can be particularly effective for at-risk students, or for those who find writing and communications skills challenging in the traditional academic environment. ==School of Marine and Atmospheric Science== The SUNY School of Marine and Atmospheric Science also operates on the Southampton campus. The primary focus of the SoMAS faculty and students is on fundamental research designed to increase understanding of the processes that characterize the coastal ocean and the atmosphere. The School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences is also committed researching solutions to problems that result from society's interactions with the environment. The Southampton location allows access to a variety environments for research ranging from the open ocean to the waters of the largest metropolitan area in the United States, as well as the resources at the nearby National Weather Service, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. ==References== ==Further reading== *John A.

A member of the Democratic Party of Hawaii, Long was appointed to the office after the term of Ingram Stainback. After statehood was achieved he served in the United States Senate, one of the first two, along with Hiram Fong, to represent Hawaii in that body. Long was the only non-Asian American U.S. Senator from Hawaii until the appointment of Brian Schatz to the position in 2012. ==Life and career== Long was born in Altoona, Kansas and attended Johnson Bible College in Knoxville, Tennessee, the University of Michigan, and Columbia University in New York City. He first came to Hawaii in 1917 as a social worker in Hilo. He then held various educational positions in the public school system, eventually serving as a superintendent from 1933 to 1946. He was appointed Governor of the Territory of Hawaii by President of the United States Harry Truman in 1951 and served until 1953. Long served in the Hawaii Territorial Senate from 1956-1959. On July 28, 1959 he was elected to one of the two Senate seats from the newly formed State of Hawaii, and took office on August 21, 1959. The other Senator elected was Republican Hiram Fong. Long chose not to run for a full six-year term in 1962, and was succeeded by fellow Democrat and then-Rep. Daniel Inouye, in January 1963. For his entire tenure Long was Hawaii's Senior Senator, as he took office the same day with fellow Senator from new state, Hiram Fong (with Long having a seniority edge due to being former Governor) Long appeared as a contestant on What's My Line? shortly after taking office.

As a chemist, his work provided much of the foundation for the business of Union Carbide Corporation. The Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation was formed in 1917 from the merger of the former Union Carbide founded in 1898 by Morehead's father; and the National Carbon Company founded in 1886.. He was a noted philanthropist who made major gifts to his alma mater, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He also served as mayor of Rye, New York and United States Ambassador to Sweden. Morehead came from an illustrious North Carolina family: his father was James Turner Morehead; his grandfather, John Motley Morehead, served as Governor of North Carolina. His sister, Lily Morehead Mebane, was decorated by the governments of France and Serbia for her relief work after World War I; she later served two terms in the North Carolina state legislature.A photograph of Lily Morehead Mebane in her relief worker uniform, c. 1921, in Rockingham County Legacy: A Digital History Project. Morehead graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill in 1891 and was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. One of his notable early scientific discoveries was the development of an economical process for the manufacture of calcium carbide. He was also an authority on the analysis of gases, having invented a device for the purpose and written a book on the subject. Morehead married Genevieve Margaret Birkhoff. A few years after her death, he married Leila Duckworth Houghton. He had no children. He devoted his considerable fortune to philanthropy, especially to the benefit of UNC-Chapel Hill. With a college classmate and fraternity brother, Rufus Lenoir Patterson, he donated the Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower on the campus. He also gave the University the Morehead Planetarium, later renamed the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center. One of Morehead's particular interests was in providing financial assistance to students attending UNC Chapel Hill. To that end he endowed the John Motley Morehead Foundation, which each year awards undergraduate scholarships covering the full cost of attendance at UNC Chapel Hill to applicants chosen through an extensive and competitive screening process. The Morehead-Cain Scholarship is the oldest merit-based scholarship in the United States. During the First World War, Morehead served as a major in the United States Army; he later became a colonel in the United States Army Reserve. From 1925 to 1930, Morehead served as the Mayor of Rye, New York, and also gave money for the establishment of a new city hall; his nomination as minister to Sweden, from which he served from 1930 to 1933, came during his mayoralty. He was awarded the North Carolina Award, the highest civilian award bestowed by the U.S. state of North Carolina in the category of Public Service in 1964. Direct descendants through the paternal line of James Turner Morehead include W. Harris Nelson and William H.M. Nelson III.. Non-lineal descendants include Jean Motley Morehead Larkin and John L. Morehead. There is a section of Interstate 40 named after him, called the John Motley Morehead III Freeway, that passes through Chapel Hill, North Carolina and most of the eastern end of Orange County. ==References== == External links == * John Motley Morehead : 200th birthday celebration, 1796-1996 / Robert Lindsay Morehead, Anne Fulcher Nelson, Charles E.

GreenDirectory of the One Hundred and Fifteenth Congress (born September 1, 1947) is an American lawyer and politician. Green has served in Congress as the Representative for Texas's 9th congressional district since 2005. The 9th district includes most of southwestern Houston, part of Fort Bend County and most of Missouri City. Green is a member of the Democratic Party. ==Early life and early career== Green was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He attended Florida A&M; University and Tuskegee University. He received a Juris Doctor degree in 1974 from Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University. He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. After law school, Green co-founded the law firm of Green, Wilson, Dewberry, and Fitch. He remained in Houston and lives in the community of Alief. In 1978, Green was elected justice of the peace in Harris County, Texas. He held this position for 26 years before retiring in 2004. Green ran for mayor of Houston in 1981, and finished fifth in the Democratic primary. == U.S. House of Representatives  Elections === In 2004, Green entered the Democratic primary for the 9th congressional district. The 9th district had previously been the 25th congressional district and was represented by Democrat Chris Bell. A 2003 Texas redistricting placed Bell's seat in jeopardy. Although the redistricted 25th district remained heavily Democratic, it had a significantly larger percentage of blacks and Latinos than the old 25th district, which had been 65% white. The new 9th was 17% white, 37% black and 33% Latino. The redistricting left Bell, who is white, vulnerable to a primary challenge from a black or Latino Democrat. Green won the March 9 primary with 66% of the vote to Bell's 31%. He then defeated Republican nominee Annette Molina in the general election. Green was reelected unopposed in 2006 and faced only a Libertarian opponent in 2008. The 9th district is heavily Democratic, with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+29. It is Houston's most Democratic district. Hillary Clinton carried the 9th district in 2016 with 79.3% of the vote, her strongest showing in Texas. === Tenure === In Congress, Green has focused on the same issues he worked on at the Houston NAACP: fair housing and fair hiring practices for the poor and minorities. After the 2012 election, Green held a press conference in Houston at which he emphasized the need for the lame duck Congress to work together to reform the national budget. He also announced a plan for infrastructure investments across the country intended to create jobs and unify the country and improve the economy. Green has supported the Federal Reserve's program of quantitative easing and claims it has led to economic recovery since the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. Congressman Al Green's Floor Speech on the Impeachment of President Trump On May 17, 2017, Green presented articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, citing Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey. Immediately after his speech, he shelved the document without calling for a vote, but continued to call for impeachment. He reintroduced articles of impeachment on July 16, 2019, citing Trump's attacks on four Democratic congresswomen of color. As a privileged resolution, the House was required to vote on it.Al Green impeachment resolution text On July 17 the House voted to table the resolution, effectively killing it.

Green is pro-choice, and consistently votes against restrictions on abortion. On October 13, 2011, he voted against an amendment to the Affordable Care Act, which prevented insurance programs created by the Act from covering abortions. He has voted against eight other bills proposed in the House that would if enacted prevent the federal government from covering the cost of abortions. He has received a 100% ratings from Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America, while receiving a 0% rating from the National Right to Life Committee. Green also supports gun control. He spoke out after the Trayvon Martin shooting, asking members of the African-American community to show faith in the justice system and let the courts do their job and convict George Zimmerman. The National Rifle Association gave him a rating of 0%, Gun Owners of America rated him 25%, while the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence gave him a Lifetime Score of 83%. On budget issues, Green follows his party's views. He supported every budget bill proposed during President Obama's term. During President Bush's term, Green voted against all budget bills that cut government spending and cut taxes. He also voted for Obama's bailout of the Auto Industry in 2009. On December 10, 2008, he wrote a statement supporting the auto bailout, saying, \\"The auto bailout is really about bailing out people, and the people of this country... I think that [how tax dollars are spent] is a legitimate concern for the American people, but I do think, with the proper strings attached, we can bail out the people...who may lose their jobs.\\" Green is a member of the Congressional Pakistan Caucus. He is a strong supporter of holding Pakistan as an ally in South Asia. After the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on December 27, 2007, which initially destabilized the country as riots erupted, Green issued a statement condemning the assassination as a \\"dastardly effort to circumvent the democratic process.\\" He announced his support of the US's continued alliance with Pakistan, and urged Pakistanis to continue their push towards true democracy, \\"knowing that freedom, justice, and democracy are difficult to achieve.\\" On December 6, 2017, Green denounced Trump for \\"casting contempt on transgender individuals, inciting hate and hostility, and sowing discord among the people of the United States on the basis of gender.\\"https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hres646/BILLS-115hres646lth.pdf Green is a member of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus. ==Sexual misconduct allegations== In 2008, former staffer Lucinda Daniels accused Green of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace, including claims that Green discriminated against Daniels after she refused to continue to have sex with him. Daniels filed a lawsuit against Green and then withdrew it. Green filed a counter-lawsuit, alleging Daniels had threatened to sue Green for workplace discrimination if Green did not pay her money. Green subsequently withdrew his suit. The Hill reported that a spokesman for Green said the two had had a \\"romantic encounter\\" in 2007, but that the allegations of sexual harassment were untrue. In 2017, ten years after the allegations were made and withdrawn, Green released a joint statement with Daniels detailing their relationship at a time when several other congressmen were facing accusations of sexual misconduct. == Financial Services Committee 2019 == During the House Financial Services Committee hearing on April 10, 2019, at which the CEOs of all the major banks and investment institutions of the United States where sworn to testify, Green presented several questions that were regarded as controversial. He began by asking why all the executives were white men, then asked whether they hypothetically saw themselves succeeded in the future by men of color or women, repeatedly asking them to raise and lower their hands. Green then asked J. P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon whether the institution he chaired had profited from slavery, to which Dimon responded that that had taken place more than two centuries ago. The lack of connection between Green's inquiries and the topic of the hearing, the effects of the post-financial crisis on the major American banks, was interpreted as digression. ==See also== *List of African-American United States Representatives ==References== ==External links== *Congressman Al Green official U.S. House website *Al Green for Congress * * - Category:1947 births Category:21st-century American politicians Category:African-American lawyers Category:African-American members of the United States House of Representatives Category:African-American people in Texas politics Category:American justices of the peace Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Baptists from Texas Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:Living people Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Texas Category:People from Houston Category:Texas Democrats Category:Texas lawyers Category:Texas Southern University alumni Category:Thurgood Marshall School of Law alumni Category:Tuskegee University alumni Category:American gun control activists ","title":"Al Green (politician)"},{"id":"517070","text":"The 1886 Quebec general election on October 14, 1886 to elect members of the 6th Legislative Assembly for the Province of Quebec, Canada.

Ratcliff and Paul Grace, developed and published in 1989 for MS-DOS and in 1990 for Amiga by Electronic Arts. A Sega Genesis version was also released in 1991 by Sega and was developed by MicroProse. 688 Attack Sub, Sega Genesis versionThe player takes command of a US or Soviet nuclear-powered attack submarine and plays ten missions ranging from into either Cold War scenarios or combat missions in a hypothetical global conflict. As modeled in the game, the American submarine has more sophisticated electronics and more weapons. The Soviet boat has fewer weapons but higher sustained speeds. This was one of the earliest games that allowed two players to play against each other over a modem (or null modem cable), and one of the first to use more than 32 colors in MCGA mode. Ratcliff and Grace later developed SSN-21 Seawolf, published in 1994. ==Reception== Computer Gaming World in 1989 gave the DOS version a positive review, noting the game was designed to be a fun game, as opposed to a realistic simulator, and concluding that it was \\"this reviewer's personal candidate for 'Game of the Year'\\". 1992 and 1994 surveys in the magazine of wargames with modern settings gave the game two stars out of five, stating that the game was closer to World War II than modern submarine operations, and criticizing the \\"unrealistic\\" emphasis on periscope target acquisition. Compute! named the game to its list of \\"nine great games for 1989\\", describing it as \\"swift and exciting as any Mach 2 flight simulator\\". The magazine praised the game's graphics and two-player modem option, but criticized the lack of more than ten missions. ==References== == External links == * *688 Attack Sub Review at Mean Machines *History of Subsims *Review in Games International Category:1989 video games Category:DOS games Category:Amiga games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:NEC PC-9801 games Category:Submarine simulation video games Category:Cold War video games Category:Naval video games Category:Video games scored by Rob Hubbard Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"688 Attack Sub"},{"id":"517080","text":"The 1878 Quebec general election was held on May 1, 1878 to elect members of the 4th Legislative Assembly for the Province of Quebec, Canada. The result was a hung parliament, with no party having a clear majority. Only one seat divided the two major parties, the Quebec Conservative Party and the Quebec Liberal Party. The balance of power was held by two Independent Conservatives. The incumbent premier, Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbini√®re, was able to form a minority government with the support of the Independent Conservatives, even though the Conservative Party had one seat more than the Liberals. == Political events == The election was called in unusual circumstances. On March 8, 1878, the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, Luc Letellier de Saint-Just, dismissed the Conservative premier, Charles Boucher de Boucherville, in a dispute over proposed railway legislation.Dictionary of Canadian Biography: \\"Boucher de Boucherville, Sir Charles\\". The Lieutenant Governor then appointed Joly de Lotbini√®re, the leader of the Liberals, as premier. Since the Conservatives still maintained a substantial majority in the Legislative Assembly, on March 22, 1878 Joly de Lotbini√®re requested the dissolution of the Assembly and a general election, which Letellier de Saint-Just ordered. The election was fought in part over economic issues and in part over the actions of the Lieutenant Governor, who was criticised by the Conservatives for having installed Joly de Lotbini√®re by a coup d'√©tat. One of the leading Conservatives, Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau, opened his campaign with the slogan: \\"Silence the voice of Spencer Wood [the residence of the Lieutenant Governor] and let the mighty voice of the people speak.\\"Canadian Dictionary of Biography: \\"Letellier de Saint-Just, Luc\\". Joly de Lotbini√®re agreed that the people should decide, and campaigned on the slogan ‚ÄúThe province must choose between direct taxation and economy.‚ÄùCanadian Dictionary of Biography: \\"Joly de Lotbini√®re, Sir Henri-Gustave\\". Following the election results, Joly de Lotbini√®re was able to stay in office for one year as the leader of a minority government supported by the Independent Conservatives, even though the Conservative Party had one more seat than the Liberals. In 1879, he was defeated in the Assembly by the Conservatives, who formed a minority government. == Electoral map == The Legislative Assembly was composed of sixty-five single-member constituencies or \\"ridings\\". The 1878 election was conducted under the pre-Confederation electoral map of the former Province of Canada. That map had set the boundaries for the sixty-five constituencies of Canada East, which became Quebec. The British North America Act, 1867 provided that the pre-Confederation electoral map would continue to be used for Quebec elections until altered by the Legislature of Quebec.Constitution Act, 1867, s. 80. The map of the sixty-five constituencies was also to be used in federal elections, until altered by Parliament.Constitution Act, 1867, s. 40. == Conduct of the election  Secret ballot === The election was conducted under The Quebec Election Act, a provincial statute.The Quebec Election Act, SQ 1875, c. 7. It was the second election where the secret ballot was used in Quebec.The Quebec Election Act, ss. 181-185, 187. === Preparation of voter lists === The Act required that each municipality prepare a voter list in March of each year, based on the valuation of property and ownership used for the tax rolls. The list was drawn up the secretary-treasurer of each municipality.The Quebec Election Act, s. 12. The municipal council then reviewed the list and could make corrections to it. Once approved by the municipal council, the list was in force until the preparation of the list in the next year.The Quebec Election Act, ss. 27 to 36. Any person who was dissatisfied by their inclusion or exclusion from the list could appeal to the local judge of the superior court or district magistrate, whose decision on the issue was final.The Quebec Election Act, ss. 41-48. === Procedure for the election === The election began with a proclamation issued by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, setting the date for nomination of candidates. The date was the same for all constituencies.The Quebec Election Act, s. 65. The provincial Clerk of the Crown in Chancery then issued sixty-five writs, directed to the Returning Officer for each constituency, directing them to conduct the election.The Quebec Election Act, s. 76, Form C. The Returning Officer would be the registrar or sheriff of the constituency.The Quebec Election Act, s. 78. On the date set for nominations, the Returning Officer would hold a public meeting to receive nominations. The meeting was conducted at the most central and convenient location in the constituency, in a court house, city hall or registry office, between noon and one o'clock.The Quebec Election Act, ss. 96 to 98. To be nominated, a candidate had to file a nomination paper with the Returning Officer, signed by at least twenty-five supporters eligible to vote in the constituency, and accompanied with a deposit of $200. The nomination paper and deposit had to be filed on or before the nomination meeting.The Quebec Election Act, ss. 104 to 109. If only one nomination was received, the Returning Officer would declare that person to be elected, and immediately report the result to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery with the return of the writ.The Quebec Election Act, ss. 117 to 119. If two or more candidates were nominated, voting would occur one week after the nomination date set in the writ.The Quebec Election Act, s. 73. The Returning Officer would establish polling stations throughout the constituency.The Quebec Election Act, s. 89. On polling day, the polls would open in each station and voters would cast their ballots in the locked ballot box.The Quebec Election Act, ss. 157 to 171. When the polls closed, the deputy returning officers would unlock the ballot box, count the ballots in the presence of the candidates or their agents, and prepare a record of the vote. The deputy returning officer would then place all of the records and ballots in the ballot box, lock it, and deliver the ballot box to the Returning Officer.The Quebec Election Act, ss. 189 to 195. Once all the ballot boxes were received, the Returning Officer would open all the ballot boxes in the presence of witnesses and total the votes from each polling station.The Quebec Election Act, s. 200. The Returning Officer would declare the candidate with the most votes elected.The Quebec Election Act, s. 204. If there was a tie between the top two candidates, the Returning Officer was required to give a written casting vote immediately to decide the election. In no other circumstances could the Returning Officer vote.The Quebec Election Act, s. 205. The Returning Officer would then prepare a complete report of the results of the election, along with his return of the writ, and forward it all to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery.The Quebec Election Act, s. 206. ==Results== The election resulted in a hung parliament: neither of the parties had a majority. Two Independent Conservatives were elected, who held the balance of power. { class = \\"\\" + 1878 Election Results ! rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Party ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Party leader ! colspan=\\"3\\"Seats ! colspan=\\"3\\"Popular vote -  align=\\"center\\"1875 !

The Quebec Conservative Party, led by Charles-Eug√®ne Boucher de Boucherville, defeated the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbini√®re. The election was the first one held under the new Quebec Elections Act, passed by the de Boucherville government to replace the pre-Confederation elections law. The new law provided for the secret ballot in Quebec elections for the first time. Under the pre-Confederation elections law, each voter had been required to publicly declare their vote to the elections officials, a form of open ballotting. == Franchise and qualification  Right to vote === The right to vote in elections to the Legislative Assembly was not universal. Only male British subjects (by birth or naturalisation), aged 21 or older, were eligible to vote, and only if they met a property qualification.The Quebec Elections Act, SQ 1875, c. 7, s. 8. For residents of larger cities, the qualification was being the owner or occupant of real property assessed at three hundred dollars or more, or for tenants, an annual rent of thirty dollars or more. For any other municipality, the qualification was being an owner or occupant of real property assessed at two hundred dollars or more, or twenty dollars in annual value. For tenants in smaller centers, the qualification was paying an annual rent of twenty dollars or more. Women were completely barred from voting. Judges and many municipal and provincial officials were also barred from voting, particularly officials with law enforcement duties, or duties relating to public revenue.The Quebec Election Act, s. 11. The Returning Officer in each riding was also barred from voting, except when needed to give a casting vote in the event of a tie vote.The Quebec Election Act, s. 205. === Qualification for the Legislative Assembly === Candidates for election to the Legislative Assembly had to meet stricter qualifications than voters. To stand for election, a candidate had to # Be at least twenty-one years of age; # Be of the male sex; # Be a subject of Her Majesty (either by birth or naturalisation); # Be free from all legal incapacity; # Be the proprietor in possession of lands or tenements worth at least $2,000, over and above all encumbrances and charges on the property.The Quebec Election Act, s. 124.

The electoral process of the Province of Canada in turn had been based on the traditional British electoral process, without a secret ballot. Instead, elections were public affairs, with each voter publicly stating the name of the candidate they voted for. The election process began with writs of election issued by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, one for each constituency (also called a \\"riding\\").

He twice served as the eighth Premier of Quebec. ==Political career== Taillon's first term of office was just four days, from January 25 to January 29, 1887. This term came at the end of the Conservative government of his predecessor John Jones Ross. Ross had lost the 1886 Quebec election, but had tried to cling to power in a minority government for a few more months. Taillon was Leader of the Opposition from 1887 until 1890, when he lost the 1890 election and his own seat. He briefly returned to the practice of law, but following the removal of Liberal Honor√© Mercier from office by the Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec, Taillon became minister without portfolio in the government of Charles-Eug√®ne Boucher de Boucherville. Taillon became premier when Boucher de Boucherville resigned. Taillon lost the 1890 election but continued as leader of the party. He resigned in 1896 and moved into federal politics to serve as Postmaster-General in the very short-lived federal Conservative government of Charles Tupper, from May to July 1896. He failed to gain a federal seat in the 1896 federal election, and likewise failed to secure a seat in the 1900 federal election, ending his political career. In 1916, he was made a Knight Bachelor. ==Personal life== Taillon was born in Terrebonne, Lower Canada (now Quebec). He was the son of Aim√© Taillon, a farmer, and Josephte Daunais. Taillon married Georgiana Archambault in 1875. Archambault and their child died shortly after the child's birth in January 1876.

His father's family was one of the traditional Huguenot families from Switzerland and his mother's family was Roman Catholic. Initially a Huguenot himself, Henri-Gustave converted to Anglicanism before he married in 1856. His father, Gaspard-Pierre-Gustave Joly de Lotbini√®re, was a pioneer of early photography (the first man to photograph the Acropolis, in 1839) who made a series of daguerreotypes while on a Grand Tour through Greece, Egypt and the Holy Land. Henri-Gustave's mother was Julie-Christine, the youngest daughter of Michel- Eustache-Gaspard-Alain Chartier de Lotbini√®re, who inherited the seigneury of Lotbini√®re, in 1828. His parents' marriage was not a happy one, which is perhaps not surprising as his father had first proposed to Julie-Christine's eldest sister, Louise-Josephe, the Seigneuresse de Vaudreuil, who instead chose to marry Robert Unwin Harwood. Henri-Gustave Joly studied in Paris and inherited the title of seigneur of Lotbini√®re in 1860.Little, 2013 He married Margaretta-Josepha Gowen, daughter of Hammond Gowen of Quebec, and was the father of eleven children. Their daughter married Brigadier-General Herbert Colborne Nanton (1863-1935), brother of Augustus Meredith Nanton. He was the grandfather of Seymour de Lotbiniere. === Provincial political career === Joly was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for Lotbini√®re in 1861 as a Bleu, a moderate liberal, but was a member of the more radical Parti rouge when re-elected in 1863. Henri-Gustave Joly became Leader of the Quebec Liberals at the time of Confederation in 1867, and was the member for the federal riding of Lotbini√®re. He was re-elected in Lotbini√®re in the Canadian Election of 1872. In 1878, Conservative premier Charles-Eug√®ne Boucher de Boucherville resigned on March 2 since he was about to be deposed by Lieutenant Governor Luc Letellier de Saint-Just. They had a conflict over railroad legislation which de Saint-Just deemed unconstitutional. As a result, Joly became Premier on March 8, 1878, and the first Liberal to become Premier of Quebec. To this day, he remains the only foreign-born and Protestant to be the Leader of the Province of Quebec. In the May 1, 1878 election, the Liberals won one fewer seat than the Conservatives (there were also two independent Conservatives). However, Joly remained in power in a minority government for about a year and half. His government was brought down by a motion of censure involving the defection of five Liberals (including future premier Edmund James Flynn) to the Conservatives. The Leader of the Opposition Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau was called to form a government on October 31, 1879.Little, 2013 Joly remained Liberal Party leader until 1883. In all, he spent about 17 years as Liberal leader, but served only briefly as Premier. In 1883, Joly resigned as Liberal leader to make way for Honor√© Mercier. He resigned as member of the Legislative Assembly in November 1885. He added \\"de Lotbini√®re\\" (part of his mother's maiden name) to his name in 1888. === Careers in federal politics and in forestry === Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbini√®re, c.

He served as a federal Cabinet minister from until he retired in .Little, 2013 In Sir Henri was invited along with J. R. Booth, William Little, Thomas Southworth and Dr. William Saunders by Elihu Stewart, Canada's chief inspector of timber and forestry, to create the Canadian Forestry Association. On , these men met in the Railway Committee Room of the House of Commons in Ottawa, playing host to lumbermen, foresters, civil servants, railroad executives and others, all concerned about the survival and future use of Canada's forests. The CFA was truly a national organization, with representation from every province and the districts of Assiniboia, Athabaska, Keewatin and Yukon. Under the chairmanship of Sir Henri, delegates approved bylaws and a constitution of the Canadian Forestry Association, Canada's oldest conservation organization. These early conservationists recognized that the whole field of renewable resources, the forests, waters, wildlife, soils and recreational values, were closely interrelated. The CFA's mission continues to be to promote the protection and wise use of Canada's forest, water and wildlife resources. His participation as the first president of the Canadian Forestry Association was not altered by his ongoing political activity. He continued to put forward new ideas for forestry. In the CFA convened Canada's first national forestry convention, chaired by Sir Wilfrid Laurier, honorary CFA President. Sir Henri presented a paper in that called for the forest sector to consider conversion to the metric measurement system, a change that would not come to fruition in Canada until the s.Little, 2013 At the annual meeting of the Canadian Forestry Association in Qu√©bec City, condolences were expressed to Sir Henri on the passing the previous year of his wife. To quote the proceedings: \\"Then we must all regret the affliction that has come to our honoured president, Sir Henri Joly de Lotbini√®re and his family in the death of Lady Joly. We all love Sir Henri, and we believe that his name will be remembered for the good work he has done as long as trees grow in this country. He has our sincere sympathy in the affliction that has befallen him.\\" Prime Minister Laurier appointed him Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia in 1900; he served until 1906. He died in Quebec City in 1908, and was buried in Mount Hermon Cemetery in Sillery, on . He and his wife, Margaretta Josepha Gowen ( - ), had 11 children of whom 7 reached adulthood. Seymour de Lotbiniere, who grew up in England and was an influential director of outside broadcasting at the BBC, was their grandson. ==Elections as party leader== He won the 1878 election (the Liberals won one fewer seat than the Conservatives but he remained premier with the support of a few Conservatives).

Her biggest hit was \\"Just One Look\\", a top 10 hit in 1963. She was also one of the four female back up singers on The Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd. ==Life and career== She was born as Doris Elaine Higginsen, in the Bronx, the daughter of a Barbadian Pentecostal minister. She later took her grandmother's name and grew up as Doris Payne. Her parents disapproved of \\"subversive\\" forms of music like rhythm & blues, so she cut her teeth singing in her father's choir. At age 16, she was working as an usherette at the Apollo where she was discovered by James Brown. Under the name Doris Payne, she began songwriting and earned $100 in 1960 for the Dee Clark hit \\"How About That\\". Going into the recording industry, Troy worked as a backup vocalist for Atlantic Records alongside Dionne and Dee Dee Warwick. She was also part of the original lineup of The Sweet Inspirations in 1963, with Cissy Houston and the two Warwicks, who were Houston's nieces. Taking her stage name from Helen of Troy, Troy sang backup vocals for Solomon Burke, the Drifters, Houston, and Dionne Warwick, before she co-wrote and recorded \\"Just One Look\\" (the songwriting credits use the name Doris Payne). This song hit No. 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1963. \\"Just One Look\\" was the only charting US hit for Troy. The song was recorded in 10 minutes in October 1962, with producer Buddy Lucas, as a demo for Atlantic Records.Bernard \\"Pretty\\" Purdie, Let The Drums Speak!, 2014 pages 69‚Äì70. However, after Atlantic Records heard the demo, they decided not to re-record it, instead opting to release it as was. The musicians included Ernie Hayes on organ, Wally Richardson on guitar, Bob Bushnell on bass, and Bernard \\"Pretty\\" Purdie on drums. The song has been covered by The Hollies, Faith, Hope & Charity, Major Lance, Linda Ronstadt, Bryan Ferry, Anne Murray, Klaus Nomi, and Harry Nilsson in a duet with Lynda Laurence. Troy's only foray into the UK Singles Chart, \\"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\\", peaked at No. 37 in December 1964.

Further releases in the R&B; style followed: \\"Lullabye Angel\\", \\"I Know It All\\", \\"I'm Never Gonna Cry\\" and \\"Yours\\". The duo also recorded R&B; tracks for Vincent Chin's Randy's label including \\"Let Me Dream\\". The duo split after Parkins won a major talent contest and moved to the United States. Ellis remained in Kingston, working as a printer and after losing his job, he restarted his music career, initially forming a new duo with John Holt. When Holt joined The Paragons, Ellis formed a new group, The Flames. Ellis continued to work for Dodd and also recorded for his arch-rival, Duke Reid on his Treasure Isle label. At the start of his career Ellis recorded with his younger sister Hortense; early tracks with Hortense like \\"Don't Gamble With Love\\" (1965) were still in the R&B; style. ===Ska and rocksteady=== By the mid-1960s, ska was moving on and the beat was slowing down to rocksteady and becoming associated with the violent rude boy subculture in Jamaican dancehalls. Many artists made records referring to the rude boys, including Ellis, although his records were consistently anti-rudie, including \\"Don't Trouble People\\", \\"Dance Crasher\\", and \\"Cry Tough\\". Releasing records under the name Alton Ellis and The Flames (the varying line-up of which included his brother Leslie Ellis, David \\"Baby G\\" Gordon and Winston Jarrett); the group had hits with \\"Girl I've Got a Date\\" and \\"Cry Tough\\". \\"Girl I've Got a Date\\" recorded with Gladstone Anderson on piano, Paul Douglas on drums, Hux Brown on rhythm guitar, Lynn Taitt on guitar, and Jackie Jackson on bass is considered one of the foundational songs of the rocksteady genre. The bass line of \\"Girl I've Got a Date\\" was allegedly duplicated in other international hits \\"The Liquidator\\" (Harry J Allstars and \\"I'll Take You There\\" (The Staple Singers). The release of \\"Rock Steady\\" (1967) backed by Tommy McCook and the Supersonics, the first song to refer to the name of the new genre, heralded the new direction Jamaican popular music was taking. Ellis continued to have hits for Treasure Isle; working with artists such as Lloyd Charmers, Phyllis Dillon and The Heptones. His Mr Soul of Jamaica album (with Tommy McCook and the Supersonics) is regarded as one of the definitive rocksteady albums. Ellis toured the United Kingdom in the 1967 with Ken Boothe and Studio One session band the Soul Vendors and on his return to Jamaica he worked with Dodd, recording the tracks that would be released as his debut album Alton Ellis Sings Rock & Soul. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Ellis recorded for some of Jamaica's top producers including Bunny Lee, Keith Hudson, and Herman Chin Loy. He also began to produce his own records, including \\"My Time Is The Right Time\\" (1968) and \\"The Message\\". He had two hits with Lloyd Daley in \\"Deliver Us\\" (1970) and \\"Back to Africa\\" (1971), both released in the UK on the Gas record label, a subsidiary of Pama Records. Ellis regularly returned to England, working with several London-based producers and after spending a few years in Canada, from 1972 he based himself permanently in the UK. Ellis continued to record and perform regularly, recording in the early 1980s for emerging producers including Henry \\"Junjo\\" Lawes, Sugar Minott, and King Jammy. He also opened up the All-Tone record shop in South London, and started a record label of the same name.Katz, David (2003), Solid Foundation ‚Äì an Oral History of Reggae, Bloomsbury, . Ellis continued to be active on the reggae scene until his health began to deteriorate.Taylor, Angus (2006), \\"Alton Ellis @ The Jazz Cafe 5th January 2006\\" , Reggae News. His latest works include performing all over Europe with a French backing-band called ASPO (About Some Precioux Oldies) at the beginning of the 21st century. Recorded in Bordeaux, France, Live with Aspo: Workin' on a Groovy Thing is the only live album Alton Ellis ever released (2001). In 2004, Ellis was awarded the Order of Distinction by the Jamaican government in recognition of his achievements. In December 2007, he was admitted to hospital in London for treatment of cancer of the lymph glands (Hodgkins disease), but he returned to live performance after receiving chemotherapy. Ellis died of cancer on 10 October 2008 at Hammersmith Hospital, London. His death prompted a statement from Jamaica's Minister of Information, Culture, Youth and Sports, Olivia \\"Babsy\\" Grange, who said \\"even as we mourn the great Alton Ellis, we must give thanks for his monumental contribution to the development of Jamaica's popular music\\".\\"Statement From Minister Grange Expressing Regret At The Passing Of Jamaica's Most Famous Rocksteady Artiste \\", Monday, 13 October 2008, Jamaica Information Service A funeral service and celebration of his life was held on 3 November, attended by family, fans, music industry personnel and government ministers, with tribute performances from stars including Mr. Fix It Winston Francis, Tinga Stewart, George Nooks, Tony Gregory, Ken Boothe, Judy Mowatt and Carlene Davis.Peru, Yasmine (2008), \\"A rollicking send-off for Alton Ellis\\" , Jamaica Observer, 4 November 200. In 2012 it was announced that the main hall of the new Trench Town Multi-Purpose Building would be named the Alton Ellis Auditorium in his honour.Walters, Basil (2012) \\"Alton Ellis Auditiorium coming\\", Jamaica Observer, 9 September 2012, retrieved 10 September 2012. He was the older brother of the late Hortense Ellis, and the father of more than twenty children, including Noel Ellis and Christopher Ellis, who are both reggae singers.Campbell-Livingston, Cecelia (2013), \\"Rock Steady with Christopher Ellis\\", Jamaica Observer, 18 November 2013. Retrieved 18 November 2013. He was also the uncle of the Jamaican comedians Owen \\"Blakka\\" Ellis and Ian \\"Ity\\" Ellis. ==Legacy== The \\"Mad Mad\\" riddim (the track \\"Mad Mad\\" by Alton Ellis and the Sound Dimension band was released in 1968 on the Coxsone label) has been reused or sampled by many hip-hop, dancehall and reggae producers and artists. The recognizable three-note descending horn line was reinterpreted by Henry \\"Junjo\\" Lawes, and eventually became known as the \\"Diseases\\" reggae riddim. \\"Diseases\\" is notably used in Yellowman's hit song \\"Zungguzungguguzungguzeng\\", which has in turn has been sampled and reinterpreted by a long list of popular hip-hop artists, including KRS-One, The Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur, Sublime, and Blackstar. This constant reinterpretation and referencing has made Ellis a major but little-known influence in the trajectory of dancehall, reggae and hip hop. ==DiscographyAlbums=== * Sings Rock and Soul (Studio One, 1967) * The Best Of (Coxsone, 1969) * Sunday Coming (Coxsone, 1970) * Greatest Hits (Count Shelly, 1973) * Mr Soul of Jamaica (Treasure Isle, 1974) * Still in Love (Horse, 1977) * Love to Share (Third World, 1979) * Showcase (Studio One, 1984) * Slummin' (Abraham, 198?) * A New Day (Body Music, 1983) * Daydreaming (Silver Camel, 1983) * 25th Silver Jubilee (Sky Note, 1984) * Continuation (All Tone, 1985) * Jubilee Volume 2 (Sky Note, 1985) * Here I Am (Angella, 1988) * Family Vibes (All Tone, 1992) * Cry Tough (Reissue of Greatest Hits (1973) with extras on Heartbeat, 1993) * Man From Studio One (All Tone, 1994) * Change My Mind (Orchard, 2000) * More Alton Ellis (T.P., 2001) * Live with Aspo: Workin' on a Groovy Thing (Belleville International/Patate Records, 2001) * Reggae Chronicles (Pickwick, Hallmark, 2006) ;With the Heptones: * Mr Ska Bean'a (Cha Cha, 1981) * Alton Ellis Sings, Heptones Harmonise (1978‚Äì80) (Jet Star, 19??) ;With Wayne McGhie: * Wayne McGhie and the Sounds of Joy (Birchmount, Canada, 1970) ;With Hortense Ellis: * Alton & Hortense Ellis at Studio 1 (Heartbeat, 1990) ===Compilations=== * All My Tears (1965‚Äì68) (Brook, 2006) * Arise Black Man (1968‚Äì78) (Moll Selekta, 19??) * Be True to Yourself (1965‚Äì73) (Trojan 2004) * Get Ready for Rock Reggae Steady (1967‚Äì74) (Jamaican Gold, 1999) * Many Moods of Alton Ellis (1978‚Äì80) (Tele-Tech, 1980) * My Time Is the Right Time (1966‚Äì71) (Westside, 2000) * Reggae Valley of Decision (197X) (House of Reggae, 1996) * Soul Groover (Trojan, 1997) * Reggae Max (Jet Star, 1997) * The Duke Reid Collection (Rhino, 1999) * Soul of Jamaica (Bianco, 2001) * Studio One Soul (?Reissue, 2001) * It Hurts Me So (Essential Gold, 2006) * Reggae Chronicles (Hallmark, 2006) * Muriel (All Tone, 2007) * Story of Mister Soul (Jahslams, 2009) ==References== ==External links== *Alton Ellis at Roots Archives *\\"Sleepy Meets Mr. Soul at Ladbroke Grove\\" ‚Äì interview with Alton Ellis and Horace Andy by Lol Bell-Brown and Mark Ottignon *Rebel Base interview Category:1938 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Jamaican expatriates in the United Kingdom Category:Musicians from Kingston, Jamaica Category:Rocksteady musicians Category:Jamaican emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:Jamaican reggae musicians Category:Island Records artists Category:Trojan Records artists Category:Recipients of the Order of Distinction Category:Deaths from cancer in England ","title":"Alton Ellis"},{"id":"517117","text":"A national redoubt or national fortress is an area to which the (remnant) forces of a nation can be withdrawn if the main battle has been lost or even earlier if defeat is considered inevitable. Typically, a region is chosen with a geography favouring defence, such as a mountainous area or a peninsula, to function as a final holdout to preserve national independence and host an effective resistance movement for the duration of the conflict. ==Western EuropeBelgium=== From the middle of the 19th century until 1914 the fortress city of Antwerp was the official National Redoubt of Antwerp in Belgium. Fortress Antwerp was a defensive belt of fortifications built in two rings to defend Antwerp. Antwerp was designated to be a national reduit (R√©duit national (French) or De versterkte stelling Antwerpen (Dutch)) in case Belgium was attacked. It was built in the period 1859‚Äì1914. In total it encompasses a belt of fortifications of 95 km. ===France=== In 1940 Brittany was briefly considered as such in the last stages of the Fall of France, but proved impractical. ===Netherlands=== Major Dutch defence lines in 1940 Until 1920, the \\"Fortress Amsterdam\\" was the national redoubt of the Netherlands. Between 1920 and 1940, Fortress Amsterdam was extended to Fortress Holland, to include a larger part of the country's heartland. In both cases, neither \\"redoubt\\" proved defensible even though the Dutch Water Line, a precursor in the Netherlands, managed to stop the advances of the French troops in the Rampjaar 1672, providing the Dutch with the needed time to gain the upper hand. ===Portugal=== Since the early 19th century to the World War II, Lisbon was considered the national redoubt of Portugal. Besides being the capital, the largest city and the major port of the country, Lisbon was considered the last defensible redoubt in case of an invasion of Portugal by a major power. During this period, successive systems of defense were implemented. The first major defense system of Lisbon was built during the Peninsular War, as the Lines of Torres Vedras. These consisted in two lines of fortifications that protected the region of Lisbon (with a third line around the coastal fortress of S√£o Juli√£o da Barra). The Lines of Torres Vedras were able to block Mass√©na's 1810 offensive. Another major defense system was implemented in the late 19th century as the Lisbon Entrenched Camp. This was a modern (for its day) system of fortifications, aimed to protect the Portuguese capital against an attack coming from land or from the sea. Its land component sector consisted in several modern forts, connected by protected roads and telegraph lines. Its sea front defense consisted in coastal artillery batteries, complemented by naval dedicated assets, including a coastal battleship, torpedo boats, submarines and naval mines. The last major system of defense of Lisbon was implemented during World War II. It included a system of anti- aircraft, ground, coastal and maritime defenses. Parts of this system, namely its fortified coastal defense batteries remained partially active until the late 1990s. ==Central EuropeGermany=== The Alpine Fortress () was the World War II national redoubt planned by Heinrich Himmler in November/December 1943\\"Himmler started laying the plans for underground warfare in the last two months of 1943.... The plans are threefold, embracing (1) Open warfare directed from Hitler's mountain headquarters; (2) Sabotage and guerrilla activity conducted by partisan bands organized by districts, and (3) Propaganda warfare to be carried on by some 200,000 Nazi followers in Europe and elsewhere. Strongholds Established Already picked S.S. (elite) troops have been established in underground strongholds and hospitals in the Austrian, Bavarian and Italian Alpine area and it is the plan of Nazi leaders to flee to that region when the German military collapse comes\\" ). for Germany's government and armed forces to retreat to an area from \\"southern Bavaria across western Austria to northern Italy\\".\\"But what of the top Nazis who cannot hide? With a compact army of young SS and Hitler Youth fanatics, they will retreat, behind a loyal rearguard cover of Volksgrenadiere and Volksst√ºrmer, to the Alpine massif which reaches from southern Bavaria across western Austria to northern Italy. There immense stores of food and munitions are being laid down in prepared fortifications. If the retreat is a success, such an army might hold out for years\\" () The plan was never fully endorsed by Hitler and no serious attempt was made to put the plan into operation. === Italy === The Alpine Wall (Vallo Alpino) was a defence structure developed against the allied Germany in the Alps. It was reused at the end of the World War II from German troops, and after the World War II in the Cold War to prevent an invasion from Soviet Union.Photos and articles on the western section of the Alpine Wall (in Italian) Alessandro Bernasconi; Giovanni Muran. Le fortificazioni del Vallo Alpino Littorio in Alto Adige Trento, editore Temi [maggio 1999], 328 pagine. ===Switzerland=== Plan of the Defence lines of the Swiss National Redoubt Swiss National Redoubt (Schweizer Alpenfestung or R√©duit suisse) was a defensive plan developed by the Swiss government during World War II to respond to a possible German invasion, which had been planned but was never carried out. The plan was in three stages: first, to hold an invading army on the border; second, if that failed, to launch a delaying war that would allow the bulk of Swiss forces to withdraw to a defensible perimeter in the Swiss Alps; and third, to defend that mountain stronghold.Strange Maps ===Austria=== During the Cold War, Austria developed a similar plan called Raumverteidigung (area defence). The plan was primarily directed against Hungary and Czechoslovakia (and later the Warsaw Pact) but it also included plans against an attack by NATO forces. The Austrian Armed Forces would retreat into key zones situated in the alpine region and defend it. They would also employ guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines and delay the enemy advance in the area's security zones. ==Other regionsChina=== The Chinese Nationalists relocated to the island of Taiwan after the Civil War. During the Second Sino-Japanese War in World War II, the city of Kunming was prepared as a national redoubt in case the temporary capital, Chongqing, fell. An elaborate system of caves to serve as offices, barracks and factories was prepared but never used. Kunming was again slated to serve in this role in the renewed Chinese civil war, but the Nationalist garrison changed sides and joined the Communists. Instead, Taiwan became the last redoubt and home of the Nationalist government, a role which continues to this day. ===Japan=== Towards the end of World War II, the Matsushiro Underground Imperial Headquarters were built in Nagano Prefecture. They were intended as a base from which the Japanese government could operate. The base was partly completed by the time of Japan's surrender. ===Mandate of Palestine=== As German Afrika Korps forces proceeded eastward towards Egypt in World War II, the Jewish community in Palestine considered retreating into fortified positions at Haifa and the Mount Carmel region, were the German advance to reach them. The Palestine Post Occupation Scheme was a short-lived 1942 collaboration between the Jewish underground Palmach and the British Special Operations Executive, with training for the plan centered at the kibbutz Mishmar HaEmek, and Moshe Dayan to be put in charge of managing a clandestine radio network. In Jewish underground circles, the plan was also variously called the \\"Plan for the North\\", \\"Masada on the Carmel\\", \\"Haifa-Tobruk\\", \\"Haifa-Masada-Musa-Dagh\\", or \\"Haifa Stronghold\\". The planners on the Palmach side were Yohanan Ratner and Yitzhak Sadeh. David Shaltiel (commander in Haifa at the time) and Yitzhak Gruenbaum were vocal supporters of a Masada-like stand, while Yigal Allon and others were skeptical of its usefulness. The evacuation of women and children to Cyprus was also considered. The decisive British victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein soon afterward rendered the plan moot. ===Poland=== During the 1930s, assuming that Poland was attacked only by the Germans, the Polish forces were to make the last stand in the area of the Romanian Bridgehead. After the Battle of Bzura was over and even after the Soviet invasion of Poland, many Polish divisions kept on heading towards the Romanian Bridgehead. Beck's proposal to establish Lviv (Lw√≥w) as the temporary capital of Poland, in the case of German attack, was rejected; possibly because Lviv was west of the Romanian bridgehead. ===Sweden=== Karlsborg Fortress was conceived in 19th century Sweden to host monarchy, government, parliament and gold reserves in time of war. Karlsborg was selected as Sweden's eastern coast and Stockholm became rather exposed after Sweden's loss of Finland in 1809. ===Yugoslavia=== According to the \\"Total National Resistance\\" defense doctrine of the second Yugoslavia, a rugged highland area focused on central Bosnia (roughly, the La≈°va Valley) was to function as a redoubt to which the Yugoslav People's Army would retreat in case of a Soviet or NATO invasion. Defense of the rest of the country was to be left to the guerrilla-warfare efforts of the Territorial Defense forces. A network of industrial zones and fortified bases was developed in anticipation, including factories in boom cities like Zenica and an underground air force base at ≈Ωeljava and a command bunker complex intended for the use of Marshal Josip Broz Tito. == See also == == External links == * US Army in WW II: The last Offensive Chapter XVIII: The Myth of the Redoubt ==Notes and references== Category:Military deception during World War II Category:Fortifications by type ","title":"National redoubt"},{"id":"517118","text":"John Jones Ross, (August 16, 1831 ‚Äì May 4, 1901) was a Canadian politician.

His father, Thomas Macdonald, and his mother, Ellen, were both Welsh. The family moved to the Lancashire Coalfield where he was brought up, his father working as a coalminer in a pit near Ashton in Makerfield. Educated in a local elementary school, he initially followed his father into the collieries aged 13. He subsequently won a scholarship to Ruskin College. In 1920 he was elected to Wigan Board of Guardians, in 1924 became president of a local co- operative society and in the same year a miner's agent for the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. ==Member of parliament== At the 1929 general election Macdonald was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Ince, holding the seat until 1942. He was a junior Labour whip from 1931 to 1934 and was chairman of committees in the House of Commons. He resigned from Parliament in July 1942 to take up the post of Regional Controller for the Ministry of Fuel and Power for the Lancashire, Cheshire, and North Wales Region. ==Governor of Newfoundland== In January 1946 he was appointed Governor of Newfoundland and Commander in Chief of Newfoundland and its Dependencies, and chairman of the unelected Commission of Government that governed the dominion. At the same time he was created Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. He oversaw the election of the Newfoundland National Convention in 1946, and the holding of two referendums in 1948, which led to Newfoundland becoming a province of Canada in March 1949. Macdonald was viewed as being pro-federation and was accused of bias by Peter Cashin and supporters of responsible government and of manipulating the referendums. Macdonald left the island upon its entry to Canada in 1949. Two days after his departure, an apparently congratulatory poem was published in The Evening Telegram. It emerged that the poem was an acrostic, with the first letter of each line spelling out \\"THE BASTARD\\". ==Paymaster-General== On return to the United Kingdom in 1949, Macdonald joined the government of Clement Attlee as Paymaster-General, elevated to the House of Lords as Baron Macdonald of Gwaenysgor. In 1950 he was leader of the British delegation to the Commonwealth Conference on Economic Aid to Countries of South East Asia held in Sydney, Australia and was a delegate to United Nations General Assembly at Lake Success, New York. He was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1951. He held office until Labour lost power at the 1951 general election. ==Later life== Macdonald continued to be active in public life. A fluent Welsh speaker, from 1952 to 1960 he was National Governor for Wales of the British Broadcasting Corporation, and from 1953 until his death was chairman of the Broadcasting Council for Wales. From 1952 to 1959 he was a member of the Colonial Development Corporation. A Congregationalist in religion, he was National President of the Band of Hope Union of Great Britain in 1951. He held two honorary doctorates in law from Mount Allison University, Sackville, New Brunswick and the University of Wales. ==Family== In 1913 he married Mary Lewis of Blaenau Ffestiniog. The couple had two sons and one daughter. He died in January 1966, aged 77. His eldest son, Gordon Ramsay MacDonald, succeeded him in the barony. ==See also== *List of people of Newfoundland and Labrador *Lord MacDonald of Gwaenysgor on the Dictionary of Welsh Biography *Brief description or Lord MacDonald's papers at the National Library of Wales ==References== ==External links== * Category:1885 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Barons in the Peerage of the United Kingdom Category:Governors of the Dominion of Newfoundland Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Labour Party (UK) hereditary peers Category:Members of the Newfoundland Commission of Government Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Miners' Federation of Great Britain-sponsored MPs Category:Ministers in the Attlee governments, 1945‚Äì1951 Category:People from Prestatyn Category:Place of death missing Category:UK MPs 1929‚Äì1931 Category:UK MPs 1931‚Äì1935 Category:UK MPs 1935‚Äì1945 Category:UK MPs who were granted peerages ","title":"Gordon Macdonald, 1st Baron Macdonald of Gwaenysgor"},{"id":"517122","text":"The following are the regional bird lists by continent.

Ring editor Nat Fleischer, noting that other sports had record books and that boxing did not have any books specialized in keeping fans up to date as far as the participants' records, began writing the first Ring boxing encyclopedia in 1941. It was published for the first time in 1942. Fleischer wanted to create a book that would keep fans informed about the history of boxing and their favorite fighters, and, at the same time, help fighters' managers and promoters choose who their prot√©g√©'s next opponent should be. It also included a detailed history of title fights for each division, and a section of a list of boxing record setters. With time, the book would also include round by round scoring for each title fight held on the year prior. At its peak, the book consisted of close to 600 pages of records and stats. After Fleischer died in 1972, Stanley Weston took over the production and edition of the yearly encyclopedia book. During this period, Ring Record book and boxing Encyclopedias were hard-cover books, with a glossy, outside cover that had color photos of famous modern fighters of the era. In 1990, The Ring magazine went bankrupt, and the Ring Encyclopedia stopped being produced. In 1992, The Ring magazine returned to the stands, but it wasn't until 1994 that the encyclopedia returned. The new version of the Ring Record Book and Boxing Encyclopedia is a smaller, pocket sized book with a different context separating it from the original one. It is a soft cover book that covers the history of each division, but including only the fights where world titles changed hands. It also includes a recap of title fights held the year before, but without the judges' scorecards for any of the fights. It only has the records of current world champions (except WBO ones, as The Ring magazine has always refused to recognize WBO world champions as such), and of leading contenders. It also has a recap of Ring's articles of the past twelve months. Currently, the encyclopedic books are edited by Steve Farhood. The original version of the encyclopedia, which was a mail-order item, topped at a price of 25 dollars. Many books in the original format are now collector's items, and as such, their prices have gone up. The new version usually sells for 5 dollars at many supermarkets and other stores.

Starting in the early 1950s as the lead singer of his family musical group the Valentinos and as Sam Cooke's backing guitarist, Womack's career spanned more than 60 years and multiple styles, including R&B;, soul, rock and roll, doo-wop, and gospel. Womack was a prolific songwriter who wrote and originally recorded, (with his brothers, the Valentinos), the Rolling Stones' first UK number one hit, \\"It's All Over Now\\" and New Birth's \\"I Can Understand It\\". As a singer, he is most notable for the hits \\"Lookin' for a Love\\", \\"That's the Way I Feel About Cha\\", \\"Woman's Gotta Have It\\", \\"Harry Hippie\\", \\"Across 110th Street\\", and his 1980s hits \\"If You Think You're Lonely Now\\" and \\"I Wish He Didn't Trust Me So Much\\". In 2009, Bobby Womack was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. ==Early life== Born in Cleveland's Fairfax neighborhood, near East 85th Street and Quincy Avenue, to Naomi Womack and Friendly Womack, Bobby was the third of five brothers. Friendly Jr. and Curtis were the older brothers, Harry and Cecil were his younger brothers. They all grew up in the Cleveland slums, so poor that the family would fish pig snouts out of the local supermarket's trash. He had to share a bed with his brothers. His mother told him he could \\"sing his way out of the ghetto.\\" Recalling his childhood, Bobby said, \\"we came up very poor. My kids have had a much better life than I'd ever thought of livin,'\\" and, \\"the neighborhood was so ghetto that we didn't bother the rats and they didn't bother us.\\" Raised Baptist, their mother played the organ for the church choir, and their father was a steelworker, part-time minister, and musician who played the guitar and also sang gospel. Their father repeatedly ordered his sons to not touch his guitar while he was away, yet all five brothers regularly played it while their father was at work. One night, eight- year-old Bobby broke a guitar string, then tried to replace the string with a shoelace. After Friendly deduced that Bobby (who was missing a shoelace) had broken the string, he offered Bobby the chance to play the guitar for him in lieu of a whipping. Soon afterwards, Friendly bought guitars for all five of his sons. Because Bobby was left-handed, he flipped his guitar upside-down to play, not knowing that the guitar could have been restrung to accommodate a left-handed player.\\"I was left-handed and didn't realize I had the guitar upside-down.\\" == Career == By the mid-1950s, 10-year-old Bobby was touring with his brothers on the midwest gospel circuit as The Womack Brothers, along with Naomi on organ and Friendly Sr. on guitar. In 1954, under the moniker Curtis Womack and the Womack Brothers, the group issued the Pennant single, \\"Buffalo Bill\\". More records followed. Sam Cooke, the lead singer of The Soul Stirrers, first saw the group performing in the mid-1950s. He became their mentor and helped them go on tour. They went on national tours with The Staple Singers. Even though Curtis often sang lead, Bobby was allowed to sing alongside him showcasing his gruff baritone vocals in contrast to his older brother's smoother tenor. During performances, Bobby would sometimes imitate the role of a preacher, which later became his nickname. At just 16, Bobby dropped out of high school. At the beginning of the 1960s, Cooke formed SAR Records and signed the quintet to the label in 1961, where they released a handful of gospel singles. Then, Cooke changed their name to the Valentinos, relocated them to Los Angeles and convinced them to transition from gospel music to secular soul-and pop-influenced sound. Cooke produced and arranged the group's first hit single, \\"Lookin' for a Love\\", which was a pop version of the gospel song, \\"Couldn't Hear Nobody Pray\\", they had recorded earlier. The song became an R&B; hit and helped land the group an opening spot for James Brown's tour. The group's next hit came in 1964 with the country-tinged \\"It's All Over Now\\", co-composed by Bobby. Their version was rising on the charts when The Rolling Stones covered it. Womack was also a member of Cooke's band, touring and recording with him from 1961. The Valentinos' career was left shaky after Sam Cooke was shot and killed in a Los Angeles motel. Devastated by the news, the brothers disbanded and SAR Records folded. Womack attempted to start his solo career in 1965, first recording for Him Records and later the Chess Records subsidiary, Checker Records. Womack faced backlash after his marriage to Cooke's widow Barbara Cooke. He would go to radio stations and disc jockeys would throw away his records. He continued to work as a session musician. Between 1965 and 1968, he toured and recorded with Ray Charles. ===1967‚Äì1972: Early solo career=== Circa 1965, Womack relocated to Memphis where he worked at Chips Moman's American Studios. He played guitar on recordings by Joe Tex and the Box Tops. Womack played guitar on several of Aretha Franklin's albums, including Lady Soul, but not on the hit song \\"Chain of Fools\\", as erroneously reported. His work as a songwriter caught the eye of music executives after Wilson Pickett took a liking to some of Womack's songs and insisted on recording them. Among the songs were \\"I'm a Midnight Mover\\" and \\"I'm in Love\\". In 1968, Bobby signed with Minit Records and recorded his first solo album, Fly Me to the Moon, where he scored his first major hit with a cover of The Mamas & the Papas' \\"California Dreamin'\\". In 1969, Womack forged a partnership with G√°bor Szab√≥ and with Szab√≥, penned the instrumental \\"Breezin'\\", later a hit for George Benson. Womack also worked with rock musicians Sly and the Family Stone and Janis Joplin, contributing vocals and guitar work on the Family Stone's accomplished album There's a Riot Goin' On, and penning the ballad \\"Trust Me\\", for Joplin on her album Pearl. In fact, Womack was one of the last people to see Joplin alive, having visited her hours before she died at the Landmark Hotel in Los Angeles, California. After two more albums with Minit, Bobby switched labels, signing with United Artists where he changed his attire and his musical direction with the album Communication. The album bolstered his first top 40 hit, \\"That's the Way I Feel About Cha\\", which peaked at number two R&B; and number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the spring of 1972. ===1972‚Äì1985: Solo success=== Following Communication, Womack's profile was raised with two more albums, released in 1972. The first was Understanding, noted for the track \\"I Can Understand It\\", later covered by the funk band New Birth and a three-sibling lineup of Bobby's old group, the Valentinos, and two hit singles, \\"Woman's Gotta Have It\\" and \\"Harry Hippie\\". The latter song was written for Womack by Jim Ford in a country version, which Womack re-arranged in an R&B; version. \\"Harry Hippie\\" later became Womack's first single to be certified gold. \\"Woman's Gotta Have It\\" became Womack's first single to hit number one on the R&B; charts. Another hit album released after Understanding was the soundtrack to the blaxploitation film Across 110th Street. The title track became popular during its initial 1972 release and later would be played during the opening and closing scenes of the 1997 film, Jackie Brown. In 1973, Womack released another hit album, Facts of Life, and had a top 40 hit with \\"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out,\\" an older song Sam Cooke had done years before. In 1974, Womack released his most successful single during this period with a remake of his first hit single, \\"Lookin' for a Love\\". His solo version of the song became even more successful than the original with the Valentinos, becoming his second number one hit on the R&B; chart and peaking at number ten on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming his only hit to reach that high on the pop chart. The song was featured on the album Lookin' for a Love Again and featured the minor charted \\"You're Welcome, Stop on By\\", later covered by Rufus & Chaka Khan. Womack's career began stalling after Womack received the news of his brother Harry's death. Womack continued to record albums with United Artists through 1975 and 1976 but with less success than previous albums. In 1975, Womack collaborated with Rolling Stones member Ronnie Wood, on Wood's second solo album, Now Look. In 1976, Womack organized a benefit at the Hollywood Palladium to raise funds for his friend, singer Jackie Wilson, who had suffered a heart attack. Womack languished with his own recordings during the late 1970s but continued to be a frequent collaborator with other artists, most notably Wilton Felder of the Crusaders. After his son Truth Bobby died in 1978, Womack formed a production company named Truth. He hired a new co-producer and Keyboardist, Patrick Moten who worked with Ike Turner and Natalie Cole, and released the album Roads of Life on Arista Records in 1979. In 1980, Wilton Felder released the album Inherit The Wind on MCA Records which featured Womack. It became a jazz-funk classic, notably in the UK‚ÄîRobbie Vincent at Radio London included the track as one of his all-time winners in October 1982. In 1981, Womack signed with Beverly Glen Records and had his first R&B; top 10 single in five years‚Äîsince the 1976 single \\"Daylight\\"‚Äîwith \\"If You Think You're Lonely Now\\" that peaked at number three on the R&B; singles chart. His accompanying album The Poet reached number one on the R&B; album charts and is now seen as the high point of his long career, bringing him wider acclaim not only in the U.S. but also in Europe. He had two more R&B; top 10 singles during the 1980s including the Patti LaBelle duet, \\"Love Has Finally Come at Last\\", and \\"I Wish He Didn't Trust Me So Much\\". He had a hit featuring on the Wilton Felder single \\"(No Matter How High I Get) I'll Still Be Looking Up to You\\". ===1985‚Äì2014: Later career=== Womack's solo career started to slow down after 1985, in part due to Womack's issues with drug addiction. After sobering up in the mid-1990s, he released his twentieth studio album, Resurrection on his close friend's Ronnie Wood's label. The album included session background work from admiring associates that included Rod Stewart, Ronald Isley, Keith Richards and Charlie Watts. His remaining brothers from the Valentinos, Curtis, Friendly and Cecil, featured as background singers. Two singles from the album‚Äîa duet with Ronald Isley, \\"Tryin' Not To Break Down\\", and \\"Forever Love\\"‚Äîappeared on the Billboard R&B; chart, but although the album contained two of Womack's best latter songs, \\"Cousin Henry\\" and \\"Don't Break Your Promise (Too Soon)\\", the album received a mixed critical reception. A gospel album, Back to My Roots, appeared at the end of the decade, but Womack largely concentrated on session and guest work for the next ten years. In 1986, The Manhattans released the album Back To Basics, which contained songs written and produced by Womack. Womack contributed vocals and acoustic guitar to the songs \\"Where Did We Go Wrong\\" (duet with Regina Belle), \\"I'm Through Trying To Prove My Love To You\\", \\"Mr D.J.\\" and \\"Back Into The Night\\". He is the featured vocalist on June Yamagishi's My Pleasure album, on \\"Inherit The Wind\\", a track credited to Wilton Felder, and with Allen Toussaint on \\"Sputin\\", and he contributed vocals to Rae & Christian's version of \\"Wake Up Everybody\\". Other collaborations included \\"You Got What It Takes\\" with Diane Schuur, \\"Ain't Nothing Like The Lovin' We Got\\" with Shirley Brown, \\"Break the Chain\\" with Andrew Love & Wayne Jackson and \\"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\\" with Jeanie Tracy. In 1989, Womack sang on Todd Rundgren's \\"For the Want of a Nail\\" on the album Nearly Human. In 1998, he performed George Gershwin's \\"Summertime\\" with The Roots for the Red Hot Organization's compilation album Red Hot + Rhapsody, a tribute to Gershwin, which raised money for various charities devoted to increasing AIDS awareness and fighting the disease. In October 1992, Womack held four tribute concert for his friend Eddie Kendricks. Womack planned the concert before Kendricks, who suffered from lung cancer, died on October 5, 1992. Womack headlined the concert; other performers included Chaka Khan, Mary Wilson, and Bill Withers. In 2010, Womack contributed lyrics and sang on \\"Stylo\\" alongside Mos Def, the first single from the third Gorillaz album Plastic Beach. Womack was told to sing whatever was on his mind during the recording of \\"Stylo\\". \\"I was in there for an hour going crazy about love and politics, getting it off my chest,\\" said Womack. He also provided vocals on the song \\"Cloud of Unknowing\\" in addition to the song \\"Bobby in Phoenix\\" on their December 2010 release The Fall. A new album was released on June 12, 2012 by XL Recordings of London. The album, The Bravest Man in the Universe was produced by Damon Albarn and Richard Russell. The first Song \\"Please Forgive My Heart\\" was offered as a free download on XL Recordings' official website on March 8, 2012. Contact Music reported that Womack was working on a blues album called Living in the House of Blues, featuring collaborations with Stevie Wonder, Snoop Dogg and Rod Stewart. In an interview with Uncut, Womack revealed that the follow-up album would now be called The Best Is Yet to Come and feature Teena Marie and Ronnie Isley. Womack duets with Van Morrison on \\"Some Peace of Mind\\", from Morrison's 1991 album, Hymns to the Silence, on Morrison's album Duets: Re-working the Catalogue released in 2015. Womack collaborated with Rudimental on \\"New Day\\", a song taken from their second studio album, We the Generation. He had expressed an interest in working with the group and they had exchanged ideas. Following Womack's death, his wife sent the group an a cappella vocal which he had recorded for them, and they pieced together the track. Womack's final concert was June 14, 2014 at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bobby- womack-1944-2014-246105/ ==Musical legacy== Throughout his long recording career, many of Womack's songs have been covered by other artists. In addition to the famous Rolling Stones' version of \\"It's All Over Now\\", it has charted also with versions by Patti Drew in 1966 and as a duet between Womack and Bill Withers in 1975. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s other artists regularly recorded his songs. They included Ella Washington and Baby Washington, who recorded \\"I Can't Afford To Lose Him\\" in 1968, Jerry Butler, who released \\"Yes My Goodness Yes\\" in 1968, Margie Joseph, who issued \\"What You Gonna Do\\", and Roosevelt Grier, who had an R&B; success with \\"People Make The World\\". One of his most famous songs, \\"Trust Me\\", was recorded by Janis Joplin and later by Winfield Parker amongst others. The 1960s and 1970s were especially profitable years for Womack's songwriting, either solo efforts or in partnership with the likes of Darryl Carter and Jim Ford. Whilst working as a session musician with Wilson Pickett he regularly contributed songs, including the original version of \\"I'm In Love\\", later covered by Aretha Franklin. Another Atlantic Records artist, Percy Sledge, issued \\"Baby Help Me\\" in 1967. The J. Geils Band covered \\"Lookin' for a Love\\", released on several albums, including the live album Blow Your Face Out. In the following decade, Millie Jackson with \\"Put Something Down On It\\", Kokomo and New Birth with \\"I Can Understand It\\", Ronnie Wood with \\"I Got A Feeling\\", and George Benson with the instrumental \\"Breezin'\\", recorded versions of Womack songs. Lou Donaldson, the American jazz saxophonist, reinterpreted \\"You're Welcome To Stop On By\\" in 1974. The British singer Rod Stewart used the distinctive string arrangement from \\"Put Something Down On It\\" for his massive hit \\"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy\\". Other significant artists to record Bobby Womack songs include: Georgie Fame and Kelly Rowland and Vicki Sue Robinson, 1976 with \\"Daylight\\", Aretha Franklin and O V Wright's separate covers of \\"That's The Way I Feel About You\\" and reggae acts Dennis Alcapone, who issued a distinctive version of \\"Harry Hippy\\" entitled \\"Sorry Harry\\", and Triston Palma, who issued \\"Love Has Finally Come At Last\\" in 1984. Jodeci's K-Ci Hailey, a notable admirer of Womack's work, covered \\"If You Think You're Lonely Now\\" in 1994. Hailey again covered Womack in 2006 with his rendition of \\"A Woman's Gotta Have It\\". The song is referenced in Mariah Carey's song \\"We Belong Together\\", a number one hit in June 2005. Carey sings \\"I can't sleep at night / When you are on my mind / Bobby Womack's on the radio / Singing to me: 'If you think you're lonely now.' \\" In 2007, R&B; singer Jaheim interpolated the song as \\"Lonely\\" on his album The Makings of a Man. Neo soul singer Calvin Richardson also covered many of Womack's tunes. \\"That's the Way I Feel About Cha\\" was covered by the late R&B; musician Gerald Levert and fellow singer Mary J. Blige on Levert's 1998 album Love & Consequences. Film director Quentin Tarantino used \\"Across 110th Street\\" (which, in a different version, had been the title song of the 1972 movie) in the opening and closing sequences of his 1997 film Jackie Brown. His work has been used in several other popular films, including Meet the Parents (2000), Ali (2001) and American Gangster (2007). A 2003 Saab commercial used Womack's interpretation of \\"California Dreamin.\\" In 2005, \\"Across 110th Street\\" appeared in the hit Activision video game True Crime: New York City. On the 1994 release 1-800-NEW-FUNK, Nona Gaye covered \\"Woman's Gotta Have It\\", produced by Prince and backed by his band, New Power Generation. During the spring of 1997, R&B; singer Rome covered the original song from his self- titled debut album. In 2008, Kelly Rowland recorded her own version of his R&B; hit \\"Daylight\\" with Travis McCoy of the Gym Class Heroes, which became a hit in the UK Singles Chart, where it was previously released as a single by Womack in 1976. In 2009, Calvin Richardson was chosen to record a tribute album to Womack to coincide with Womack's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The Grammy-nominated album was entitled Facts of Life: The Soul of Bobby Womack. It reached No. 30 on the US R&B; chart. In early 2012, Womack's career was the subject of the documentary show Unsung on TV One. ===Material loss=== On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Bobby Womack among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. ==Personal life Marriages === On February 26, 1965, 77 days after Sam Cooke's death, 20-year-old Womack and Cooke's widow Barbara Cooke, who was 10 years his senior, attempted to marry at the Los Angeles county courthouse. Womack wore one of Cooke's suits to the courthouse and the media was present to record the event, but their application was rejected. According to the Los Angeles Sentinel, it was denied because Womack was under 21 years old and did not have his parents' permission to marry. They were finally married on March 5, the day after his 21st birthday. Their marriage was considered a scandal by some in the music business and Womack found himself ostracized in the soul music world. Womack's brothers turned against him, as did his audiences and disc jockeys. Cooke's family was also enraged. His brothers Charles and David Cook broke Womack's jaw during an attack at a hotel in Chicago. Womack later claimed he initially went to Barbara's side to console her following Cooke's death for fear that if she were left alone, she would \\"do something crazy.\\" In 1970, Womack and Barbara separated after she discovered he was having an affair with his 17-year-old stepdaughter Linda Cooke (daughter of Barbara and Sam Cooke). In the ensuing tussle, Barbara fired a gun at her husband and the bullet grazed his head. Their divorce was finalized in 1971. According to Womack, Linda never spoke to her mother again. Womack married his second wife Evelyn Evans when he was 29. She was his personal secretary. On December 31, 1975, Womack married his third wife 19-year-old Regina Banks. Together they had three children. In the early 1990s, Regina left him and went to New York. They later remarried in 2013. === Children === Womack had six children, with two passing away before him. Womack's firstborn from his marriage to Barbara, Vincent Dwayne Womack, was born in 1966. He committed suicide at the age of 21 by a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Barbara had two daughters from her previous marriage to Sam Cooke, Tracy and Linda. She also had a son, Vincent Lance Cooke (1961‚Äì1963), who drowned aged 18 months old in the family pool. Womack had two sons, Truth Bobby (1978‚Äì1978) and Bobby Truth, and a daughter, GinaRe, with his wife Regina. Truth Bobby, whose name was suggested by Womack's friend Sly Stone, died aged 4 months old after falling into a coma when he was found \\"wedged between the wall and the bed.\\" His death caused Womack to delve deeper into drug addiction. Bobby Truth got involved with gangs and was sent to a youth detention center at about 11 or 12 years old. Womack fathered two sons, Cory and Jordan, from his relationship with Jody Laba. === Family === In 1974, Bobby's brother Harry Womack was fatally stabbed in the neck with a steak knife, by his girlfriend Patricia Wilson, in a jealous rage. She had found another woman's clothes in a room he was occupying at Bobby's house. It turned out that the clothes actually belonged to Bobby's girlfriend. After his death, Bobby established the 'Harry James Womack Memorial Scholarship Fund' in his memory. The $50,000 scholarship fund was to aid minority students complete college, because Harry had always \\"wished he had gone on and gotten a degree.\\" Bobby's former stepdaughter, Linda Cooke, co-wrote his 1972 hit song \\"Woman's Gotta Have It.\\" They collaborated in the late 1970s for her planned debut album. She married Bobby's younger brother Cecil Womack, and the duo teamed up as Womack & Womack. The song \\"Baby I'm Scared of You\\" by Womack & Womack, from their album Love Wars, was released as a single in 1983. ===Drug addiction and health issues=== Womack opened up about his frequent drug use in his memoir, Midnight Mover. Womack said he began using cocaine sometime in the late 1960s. He had become close friends with Sly Stone, and was an enthusiastic participant in Stone's infamous drug binges. Womack told Rolling Stone in 1984: \\"I was really off into the drugs. Blowing as much coke as I could blow. And drinking. And smoking weed and taking pills. Doing that all day, staying up seven, eight days. Me and Sly [Stone] were running partners.\\" In 1974, Womack experienced \\"temporary blindness\\" after he suffered a concussion from a blow to his head when he flipped off backwards over an amplifier. His cocaine use turned into an addiction by the late 1970s. Womack partially attributed his drug addiction to his infant son Truth's death in 1978, which he said changed him forever. Throughout most of the 1980s, Womack struggled with a worsening addiction. During this period his career slowed down significantly, partly as a result of his drug usage. In 1985, after completing 14 one- nighters, Womack was hospitalized after experiencing a blood circulation problem in his left leg. Towards the end of the 1980s, he went into a rehabilitation center to get over his cocaine addiction, which he said he conquered. Womack survived prostate cancer. A series of health problems would follow, including diabetes, pneumonia, colon cancer and the early signs of Alzheimer's disease. Womack developed diabetes in his later years. It was revealed in March 2012 that Womack was diagnosed with colon cancer after Bootsy Collins reported it on his Facebook page. Womack announced afterwards that he was to undergo cancer surgery. On May 24, 2012, it was announced that Womack's surgery to remove a tumor from his colon was successful and he was declared cancer free. On January 1, 2013, Womack admitted that he struggled to remember his songs and other people's names, and later he was diagnosed with early stages of Alzheimer's disease. ==Death== Womack died at his home in Tarzana, California at the age of 70 on June 27, 2014. He was cremated, and his ashes were interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California, in The Great Mausoleum, Memorial Terrace, Memorial Terrace Columbarium.Resting Places ==Awards and nominations== In 2009, Womack was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. However, his original vocal group, his brothers, The Valentinos (Friendly Womack, Jr., Curtis Womack, Harry Womack and Cecil Womack), were not inducted with him. In 2011, Womack received his first Grammy nomination for Best Short-Form Music Video for \\"Stylo\\" shared with Mos Def & Gorillaz. ==Discography== *Fly Me to the Moon (1969) *My Prescription (1970) *Communication (1971) *Understanding (1972) *Facts of Life (1973) *Lookin' for a Love Again (1974) *I Don't Know What the World Is Coming To (1975) *Safety Zone (1975) *BW Goes C&W; (1976) *Home Is Where the Heart Is (1976) *Pieces (1978) *Roads of Life (1979) *The Poet (1981) *The Poet II (1984) *So Many Rivers (1985) *Someday We'll All Be Free (1985) *Womagic (1986) *The Last Soul Man (1987) *Save the Children (1989) *Resurrection (1994) *Back to My Roots (1999) *Traditions (1999) *The Bravest Man in the Universe (2012) == References * *Bobby Womack interview by Pete Lewis, 'Blues & Soul' August 1994 (republished June 2008) *Soul Patrol Biography *Soulwalking website *Bobby Womack Interview 2011 *Wax Poetics Interview * Category:1944 births Category:2014 deaths Category:African-American guitarists Category:African-American male singers Category:African-American record producers Category:Record producers from Ohio Category:African-American songwriters Category:American acoustic guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American baritones Category:American funk guitarists Category:American funk singers Category:American rhythm and blues singer-songwriters Category:American soul guitarists Category:American soul singers Category:Jay Boy artists Category:Musicians from Cleveland Category:People with Alzheimer's disease Category:Rhythm guitarists Category:Minit Records artists Category:United Artists Records artists Category:Columbia Records artists Category:Arista Records artists Category:Capitol Records artists Category:MCA Records artists Category:SOLAR Records artists Category:Songwriters from Ohio Category:The Valentinos members Category:Guitarists from Ohio Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:Burials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale) ","title":"Bobby Womack"},{"id":"517148","text":"The Uncompahgre River is a tributary of the Gunnison River, approximately 75 mi (121 km) long, in southwestern Colorado in the United States. Lake Como at 12,215 ft (3723m) in northern San Juan County, in the Uncompahgre National Forest in the northwestern San Juan Mountains is the headwaters of the river. It flows northwest past Ouray, Ridgway, Montrose, and Olathe and joins the Gunnison at Confluence Park in Delta. The river forms Poughkeepsie Gulch and the Uncompahgre Gorge. The major tributaries are all creeks draining the northwest San Juan Mountains. There are two dams on the Uncompahgre River, a small diversion dam in the Uncompahgre Gorge, and Ridgway Dam below the town of Ridgway which forms Ridgway Reservoir. The river is used for irrigation in the Uncompahgre Valley. Additionally, water from the Gunnison is diverted to the valley via the Gunnison Tunnel. The Uncompahgre is unnavigable except at high water. The name Uncompahgre () comes from the Ute word Uncompaghre, which loosely translates to \\"dirty water,\\" \\"red lake,\\" or \\"red water spring\\" and is likely a reference to the many hot springs in the vicinity of Ouray.In the journal of Francisco Silvestre V√©lez de Escalante's 1776 expedition, the author states that the Native American name for the river was Ancapagari, which translated to Spanish as Laguna Colorado and referred to a hot, bad tasting, red lake from which its waters came. The Spanish name for the river at that time was Rio de San Francisco, apparently so named by explorer Juan Maria de Rivera on one of his two earlier expeditions (1761 and 1765). ==See also== *List of rivers of Colorado *List of tributaries of the Colorado River ==References== Category:Gunnison River Category:Rivers of Colorado Category:Rivers of Ouray County, Colorado Category:Rivers of San Juan County, Colorado Category:Tributaries of the Colorado River in Colorado Category:Colorado Western Slope ","title":"Uncompahgre River"},{"id":"517155","text":"Sky Dream Fukuoka, September 2009 Sky Dream and the Evergreen Marinoa at Night, January 2006 was a Ferris wheel which operated at Evergreen Marinoa in the city of Fukuoka, Japan, from 2001 until September 2009.

Signature songs include a quartet of major 1966 chart hits\\"Just Like Me\\" (late 1965 debut), \\"Kicks\\" (ranked no. 400 on Rolling Stones list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time), \\"Hungry\\" and \\"Good Thing\\"and \\"Him Or Me ‚Äì What's It Gonna Be?\\" (1967). Plus the platinum-certified 1971 comeback no. 1 \\"Indian Reservation\\", credited to simply 'Raiders'. ==HistoryEarly years=== Initially based in Boise, Idaho, the Raiders began as an instrumental rock band led by organist and founder Paul Revere Dick (1938‚Äì2014).Paul Revere & The Raiders Biography .

The band relocated to Portland, Oregon, when Revere returned from serving in the armed forces in 1962.Stax, Mike. \\"Optical Sound: The Technicolor Tales Behind the Numerous Nuggets\\" (track-by-track booklet liner notes). Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965‚Äì1968 (4-CD Box Set). Rhino 1998, p. 58. In his early 20s, Revere owned several restaurants in Caldwell, Idaho, and first met singer Mark Lindsay (b. 1942) while picking up hamburger buns from the bakery where Lindsay worked. The circumstance of their meeting was later referred to in the tongue-in-cheek song \\"Legend of Paul Revere\\", recorded by the group. Lindsay joined Revere's band in 1958. Originally called the Downbeats, they changed their name to Paul Revere & the Raiders in 1960 on the eve of their first record release for Gardena Records. The band garnered their first hit in the Pacific Northwest in 1961, with the instrumental \\"Like, Long Hair\\". The record had enough national appeal that it peaked at no. 38 on the Billboard Hot 100 on April 17, 1961. When Revere was drafted for military service, he became a conscientious objector and worked as a cook at a mental institution for a year and a half of deferred service. During the same time period, Lindsay pumped gas in Wilsonville, Oregon. On the strength of their Top 40 single, Lindsay toured the U.S. in the summer of 1961 with a band that featured Leon Russell taking Revere's place on piano. By summer 1962, Revere and Lindsay were working together again in Oregon with a version of the Raiders that featured Mike \\"Smitty\\" Smith (b. 1942), a drummer who would spend two extended periods with the band. Around this time, KISN DJ Roger Hart, who was producing teen dances, was looking for a band to hire. Hart had a casual conversation with a bank teller who told him about a band called \\"Paul Revere- something\\". Hart obtained Revere's phone number and they met for lunch. Hart hired the band for one of his teen dances. Soon afterward, Hart became the group's personal manager. It was Hart who suggested they record \\"Louie Louie\\", for which Hart paid them about $50, producing the song and placing it on his Sandƒì label, ultimately attracting the attention of Columbia Records. According to Lindsay, the Raiders were a \\"bunch of white-bread kids doing their best to sound black. We got signed to Columbia on the strength of sounding like this.\\" Whether the Raiders or the Kingsmen recorded \\"Louie Louie\\" first is not certain; however, both groups recorded it in the same studio NorthWestern Motion Pictures and Sound Recordings, Inc. (NWI) in Portland, Oregon, in April 1963.The date on the master tape of the Kingsmen version was April 6, 1963, according to Dick Peterson in his book Louie Louie, Me Gotta Go (p. 45). Peter Blecha states in his 2009 book Sonic Boom! The History of Northwest Rock (p. 137) that the probable date of the Raiders recording was April 13, 1963. Following the death of Kingsmen singer Jack Ely, Mark Lindsay tweeted on April 28, 2015, \\"To settle it once and for all: Jack Ely/The Kingsmen recorded Louie Louie 3 days BEFORE the Raiders.\\" See additional citations at the Louie Louie page. By then, the Raiders included Revere, Lindsay, Smith, guitarist Drake Levin, and bassist Mike \\"Doc\\" Holliday, who was replaced in early 1965 by Phil Volk. ===Hits and promotion in the \\"Action\\" era=== Where the Action Is photo of Dick Clark with the group in 1966. Front L‚ÄìR: Paul Revere, Clark, and Mike Smith. Back L‚ÄìR: Drake Levin, Phil Volk, and Mark Lindsay. In 1965 the Raiders began recording a string of garage rock classics. Under the guidance of producer Terry Melcher, the group relocated to Los Angeles and increasingly emulated the sounds of British Invasion bands such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Dave Clark Five, and the Animals, while adding an American, R&B; feel. Their first major national hit, \\"Just Like Me\\" (no. 11, 1965) was one of the first rock records to feature a distinctive, double-tracked guitar solo, performed by guitarist Drake Levin. The band appeared regularly in the U.S. on national television, most notably on Dick Clark's Where the Action Is, Happening '68, and It's Happening, the latter two co-hosted by Revere and Lindsay. In November 1966, the band appeared as themselves performing a song on the popular Batman television series in the episode \\"Hizzonner the Penguin\\". The Raiders had an endorsement deal with the Vox Amplifier Company through its U.S. distributor, the Thomas Organ Co., with Revere using the Vox Continental combo organ and Volk occasionally playing the Vox Phantom IV bass. When performing, the entire band was plugged into Vox Super Beatle amplifiers. The band was reported to be the first major band in history to tour with all members amplified, including sidemen such as horn players. When Levin left the group in 1966 to join the National Guard he was replaced by Jim Valley, another Northwest musician the Raiders had met during their days playing the Portland and Seattle music circuits. Valley was dubbed \\"Harpo\\" by the other Raiders due to a vague resemblance to the famous Marx brother. Their hits from this period include \\"Kicks\\" (no. 4 on Billboard's Hot 100), \\"Hungry\\" (no. 6), \\"The Great Airplane Strike\\" (no. 20), \\"Good Thing\\" (no. 4) and \\"Him or Me ‚Äì What's It Gonna Be?\\" (no. 5). Of these, \\"Kicks\\" emerged as their best-known hit ‚Äì a hip-sounding record with an anti-drug message, written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil and originally earmarked for the Animals. (Mann later revealed in interviews that the song was written about their friend, fellow 1960s songwriter Gerry Goffin, whose ongoing drug problems were interfering with his career and his relationship with then wife Carole King.) In mid-1967, with three gold albums to their credit, the Raiders were Columbia's top-selling rock group; their Greatest Hits was one of two releases selected by Clive Davis to test a higher list price for albums expected to be particularly popular (along with Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits). Quentin Tarantino's 2019 film Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood, set in 1969, features three of the band's hit singles ‚Äì \\"Hungry\\" (1966), \\"Good Thing\\" (1966) and \\"Mr. Sun, Mr. Moon\\" (1969) ‚Äì and the 1968 B-side \\"Theme From It's Happening\\". ===Major lineup change=== At the height of the group's popularity, Valley, Volk, and Smith left the band. The split happened for a number of reasons, among them being the feeling that the group was prevented from evolving into a more egalitarian creative team, upset at being replaced by studio musicians on recordings (Volk denies this and says that The Wrecking Crew were hired by Melcher and Lindsay only to augment the band) and unhappy with a continued teen-oriented direction while a more serious rock 'n' roll style was emerging. The first to leave was Valley, who then embarked on a solo career. Drake Levin rejoined the band on guitar to finish the spring 1967 tour. Levin, Volk, and Smith flew to New York together when the Raiders were booked to perform on The Ed Sullivan Show. Revere was upset about Valley, Volk, and Smith leaving the group, blaming Levin for their departures. Levin showed up at the Ed Sullivan Theater to perform with Volk and Smith for the very last time, but Revere refused to allow Levin to play.Phil Volk interview, October 19, 2009, Greg Martin Radio Show. Unbeknownst to the group, Revere had hired a new guitar player, Freddy Weller, to perform that night. Levin held no grudges about this; he showed Weller the chords to the songs and watched from the wings as the Raiders made their one and only appearance on Sullivan's show on April 30, 1967. It was the only time that the lineup of Revere, Lindsay, Smith, Volk, and Weller performed together. The following month, Volk and Smith left, subsequently rejoining Levin to form a band called \\"Brotherhood\\". Charlie Coe, who had played guitar for the group in 1963, rejoined the band on bass, and Joe Correro, Jr. was recruited as the new drummer. ===The \\"Happening\\" era=== Changing tastes in the late 1960s rendered the group unfashionable, but they still continued to have modest hits through the rest of the decade, including \\"Ups and Downs\\", \\"I Had a Dream\\", \\"Too Much Talk\\", \\"Don't Take It So Hard\\", \\"Cinderella Sunshine\\", \\"Mr. Sun, Mr. Moon\\", and \\"Let Me\\", which became their first gold record. On January 6, 1968, just four months after the cancellation of Where The Action Is, Revere and Lindsay returned to the air as hosts of a new Dick Clark- produced show in which the Raiders made several appearances, Happening '68 (later shortened to Happening). This weekly series was joined from July to September that year by a Clark-produced daily series It's Happening, also hosted by Revere and Lindsay. In August 1968, bassist Coe left the group again to get married; he was replaced by former Action heartthrob Keith Allison. According to author Derek Taylor, the Raiders were seen as \\"irrelevances. . . . Nervous citizens felt reassured that some good safe things never changed\\". Mark Lindsay took more control of the band during this time. He produced all records beginning with Too Much Talk in 1968 and the psychedelic album Something Happening. Lindsay's vision was represented on songs such as \\"Let Me\\" and the albums Hard 'N' Heavy (with marshmallow) and Alias Pink Puzz. (According to allmusic.com, Pink Puzz was the identity under which the Raiders first tried to get the album played on FM radio, a gambit that failed though the band kept the joke name for the album title.) The success of \\"Let Me\\" allowed Paul Revere and the Raiders to tour Europe with the Beach Boys in the summer of 1969 (they also recorded two songs for the long running German music program Beat-Club at this time). Happening ended its run that autumn. Also in 1969, the band performed a specially written song and appeared in a television commercial for Pontiac's new GTO sports car, \\"The Judge\\". ===The Raiders: early 1970s=== In an effort to change the bands' sound and image, the name was officially shortened to The Raiders (shown simply as Raiders on the singles), while the 1970 album Collage was an attempt to move in another musical direction. It drew a glowing review from Rolling Stone magazine, with critic Lenny Kaye singling out Lindsay for praise: \\"[He] never fails to give the impression that he knows what he's doing. Almost single-handedly, he's brought the Raiders to a stronger position than they've occupied in years\\". Collage proved to be a commercial failure (#154 on the Billboard 200) and Lindsay began to turn toward solo projects. Joe Correro departed after their spring tour ended, to be replaced by his predecessor Mike Smith. The Raiders achieved their biggest 1970s success with their cover of John D. Loudermilk's \\"Indian Reservation\\", which was brought to the group by Columbia A&R; man while they were working on an album. Revere worked heavily to promote the single, and \\"Indian Reservation\\" peaked at number one for one week in July 1971.Bronson, Fred, The Billboard Book of Number One Hits, Billboard Publications, Inc. 1985; . It became Columbia's biggest-selling single for almost a decade, clearing over six million units. The success of the single was followed by the album of the same name that reached No. 19 and consisted mainly of covers. The group expanded to include drummer Omar Martinez and keyboardist Bob Wooley. In 1972, the Raiders' last attempt at a pop album, Country Wine, failed to crack the Billboard 200. Later that year, they began preparation on what was to be their fourth album in two years, Love Music. The intended title track was released as a promotion for the project, but it reached only #97, marking the Raiders' final chart appearance and the album being shelved by Columbia. The band's presence dwindled and they were relegated to playing lounges and state fairs as an \\"oldies\\" act, a situation Revere found pleasing, but not Lindsay. Weller and Smith departed in December 1972, Weller being replaced by guitarist Doug Heath. ===The later 1970s=== Lineup changes ensued in early 1975, with Mark Lindsay departing the band after a gig at Knott's Berry Farm. Lindsay continued his solo career, having previously landed a hit single in late 1969 with Kenny Young's \\"Arizona\\". After two final singles for Warner Bros. records in 1977, Mark turned his attentions to film scoring and commercials. He was also head of A&R; (artists & repertoire) for United Artists Records in the 1970s. Keith Allison departed in April 1975, to be replaced by current Raider bassist Ron Foos.\\" Country music was the choice of former guitarist Freddy Weller, who had much success on the country charts before, starting with his country version of Joe South's \\"Games People Play\\" in 1969 reaching no. 2 on the country charts as well as recording albums (his first two solo albums were produced by Mark Lindsay), and Top 10 singles on the country singles charts such as his covers of Chuck Berry's \\"Promised Land\\", the Cowsills' \\"Indian Lake\\", as well as \\"These Are Not My People\\" and \\"Another Night of Love\\" for Columbia during this time while with the Raiders, as well as after leaving the Raiders. (Freddy's stint was 1967‚Äì1973.) In a memorable event, Revere married for the second time on July 4, Bicentennial Year 1976 onstage at a Raiders show. Revere announced his retirement from the music business at the end of 1976, but was back on the road by 1978 with a new cast of Raiders. Along with guitarist Doug Heath, Revere linked in this period with a group called \\"Louie Fontaine & the Rockets\\", and went on the road with them as \\"Paul Revere & the Raiders\\", featuring Blair Hill (\\"Louie Fontaine\\") as lead vocalist. This configuration even appeared as \\"Paul Revere's Raiders\\" without Paul, for a while in 1978. The quintet of Paul Revere, Mark Lindsay, Drake Levin, Phil Volk, and Mike Smith reunited for Dick Clark on national television in 1979 and performed a medley of their biggest hits. The same year \\"Indian Reservation\\" was covered by the German group Orlando Riva Sound.Paul Revere and the Raiders , Classicwebs.com; retrieved November 11, 2012. ===The 1980s to 2014=== Paul Revere in 2007 The punk rock and new wave eras saw a wave of interest in the Raiders' music; \\"I'm Not Your Stepping Stone\\" was covered by the Sex Pistols, Minor Threat, and Liverpool band the Farm (although the Monkees' cover version was better known than the Raiders' original), and later \\"Just Like Me\\" was covered by the Circle Jerks, Joan Jett and Pat Benatar. David Bowie covered \\"Louie, Go Home\\". In 1964, the Who took the song and changed the title and lyrics to \\"Lubie (Come Back Home)\\" in 1965. \\"Hungry\\" was covered by Sammy Hagar. The Flamin' Groovies tackled three Raiders songs (\\"Him or Me, What's it Gonna Be?\\", \\"Sometimes\\" and \\"Ups and Downs\\") and The Morrells did a country-tinged arrangement of \\"Ups and Downs\\" as well. The Paisley Underground, garage rock revival, and grunge movements all acknowledged the Raiders' influence. \\"Kicks\\" was also covered by Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork of the Monkees as one of three new recordings included on their 1986 compilation, Then & Now... The Best of The Monkees. Mark Lindsay cut a version of \\"Ups And Downs\\" in 1994 with Carla Olson, which appeared on her Reap The Whirlwind album. Revere continued with a relatively stable lineup through the 80's and 90's, featuring longtime members Omar Martinez (drums and vocals since 1972), Doug Heath (guitarist for the Raiders since 1973), Ron Foos (bass, Allison's replacement in 1975), and lead vocalist Carlo Driggs (who replaced Michael Bradley). Occasional new record releases included the self-produced \\"Special Edition\\" in 1983, with Michael Bradley on vocals, and \\"Paul Revere Rides Again\\", released in 1983 through Radio Shack stores. They also recorded a home video for MCA Universal in 1996 titled \\"The Last Madman of Rock 'N' Roll\\". Revere's son Jamie joined the band on guitar for several years in the 1990s, featured on \\"Generic Rock & Roll\\" (1992) and \\"Generic Rock 2\\" (1996). On September 19, 1997, the group's classic 1966 Midnight Ride lineup (singer Mark Lindsay, guitarist Drake Levin, bassist Phil \\"Fang\\" Volk and drummer Mike \\"Smitty\\" Smith) reunited in full costume (though without Revere himself) for a 30th anniversary performance in Portland. In 2000 Sundazed Records released a two-CD package entitled Mojo Workout that focused on the R&B; and soul sounds from early in the Raiders' Columbia career. In 2001, the Raiders released \\"Ride to the Wall\\", featuring several new songs, along with their versions of 1960s hits, with proceeds going to help veterans of the Vietnam War. They performed at Rolling Thunder's Memorial Day event in Washington D.C. in 2001 for POW-MIA's of the Vietnam era. A steady touring schedule kept Paul and his \\"new Raiders\\" in the public eye. Keith Allison, who played in the Raiders from 1968 to 1975, has since gone into acting, and appeared in the film Gods and Generals.; accessed September 13, 2015. On October 13, 2007, Paul Revere & the Raiders were officially inducted, along with their manager Roger Hart, into the Oregon Music Hall of Fame. In attendance were Mark Lindsay, Phil \\"Fang\\" Volk, and Roger Hart to accept their awards. In 2010, the band was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame. Revere announced his retirement from the band in August 2014; the group planned to tour without him as \\"Paul Revere's Raiders\\". In October 2014, the band's web site announced that Revere had died \\"peacefully\\" on October 4, 2014, at his Garden Valley, Idaho home, a \\"small estate overlooking a tranquil river canyon\\", from cancer. He was 76 years old. On October 10, 2014 at the Los Angeles Forum, Tom Petty performed \\"I'm Not Your Stepping Stone\\", dedicating it to Paul Revere, acknowledging his passing that week. ===Former Raiders and legacy=== Phil Volk tours with his own band, Fang and the Gang. Since 1967, he has been married to Where The Action Is regular Tina Mason. After leaving the Raiders in 1967, Jim Valley continued to perform and hone his songwriting skills in a variety of acts. He was signed as a solo artist by Dunhill Records and released two singles. He subsequently moved back to his native Northwest, playing with several rock acts including Sweet Talking Jones and the Shoestring Orchestra & Choir. He became an acclaimed and award-winning children's music artist and educator, traveling the world as an emissary of the \\"Rainbow Planet\\". Valley continues to work with children, write and record his own albums, as well as perform live. Joe Correro Jr., the Raiders' drummer from 1967 to 1971, performs as part of the Los Angeles-based Richard Sherman Trio jazz combo. Bassist Mike \\"Doc\\" Holiday and guitarist/bassist Charlie Coe made a special guest appearance with Mark Lindsay at a show in Boise, Idaho in 1996. They both reside in Idaho. Righteous Brothers Bill Medley's son, Darrin, sang and performed with Paul Revere & the Raiders. Another Darren, Darren Dowler, followed Darrin Medley as lead vocalist of the Raiders. Coincidentally, Darren Dowler also sang with Darrin Medley's father's group, the Righteous Brothers Band singing the parts formerly sung by tenor, recording great Bobby Hatfield. Dowler, the current vocalist, has also performed with the Lettermen, the Jordanaires, the Fifth Dimension, Gary Puckett, Mitch Ryder and was the first guitarist for the Backstreet Boys in 1991 before they hit mega stardom. Dowler, also an actor and filmmaker, appeared in such films as Eagle Eye with Billy Bob Thornton and Hancock with Will Smith. In 2014 he starred in, wrote, and directed the films Rock and Roll the Movie and Christmas In Hollywood. In 2014, Revere commissioned Dowler to compose an album of original songs for a new Raider album, the first all original album in 35 years. After ending his second stint with the Raiders in 1972, drummer Mike \\"Smitty\\" Smith moved to Kona, Hawaii and continued performing for several groups in that region. Smith died of natural causes on March 6, 2001, three weeks before his 59th birthday.Portland Tribune and Community Newspapers , Portlandtribune.com; retrieved November 11, 2012.

Carl \\"Carlo\\" Driggs, Paul Revere & the Raiders' longest-serving lead singer (a 20-year-plus span), was formerly lead vocalist for Kracker, a band that toured Europe as an opening act for (and had their albums distributed outside America by) the Rolling Stones. He followed this with his tenure in the Latin/disco group Foxy, who scored a no. 1 hit on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart (no. 9 on Billboard's Hot 100) with \\"Get Off\\", which was co- written by Driggs. On May 31, 2017, Driggs died of a heart attack at his home in Miami, Florida, at the age of 67. Paul Revere & the Raiders feature heavily in the soundtrack of Quentin Tarantino's 2019 comedy-drama Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, namely the tracks \\"Hungry\\", \\"Mr. Sun, Mr. Moon\\" and \\"Good Thing\\", with the latter appearing in the film's official trailer. They are also named in the picture's dialogue, with Sharon Tate (portrayed by Margot Robbie) asking Jay Sebring (portrayed by Emile Hirsch): \\"Aww, what's the matter? You afraid I'll tell Jim Morrison you were dancing to Paul Revere & The Raiders? Are they not cool enough for you?\\" ==MembersCurrent members=== *Doug Heath ‚Äì guitar (1973‚Äì1977, 1978‚Äì1979, 1980‚Äìpresent) *Ron Foos ‚Äì bass, guitar (1975‚Äì1977, 1980‚Äìpresent) *Danny

Dolbear researched electrical spark conversion into sound waves and electrical impulses. He was a professor at University of Kentucky in Lexington from 1868 until 1874. In 1874 he became the chair of the physics department at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. He is known for his 1882 invention of a system for transmitting telegraph signals without wires. In 1899 his patent for it was purchased in an unsuccessful attempt to interfere with Guglielmo Marconi's wireless telegraphy patents in the United States. ==Biography== Dolbear was a graduate of Ohio Wesleyan University, in Delaware, Ohio. While a student at Ohio Wesleyan, he had made a \\"talking telegraph\\" and invented a receiver containing two features of the modern telephone: a permanent magnet and a metallic diaphragm that he made from a tintype. He invented the first telephone receiver with a permanent magnet in 1865, 11 years before Alexander Graham Bell patented his model. Later, Dolbear couldn't prove his claim, so Bell kept the patent. Dolbear lost his case before the U. S. Supreme Court, (Dolbear et al. v. American Bell Telephone Company). The June 18, 1881 edition of Scientific American reported: : \\"had [Dolbear] been observant of patent office formalities, it is possible that the speaking telephone, now so widely credited to Mr. Bell would be garnered among his own laurels.\\" In 1876, Dolbear patented a magneto electric telephone. He patented a static telephone in 1879. In 1882, Dolbear was able to communicate over a distance of a quarter of a mile without wires in the Earth. His device relied on conduction in the ground, which was different from later radio transmissions that used electromagnetic radiation. He received a U.S. patent for a wireless telegraph in March of that year. His set-up used phones grounded by metal rods poked into the earth. His transmission range was at least as much as a half a mile\\"Mode of Electric communication\\" October 5, 1886. Lines 51-55. and he received a patent for this device, , in 1886. (He did not patent his system in Europe.) In 1899, The New England Wireless Telegraph and Telephone Company, a subsidiary of the American Wireless Telephone and Telegraph Company, purchased Dolbear's 1886 patent, and filed a suit against Marconi for infringement.\\"A Suit Against Marconi\\", Washington Times, October 18, 1899, page 4. However, in March, 1901 a United States Circuit Court dismissed the suit.\\"Suit Against Marconi Dismissed\\", New-York Daily Tribune, March 23, 1901, page 7. In April, 1902, American Wireless petitioned Congress to extend the 1886 patent by ten years, but was unsuccessful, so it duly expired on October 4, 1903.\\"Petition of the American Wireless Telegraph and Telegraph Company, of Philadelphia, Pa., Praying the Extension for Ten Years of Letters Patent No. 350,299, Being the Basic Patent for the Art of Wireless Telegraphy and Telephony Granted to Amos Emerson Dolbear in 1886\\", United States Senate Documents, Volume 26 (4245), 57th Congress, 1st Session, Document No. 346, pages 1-3. In 1905, the New York Circuit Court further noted that the Dolbear patent was \\"inoperative, and that, even if operative, it operates by virtue of radically different electrical laws and phenomena\\" than the radio signaling used by Marconi.\\"Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. of America v. De Forest Wireless Telegraph Co. (Circuit Court, S. D. New York. April 11, 1905.)\\", The Federal Reporter. Volume 138. Cases Argued and Determined in the Circuit Courts of Appeals and Circuit and District Courts of the United States. July‚ÄìSeptember, 1905, page 668. In 1868 Dolbear (while a professor at Bethany College) invented the electrostatic telephone. He also invented the opeidoscope (an instrument for visualizing vibration of sound waves, using a mirror mounted on a membrane) and a system of incandescent lighting. He authored several books, articles, and pamphlets, and was recognized for his contributions to science at both the Paris Exposition in 1881 and the Crystal Palace Exposition in 1882. In 1897, Dolbear published an article \\"The Cricket as a Thermometer\\" that noted the correlation between the ambient temperature and the rate at which crickets chirp. The formula expressed in that article became known as Dolbear's Law. ==Publications== ;Books * The Art of Projecting, Boston, 1876 * The Speaking Telephone, 1877 * Sound and its Phenomena, 1885 * Matter, Ether, and Motion, Boston, 1892 * First Principles of Natural Philosophy, Boston, 1897 * Modes of Motion, Boston, 1897 ;Journal articles * \\"The Cricket as a Thermometer\\".

Her folk-inflected compositions alternate between ironic, story-driven character studies and emotive ballads, a duality reminiscent of such 1970s American songwriters as Warren Zevon, Harry Nilsson, Loudon Wainwright III, Harry Chapin, and Randy Newman. Autobiographical elements, including Sobule's Jewish heritage and her adolescent battles with anorexia and depression, frequently occur in Sobule's writing. In 2009, she released an album funded entirely by fan donations, one of the early pioneers of crowdfunding. ==History and studio recordings== To date Sobule has released eight studio albums of original songs, four EPs, and a greatest hits compilation album. Sobule's output also includes original songs available only via the Internet, a cover of Robert Earl Keen's Christmas novelty track \\"Merry Christmas from the Family,\\" and a version of the late Warren Zevon's \\"Don't Let Us Get Sick\\" included on both Sobule's acoustic album and on a posthumous Zevon tribute record. ===1990s=== Sobule's debut album Things Here Are Different was released in 1990. Produced by pop legend Todd Rundgren, the album failed to sell. During this period a follow-up record was produced by British New Wave rocker Joe Jackson (for whom she opened during 1991) but Sobule was dropped from her label and the second record was never released. It was five years before Sobule landed another recording contract. Her 1995 album Jill Sobule established Sobule as part of a fruitful mid-90s movement of female singer-songwriters that included such artists as Lisa Loeb, Juliana Hatfield and Alanis Morissette. The album contains Sobule's best-known composition \\"I Kissed a Girl\\", a story-song about a lesbian flirtation between two suburban girlfriends which became an unlikely radio success thanks in part to a comedic music video featuring beefcake male model Fabio. \\"Supermodel\\" (sample lyric: \\"I didn't eat yesterday ... and I'm not gonna eat today ... and I'm not gonna eat tomorrow ... 'Cause I'm gonna be a supermodel\\") managed to both send up and celebrate American teenage lifestyles, and became well known after its inclusion in 1995's hit teen comedy film Clueless. The Jill Sobule album seemed to establish Sobule's commercial prospects, but her third album slowed that momentum while setting what has so far been the musical and production patterns for the rest of her career. 1997's Happy Town featured Sobule's most elaborate pop productions to date and contains songs about an eclectic range of topics including reactionary Christianity (\\"Soldiers of Christ\\"), the negative impact of anti- depressant medication on the libido (\\"Happy Town\\"), and a track that uses Anne Frank's enforced Nazi-era hibernation as the metaphor for a love song (\\"Attic\\"). Though embraced by record reviewers from publications as diverse as The Advocate and Entertainment Weekly, Happy Town sold poorly, simultaneously solidifying Sobule's critical reputation while stalling her commercial momentum. ===2000s=== The 2000 record Pink Pearl may be Sobule's most characteristic set. Anchored by the female character studies \\"Lucy at the Gym\\" (about an anorexic exercise addict), \\"Claire\\" (about an aging lesbian aviator succumbing to Alzheimer's disease) and \\"Mary Kay\\" about Mary Kay Letourneau, the notorious real-life schoolteacher who became impregnated and imprisoned as the result of the statutory rape of a 13-year-old male student, whom she married when he reached the age of consent. Pink Pearl also contains some of Sobule's most directly confessional songwriting, especially the atheist's prayer \\"Somewhere in New Mexico\\" and the insomniac's lullaby \\"Rock Me To Sleep\\". Don Henley contributed a promotional quotation to the ad campaign for the album and selected Sobule to open for him during his solo tour that year. In 2004, Sobule self-released an independent album of demo-quality acoustic tracks titled The Folk Years 2003‚Äì2003. In addition to some of her rarer compositions and several tracks that would later receive fuller arrangements on Sobule's next major-label release, Sobule performed offbeat cover versions of such standards as the old Doris Day theme song \\"Que Sera Sera\\" and \\"Sunrise/Sunset\\" from the Broadway musical Fiddler on the Roof. 2004's more elaborately recorded Underdog Victorious was one of the last albums distributed by legendary personal manager and media entrepreneur Danny Goldberg's now-defunct Artemis Records. The liquidation of Artemis Records led Sobule to extend her experiments with online music distribution and to relocate from New York City to Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, she has continued to write and perform prolifically and to compose original music for television, including for the popular Nickelodeon series Unfabulous. In mid- January 2008, Sobule launched a website, jillsnextrecord.com, which sought to raise $75,000 through fan donations in order to produce, manufacture, distribute and promote an upcoming studio album. In exchange for their donations, Sobule offered her patrons an assortment of gifts with values commensurate with the amount of the donation. These gifts ranged from a free download of the album upon its release ($10) to the opportunity to attend a recording session and sing on the record ($10,000). On March 8, 2008, 53 days after the public launch of the site, Sobule reached her target through donations from over 500 people in 44 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and eleven foreign countries. The subsequent album, California Years, was released on April 14, 2009 on Sobule's own label, Pinko Records. Sobule released \\"Dottie's Charms\\" in 2014, in which she put music to lyrics of her friends and favorite authors including David Hajdu, Jonathan Lethem, Vendela Vida, and Luc Sante. In 2018, Sobule once again used crowd funding to assist with the production of her next album, \\"Nostalgia Kills\\". Rolling Stone listed Sobule's first single from the album, \\"Island of Lost Things\\", as one of the 'best country & americana songs you need to hear right now'. ==Music== Jill Sobule and Lloyd Cole during a concert in Seattle, Washington in 2005 Sobule uses both satire and personal experience to sing about a range of issues, including sexuality, depression, war, abandonment, and greed. According to her website bio, a central preoccupation of her work is the classic one: \\"Love found, love lost, love wished for and love taken away.\\" Many of her songs incorporate humor into their narrative. She often creates detailed character sketches, especially of women. ==Collaborations== Sobule is a prolific collaborator, writing and performing both with other musicians and with artists from nonmusical disciplines, including blogger Arianna Huffington, television producer Sue Rose and comedian Julia Sweeney. Jill Sobule, in 2007, performing at D5 in Carlsbad Caverns In the late 90s, Sobule toured with Richard Barone as \\"The Richard & Jill Show.\\" Together they wrote \\"Bitter\\" on Happy Town, \\"Rock Me To Sleep\\" on Pink Pearl, \\"Big Shoes\\" on I Never Learned to Swim, and \\"Waiting for the Train\\" on Barone's Clouds Over Eden album. They also appeared together (as Mr. and Mrs. Sobule) in the underground film Next Year in Jerusalem, which featured another of their compositions, \\"Everybody's Queer.\\" The pair continue to collaborate, including \\"Odd Girl Out\\" for Barone's 2010 album, Glow (Bar/None Records), and to perform together. Their songs have been used on The West Wing. Felicity, Dawson's Creek, South of Nowhere and other television shows. In 2018, Barone produced and sang backing vocals on \\"Island of Lost Things\\" on Sobule's album Nostalgia Kills. In 1997-1998, Sobule joined Lloyd Cole's short-lived band The Negatives. In 2004, she played one of the five leads in the film Mind The Gap with six of her songs featured on the soundtrack. In 2005, Sobule contributed music to Unfabulous, a popular Nickelodeon TV series about a 13-year-old aspiring songwriter, including a title song performed by Sobule under the program's opening credits. Four Sobule compositions or co-compositions appear on the series star's debut album, Unfabulous and More: Emma Roberts: credits a Roberts cover version of \\"Mexican Wrestler\\" from Sobule's album Pink Pearl; \\"Punch Rocker\\" and \\"94 Weeks (Metal Mouth Freak),\\" both written by Sobule for Roberts' character to \\"compose\\" on the program; and \\"New Shoes,\\" a track co- written by Sobule with Unfabulous series creator Sue Rose. In 2006, Sobule met Julia Sweeney, the actress, writer and comedian, and started performing the \\"Jill and Julia Show\\", a compilation of songs and stories. They performed at the James Randi Educational Foundation meeting in Las Vegas on January 19, 2007, as well as at regular showings for the Groundlings Theater in Los Angeles. Also in 2006, Sobule created a theme song for blogger Arianna Huffington's self-help book On Becoming Fearless. In 2007, Sobule teamed up with John Doe to produce and record a cover of Neil Young's \\"Down by the River\\" for the American Laundromat Records benefit CD Cinnamon Girl ‚Äì Women Artists Cover Neil Young For Charity. Other contributing artists included Lori McKenna, Tanya Donelly, Josie Cotton, Kristin Hersh, Britta Phillips, and The Watsons Twins. Also in 2007, Sobule's song \\"San Francisco\\" became the first single released by Don Was as part of his Wasmopolitan Cavalcade of Recorded Music, an advertiser-sponsored means for the recording and distribution of new music, part of the multimedia website mydamnchannel.com. The pair also collaborated on a 16-minute concert video entitled \\"Jill Sobule's Dance Party,\\" distributed for free in two parts on both mydamnchannel.com and YouTube. In May 2008, Sobule released a CD of music from Prozak and the Platypus, a multi-media collaboration of Sobule, playwright Elise Thoron, and graphic artist KellyAnne Hanrahan. The play, written by Thoron (book, lyrics) and Sobule (music) and illustrated in a graphic novella by Hanrahan, tells the story of a fierce young woman, Sara (a musician) and her father Arvin, a neuroscientist, who relocates his family from Los Angeles to Brisbane, Australia to study REM sleep in the platypus, a unique species native to Australia. Shattered by her mother's recent suicide and unhappy with the side- effects of her own treatment for depression, Sara renames herself \\"Prozak,\\" rages through her songwriting, and rebels. Meanwhile, in her father's lab, Sara finds an unexpected confidant in her father's current lab subject, a jaunty platypus who speaks to her and calls himself \\"Frankie.\\" In the piece, according to its website, \\"Music club and science lab become testing grounds in which angry teen and scientist father pit aboriginal mythology against modern neuroscience research. The dreams of a platypus prove to be the link between the two.\\" Sobule was a frequent guest on National Public Radio's The Bryant Park Project. Her contributions took the form of musical essays offering commentary on contemporary issues, including record-financing in the music industry, the 2007 Writers Guild strike, and the popularity of tarty, uncreative Halloween costumes. Sobule toured twice with the late Warren Zevon, with whom she shares a penchant for sardonic storytelling. The two artists frequently accompanied one another during each other's sets, and Zevon was known on multiple occasions to take the lead vocal on Sobule's \\"I Kissed a Girl\\". Sobule has said that part of their bond came from the fact that she, like Zevon, was best known for a single fluke hit (Zevon's being \\"Werewolves of London\\"). In 2009-10, Sobule performed with Julia Sweeney in a revue called \\"Jill and Julia\\". Sobule and Sweeney originally met at a TED (conference) and performed together at TED in 2008. They brought the show on the road in 2009 and 2010, performing in New York and Denver among other locations. The show is an autobiographical mix of music, stories and commentary. ==Katy Perry's \\"I Kissed a Girl\\"== In 2008, Katy Perry issued her own \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" for her debut album One of the Boys. The song received mixed reviews but skyrocketed to #1. Sobule shared her feelings about Perry's song and use of the title in a July 2009 interview with The Rumpus: Days later, in an article she wrote for The Huffington Post, Sobule stated ==Personal life== Sobule identifies as bisexual. ==DiscographyStudio albums=== *Things Here Are Different (1990) *Jill Sobule (1995) *Happy Town (1997) ‚Äì AUS #83Australian (ARIA) chart peaks: *Top 50 peaks: *Top 100 peaks to December 2010: *\\"Supermodel\\": N.B.

At the same time, the upper house of the legislature, the Legislative Council, was abolished. Both were initially created by the Constitution Act of 1867. It was the Union Nationale government of Premier Jean-Jacques Bertrand that passed the \\"Bill 90\\" legislation to abolish the upper house, but earlier attempts had been made by earlier governments.

When the Assembly was renamed so too was the title of its presiding officer, becoming known as the President. Today, Quebec has a unicameral legislature, whose single house is the National Assembly. The large chamber that housed the assembly is also known as le salon bleu (the blue hall) because of the predominance of the colour on the walls.

It was located approximately 700 metres west of Tottenham railway station. The next station down the line was Sunshine. ==History== The station was opened on 10 December 1927, to serve the new White City greyhound racing track, named after the site of the 1908 London Olympics. The station was originally called Coursing Platform and was renamed White City on 25 August 1929. Workmen's trains from the city began stopping at the station on 10 June 1940, serving employees at local industries, such as the Olympic Tyres factory, but it was not until 28 June 1948, that trains returning to the city stopped at the station, when an afternoon \\"up\\" service was provided from the station's single platform, using the crossover at the up end of the platform. White City was made a regular suburban station in December 1949. The station only ever had one platform, on the westbound track, even though fifty services a week stopped there at its peak. Due to its proximity to Tottenham station, White City's signals were operated from there. In the early 1980s, Tottenham station and its environs underwent extensive alterations. The line was raised in order to eliminate the level crossing at Ashley Street, and a new high-level island platform was provided. As a consequence, it was decided to remove the nearby White City station. On 4 October 1981, White City was officially closed. It was later demolished, and no trace of its existence remains. ==References== ==References== *Victorian Railways signal diagram: West Footscray to Sunshine (1977) Category:Disused railway stations in Melbourne Category:Railway stations in Australia opened in 1927 Category:Railway stations closed in 1981 ","title":"White City railway station"},{"id":"517197","text":"In computing cooperative distributed problem solving is a network of semi- autonomous processing nodes working together to solve a problem, typically in a multi-agent system.

Adams-class guided missile destroyer of the United States Navy notable for action in the Vietnam War. The ship was named in honor of Admiral John Henry Towers. Towers keel was laid down on 1 April 1958 at Seattle, Washington, by the Todd Pacific Shipyards; launched on 23 April 1959; sponsored by Mrs. Nathaniel Rotoreau, Jr.; and commissioned on 6 June 1961 at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, Comdr. L. D. Cummins in command. ==1960s== Homeported at San Diego, California, Towers carried out trials and local operations off the southern California coast into September 1961. She then conducted her shakedown cruise to Callao and Lima, Peru; Balboa, Panama Canal Zone; and Acapulco, Mexico, before she deployed to the Western Pacific (WestPac) for the first time in the early spring of 1962. She arrived at Sydney, Australia, on 30 April to represent the United States during the 20th observance of the anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea and shifted to Melbourne a week later. She then continued her WestPac deployment with visits to Yokosuka and Sasebo, Japan; Buckner Bay, Okinawa; Subic Bay, Philippines; Keeling, Taiwan; and Bangkok, Thailand. She then returned home via Guam and Hawaii. Following a routine schedule of local operations out of San Diego from 1 January to 17 May 1963, Towers departed her home port on 18 May, bound for the Far East. En route, she stopped at Pearl Harbor and Midway and later took part in exercises and operations off Japan and in the Philippines. She returned to San Diego on 28 November 1963 and operated along the southern California coast. May '64 Towers entered dry dock at Hunters Point, San Francisco for a five-month overhaul. Returning to duty in early October she went through weeks of shakedown exercises prior to returning to her home port of San Diego. Towers departed San Diego on 5 January 1965, bound for her third WestPac tour. As American forces became increasingly involved in the Vietnam War, escalating from an advisory capacity to active combat, the Navy's role in Vietnamese coastal waters expanded. Towers participated in three main facets of the U.S. 7th Fleet's operations in the Gulf of Tonkin and the South China Sea. She performed screening and plane- guard duties for fast carrier task forces on Yankee Station, providing protection with her missiles and her rapid-fire 5-inch battery. In addition, she conducted search and rescue (SAR) patrols on the northern station; and made interdiction patrols in conjunction with Operation Market Time. Upon the conclusion of this tour, the guided missile destroyer sailed for home on 10 May. En route to the Hawaiian Islands, she participated in Operation Sailor Hat, a special blast test to determine deficiencies in modern ship construction, and arrived home at San Diego on 26 June. From 31 January to 6 February 1966, Towers participated in Operation Buttonhook, a joint United States and Canadian exercise off the west coast of Canada and the United States which emphasized antisubmarine warfare (ASW) techniques. Following availability at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard during March, Towers took part in Operation Gray Ghost from 12 to 22 April. This exercise dealt with air control intercept tactics and antiaircraft warfare (AAA) measures to prepare the ship for her upcoming deployment to the Gulf of Tonkin, off Vietnam. In addition, the ship trained to become proficient in tactics to utilize against possible motor torpedo (PT) boat attacks. Departing San Diego on 4 June 1966, Towers steamed west, via Pearl Harbor, Guam, and Subic Bay, to Vietnam. She expended some 3,266 rounds of 5-inch ammunition between 2 and 17 July, off target areas which included the \\"Rung Sat Special Zone.\\" Her target assessment included the destruction of 17 enemy buildings and damage to 118 more, the sinking of three sampans, the killing of 11 Viet Cong soldiers, and the destruction of a bridge. The guided missile destroyer returned to Subic Bay for upkeep and further training in PT-boat countermeasures before she returned to the Gulf of Tonkin to take up her position on the northern SAR station on 1 August. For the next month, under the command of Stanley Thomas Counts, she deployed with , keeping on the alert to spot downed pilots and to direct friendly helicopters to the rescue. On 6 August 1966, Towers directed an HU-16 helicopter to the site of a downed aviator some 69 miles from the ship. The next day, Towers directed another HU-16 to a spot behind the enemy-held island of Cac Ba, where two Air Force men had bailed out. The helicopter successfully rescued them from behind communist lines. In the next two weeks, the ship participated in two more rescues‚Äîpicking up two more Air Force pilots in one and a Navy flyer in the other. Towers' most daring rescue came on the last day of her tour on the SARA station. On 31 August 1966, a Navy plane was hit by antiaircraft fire over Haiphong, and the pilot bailed out of his doomed aircraft directly over the enemy harbor. As he floated down under his parachute to face what seemed certain capture, Towers and closed to within visual range of Haiphong harbor. Then King's helicopter sped in under the guidance of Towers' experienced controllers and picked up the pilot, whisking him out of danger from beneath the enemy's very nose. After a brief rest and recreation period, Towers returned to the SAR station again on 1 October 1966. However, flying weather turned out to be poorer at this time of year, and air operations were sharply curtailed. Hence, Towers spent much of her time patrolling the Gulf of Tonkin. Sailing for home on 21 November 1966, Towers departed Yokosuka and ran into heavy seas while en route to the west coast, suffering minor storm damage before she arrived at her home port on 3 December. After operations at sea from January 1967 to mid-March, Towers underwent a major overhaul at Hunters' Point Naval Shipyard from 14 April to 19 October. The guided missile destroyer then operated out of San Diego through the spring of 1968. Towers then readied herself for her next WestPac deployment. Her preparation included screening and shore bombardment exercises with , the world's only active battleship. Departing San Diego on 5 September 1968, Towers made stops at Pearl Harbor and Subic Bay before arriving off the I Corps tactical zone to commence \\"Sea Dragon\\" operations. While escorting and screening New Jersey, Towers knocked out two artillery and three antiaircraft gun sites; destroyed 55 meters of trenches; sank two logistics craft; set off 19 secondary explosions; and killed an estimated 10 enemy soldiers. On 1 October 1968, the ship rescued two downed airmen just south of the demilitarized zone (DMZ). The flyers, Capt. James Spaith, USMC, and his observer, 1st Lt. U.S. Grant, USMC, had been shot down when their Douglas A4F \\"Skyhawk\\" had been hit while spotting gunfire for New Jersey. Following upkeep at Subic Bay, she planeguarded on \\"Yankee Station\\" for and returned to the I Corps operating zone for urgent gunfire support duties. She provided support for Operation Daring Endeavor launched to destroy enemy troop concentrations south of Da Nang. Commended for her part in this action, Towers remained on the scene from 17 to 30 November. She again provided anti-rocket support out of Da Nang from the 21st through the 25th. In addition, she provided gunfire for Korean marines: and the Army's 101st Airborne Division. Towers then sailed north to the Philippines for up keep at Subic Bay before proceeding to Singapore for rest and recreation. She arrived back on \\"Yankee Station\\" three days before Christmas, to assume the role of escort commander for . After two days of this duty, however, the guided missile destroyer was back in the IV Corps operating area on night-harassment fire duties against the communist ground forces. New Year's Day 1969 found the ship still engaging the enemy in the IV Corps' zone, supporting Vietnamese ranger battalions. During this period, Towers' 5-inch rifles wreaked havoc upon Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troop concentrations, bunkers, sampans, and footbridges. The ship then spent a few days at Hong Kong before she returned to the \\"gunline\\", once more at Da Nang. She supported the U.S. 3rd Marine Division, operating north and south of Da Nang, blasting enemy troops and structures, again in support of Korean marines and the 101st Airborne. During the latter period, she again stood duty at Da Nang, her guns ready to reply to communist rocket sites. Towers furnished gunfire support for South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) units in January 1969 and shelled shore targets for the 3rd Marine Division and the 101st Airborne Division, both north and south of Da Nang. From her anchorage inside Da Nang harbor, the guided missile destroyer fired frequent night harassment and counter-rocket site fire against communist positions in the surrounding countryside. Her damage assessments for this duty included destruction of targets such as troop concentrations, bunkers, footbridges, and supply-carrying sampans. Shifting again to \\"Yankee Station\\", Towers joined the screen of on station with TG 77.5 until 7 February. She then sailed for Subic Bay for three days of upkeep before proceeding on to Yokosuka. Departing Japanese waters on 21 February, Towers soon headed east and brought this WestPac deployment to a close when she sailed into San Diego harbor on 4 March 1969. ==1970s== Towers spent much of the year 1970 on routine local operations in the vicinity of her home port in preparation for future WestPac deployments. On 4 September, while conducting refresher training out of San Diego, the ship directed a helicopter to rescue the pilot from an F-8 Crusader that had crashed nearby. The embarked evaluation team from the Fleet Training Group gave the ship a grade of \\"outstanding\\" during this \\"unscheduled evolution.\\" Deploying again to WestPac on 7 January 1971, Towers proceeded to Vietnamese waters, via Pearl Harbor and Midway. While she proceeded west on 20 January, one of the other ships in her convoy, , suffered a major engine room fire which stopped her dead in the water. Towers turned-to and lent a hand. After the fire was extinguished, the guided missile destroyer took Roark in tow until arrived and took over the towing. Towers arrived back on the gunline on 8 February and provided gunfire support until the 21st, when she moved to \\"Yankee Station\\" to provide plane-guard service for . On 6 March, a member of the carrier's flight deck force was blown over the side during launching operations. Towers quickly sped to the scene, rescued the sailor, and returned him to his ship. A short visit to Subic Bay followed, as did another tour on the gunline and the northern SAR station. The ship then returned to Subic Bay for upkeep and then made still another tour as plane guard and screen for . She departed WestPac on 1 July. Arriving at San Diego on the 15th, Towers operated out of her home base into the early spring of 1972. Gunnery exercises, underway training evolutions (with emphasis on ASW and AAW tactics); plane-guarding for ; and an upkeep and inport period all followed as the ship prepared for her upcoming WestPac deployment. Events in Vietnam, however, forced a change in plan for Towers and rapidly accelerated her return to the war zone. Although not scheduled for deployment until September, she departed the west coast on 20 June, bound once more for-the gunline. A massive Viet Cong and North Vietnamese assault had battered South Vietnamese forces in key Quang Tri Province and resulted in emergency measures for the supporting naval forces offshore. During the voyage from the west coast to the South China Sea, the ship assisted in the rescue of six crewmen from a downed B-52 Stratofortress near Guam and received a commendation from the United States Secretary of the Navy. A curtailed two-day upkeep period at Subic Bay preceded the ship's sailing on 13 July for the gunline. Heavy commitments and long hours of gunfire support duty in support of ARVN troops followed from 17 to 28 July as Towers participated in Operation Lamson 72. From 29 July to 5 August, the ship operated on \\"Linebacker\\" strikes against targets to the northward of the DMZ, in North Vietnam, as part of Task Unit 77.1.2. On several occasions during this time, she came under fire from communist shore batteries. The intense gunfire support duties assigned to the ship soon wore out the linings of her two 5-inch guns, so the ship sailed for Sasebo, where she spent the week from 9 to 15 August undergoing a re-gunning. She soon returned to the \\"gunline\\" and supported ARVN troops off Hu·∫ø. The destroyer also fired night \\"Linebacker\\" strikes on 24 and 25 September, rounding out the month with gunfire support missions fired for the 1st ARVN division. A visit to Hong Kong for needed rest and recreation for her crew soon followed, and an upkeep period at Subic Bay preceded the ship's return to Vietnamese waters on 21 October. She supported the ARVN 22d Division near Qui Nhon and around Quang Tri. She then again visited Subic Bay and Kaohsiung, Taiwan, before returning to the gunline again from 3 to 8 December. For the rest of the month, Towers fired gunfire support missions against North Vietnamese troop concentrations near Quang Tri. Spirited exchanges of gunfire with enemy shore batteries took place on numerous occasions during this period. She finished the year 1972 again serving as plane guard for Constellation on \\"Yankee Station\\" and closed out her grueling seven-month deployment on the last day of the year, when she sailed for Yokosuka. From there, she returned home via Midway and Pearl Harbor. This deployment turned out to be the destroyer's last in support of the Vietnam War. The \\"Vietnamization\\" plan placed the burden of self-defense on the shoulders of the South Vietnamese, as American land, sea, and air forces were withdrawn from combat in January and February 1973. Towers returned to San Diego and soon under-went refurbishment at Long Bach shipyards. Towers then operated out of San Diego from 1973 through 1976, pursuing a regular schedule of local operations, routine upkeep and overhaul periods, and underway training evolutions. Towers departed San Diego on 30 July 1976 for her first extended overseas deployment in three years. She conducted exercises and local operations in the western Pacific (WESTPAC) while stationed at Subic Bay Naval Station, Philippines. Towers participated in Exercise \\"Sharkhunt XVII\\" with the Taiwanese Navy and made a port call in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Towers then performed an extended cruise through the busy Strait of Malacca into the Indian Ocean, with port calls to Singapore, Colombo, Sri Lanka and Karachi, Pakistan. While in Columbo the crew of the USS Towers were honored as guests of the European diplomatic community and the U.S. Marines embassy detachment at the coastal European diplomatic recreation center, over-looking the Indian Ocean. While in the Indian Ocean Towers took part in \\"Midlink 76\\" with units of the Iranian, Pakistani, British, and American Navies in mid-November. Towers then returned to the South China Sea where she participated in \\"Multiplex/Missilex-76\\" with other United States 7th Fleet units. Following port visits to Hong Kong from 6 to 12 January and Bangkok, Thailand from 29 January to 4 February 1977, Towers engaged in a coordinated ASW (Anti-Submarine-Warfare) exercise, \\"Sharkhunt XX\\", with the Taiwanese Navy from 22 to 25 February and made a second port call in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. She returned to San Diego via Hawaii on 21 March to complete her seven-month, three-week WESTPAC deployment. Post-deployment operations off the west coast were highlighted by port visits to San Francisco, California and Vancouver, British Columbia, from 9 to 17 July for Vancouver's annual Sea Festival. Towers' last significant operations at sea for the year occurred during the period 12 to 16 September when she conducted naval gunfire support exercises on the range at San Clemente Island. On 23 September, the guided missile destroyer commenced a four-month availability at San Diego which took her into the new year. Post-availability trials commenced on 26 January 1978, and Towers spent the next nine months evaluating her radar detection and tracking system during numerous at-sea operations for that purpose. On 14 November, the ship got underway for Long Beach where she entered the Naval Shipyard on the 15th for commencement of a regular overhaul which took her into 1979. ==1980s== In January 1980, Towers' ships' company received news that the ship's home port would change to Yokosuka, Japan, in October. The crew spent the next nine months preparing for the homeport change, which required passing a series of service inspections, repairing engineering casualties and preparing for overseas deployment. In July, Towers underwent a special availability at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, arriving on the 13th for repairs to her missile launcher system. The repairs only took two weeks since replacement parts were obtained from the decommissioned guided missile cruiser . Departing San Diego on 14 October, Towers sailed for Japan, arriving in Yokosuka via Pearl Harbor on 10 November. Following an upkeep period through 12 December, the warship conducted a short familiarization cruise in Japanese waters until the 19th whereupon she began a holiday leave and upkeep period. After a series of local operations and exercises, including an ASW exercise with Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) warships, Towers sailed to the Middle East in mid-April to relieve guided missile cruiser as radar picket ship in the Persian Gulf. Concluding operations on 14 May, she slowly made her way home, visiting Thailand, Singapore, and Subic Bay, as well as rescuing 138 Vietnamese refugees from three small craft in the South China Sea before putting into Yokosuka on 11 June. Less than a month later, Towers was on hand for another rescue on 4 July, this time picking up 26 survivors from a South Korean freighter that had gone down in bad weather 25 miles east of Hong Kong. A planned restricted availability at Yokosuka followed, during which the yard replaced both propellers as well as the sandblasted and repainted the hull. Maintenance problems hampered the warship over the next few months, but the guided missile destroyer managed to conduct multiple training evolutions with two aircraft carrier battle groups as they transited the area. Towers resumed local operations in early February 1982 with an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercise off Sasebo with JMSDF ships Kurama and Sagami. During the exercise, the warship successfully fired practice torpedoes at submarine . After a cruise to Okinawa and Hong Kong later in the month, Towers joined carrier Midway and the rest of Battle Group Alpha for an operational \\"tune-up\\" prior to Exercise Team Spirit '82 in mid- March. Operations with the battle group continued off and on until 5 May, when the guided missile destroyer shifted to the carrier Ranger Battle Group. Over the next three days she conducted close-in AAW defense and plane guard duties for Ranger during \\"war-at-sea\\" exercises. In company with Reeves, Towers successfully fired two SM-1 missiles before steaming to Subic Bay on 22 May for a two-week upkeep period. Following Naval Gunfire Support (NGFS) qualifications, the guided missile destroyer returned to Yokosuka on 18 June. Following a restricted availability through July 1982, Towers resumed the familiar pattern of operations out of Yokosuka. These included battle group training evolutions with Midway, ASW exercises with Japanese warships as well as investigating and shadowing Soviet warships in the northern Pacific, a regimen that lasted through September. On 12 October, she got underway with Battle Group Alpha for a voyage to the Indian Ocean, stopping at Subic Bay the next day and then sailing for Singapore. While en route, the warship rescued 65 Vietnamese refugees from a small craft in the South China Sea and transferred them to Midway for further processing. The warships then conducted exercises with Singapore naval and air units in late October, visited Pattaya beach, Thailand, in early November, and conducted battle group operations while en route to Japan, arriving at Yokosuka via Hong Kong on 10 December. In mid-January 1983, Towers commenced Team Spirit '83, a joint exercise off South Korea, followed by the periodic Nuclear Weapons Certification inspection. After a short period at Yokosuka (10‚Äì27 February 1983), the warship conducted another set of battle group operations. Unfortunately, during the afternoon watch on 2 March, while en route to Chinhae, Korea, a ruptured steam line in number one fire room inflicted serious injuries on FNs Pino and Jones and BT2 Dyer; all were med-evaced by helicopter to Midway. FN Pino died from his injuries. Towers subsequently returned to Sasebo for repairs between 2‚Äì19 March. Following more battle group operations, the ship returned to Chinhae for a Nuclear Technical Proficiency Inspection (23‚Äì27 March), thereafter participating in FleetEx 83-1, a major northern Pacific exercise involving carriers , and Midway. Gunnery exercises in April, a joint midshipmen cruise with the JMSDF out of Kure and Valiant Usher 83, a combined amphibious assault exercise off the coast of Korea, rounded out the summer. After a maintenance availability in Yokosuka (13‚Äì25 August), Towers sailed south with DesRon 15, bound for the Indian Ocean. During the transit, the guided missile destroyer helped track a Soviet Echo II guided missile submarine and her escorts through the Malacca Straits. On 20 September, she arrived at Diego Garcia to refuel, subsequently transiting to Phuket, Thailand, for a five-day visit. After a stop at Subic Bay on 11 October, the warship supported the final salvage stages of salvage work at the Korean Air Lines Flight 007 crash site (22 October ‚Äì 6 November) before reaching Yokosuka on 9 November. Towers underwent a major overhaul at Yokosuka during most of 1984, receiving the Harpoon anti- ship missile system, improved electronics equipment and major work on boiler tubes and brickwork. Conducting her first sea trials after the overhaul (4‚Äì7 September), she departed Yokosuka ahead of schedule on 17 October for two months of combat systems certification in the Hawaiian operating areas. Following a series of service inspections in January and February 1985, Towers conducted refresher training off South Korea and out of Subic Bay before sailing south for Cobra Gold '85, a joint training exercise with the Thai military held 7‚Äì16 July. During her transit south, Towers rescued another group of Vietnamese refugees, her fourth such humanitarian rescue in her career. Subsequent to Cobra Gold, the guided missile destroyer steamed to the North Arabian Sea via Singapore and Diego Garcia, arriving on station on 4 August. Battle group operations remained fairly quiet, with the warship tasked to track Soviet or Indian aircraft on a periodic basis. Tragedy struck on the night of 7 August, however, when Liberty 603, an E-2C from VAW-115, impacted the water off Midway's flight deck. The search and rescue effort, in which Towers participated, yielded three of the five crew members; Lt.(j.g.) Kevin R. Kuhnigk, USNR, and Ens. Christopher Mims, USNR, however, perished in the mishap. After a \\"war-at-sea\\" exercise in the Indian Ocean, Battle Group Alpha steamed southeast to western Australia, where Towers enjoyed five days of liberty in Geraldton, Australia (13‚Äì19 September). Thereafter, she participated in Valiant Usher '85, a joint exercise with Australian forces, and AnnualEx 85, a joint U.S.-Japanese operation, before reaching Yokosuka on 15 October. After a series of local operations and individual ship exercises, Towers participated in Exercise Team Spirit 86 off Korea in late February and early March 1986. Upon her return home on 3 April 1986, the guided missile destroyer underwent and passed four major inspections; a command security inspection, (24 April) a combat systems readiness test (14‚Äì19 April), a Board of Inspection and Survey visit (5‚Äì9 May) and a boiler inspection (12 May). After celebrating her 25th anniversary on 29 May, Towers hosted a celebration in her home port for crew and their families, as well as local dignitaries. She then returned to certifications, service exams and inspections, tasks that kept the crew busy until mid-September when she sailed for Guam. After participation in multinational exercise CrowEater '86, the guided missile destroyer sailed south for a series of port visits in eastern Australia, stopping at Cairns, Sydney, Adelaide and Brisbane before returning home on 15 November via Cairns and Guam. The new year got off to a good start with the crew receiving \\"outstanding\\" in all areas during the 5‚Äì8 January 1987 command inspection. Local operations followed, including training for the annual March‚ÄìApril Exercise Team Spirit '87. On 15‚Äì19 May Towers took part in the Shimoda Black Ship Festival, celebrating the visit of Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry's squadron to Japan in July 1853. She spent the rest of the summer in preparation for another Indian Ocean deployment, upon which she embarked on 15 October. After a stop at Subic Bay in November, the warship sailed to the Persian Gulf, beginning the new year moored alongside the destroyer tender for availability at Masirah, Oman. Upon completion, Towers, in company with frigate , sailed to Karachi, Pakistan, for a five-day port visit (14‚Äì18 January 1988) during which the commanding officer called upon the CNO of the Pakistan Navy. The guided missile destroyer subsequently made her way to the Republic of the Maldives for a four-day port visit and then to Diego Garcia for five days. After a stop at Pattaya Beach, Thailand, in mid- February, Towers accomplished her fifth rescue of Vietnamese refugees on 29 February, picking up 126 survivors of a \\"grossly overloaded\\" boat with a broken-down engine and no food or water. Continuing on home, the guided missile destroyer stopped at Subic Bay and Hong Kong before participating in the annual bilateral exercise Team Spirit 87 off South Korea (16 March ‚Äì 3 April). Following local exercises, Towers participated in a joint exercise with the Japanese in the Philippine Sea (13‚Äì19 May), an ASW exercise in the Sea of Japan (11‚Äì14 June), before putting to sea on the 23rd for Exercise Mekar 88 alongside ships of the Royal Malaysian Navy (7‚Äì13 July). She combined that operation with Exercise Cobra Gold 88 off Thailand (24 July ‚Äì 1 August), upon completion of which she returned to Yokosuka for a 90-day restricted availability. Upon completion of repairs, which included replacing both 5-inch gun mounts, the warship conducted sea trials and gunnery drills starting on 9 November 1988. During those evolutions, however, some shells fell both within Japanese territorial waters and near a Japanese Maritime Safety Agency ship. The Japan government protested the incident and the Navy relieved Towers' commanding officer \\"for cause without relief.\\" Despite the embarrassing incident, the warship resumed local operations soon after. Departing Yokosuka on 6 January 1989, Towers sailed south for refresher training out of Subic Bay. Engineering trouble hampered these evolutions, however, and the guided missile destroyer put into the Ship Repair Facility (SRF) there for repairs in late January. Detailed inspections quickly determined that the guided missile destroyer had suffered damage to turbine blades as well as both propellers. \\"It was amazing\\", one technician commented later, \\"that the whole turbine did not disintegrate.\\" The guided missile destroyer finally put to sea for exercises with the Midway Battle Group in June. After a month-long stay at Yokosuka starting on 15 July, Towers sailed south for more exercises with the battle group. While in transit to Pattaya Beach in late August, however, the warship received the news that Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, USMC, kidnapped by Iranian-supported terrorists in Beirut, Lebanon, the previous February, had been murdered. Ordered to the Indian Ocean for contingency operations, as well as to oversee the end of tanker convoy operations in the Persian Gulf, Towers patrolled those waters until early October. She then sailed south for a port visit to Mombasa, Kenya, 18‚Äì21 October, before arriving in Subic Bay on 27 November. Although Towers departed 1 December, an attempted coup d'√©tat in the Philippines kept her there for a week of contingency operations before she arrived home on 11 December. Although the guided missile destroyer continued intermittent local operations in early 1990, Towers received word of future decommissioning and began inactivation inspections in April. She got underway for the last time on 18 June, to serve as plane guard for Midway, and visited Pusan, South Korea, before returning to Yokosuka on the 30th. On 17 July the ship moved to drydock for inactivation procedures and she was decommissioned at Yokosuka on 1 October 1990. Later towed to the Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Pearl Harbor and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 26 May 1992, she was, ultimately, sunk by guided missile frigate in a fleet training exercise (SinkEx) off the coast of California on 9 October 2002. ==Decommissioning and sinking exercise (Sinkex)== Ex-Towers (DDG-9) sinking following a live fire exercise 9 October 2002 (SINKEX) The ship was decommissioned 1 October 1990, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 27 May 1992. Originally expected to be converted to a barge, the ship was sunk as a target in 2002. The USS Tower's Captain's Gig is on display at Freedom Park in Omaha, Nebraska. Towers received one Navy Unit Commendation, one Meritorious Unit Commendation, and four battle stars for her service in Vietnam. ==References== * * ==External links== * MaritimeQuest USS Towers DDG-9 pages * USS Towers DDG-9 Association Category:Cold War destroyers of the United States Category:Vietnam War destroyers of the United States Category:1959 ships Category:Charles F.

The World War II conception of boffins as war-winning researchers lends the term a more positive connotation than related terms such as nerd, egghead, geek or spod. A \\"boffin\\" was viewed by some in the regular services as odd, quirky or peculiar, though quite bright and essential to helping in the war effort. ==OriginsCivil=== The origins and etymology of boffin are obscure. A link to the mathematician and evolutionary theorist Buffon has been proposed. Alternatively, linguist Eric Partridge proposed the term derived from Nicodemus Boffin, the good-hearted 'golden dustman' character who appears in the novel Our Mutual Friend (1864/5) by Charles Dickens, described there as a \\"very odd-looking old fellow indeed\\". In the novel, Mr Boffin pursues a late- life education, employing Silas Wegg to teach him to read. William Morris has a man called Boffin, based on Charles Dickens and said to be a variant of 'Biffin', meet the newly arrived time traveller in his novel News from Nowhere (1890). Dickens had referred to a 'Miss Biffins', an artist with only vestigial arms and legs, in Martin Chuzzlewit (1843). Thus at this time a 'Boffin' is a good-hearted person who has suffered from 'hard times', been ill-regarded, taken an opportunity to better themselves and done well, demonstrating remarkable social mobility. Possibly ill-favoured in appearance, possibly artistic. ===Military=== Eric Partridge noted that the word was used in the Royal Navy as \\"an unkind term for any officer over forty\\".Ronald W. Clark, The Rise of the Boffins, Phoenix House, 1962 Chris Roberts, Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press, 2006 () On the other hand, the Oxford English Dictionary quotes use in The Times in September 1945: First published in A Supplement to the OED I, 1972. Malvern was home to both TRE and RRDE, who were later merged into RRE. It supported all the services. The then superintendent of TRE uses the term to refer to earlier R.A.F. usage and in a 1942 RAF training film (School for Secrets) the word was cited as armed-forces slang for an RAF technician or research scientist. The founder of the organization that became TRE, Robert Watson-Watt cites Air Vice-Marshal G. P. Chamberlain, who played a vital part in the use of radar to defeat night- bombers, as the source. Of its etymology Sir Robert wrote: ‚ÄúI am not quite sure about the true origins of this name of Boffin. ... I am sure it has nothing at all to do with that first literary ‚ÄúBack Room Boy,‚Äù the claustrophiliac Colonel Boffin, who as you remember never overtly emerged from his back room, although his voice was clearly audible from it. It is the very essence of the Boffin that he should emerge frequently and almost aggressively from the Back Room to which, however, he must return on his missions of interpretation and inspiration.‚Äù Chamberlain claimed that 'A Puffin, a bird with a mournful cry, got crossed with a Baffin,In service 1934-1941. a mercifully obsolete Fleet Air Arm aircraft. Their offspring was a Boffin, a bird of astonishingly queer appearance, bursting with weird and sometimes inopportune ideas, but possessed of staggering inventiveness, analytical powers and persistence. Its ideas, like its eggs, were conical and unbreakable. You push the unwanted ones away, and they just roll back.' A naval origin is supported by reports of an anti-submarine trial by HM Signal School April 1 1941 based on equipment from TRE. Thus the origin appears to be Naval, rather than Air. Either way, it seems to have originated with servicemen working with radar 'boffins' and quickly adapted by other servicemen and boffins themselves. ==Usage Civil=== The word made a few appearances in literature prior to World War II. J. R. R. Tolkien used Boffin as a surname for a hobbit family in The Hobbit (1937) (deriving the name from an Oxford family of bakers and confectioners. This family provides the main heroes, who meet Dicken's mould and are also small, like Sarah Biffen. There is also a Sergeant Boffin in Tolkien's Mr. Bliss (written around 1932, published 1982). ===World War II=== War-time reference to scientist was particularly associated with the members of the team that worked on radar at Bawdsey Research Station under Sir Robert Watson-Watt, but also with mathematicians like Alan Turing, aeronautical engineers like Barnes Wallis and their associates, and the scientists of the Department of Miscellaneous Weapons Development. Watson-Watt cites Robert Hanbury Brown as the prototypical boffin, who notes: \\"It is quite wrong to use the word ‚Äòboffin‚Äô simply to describe a scientist or technician; a boffin is essentially a middleman, a bridge between two worlds ...\\". Alternatively, Lindemann noted that Mervyn O'Gorman had inaugurated the use of scientific methods in aeronautical development at the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough, developing a cadre of 'leaders and explorers' who have retrospectively been termed 'boffins'.The Earl of Birkenhead, The Prof in Two Worlds: The Official Life of F.A. Lindemann, Viscount Cherwell, Collins, 1961 Some \\"have been careful to differentiate between the true boffin and the 'nark', who was a member of the scientific staff of the Experimental Flying Section at Farnborough.' Similarly, the Secretary of State for War cites the contribution of an operational analyst to the U-boat war in 1943.‚Äù Robert Watson-Watt,Sir Robert Watson-Watt, The Natural History of the Boffin, Proceedings of the Institute of Radar Engineers, 1953, page 1699 provided the following definition: \\"The Boffin is a researcher, of high scientific competence, who has learned that a device of great technical elegance, capable of a remarkable performance in the hands of a picked crew, is not necessarily al good weapon of war. He (sic) is the instrument for building into the design provisions which depend on close analysis of the vehicle in which the device is to operate, the field conditions in which it is to operate and above all things, the competence of those who are to operate, maintain, and repair it. He alone can save us from the danger of engendering electronic dinosaurs; he alone can provide on the one hand the knowledge on which the machine can be measured to the man and on the other, the knowledge on which can be based the selection, training, and (this is important) the inspiration of the normal human beings on whom its successful use, in the end, must rest. He must have an understanding and an appreciation of these normal human beings. He can reach these only through having their confidence. He is a middleman, but he is a middleman who can effect enormous economies and enormous increases in efficiencies. He is a rare bird, but he should be free to flit over the whole field of defense science, its origins, and its applications.\\" He also noted that ‚ÄúIt is a term of respect, and admiration, but particularly a term of affection‚Äîan affection which is expressed, as is the English way, in a slightly outside-in, jocular way so that the affection and admiration may not be regarded as too demonstrative.‚Äù Thus a Boffin seems the type of person described by Isaac Newton (1642-1726/7) who, in his advice to the Admiralty, made an important distinction when he said that 'if, instead of sending observations of seamen to able mathematicians on land, the land would be able to send able mathematicians to sea, it would signify much more to the improvement of navigation and the safety of men's lives and estates on that element.' Watson-Watt stated that 'the bill of the boffin has two separate functions. One is to poke into other people's business and the other is to puncture 'the more highly coloured and ornate eggs of the \\"Lesser Back Room Bird\\", which are quite inappropriate to the military scene.' Henry Tizard has also been regarded as the prototypical boffin. More widespread usage may have been encouraged by the common wartime practice of using substitutes for critical words in war-related conversation, to confuse eavesdroppers or spies. ===Cold War=== In 1952 the Secretary of State for War noted the need to develop 'Colonel Boffins' at Shrivenham (1952). Notably,Richard Vincent acquired the nickname 'the boffin' after working at Malvern (1960-62) as a Gunnery Staff Captain and, via RMCS Shrivenham, rosing to become Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom).\\"Field Marshal Lord Vincent obituary\\", 13 September 2018, The Times In the 12 January 1953 issue of Life magazine, a short article on Malcolm Compston depicted him testing \\"the Admiralty's new plastic survival suit\\" in the Arctic Ocean; the article, entitled \\"Cold Bath for a Boffin\\", defines the term for its American audience as \\"civilian scientist working with the British Navy\\" and notes that his potentially life- saving work demonstrates \\"why the term 'boffin', which first began as a sailor's expression of joking contempt, has become instead one of affectionate admiration\\". By 1962 Boffins were characterised as 'the man (sic) who could understand the viewpoint of the Services, who worked with them, and who frequently shared their dangers' and R V Jones, wartime head of scientific intelligence, was referred to as a boffin. By the late 60s the term was being used to include all scientists who had worked at Malvern, irrespective of how closely they worked with the services, even 'backroom' staff.Captain Spencer Freeman CBE, Production under Fire, C J Fallon, 1967 ===Popular Culture=== Boffin continued, in the immediate postwar period, to carry some of its wartime connotation, as a modern-day wizard who labours in secret to create incomprehensible devices of great power. For example, the comics of the period depicted them as developing imaginative machines.Ed. Daniel TatarskyEagle Annual of the Cutaways, Orion Books,2009 However, their more nuanced wartime role was not reflected in popular culture, such as the 1951 Festival of Britain and the term was even used in the UK parliament (1953) to refer to boffins as narrow academics. The image of the technical boffin-hero was popularised by Nevil Shute's novel No Highway (1948), PaulBrickhill's non- fiction book The Dambusters (1951) and Shute's autobiography Slide Rule (1954). Films of The Small Back Room (1948), No Highway (1951, as No Highway in the Sky), and The Dambusters (1954) also featured boffins as heroes, as did stand-alone films such as The Man in the White Suit (1951) and The Sound Barrier (1952). John Wyndham's novel The Kraken Wakes (1953) includes a song called \\"The Boffin's Lament\\" or \\"The Lay of the Baffled Boffin\\", with Naval Boffins. A 1959 biography refers to 'muzzle-headed boffins in cob-webby small backrooms'. By the 1980s boffins were relegated, in UK popular culture, to semi-comic supporting characters such as Q, the fussy armourer-inventor in the James Bond films, and the term itself gradually took on a slightly negative connotation.\\"Who are you calling a boffin?\\", 24 September 2010, Jenny Rohn, The Guardian Thus, by the late 1990s, while the need for 'high-calibre' research staff with 'intimate knowledge' of users and their potential needs was well recognized, the term 'boffin' was no longer used in its original sense, lest it conjure up images of 'mad scientists'. Eds. Robert Bud and Philip Gummett, Cold War Hot Science, Harwood, 1999 This changed after 2003, with Backroom Boys: The Secret Return of the British Boffin and with a nostalgic popular book to accompany the Science Museum's 'Dan Dare and the Birth of High-Tech Britain' Exhibition. This describes the optimism as the war-time boffins turned their attention to turning Britain into 'a place of ingenious, and beautifully crafted home-spun technology and design', until thwarted by the consumerist policies of Harold Macmillan. Norman Foster is cited as carrying forward the spirit of the boffin. There has also been academic recognition that by 1959 boffins had become under-appreciated, under- valued and under-used, to the extent that the post-war vision of an integrated approach to the development and use of the sciences was never fully realized. ==References== ==Further reading== * Christopher Frayling, Mad, Bad And Dangerous?: The Scientist and the Cinema (2005) * George Drower, Boats, Boffins and Bowlines: The Stories of Sailing Inventors and Innovations, The History Press (2011) * Alfred Price, Instruments of Darkness: The Struggle for Radar Supremacy, Kimber, London (1967) * R.

He reigned from 1806 to 1837. He was the second son of Shah Alam II and the father of Bahadur Shah II. Akbar had little de facto power due to the increasing British influence in India through the East India Company. He sent Ram Mohan Roy as an ambassador to Britain and gave him the title of Raja. During his regime, in 1835, the East India Company (EIC) discontinued calling itself subject of the Mughal Emperor and issuing coins in his name. The Persian lines in the company's coins to this effect were deleted. Akbar II is credited with starting the Hindu-Muslim unity festival Phool Walon Ki Sair. His grave lies next to the dargah of 13th century Sufi saint Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki at Mehrauli. ==Early life== The crown prince seated next to his blinded father Shah Alam II (c. 1800) Prince Mirza Akbar was born on 22 April 1760 to Emperor Shah Alam II at Mukundpur, Satna, while his father was in exile. On 2 May 1781, at the Red Fort, the prince was made Crown Prince with the title of Wali Ahd Bahadur, after the death of his elder brother. In 1782, he was appointed the viceroy of Delhi until 1799. When the renegade eunuch Ghulam Qadir captured Delhi, the young Prince Mirza Akbar was forced to nautch dance together along with other Mughal princes and princesses. He witnessed how the members of the imperial Mughal family were humiliated, as well as starved. When Mahmud Shah fled, Mirza Akbar was titular Emperor with the title of Akbar Shah II, and was to remain acting emperor even after the reinstatement of his father Shah Alam II, till January 1788. ==Reign== Jade bowl inscribed with the name of the emperor Zafar Mehal, Mehrauli, Delhialt= Emperor Akbar II presided over an empire titularly large but in effect limited to the Red Fort in Delhi alone. The cultural life of Delhi as a whole flourished during his reign. However, his attitude towards East India Company officials, especially Lord Hastings, to whom he refused to grant an audience on terms other than those of subject and sovereign, although honourable to him, increasingly frustrated the British, who regarded him as merely their pensioner. The British therefore reduced his titular authority to 'King of Delhi' in 1835 and the East India Company ceased to act as the mere lieutenants of the Mughal Empire as they did from 1803 to 1835. Simultaneously they replaced Persian text with English text on the company's coins, which no longer carried the emperor's name. The British encouraged the Nawab of Oudh and the Nizam of Hyderabad to take royal titles in order to further diminish the Emperor's status and influence. Out of deference, the Nizam did not, but the Nawab of Awadh did so. He is also known to have bestowed the title Nawab upon the Nawab of Tonk and Nawab of Jaora. Akbar II appointed the Bengali reformer Ram Mohan Roy, to appeal against his treatment by the East India Company, conferring on him the title of Raja. Ram Mohan Roy then visited England, as the Mughal envoy to the Court of St. James. Ram Mohan Roy submitted a well-argued memorial on behalf of the Mughal ruler, but to no avail.

Prince Mirza Mughal, the heir apparent was himself killed in battle. Many surviving princes settled in various provinces of India, but some settled in Burma and Bengal since a large number of imperial family members, along with Emperor Bahadur Shah II were exiled to Rangoon in Burma. ==See also== * Akbar I * Mirza Nali * Jalaluddin Mirza * Mirza Zafar ==References== Category:18th-century Indian monarchs Category:19th-century Indian monarchs Category:Mughal emperors Category:1760 births Category:1837 deaths Category:Timurid monarchs Category:Indian Muslims Category:People from Satna district ","title":"Akbar II"},{"id":"517228","text":"Acanthus (plural: acanthus, rarely acanthuses in English, or acanthi in Latin), its feminine form acantha (plural: acanthae), the Latinised form of the ancient Greek word acanthos or akanthos, or the prefix acantho-, may refer to: == Biology == *Acanthus (plant), a genus containing plants used for ornament and in traditional medicine *Acanthus (entomology), an entomological term for a thorn-like projection on an insect, typically a single-celled cuticular growth without tormogen (socket) or sensory cells ==Mythology== *Acantha, a figure in Greek mythology associated with the Acanthus plant *Acanthus, son of Autonous who received his name after the plant, which was common in his infertile homeland ==People== *Acanthus of Sparta, an ancient athlete *Acanthus, the pen-name of the cartoonist Frank Hoar ==Places== *Acanthus, Ontario, a modern Canadian town *Acanthus (Caria), a town of ancient Caria, near Bybassus *Acanthus (Egypt), an ancient Egyptian city *Akanthos (Greece), an ancient Macedonian city *Acantha, County Offaly, a townland in the civil parish of Durrow, barony of Ballycowan, Ireland ==Other uses== *Acanthus (ornament), a form in architecture and in leather carving, from the plant *Acanthus path, a fictional tradition of enchanters, magicians and witches in the game Mage: The Awakening ==See also== *List of commonly used taxonomic affixes ","title":"Acanthus"},{"id":"517241","text":"A laptop computer heat pipe system A heat pipe is a heat-transfer device that combines the principles of both thermal conductivity and phase transition to effectively transfer heat between two solid interfaces. At the hot interface of a heat pipe, a liquid in contact with a thermally conductive solid surface turns into a vapor by absorbing heat from that surface. The vapor then travels along the heat pipe to the cold interface and condenses back into a liquid, releasing the latent heat. The liquid then returns to the hot interface through either capillary action, centrifugal force, or gravity and the cycle repeats. Due to the very high heat transfer coefficients for boiling and condensation, heat pipes are highly effective thermal conductors. The effective thermal conductivity varies with heat pipe length, and can approach for long heat pipes, in comparison with approximately for copper. ==Structure, design and construction== Diagram showing components and mechanism for a heat pipe containing a wick CFD analysis package. CFD analysis package. Cross section of a heat pipe for cooling the CPU of a laptop computer. Ruler scale is in millimeters. Cut-away view of a 500 ¬µm thick flat heat pipe with a thin planar capillary (aqua colored) Thin flat heat pipe (heat spreader) with remote heat sink and fan A typical heat pipe consists of a sealed pipe or tube made of a material that is compatible with the working fluid such as copper for water heat pipes, or aluminium for ammonia heat pipes. Typically, a vacuum pump is used to remove the air from the empty heat pipe. The heat pipe is partially filled with a working fluid and then sealed. The working fluid mass is chosen so that the heat pipe contains both vapor and liquid over the operating temperature range.Faghri, A, 2016, Heat Pipe Science and Technology, Second edition, Global Digital Press. Below the operating temperature, the liquid is too cold and cannot vaporize into a gas. Above the operating temperature, all the liquid has turned to gas, and the environmental temperature is too high for any of the gas to condense. In other words, whether too high or too low, thermal conduction is still possible through the walls of the heat pipe, but at a greatly reduced rate of thermal transfer. Working fluids are chosen according to the temperatures at which the heat pipe must operate, with examples ranging from liquid helium for extremely low temperature applications (2‚Äì4 K) to mercury (523‚Äì923 K), sodium (873‚Äì1473 K) and even indium (2000‚Äì3000 K) for extremely high temperatures. The vast majority of heat pipes for room temperature applications use ammonia (213‚Äì373 K), alcohol (methanol (283‚Äì403 K) or ethanol (273‚Äì403 K), or water (298‚Äì573 K) as the working fluid. Copper/water heat pipes have a copper envelope, use water as the working fluid and typically operate in the temperature range of 20 to 150 ¬∞C. Water heat pipes are sometimes filled by partially filling with water, heating until the water boils and displaces the air, and then sealed while hot. For the heat pipe to transfer heat, it must contain saturated liquid and its vapor (gas phase). The saturated liquid vaporizes and travels to the condenser, where it is cooled and turned back to a saturated liquid. In a standard heat pipe, the condensed liquid is returned to the evaporator using a wick structure exerting a capillary action on the liquid phase of the working fluid. Wick structures used in heat pipes include sintered metal powder, screen, and grooved wicks, which have a series of grooves parallel to the pipe axis. When the condenser is located above the evaporator in a gravitational field, gravity can return the liquid. In this case, the heat pipe is a thermosiphon. Finally, rotating heat pipes use centrifugal forces to return liquid from the condenser to the evaporator. Heat pipes contain no mechanical moving parts and typically require no maintenance, though non- condensable gases that diffuse through the pipe's walls, resulting from breakdown of the working fluid or as impurities extant in the material, may eventually reduce the pipe's effectiveness at transferring heat. The advantage of heat pipes over many other heat-dissipation mechanisms is their great efficiency in transferring heat. A pipe one inch in diameter and two feet long can transfer 3.7 kW (12.500 BTU per hour) at with only drop from end to end. Some heat pipes have demonstrated a heat flux of more than 23 kW/cm¬≤, about four times the heat flux through the surface of the sun.Jim Danneskiold, Los Alamos-developed heat pipes ease space flight. Los Alamos News Release, April 26, 2000. ===Heat pipe materials and working fluids=== Heat pipes have an envelope, a wick, and a working fluid. Heat pipes are designed for very long term operation with no maintenance, so the heat pipe wall and wick must be compatible with the working fluid. Some material/working fluids pairs that appear to be compatible are not. For example, water in an aluminium envelope will develop large amounts of non-condensable gas over a few hours or days, preventing normal operation of the heat pipe. Since heat pipes were rediscovered by George Grover in 1963, extensive life tests have been conducted to determine compatible envelope/fluid pairs, some going on for decades. In a heat pipe life test, heat pipes are operated for long periods of time, and monitored for problems such as non-condensable gas generation, material transport, and corrosion.Life Tests The most commonly used envelope (and wick)/fluid pairs include: * Copper envelope with water working fluid for electronics cooling. This is by far the most common type of heat pipe. * Copper or steel envelope with refrigerant R134a working fluid for energy recovery in HVAC systems. * Aluminium envelope with ammonia working fluid for spacecraft thermal control. * Superalloy envelope with alkali metal (cesium, potassium, sodium) working fluid for high temperature heat pipes, most commonly used for calibrating primary temperature measurement devices. Other pairs include stainless steel envelopes with nitrogen, oxygen, neon, hydrogen, or helium working fluids at temperatures below 100 K, copper/methanol heat pipes for electronics cooling when the heat pipe must operate below the water range, aluminium/ethane heat pipes for spacecraft thermal control in environments when ammonia can freeze, and refractory metal envelope/lithium working fluid for high temperature (above ) applications. ===Types of heat pipes=== In addition to standard, constant conductance heat pipes (CCHPs), there are a number of other types of heat pipes, including: * Vapor chambers (planar heat pipes), which are used for heat flux transformation, and isothermalization of surfaces * Variable conductance heat pipes (VCHPs), which use a Non-Condensable Gas (NCG) to change the heat pipe effective thermal conductivity as power or the heat sink conditions change * Pressure controlled heat pipes (PCHPs), which are a VCHP where the volume of the reservoir, or the NCG mass can be changed, to give more precise temperature control * Diode heat pipes, which have a high thermal conductivity in the forward direction, and a low thermal conductivity in the reverse direction * Thermosyphons, which are heat pipes where the liquid is returned to the evaporator by gravitational/accelerational forces, * Rotating heat pipes, where the liquid is returned to the evaporator by centrifugal forces Vapor chamber or flat heat pipes Thin planar heat pipes (heat spreaders) have the same primary components as tubular heat pipes: a hermetically sealed hollow vessel, a working fluid, and a closed-loop capillary recirculation system. In addition, an internal support structure or a series of posts are generally used in a vapor chamber to accommodate clamping pressures sometimes up to 90 PSI. This helps prevent collapse of the flat top and bottom when the pressure is applied. There are two main applications for vapor chambers. First, they are used when high powers and heat fluxes are applied to a relatively small evaporator. Heat input to the evaporator vaporizes liquid, which flows in two dimensions to the condenser surfaces. After the vapor condenses on the condenser surfaces, capillary forces in the wick return the condensate to the evaporator. Note that most vapor chambers are insensitive to gravity, and will still operate when inverted, with the evaporator above the condenser. In this application, the vapor chamber acts as a heat flux transformer, cooling a high heat flux from an electronic chip or laser diode, and transforming it to a lower heat flux that can be removed by natural or forced convection. With special evaporator wicks, vapor chambers can remove 2000 W over 4 cm2, or 700 W over 1 cm2. Another major usage of vapor chambers is for cooling purposes in gaming laptops. As vapor chambers are a flatter and more two-dimensional method of heat dissipation, sleeker gaming laptops benefit hugely from them as compared to traditional heat pipes. For example, the vapor chamber cooling in Lenovo's Legion 7i was its most unique selling point (although it was misadvertised as all models having vapor chambers, while in fact only a few had). Second, compared to a one-dimensional tubular heat pipe, the width of a two-dimensional heat pipe allows an adequate cross section for heat flow even with a very thin device. These thin planar heat pipes are finding their way into ‚Äúheight sensitive‚Äù applications, such as notebook computers and surface mount circuit board cores. It is possible to produce flat heat pipes as thin as 1.0 mm (slightly thicker than a 0.76 mm credit card). Variable conductance heat pipes (VCHPs) Standard heat pipes are constant conductance devices, where the heat pipe operating temperature is set by the source and sink temperatures, the thermal resistances from the source to the heat pipe, and the thermal resistances from the heat pipe to the sink. In these heat pipes, the temperature drops linearly as the power or condenser temperature is reduced. For some applications, such as satellite or research balloon thermal control, the electronics will be overcooled at low powers, or at the low sink temperatures. Variable Conductance Heat Pipes (VCHPs) are used to passively maintain the temperature of the electronics being cooled as power and sink conditions change. Variable conductance heat pipes have two additions compared to a standard heat pipe: 1. a reservoir, and 2. a non-condensable gas (NCG) added to the heat pipe, in addition to the working fluid; see the picture in the spacecraft section below. This non-condensable gas is typically argon for standard Variable conductance heat pipes, and helium for thermosyphons. When the heat pipe is not operating, the non-condensable gas and working fluid vapor are mixed throughout the heat pipe vapor space. When the variable conductance heat pipe is operating, the non-condensable gas is swept toward the condenser end of the heat pipe by the flow of the working fluid vapor. Most of the non-condensable gas is located in the reservoir, while the remainder blocks a portion of the heat pipe condenser. The variable conductance heat pipe works by varying the active length of the condenser. When the power or heat sink temperature is increased, the heat pipe vapor temperature and pressure increase. The increased vapor pressure forces more of the non-condensable gas into the reservoir, increasing the active condenser length and the heat pipe conductance. Conversely, when the power or heat sink temperature is decreased, the heat pipe vapor temperature and pressure decrease, and the non-condensable gas expands, reducing the active condenser length and heat pipe conductance. The addition of a small heater on the reservoir, with the power controlled by the evaporator temperature, will allow thermal control of roughly ¬±1-2 ¬∞C. In one example, the evaporator temperature was maintained in a ¬±1.65 ¬∞C control band, as power was varied from 72 to 150 W, and heat sink temperature varied from +15 ¬∞C to -65 ¬∞C. Pressure controlled heat pipes (PCHPs) can be used when tighter temperature control is required. In a pressure controlled heat pipe, the evaporator temperature is used to either vary the reservoir volume, or the amount of non-condensable gas in the heat pipe. Pressure controlled heat pipes have shown milli-Kelvin temperature control. Diode heat pipes Conventional heat pipes transfer heat in either direction, from the hotter to the colder end of the heat pipe. Several different heat pipes act as a thermal diode, transferring heat in one direction, while acting as an insulator in the other: * Thermosyphons, which only transfer heat from the bottom to the top of the thermosyphon, where the condensate returns by gravity. When the thermosyphon is heated at the top, there is no liquid available to evaporate. * Rotating heat pipes, where the heat pipe is shaped so that liquid can only travel by centrifugal forces from the nominal evaporator to the nominal condenser. Again, no liquid is available when the nominal condenser is heated. * Vapor trap diode heat pipes. * Liquid trap diode heat pipes. A vapor trap diode is fabricated in a similar fashion to a variable conductance heat pipe, with a gas reservoir at the end of the condenser. During fabrication, the heat pipe is charged with the working fluid and a controlled amount of a non-condensable gas (NCG). During normal operation, the flow of the working fluid vapor from the evaporator to the condenser sweeps the non-condensable gas into the reservoir, where it doesn't interfere with the normal heat pipe operation. When the nominal condenser is heated, the vapor flow is from the nominal condenser to the nominal evaporator. The non-condensable gas is dragged along with the flowing vapor, completely blocking the nominal evaporator, and greatly increasing the thermal resistivity of the heat pipe. In general, there is some heat transfer to the nominal adiabatic section. Heat is then conducted through the heat pipe walls to the evaporator. In one example, a vapor trap diode carried 95 W in the forward direction, and only 4.3 W in the reverse direction. A liquid trap diode has a wicked reservoir at the evaporator end of the heat pipe, with a separate wick that is not in communication with the wick in the remainder of the heat pipe. During normal operation, the evaporator and reservoir are heated. The vapor flows to the condenser, and liquid returns to the evaporator by capillary forces in the wick. The reservoir eventually dries out, since there is no method for returning liquid. When the nominal condenser is heated, liquid condenses in the evaporator and the reservoir. While the liquid can return to the nominal condenser from the nominal evaporator, the liquid in the reservoir is trapped, since the reservoir wick is not connected. Eventually, all of the liquid is trapped in the reservoir, and the heat pipe ceases operation. Thermosyphons Most heat pipes use a wick to return the liquid from the condenser to the evaporator, allowing the heat pipe to operate in any orientation. The liquid is sucked up back to the evaporator by capillary action, similar to the way that a sponge sucks up water when an edge is placed in contact with a pool of water. However the maximum adverse elevation (evaporator over condenser) is relatively small, on the order of 25 cm long for a typical water heat pipe. If however, the evaporator is located below the condenser, the liquid can drain back by gravity instead of requiring a wick, and the distance between the two can be much longer. Such a gravity aided heat pipe is known as a thermosyphon. In a thermosyphon, liquid working fluid is vaporized by a heat supplied to the evaporator at the bottom of the heat pipe. The vapor travels to the condenser at the top of the heat pipe, where it condenses. The liquid then drains back to the bottom of the heat pipe by gravity, and the cycle repeats. Thermosyphons are diode heat pipes; when heat is applied to the condenser end, there is no condensate available, and hence no way to form vapor and transfer heat to the evaporator. While a typical terrestrial water heat pipe is less than 30 cm long, thermosyphons are often several meters long. As discussed below, the thermosyphons used to cool the Alaska pipe line were roughly 11 to 12 m long. Even longer thermosyphons have been proposed for the extraction of geothermal energy. For example, Storch et al. fabricated a 53 mm I.D., 92 m long propane thermosyphon that carried roughly 6 kW of heat.T. Storch et al., ‚ÄúWetting and Film Behavior Of Propane Inside Geothermal Heat Pipes‚Äù, 16th International Heat Pipe Conference, Lyon, France, May 20‚Äì24, 2012. Loop heat pipe A loop heat pipe (LHP) is a passive two-phase transfer device related to the heat pipe. It can carry higher power over longer distances by having co-current liquid and vapor flow, in contrast to the counter-current flow in a heat pipe. This allows the wick in a loop heat pipe to be required only in the evaporator and compensation chamber. Micro loop heat pipes have been developed and successfully employed in a wide sphere of applications both on the ground and in space. Oscillating or pulsating heat pipe  An oscillating heat pipe, also known as a pulsating heat pipe, is only partially filled with liquid working fluid. The pipe is arranged in a serpentine pattern in which freely moving liquid and vapor segments alternate. Oscillation takes place in the working fluid; the pipe remains motionless. ==Heat transfer== Heat pipes employ phase change to transfer thermal energy from one point to another by the vaporization and condensation of a working fluid or coolant. Heat pipes rely on a temperature difference between the ends of the pipe, and cannot lower temperatures at either end below the ambient temperature (hence they tend to equalize the temperature within the pipe). When one end of the heat pipe is heated, the working fluid inside the pipe at that end vaporizes and increases the vapor pressure inside the cavity of the heat pipe. The latent heat of vaporization absorbed by the working fluid reduces the temperature at the hot end of the pipe. The vapor pressure over the hot liquid working fluid at the hot end of the pipe is higher than the equilibrium vapor pressure over the condensing working fluid at the cooler end of the pipe, and this pressure difference drives a rapid mass transfer to the condensing end where the excess vapor condenses, releases its latent heat, and warms the cool end of the pipe. Non-condensing gases (caused by contamination for instance) in the vapor impede the gas flow and reduce the effectiveness of the heat pipe, particularly at low temperatures, where vapor pressures are low. The speed of molecules in a gas is approximately the speed of sound, and in the absence of noncondensing gases (i.e., if there is only a gas phase present) this is the upper limit to the velocity with which they could travel in the heat pipe. In practice, the speed of the vapor through the heat pipe is limited by the rate of condensation at the cold end and far lower than the molecular speed. Note/explanation: The condensation rate is very close to the sticking coefficient times the molecular speed times the gas density, if the condensing surface is very cold. However, if the surface is close to the temperature of the gas, the evaporation caused by the finite temperature of the surface largely cancels this heat flux. If the temperature difference is more than some tens of degrees, the vaporization from the surface is typically negligible, as can be assessed from the vapor pressure curves. In most cases, with very efficient heat transport through the gas, it is very challenging to maintain such significant temperature differences between the gas and the condensing surface. Moreover, this temperature differences of course corresponds to a large effective thermal resistance by itself. The bottleneck is often less severe at the heat source, as the gas densities are higher there, corresponding to higher maximum heat fluxes. The condensed working fluid then flows back to the hot end of the pipe. In the case of vertically oriented heat pipes the fluid may be moved by the force of gravity. In the case of heat pipes containing wicks, the fluid is returned by capillary action. When making heat pipes, there is no need to create a vacuum in the pipe. One simply boils the working fluid in the heat pipe until the resulting vapor has purged the non-condensing gases from the pipe, and then seals the end. An interesting property of heat pipes is the temperature range over which they are effective. Initially, it might be suspected that a water-charged heat pipe only works when the hot end reaches the boiling point (100 ¬∞C, 212 ¬∞F, at normal atmospheric pressure) and steam is transferred to the cold end. However, the boiling point of water depends on the absolute pressure inside the pipe. In an evacuated pipe, water vaporizes from its triple point (0.01 ¬∞C, 32 ¬∞F) to its critical point (374 ¬∞C; 705 ¬∞F), as long as the heat pipe contains both liquid and vapor. Thus a heat pipe can operate at hot-end temperatures as low as just slightly warmer than the melting point of the working fluid, although the maximum rate of heat transfer is low at temperatures below 25 ¬∞C (77 ¬∞F). Similarly, a heat pipe with water as a working fluid can work well above the atmospheric boiling point (100 ¬∞C, 212 ¬∞F). The maximum temperature for long term water heat pipes is 270 ¬∞C (518 ¬∞F), with heat pipes operating up to 300 ¬∞C (572 ¬∞F) for short term tests. The main reason for the effectiveness of heat pipes is the vaporization and condensation of the working fluid. The heat of vaporization greatly exceeds the specific heat capacity. Using water as an example, the energy needed to evaporate one gram of water is 540 times the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of that same one gram of water by 1 ¬∞C. Almost all of that energy is rapidly transferred to the \\"cold\\" end when the fluid condenses there, making a very effective heat transfer system with no moving parts. ==Development== The general principle of heat pipes using gravity, commonly classified as two phase thermosiphons, dates back to the steam age and Angier March Perkins and his son Loftus Perkins and the \\"Perkins Tube\\", which saw widespread use in locomotive boilers and working ovens.\\"Heat Pipes\\", Fifth Edition, D. A. Reay, P.A. Kew, p. 10. Capillary-based heat pipes were first suggested by R. S. Gaugler of General Motors in 1942, who patented the idea, but did not develop it further. George Grover independently developed capillary-based heat pipes at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1963, with his patent of that year being the first to use the term \\"heat pipe\\", and he is often referred to as \\"the inventor of the heat pipe\\".\\"George M. Grover, 81, Inventor Of Popular Heat Transfer Device\\", November 3, 1996, New York Times He noted in his notebook: > Such a closed system, requiring no external pumps, may be of particular > interest in space reactors in moving heat from the reactor core to a > radiating system. In the absence of gravity, the forces must only be such as > to overcome the capillary and the drag of the returning vapor through its > channels. Grover's suggestion was taken up by NASA, which played a large role in heat pipe development in the 1960s, particularly regarding applications and reliability in space flight. This was understandable given the low weight, high heat flux, and zero power draw of heat pipes ‚Äì and that they would not be adversely affected by operating in a zero gravity environment. The first application of heat pipes in the space program was the thermal equilibration of satellite transponders. As satellites orbit, one side is exposed to the direct radiation of the sun while the opposite side is completely dark and exposed to the deep cold of outer space. This causes severe discrepancies in the temperature (and thus reliability and accuracy) of the transponders. The heat pipe cooling system designed for this purpose managed the high heat fluxes and demonstrated flawless operation with and without the influence of gravity. The cooling system developed was the first use of variable conductance heat pipes to actively regulate heat flow or evaporator temperature. ===Wider usage=== NASA has tested heat pipes designed for extreme conditions, with some using liquid sodium metal as the working fluid. Other forms of heat pipes are currently used to cool communication satellites.\\"Inspired Heat-Pipe Technology\\", lanl.gov Publications in 1967 and 1968 by Feldman, Eastman,G. Y. Eastman, ‚ÄúThe Heat Pipe‚Äù Scientific American, Vol. 218, No. 5, pp. 38-46, May 1968. and Katzoff first discussed applications of heat pipes for wider uses such as in air conditioning, engine cooling, and electronics cooling. These papers were also the first to mention flexible, arterial, and flat plate heat pipes. Publications in 1969 introduced the concept of the rotational heat pipe with its applications to turbine blade cooling and contained the first discussions of heat pipe applications to cryogenic processes. Starting in the 1980s Sony began incorporating heat pipes into the cooling schemes for some of its commercial electronic products in place of both forced convection and passive finned heat sinks. Initially they were used in receivers and amplifiers, soon spreading to other high heat flux electronics applications. During the late 1990s increasingly high heat flux microcomputer CPUs spurred a threefold increase in the number of U.S. heat pipe patent applications. As heat pipes evolved from a specialized industrial heat transfer component to a consumer commodity most development and production moved from the U.S. to Asia. Modern CPU heat pipes are typically made of copper and use water as the working fluid. They are common in many consumer electronics like desktops, laptops, tablets, and high-end smartphones. ==ApplicationsSpacecraft=== Heat pipes on spacecraft typically use a grooved aluminium extrusion as the envelope. Typical grooved aluminium-ammonia VCHP for spacecraft thermal control, with the evaporator section on the bottom, and the non-condensable gas reservoir just below the valve The spacecraft thermal control system has the function to keep all components on the spacecraft within their acceptable temperature range. This is complicated by the following: * Widely varying external conditions, such as eclipses * Micro-g environment * Heat removal from the spacecraft by thermal radiation only * Limited electrical power available, favoring passive solutions * Long lifetimes, with no possibility of maintenance Some spacecraft are designed to last for 20 years, so heat transport without electrical power or moving parts is desirable. Rejecting the heat by thermal radiation means that large radiator panes (multiple square meters) are required. Heat pipes and loop heat pipes are used extensively in spacecraft, since they don't require any power to operate, operate nearly isothermally, and can transport heat over long distances. Grooved wicks are used in spacecraft heat pipes, as shown in the first photograph in this section. The heat pipes are formed by extruding aluminium, and typically have an integral flange to increase the heat transfer area, which lowers the temperature drop. Grooved wicks are used in spacecraft, instead of the screen or sintered wicks used for terrestrial heat pipes, since the heat pipes don't have to operate against gravity in space. This allows spacecraft heat pipes to be several meters long, in contrast to the roughly 25 cm maximum length for a water heat pipe operating on Earth. Ammonia is the most common working fluid for spacecraft heat pipes. Ethane is used when the heat pipe must operate at temperatures below the ammonia freezing temperature. The second figure shows a typical grooved aluminium/ammonia variable conductance heat pipe (VCHP) for spacecraft thermal control. The heat pipe is an aluminium extrusion, similar to that shown in the first figure. The bottom flanged area is the evaporator. Above the evaporator, the flange is machined off to allow the adiabatic section to be bent. The condenser is shown above the adiabatic section. The non-condensable gas (NCG) reservoir is located above the main heat pipe. The valve is removed after filling and sealing the heat pipe. When electric heaters are used on the reservoir, the evaporator temperature can be controlled within ¬±2 K of the setpoint. ===Computer systems=== A heat sink (aluminium) with heat pipes (copper) Typical heat pipe configuration within a consumer laptop. The heat pipes conduct waste heat away from the CPU, GPU and voltage regulators, transferring it to a heatsink coupled with a cooling fan that acts as a fluid- to-fluid heat exchanger. Heat pipes began to be used in computer systems in the late 1990s,, 1998, Hong Xie, Intel Corp, IEEE when increased power requirements and subsequent increases in heat emission resulted in greater demands on cooling systems. They are now extensively used in many modern computer systems, typically to move heat away from components such as CPUs and GPUs to heat sinks where thermal energy may be dissipated into the environment. ===Solar thermal=== Heat pipes are also widely used in solar thermal water heating applications in combination with evacuated tube solar collector arrays. In these applications, distilled water is commonly used as the heat transfer fluid inside a sealed length of copper tubing that is located within an evacuated glass tube and oriented towards the sun. In connecting pipes, the heat transport occurs in the liquid steam phase because the thermal transfer medium is converted into steam in a large section of the collecting pipeline. In solar thermal water heating applications, an individual absorber tube of an evacuated tube collector is up to 40% more efficient compared to more traditional \\"flat plate\\" solar water collectors. This is largely due to the vacuum that exists within the tube, which slows down convective and conductive heat loss. Relative efficiencies of the evacuated tube system are reduced however, when compared to flat plate collectors because the latter have a larger aperture size and can absorb more solar energy per unit area. This means that while an individual evacuated tube has better insulation (lower conductive and convective losses) due to the vacuum created inside the tube, an array of tubes found in a completed solar assembly absorbs less energy per unit area due to there being less absorber surface area pointed toward the sun because of the rounded design of an evacuated tube collector. Therefore, real world efficiencies of both designs are about the same. Evacuated tube collectors reduce the need for anti-freeze additives since the vacuum helps slow heat loss. However, under prolonged exposure to freezing temperatures the heat transfer fluid can still freeze and precautions must be taken to ensure that the freezing liquid does not damage the evacuated tube when designing systems for such environments. Properly designed solar thermal water heaters can be frost protected down to more than -3 ¬∞C with special additives and are being used in Antarctica to heat water. ===Permafrost cooling=== Alaska pipeline support legs cooled by heat pipe thermosyphons to keep permafrost frozen Building on permafrost is difficult because heat from the structure can thaw the permafrost. Heat pipes are used in some cases to avoid the risk of destabilization. For example, in the Trans- Alaska Pipeline System residual ground heat remaining in the oil as well as heat produced by friction and turbulence in the moving oil could conduct down the pipe's support legs and melt the permafrost on which the supports are anchored. This would cause the pipeline to sink and possibly be damaged. To prevent this, each vertical support member has been mounted with four vertical heat pipe thermosyphons. C. E Heuer, ‚ÄúThe Application of Heat Pipes on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline‚Äù Special Report 79-26, United States Army Corps of Engineers, Sept. 1979. The significant feature of a thermosyphon is that it is passive and does not require any external power to operate. During the winter, the air is colder than the ground around the supports. The liquid ammonia at the bottom of the thermosyphon is vaporized by heat absorbed from the ground, cooling the surrounding permafrost and lowering its temperature. During the summer, the thermosyphons stop operating, since there is no liquid ammonia available at the top of the heat pipe, but the extreme cooling during the winter allows the ground to remain frozen. Heat pipes are also used to keep the permafrost frozen alongside parts of the Qinghai‚ÄìTibet Railway where the embankment and track absorb the sun's heat. Vertical heat pipes on either side of relevant formations prevent that heat from spreading any further into the surrounding permafrost. Depending on application there are several thermosyphon designs: thermoprobe, thermopile, depth thermosyphon, sloped- thermosyphon foundation, flat loop thermosyphon foundation, and hybrid flat loop thermosyphon foundation. ===Cooking=== The first commercial heat pipe product was the \\"Thermal Magic Cooking Pin\\" developed by Energy Conversion Systems, Inc. and first sold in 1966.Midwest Research Institute, Heat Pipes, NASA Report NASA CR-2508, pg. 19, Jan 1, 1975. The cooking pins used water as the working fluid. The envelope was stainless steel, with an inner copper layer for compatibility. During operation, one end of the heat pipe is poked through the roast. The other end extends into the oven where it draws heat to the middle of the roast. The high effective conductivity of the heat pipe reduces the cooking time for large pieces of meat by one-half. The principle has also been applied to camping stoves. The heat pipe transfers a large volume of heat at low temperature to allow goods to be baked and other dishes to be cooked in camping-type situations. ===Ventilation heat recovery=== In heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems (HVAC) heat pipes are positioned within the supply and exhaust air streams of an air handling system or in the exhaust gases of an industrial process, in order to recover the heat energy. The device consists of a battery of multi-row finned heat pipe tubes located within both the supply and exhaust air streams. Within the exhaust air side of the heat pipe, the refrigerant evaporates, extracting heat from the exhaust air. The refrigerant vapor moves towards the cooler end of the tube, within the supply air side of the device, where it condenses and releases heat. The condensed refrigerant returns by a combination of gravity and capillary action in the wick. Thus heat is transferred from the exhaust air stream through the tube wall to the refrigerant, and then from the refrigerant through the tube wall to the supply air stream. Because of the characteristics of the device, better efficiencies are obtained when the unit is positioned upright with the supply air side mounted over the exhaust air side, which allows the liquid refrigerant to flow quickly back to the evaporator aided by the force of gravity. Generally, gross heat transfer efficiencies of up to 75% are claimed by manufacturers. ===Nuclear power conversion=== Grover and his colleagues were working on cooling systems for nuclear power cells for space craft, where extreme thermal conditions are encountered. These alkali metal heat pipes transferred heat from the heat source to a thermionic or thermoelectric converter to generate electricity. Since the early 1990s, numerous nuclear reactor power systems have been proposed using heat pipes for transporting heat between the reactor core and the power conversion system. The first nuclear reactor to produce electricity using heat pipes was first operated on September 13, 2012 in a demonstration using flattop fission. ===Wankel rotary combustion engines=== Ignition of the fuel mixture always takes place in the same part of Wankel engines, inducing thermal dilatation disparities that reduce power output, impair fuel economy, and accelerate wear. SAE paper 2014-01-2160, by Wei Wu et al., describes: 'A Heat Pipe Assisted Air-Cooled Rotary Wankel Engine for Improved Durability, Power and Efficiency', they obtained a reduction in top engine temperature from 231 ¬∞C to 129 ¬∞C, and the temperature difference reduced from 159 ¬∞C to 18 ¬∞C for a typical small-chamber-displacement air-cooled unmanned aerial vehicle engine. === Heat pipe heat exchangers === Heat exchangers transfer heat from a hot stream to a cold stream of air, water or oil. A heat pipe heat exchanger contains several heat pipes of which each acts as an individual heat exchanger itself. This increases efficiency, life span and safety. In case that one heat pipe breaks, only a small amount of liquid is released which is critical for certain industrial processes such as aluminium casting. Additionally, with one broken heat pipe the heat pipe heat exchanger still remains operable. === Currently developed applications === Due to the great adaptability of heat pipes, research explores the implementation of heat pipes into various systems: * Improving the efficiency of geothermal heating to prevent slippery roads during winter in cold climate zones * Increased efficiency of photovoltaic cells by coupling the solar panel to a heat pipe system. This transports heat away from overheated panels to maintain optimal temperature for maximum energy generation. Additionally, the tested set up seizes the recovered thermal heat to warm, for instance, water * Hybrid control rod heat pipes to shut down a nuclear reactor in case of an emergency and simultaneously transferring decay heat away to prevent the reactor from running hot ==Limitations== Heat pipes must be tuned to particular cooling conditions. The choice of pipe material, size, and coolant all have an effect on the optimal temperatures at which heat pipes work. When used outside of its design heat range, the heat pipe's thermal conductivity is effectively reduced to the heat conduction properties of its solid metal casing alone. In the case of a copper casing, that is around 1/80 of the original flux. This is because below the intended temperature range the working fluid will not undergo phase change, while above it, all of the working fluid in the heat pipe vaporizes and the condensation process ceases. Most manufacturers cannot make a traditional heat pipe smaller than 3 mm in diameter due to material limitations. ==See also== * Air cooling * CPU cooling * Evaporative cooling * Heat sink * Loop heat pipe * Peltier-Seebeck effect * Phase-change material * Thermoelectric cooling * Thermosiphon * Vapor-compression refrigeration * Water cooling ==References== ==External links== * Frontiers in Heat Pipes (FHP) ‚Äì An International Journal * House_N Research (mit.edu) * Heat pipe selection guide (pdf) * Heat Pipe Basics and Demonstration Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning Category:Computer hardware cooling Category:Heat conduction Category:Spacecraft components Category:Heat transfer ","title":"Heat pipe"},{"id":"517255","text":" The Aviadvigatel PS-90 is a Russian high-bypass commercial turbofan rated at 16000 kgf (157 kN, 35,300 lbf) thrust. It powers Russian airliners such as the Ilyushin Il-96 and the Tupolev Tu-204/Tu-214 series and transport aircraft such as the Ilyushin Il-76. It is made by the Russian aircraft engine company Aviadvigatel, which is the successor of the Soviet Soloviev Design Bureau. \\"PS\\" are the initials of Pavel Soloviev (). ==Design and development== With the advent of new generation of Russian airliners, Aviadvigatel developed the PS-90 to satisfy the demands of economy, performance and exhaust emissions. It represented a huge advance over previous generations of 1960s era Soviet engines. The PS-90 is almost double the efficiency of those engines and is reasonably competitive to western engines of the 1980s such as the Pratt & Whitney PW2000. ===Design features=== It incorporates many firsts in a Russian engine with advanced technology features such as * High-bypass turbofan design for economy * Integrated exhaust with exhaust mixer for good efficiency * Acoustically treated exhaust duct for low noise * Full-authority digital engine control (FADEC) * Long service life based on on-condition maintenance * Modular design for ease of maintenance It was first certified in 1992 and has been in service since. ==Variants== An Air Koryo Tu-204-300 There are several variants: the basic PS-90A, the PS-90A-76, and the improved PS-90A versions. The latter include the PS-90A1, PS-90A2, PS-90A-42 and the PS-90A3 engines. ===PS-90A=== The PS-90A engine is the initial variant and is standard equipment for Ilyushin Il-96-300, Tupolev-204-100 and the Tupolev-214. For the first time it allowed Russian airliners to achieve similar performance and economy to their western counterparts. PS-90A is rated nominally at 16000 kgf (157 kN, 35,300 lbf) thrust, 13.3% less than the original Rolls-Royce RB211-535E4 engine (which is also offered on the Tu-204), and the fuel consumption is 8.2% less than it. ===PS-90A-76=== This variant is a modification of the basic PS-90A engine. It is rated nominally up to 14,500 kgf (142 kN, 32,000 lbf) take-off thrust. By replacing the D-30KP on the older Il-76, the service life of the aircraft can be extended. Fuel efficiency, and performance will be markedly improved and noise pollution reduced to the comply with the new strict requirements. With the large fleet of both civil and military Il-76 aircraft still in operation, a potentially large market exists for engine replacement. An example of such a modified version is the Il-76MD-90. The PS-90A-76 is the standard on the newly built, modernized versions of the Il-76, such as the Il-76MD-90A and the Il-76MF. ===PS-90A1=== This variant is also a modification of the basic PS-90A engine. It was certified in 2007 and is offered as an option on the IL-96-400T aircraft. ===PS-90A2=== The PS-90A2 is an advanced derivative of the PS-90A, developed in cooperation with Pratt & Whitney. It has a fair proportion of western components from France, Germany, Sweden and the USA. It is also lighter than PS-90A and features improved FADEC. These features improve the performance and reduce maintenance costs by 40%. Fuel consumption is on par with current western engines, and its noise levels are below the current regulatory requirements. The PS-90A2 is the first Russian engine to be ETOPS-180 min rated. It is offered in newly built aircraft and is completely interchangeable with the PS-90A, allowing simple upgrades on present airliners. It has the same thrust rating as the PS-90A, 16000 kgf (157 kN, 35,300 lbf) thrust. It is also capable of 18000 kgf (176 kN, 39,600 lbf) thrust. Future American involvement in engine development has been put in doubt after unwelcome attempts to block sale of PS-90A2 engines to a major Iranian customer for the type. ===PS-90A-42=== This is a version of the PS-90A2 intended for the Beriev A-42 search and rescue aircraft.http://www.pmz.ru/eng/advanced- developments/PS-90A-42/ ===PS-90A3=== According to the manufacturer, it is a modification of the PS-90A2. It was certified in January 2011 and intended to power the Tupolev Tu-204SM aircraft.http://www.airliners.net/aviation- forums/general_aviation/read.main/6137187/ It is unclear whether the US and Western European components of the PS-90A2 remain or whether they have been replaced by Russian ones.http://www.airliners.net/aviation- forums/general_aviation/read.main/6137187/ If the US components have indeed been replaced, then this engine could be fitted to the Tu-204SM ordered by Iran Air and its subsidiaries. ===Gas Turbines=== * GTE-25P, GTU-25P unit * Gas turbine PS-90GP-2 derivative of PS90A2 ==Specifications (PS-90A1)== PS-90 mounted on an :Ilyushin Il-96 ==See also== ==References== ==External links== *Manufacturer specifications *PS-90 production list (in Russian) PS-90 Category:High-bypass turbofan engines Category:1990s turbofan engines ","title":"Aviadvigatel PS-90"},{"id":"517260","text":"Spunk may in colloquial English mean either courage or semen.

The word Talgo is also used by the rail operator RENFE for a type of inter-city rail service (using Talgo VI cars). ==Corporate history== TALGO (Tren Articulado Ligero Goicoechea Oriol, Goicoechea-Oriol light articulated train), Alejandro Goicoechea and Jos√© Luis Oriol being the founders of the company. Talgo Patents S.A. was first incorporated in 1942. In March 2007 Talgo sold its Finnish rolling stock manufacturing subsidiary Talgo Oy to its local management and other Finnish investors. The company, which Talgo had owned for only seven years, reverted to its previous name of Transtech Oy. The company spends 10 to 12 percent of revenues on research and development, but the main revenue source is the Spanish railway operator Renfe. Talgo made an initial public offering on the Bolsa de Madrid in May 2015. The IPO valued the company at ‚Ç¨1.27 billion. In July 2015, Talgo stated its intention to ship a Series 9 train to India at its own cost as a demonstration on the Mumbai-Delhi rail route.For trial run in India, wheelset being adjusted from 1520mm (Russian gauge) to 1676mm (Indian gauge). ==Design== Left: Conventional bogie system. Right: Talgo System Talgo trains are best known for their unconventional articulated railway passenger cars that use in-between carriage bogies that Talgo patented in 1941, similar to the earlier Jacobs bogie. The wheels are mounted in pairs but not joined by an axle and the bogies are shared between coaches rather than underneath individual coaches. This allows a railway car to take a turn at higher speed with less hunting oscillation. As the coaches are not mounted directly onto wheel bogies, the coaches are more easily insulated from track noise. Talgo trains fitted with variable gauge axles can change rail gauge - for instance at the / at the Spanish-French border interchange. Since the introduction of the Talgo Pendular in 1980, the train tilts naturally inwards on curves, allowing it to run faster on curves without causing discomfort to passengers. The carriage tilting system pivots around the top of the suspension columns, which has the effect of partially cancelling out the effects of the lateral acceleration when cornering. ==Trains== Talgo and RENFE Class 334 in Ourense railway station Talgo trains are divided into a number of generations. They come in both locomotive hauled and self-propelled versions. ===Talgo I=== Talgo I locomotive. The Talgo I was built in 1942 in Spain. The coaches were built at the \\"Hijos de Juan Garay\\" workshop in O√±ati and the locomotive was built at the workshops of the \\"Compa√±√≠a de Norte\\" in Valladolid. It was built as a prototype, and it was used to set several railroad speed records. The first test run occurred between Madrid and Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha in October 1942. ===Talgo II=== Talgo II coaches and locomotives were first built in 1950 at the American Car and Foundry Company (ACF) works in the United States under the direction of Spanish engineers (the diesel-electric locomotives were assembled by ACF with electrical components made by General Electric). Talgo II carried most of the Jet Rocket train's passengers between Chicago and Peoria, Illinois, after entering service on the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (the Rock Island line) in 1956. Slightly different coaches were introduced later on, and indeed the last car type of the Jet Rocket resembled that of the future Talgo III.(1) (2) The New York Central Railroad trialed a complete train until 1958 but saw little success. Talgo IIs were also built for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad for its \\"John Quincy Adams\\" train from New York City to Boston, Massachusetts, and the Boston and Maine Railroad for its \\"Speed Merchant\\" train, running between Boston, Massachusetts and Portland, Maine. Soon afterwards, Talgo II trains began running in Spain, and were successfully operated until 1972. ===Talgo III=== A locomotive-hauled Talgo III train Talgo III coaches and locomotives entered service in 1964, introducing longer cars and easy directional reversibility of the cars. The Talgo III/RD was equipped with variable gauge axles, and this permitted the introduction, on 1 June 1969, of the first through train between Barcelona and Geneva (the Catalan Talgo), despite the difference in rail gauge.\\"Stop Press\\" (changes taking effect). Cooks Continental Timetable (June 1969 edition), p. 6; also pp. 71, 106. London: Thomas Cook Publishing. The same equipment was used for the Barcelona Talgo, which began operation on 26 May 1974 as the first-ever through train service between Barcelona and Paris.\\"Barcelona Talgo\\". Thomas Cook Continental Timetable (June 1975 edition), p. 466. Thomas Cook Publishing. ===Talgo Pendular=== Amtrak Cascades Talgo Pendular cars The Talgo Pendular (Talgo IV and Talgo V, also VI & Talgo 200 or 6th generation), introduced in 1980, created the \\"natural tilting\\" train, using a passive system that tilts the carriages with no need for electronic sensors or hydraulic equipment. The wheels are mounted on monoaxles between the carriages, and sitting on top of the monoaxles are suspension columns. The carriages are attached to the top of the suspension columns and swing outwards as the train goes through a curve. In 1988, a Talgo Pendular was used on trials for Amtrak on the Boston-New York corridor in the United States and on Deutsche Bahn lines in Germany. Trial commercial services with Talgo cars in the US commenced in 1994 between Seattle and Portland, and from 1998 different trains have been used on the Amtrak Cascades services from Vancouver, British Columbia south to Seattle, Washington, continuing south via Portland, Oregon to Eugene, Oregon. Five Talgo IV trains were in use in Argentina on the General Roca Railway, however they have since been replaced by CRRC Dalian rolling stock and their future is uncertain as of 2015.¬øTraslado al cementerio? - Cronica Ferroviaria, 5 May 2015. Talgo 200 series trains are also in use in Kazakhstan for the overnight train Almaty‚ÄìAstana. Kazakhstan Buys Two Talgo Trains, International Railway Journal (1 December 2000) ===Talgo VII=== Altaria service from Madrid - Barcelona passing Viladecans (Barcelona) The Talgo VII introduced beginning in 2000 is used as a locomotive-pulled train set as well as intermediate cars for the multiple units Talgo 250, Talgo 350 and Talgo XXI. The carriages are similar to the Talgo Pendular type but have an air-controlled hydraulic brake system and power supply from head end power instead of diesel engine-generators in the end cars. Talgo VII trains have the car which has two pairs of wheels in the middle of the set (of cars) rather than at one end of the set, which is the case for earlier Talgo trains. All the other cars in the set have a single pair of wheels. ===Talgo 8=== The Series 8 passenger cars are similar to the Series VII cars, but are designed for the North American market. Talgo made an agreement in 2009 to build a manufacturing facility in Wisconsin which would initially supply two 14-car trainsets for the Amtrak Hiawatha Service until the project was cancelled. The company expressed hope the plant would later be used to build trains for other U.S. rail projects. Early in 2010, the Oregon Department of Transportation announced that it had negotiated the purchase of two 13-car trainsets for use in the Pacific Northwest rail corridor between Eugene and Vancouver, British Columbia. These trainsets were also manufactured in Wisconsin, and were delivered in 2013. The sets are currently operating in the \\"Cascades\\" corridor in the Pacific Northwest. They have been integrated with the five existing sets in regular service. The Series 8 trains offer passengers many modern amenities including high speed Wi-Fi, reclining seats and a full service bistro and lounge car. In 2014, the state of Michigan expressed interest in operating the unused Talgo 8 cars for their Amtrak Wolverine service. Three years later, Amtrak proposed to lease or buy the unused cars in the wake of the 2017 Washington train derailment. The sets are currently at the Talgo facility in Milwaukee, WI being modified for Cascades service. ===Talgo 9=== This series, designed for Russia and Kazakhstan, has features wide bodyshell and wheelsets. There are three versions, consisting of either 1520mm fixed gauge, 1520-1435mm variable gauge or 1520-1676mm variable gauge. They are used in the Berlin-Moscow line (December 2016). The final successful test run of the Talgo 9 series coaches was completed in India on September 10, 2016.The final successful test run of the Talgo 9 series coaches was completed in India in the first week of September, 2016. ===Talgo 250 HSR=== The Talgo 250 is a dual voltage electric train (AC/DC) equipped with variable gauge axles. This allows the units to be used on high-speed lines and on conventional broad gauge lines. A Talgo 250 train consists of two power cars and 11 Talgo VII intermediate coaches. This class was developed for RENFE (classed as S-130). One trainset was involved in the Santiago de Compostela accident on 24 July 2013. Uzbekistan Railways ordered two Talgo 250 sets of a Russian gauge version in 2009. The first set arrived at Tashkent in July 2011. ===Talgo 250 Hybrid=== The Talgo 250 Hybrid is a dual-voltage dual-power train equipped with variable gauge axles. The train is therefore also able to operate on non-electrified lines. A Talgo 250 Hybrid train consists of two power cars, two technical end coaches and nine Talgo VII intermediate coaches. The trains were developed for RENFE and classed initially as S-130H, later as S-730). They are rebuilt from existing Talgo 250 trains. ===Talgo 350 HSR=== Talgo 350 train as used for AVE high-speed services between Madrid - Valencia The Talgo 350 entered service as the RENFE AVE Class 102 marking the company's entry into the high-speed train manufacturing market. Tests with the prototype commenced in 1994, and Talgo 350 trains have been operating at a top commercial speed of 330 km/h on the Madrid-Barcelona and Madrid-Valladolid lines since 22 December 2007. This series of trains is designed to reach a speed of , although present lines and commercial services limit the speed to . Talgo evolves its unique design for ultra high speed - High Speed: Spain, International Railway Journal, 1 October 2002 The train consists of two power cars and Talgo VII intermediate cars with improved brakes and additional primary suspension. ===Talgo XXI HSR=== RENFE class 355 / Talgo XXI / Talgo BT Talgo XXI is a project for a high speed diesel-powered train, that operates in push-pull with one or two power cars and Talgo VII intermediate cars. The North American version has four-axle power cars in compliance with United States FRA regulations. Only one train in compliance with European UIC standards has been built to date. Talgo reported that the Talgo XXI attained 256 km/h on the Olmedo-Medina del Campo high speed experimental line on 9 July 2002, which led to a claim for the world speed record for a diesel train. However, this claim was never proven. After the test runs the train was sold to the Spanish infrastructure authority ADIF as a measuring train for high speed lines. Possible specs are: * Two MTU 12V 4000 R64 engines (two power cars configuration) or one MTU 12V 4000 R84 engine (one power car configuration), up to 1.800 rpm, high speed diesel, Euro IIIB compliant with diesel particulate filter and exhaust gas recirculation aftertreatment system * 2x1.500 kW (3 MW) or 1x1.800 kW power ratings * Voith hydraulic transmission * Hydrodynamic and air braking * Variable gauge * 5 to 12 passenger coaches, depending on the setup * Up to 400 seats * Designed for a top speed of 220 km/h (135 mph) * Power car with shared trailer axle ===Talgo AVRIL HSR=== Talgo AVRIL in the International Exhibition InnoTrans, Germany 2012 Talgo has developed recently a train known as \\"AVRIL\\" (Alta Velocidad Rueda Independiente Ligero ‚Äî Light High-Speed Independent Wheel), intended for speeds of . The system uses underfloor traction in the front and rear vehicles, with the intermediate carriages having the Talgo Pendular system (which cannot use motored axles on the axles corresponding to the system). Starting with the concept stage in 2009, it began dynamic testing on the Spanish high-speed network in 2014, and was approved in May 2016. It won its first major contract in November 2016, for the Mediterranean corridor in Spain, and its link to Paris. ==Variable Gauge Axles (VGA)== In addition to the multiple units with Variable Gauge Axles, Talgo built in 2005 a prototype of a VGA locomotive (the L-9202, TRAV-CA, 130-901 or Virgen del Buen Camino). ==See also== *Amtrak Cascades *Articulated car *EMD LWT12 *FM P-12-42 *Tilting train *UAC TurboTrain *Wheelset (railroad) *Haramain High Speed Rail Project ==References== ==External links== *Talgo official Site *Talgo America Web site (English) *Talgo Deutschland *Interactive 360¬∞ panoramas of the interiors of Talgo 7, Avril, Talgo 4 cama, Talgo 6 (DB) Category:Railway companies of Spain Category:Articulated passenger trains Category:Rolling stock manufacturers of Spain Category:Rolling stock innovations Category:Spanish brands Category:Rail infrastructure manufacturers ","title":"Talgo"},{"id":"517290","text":"Absolute may refer to: ==Companies== * Absolute Entertainment, a video game publisher * Absolute Radio, (formerly Virgin Radio), independent national radio station in the UK * Absolute Software Corporation, specializes in security and data risk management * Absolut Vodka, a brand of Swedish vodka ==Mathematics and science== * Absolute (geometry), the quadric at infinity * Absolute (perfumery), a fragrance substance produced by solvent extraction * Absolute magnitude, the brightness of a star * Absolute value, a notion in mathematics, commonly a number's numerical value without regard to its sign *Absolute temperature, a temperature on the thermodynamic temperature scale * Absolute zero, the lower limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale, -273.15 ¬∞C * Absoluteness in mathematical logic ==Music== * Absolute (production team), a pop music writing and production team * Absolute (record compilation), a brand of compilation albums from EVA Records * AbsolutePunk, a website, online community, and alternative music news source * Absolute (Aion album) by Japanese metal band Aion * Absolute (Time-Life album), an R&B; compilation album * Absolute, an album by post-punk band The Scientists * \\"Absolute\\", song by The Fray from the album The Fray * \\"Absolute\\", a single by Scritti Politti from the 1985 album Cupid & Psyche 85 * Absolute, an American R&B; vocal group in the 1990s ==Philosophy and religion== * Absolute (philosophy), a concept in philosophy * Absolute truth (Buddhism), describes the ultimate reality as \\"sunyata\\", empty of concrete and inherent characteristics ==Politics and law== * Absolute defence, a factual circumstance or argument that, if proven, will end the litigation in favor of the defendant * Absolute liability, a standard of legal liability found in tort and criminal law of various legal jurisdictions * Absolute monarchy, a monarchical form of government in which the monarch's powers are not limited by a constitution or by the law * Absolute majority, a majority of the membership of a group ==Other== * Absolute construction, a grammatical construction used in certain languages * Absolute Manage, a systems lifecycle management software suite * The Absolute (novel), a book in the Animorphs series * DC Comics Absolute Edition, a line of high-end comic book reprints * Absolute Press, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing == See also == * Absolutely (disambiguation) * Absolution (disambiguation) * Absolutism (disambiguation) ","title":"Absolute"},{"id":"517298","text":"A copy of Prince Esterhazy's baryton, on display at his palace in Eisenstadt. The baryton is a bowed string instrument similar to the viol, but distinguished by an extra set of plucked strings. It was in regular use in Europe until the end of the 18th century. ==Design== The baryton can be viewed as a sort of augmented bass viol. It is similar in size to the latter instrument and likewise has six or sevenGartrell (2003: 117) discusses the evidence for four-string barytons. Evidently all such cases either are barytons that were converted into cellos, or (in one instance) show evidence in the form of filled-in peg holes of an original form with six strings. strings of gut (typically D G C E A D, although scordatura was used), arranged over a fretted fingerboard and played with a bow. The instrument is held vertically and is supported by the player's legs (rather than with an end-pin as in the modern cello). The baryton differs from the bass viol in having an additional set of wire strings. These perform two functions: they vibrate sympathetically with the bowed strings, enriching the tone, and they can also be plucked by the left thumb of the performer, creating a contrasting tonal quality. As can be seen in the illustration, the bowed strings are placed on the right, where they can be easily fingered by the player's left hand. The plucked strings are on the left; they are reachable by the player's thumb from the rear, where the back of the instrument's neck is left open.Strunk (1932, 218) ==HistoryThe Historical Baryton=== A six-stringed baryton There are only about 50 historical barytons for which we have evidence, either in the form of documents or the instrument itself. Many of the latter have been modified from their original form. Thus, tracing the history of the baryton is a difficult task.Gartrell (2003: 116). Fruchtman (1962, 2) writes, \\"the history of the baryton is a curious assortment of isolated facts\\". Concerning the origin of the baryton, Pamplin suggests that \\"the instrument probably originated in England in the early 17th century when the characteristics of two instruments, the viola da gamba and the bandora, were combined into one hybrid instrument\\".Pamplin (2009) Early evidence for the existence of the baryton is found in Marin Mersenne's work Cogitata Physico-Mathematica (1644). According for Fruchtman, \\"Mersenne stated that the English constructed a viol or lyre much admired by King James. The instrument had six bowed strings as well as metal strings behind the neck. The thumb of the left hand plucked the metal strings, which were made to sound with the bowed notes. If this information is accurate, the baryton must have been known in England before 1625, the end of King James' reign.\\"Fruchtman (1962, 3) The earliest baryton that survives today dates from 1647; it was made by Magnus Feldlen in Vienna and is currently in the musical instrument collection of the Royal College of Music in London.Pamplin (2009) In London a performance at Marylebone Gardens was announced in 1744, Mr Ferrand was to perform on \\"the Pariton, an instrument never played on in public before\\".Quoted in Warwick William Wroth and Arthur Edgar Wroth, The London Pleasure Gardens of the Eighteenth Century, 1896:96. The instrument was never particularly popular, but \\"it acquired a certain cachet in courtly circles, particularly in south Germany and Austria\\" (Pamplin). The compositions for the instrument by Haydn and his students and colleagues represented a last hurrah for the baryton; by the early 19th century it had gone out of style and ceased to attract new compositions.Pamplin (2009) The Haydn-era baryton was different from earlier versions in a crucial respect: the sympathetic strings were tuned a full octave higher than previously. This helped the baryton to stand out from the other instruments (viola, cello) in the baryton trio,Pamplin (2009) the primary form in which Haydn wrote. Since the Haydn oeuvre tends to dominate the field today, the Haydn-type tuning has become the standard.Pamplin (2009) ===Modern revival=== Violinmaker Hans Benning of Benning Violins creating a Baryton in Los Angeles, 1963. The baryton was \\"completely neglected\\" (Hsu) in the nineteenth century, but in the twentieth, with the rise of the authentic performance movement in classical music, new barytons were built and played. Initially, these instruments were heavily constructed, more in the manner of a cello than a bass viol (they were thus sometimes called \\"cellitons\\"),Sadie and Pamplin (no date) but (much as with the parallel history of the harpsichord revival) eventually lighter instruments were constructed that more closely followed their historical antecedents. Probably the first person to initiate the revival of the baryton was Christian D√∂bereiner in Munich. In 1934 he ordered a copy of an instrument by Simon Sch√∂dler (1782) from the renowned luthier, Ferdinand Wilhelm Jaura in Munich. The first performance in modern times on that baryton took place in Munich in 1936, which featured a trio by Haydn. This instrument forms part of the Vazquez Collection of Historical String Instruments and is frequently employed in performance by the Orpheon Foundation. A complete documentation of the Jaura Baryton is available at the Orpheon Foundation web site. Among the modern active baryton players are Jeremy Brooker, Kazimierz Gruszczy≈Ñski, Bal√°zs Kakuk (Haydn Baryton Trio of Budapest), Jos√© Manuel Hern√°ndez, John Hsu, Roland Hutchinson, Jos√© V√°zquez, and Kenneth Slowik. With the revival of the baryton, a body of recorded work has gradually emerged. Several ensembles have produced recordings of individual works, and the Esterh√°zy Ensemble (Michael Br√ºssing, baryton) has issued a set of recordings that cover the entire Haydn oeuvre. The Swiss composer Klaus Huber has written an important solo part for the instrument in his work (2004). ==Repertoire== Of the repertoire for this instrument, the best known works are the 175 compositions written by Joseph Haydn for his patron, Prince Nikolaus Esterh√°zy, who enjoyed playing this instrument. Of these, 126 are trios for viola, cello and baryton. They were written in the earlier part of Haydn's career, from 1762 to 1775.Hsu, cited below Andreas Lidel was also noticeable for his compositions that included baryton. ==Nomenclature== According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the name of the instrument is a loan word from French baryton or Italian baritono, and ultimately derives from Greek bary- + tonos 'deep-pitched'. Alternate spellings include: bariton, barydon, paradon, paridon, pariton, viola paradon, viola di bordoni, [Italian] viola di bardone, [German] viola di bordone. The name lyra bastard is also sometimes used, though technically speaking it is incorrect. ==Notes== ==References== *Fruchtman, Efraim (1962) The baryton: its history and its music re-examined.

Tarrasch was born in Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw), Prussian Silesia. Having finished school in 1880, he left Breslau to study medicine in Halle. With his family, he settled in Nuremberg, Bavaria, and later in Munich, setting up a successful medical practice. He had five children. Tarrasch was Jewish, converted to Christianity in 1909,Chess Notes 5997 by Edward Winter (chess historian) and was a patriotic German who lost a son in World War I, yet he faced antisemitism in the early stages of the Third Reich. ==Chess career== Tarrasch A medical doctor by profession, Tarrasch may have been the best player in the world in the early 1890s. He scored heavily against the aging World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz in tournaments, (+3‚àí0=1), but refused an opportunity to challenge Steinitz for the world title in 1892 because of the demands of his medical practice. Siegbert Tarrasch and Mikhail Chigorin. Saint Petersburg, 1893 Soon afterwards, in St. Petersburg in 1893, Tarrasch drew a hard-fought match against Steinitz' challenger Mikhail Chigorin (+9‚àí9=4) after leading most of the way. He also won four major tournaments in succession: Breslau 1889, Manchester 1890, Dresden 1892, and Leipzig 1894. However, after Emanuel Lasker became world chess champion in 1894, Tarrasch could not match him. Fred Reinfeld wrote: \\"Tarrasch was destined to play second fiddle for the rest of his life.\\"Fred Reinfeld, Tarrasch's Best Games of Chess, David McKay Co., Philadelphia, 1947, p. xvii. For example, Lasker scored much better against mutual opponents, e.g. vs. Chigorin, Tarrasch had +2 over 34 games while Lasker scored +7 in 21; vs. Akiba Rubinstein Tarrasch was ‚àí8 without a single win, while Lasker scored +2‚àí1=2; vs. David Janowski Tarrasch scored +3 compared to Lasker's huge +22; vs. G√©za Mar√≥czy, Tarrasch was +1 over 16 games while Lasker scored +4‚àí0=1,Andy Soltis, Why Lasker Matters, Batsford, London, 2005, p. 161; vs. Richard Teichmann Tarrasch scored +8‚àí5=2,Chessgames.com database while Lasker beat him all four tournament games.Chessgames.com database However, Tarrasch had a narrow plus score against Harry Nelson Pillsbury of +6‚àí5=2,Chessgames.com database while Lasker was even +5‚àí5=4.Chessgames.com database Still, Tarrasch remained a powerful player, demolishing Frank Marshall in a match in 1905 (+8‚àí1=8), and winning Ostend 1907 over Schlechter, Janowski, Marshall, Burn, and Chigorin. There was no love lost between Tarrasch and Lasker. The story goes that when they were introduced at the opening of their 1908 championship match, Tarrasch clicked his heels, bowed stiffly, and said, \\"To you, Dr. Lasker, I have only three words, check and mate\\"‚Äîthen left the room.Harold C. Schoenberg, Grandmasters of Chess, W.W. Norton & Co., New York, Rev. Ed. 1981, p. 124. When Lasker finally agreed to a title match in 1908, he beat Tarrasch convincingly +8‚àí3=5. Tarrasch continued to be one of the leading players in the world for a while. He finished fourth in the very strong St. Petersburg 1914 chess tournament, behind only World Champion Lasker and future World Champions Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca and Alexander Alekhine, and ahead of Marshall, Ossip Bernstein, Rubinstein, Nimzowitsch, Blackburne, Janowski, and Gunsberg. His win against Capablanca in the 19th round, though much less famous than Lasker's win against Capablanca the round before, was essential to enable Lasker to achieve his famous come-from-behind victory over Capablanca in the tournament. This tournament was probably Tarrasch's swan song, because his chess career was not very successful after this, although he still played some highly regarded games. ==Chess teachings== Tarrasch was a very influential chess writer, and was called Praeceptor Germaniae, meaning \\"Teacher of Germany.\\" He took some of Wilhelm Steinitz's ideas (e.g. control of the center, , ) and made them more accessible to the average chess player. In other areas he departed from Steinitz. He emphasized piece much more than Steinitz did, and disliked cramped positions, saying that they \\"had the germ of defeat.\\" Tarrasch formulated a very important rule in rook endgames that is often called the Tarrasch rule: :The rooks belong behind passed pawns, behind their own in order to support their advance, behind the enemy's in order to impede their advance.Tarrasch, St Petersburg 1914: International Chess Tournament, translated by Dr Robert Maxham, Caissa Editions, Yorklyn, DE, 1993, ‚Äîcomment on Frank James Marshall vs Emanuel Lasker, St. Petersburg (1914), rd 3, Apr-24, p. 83, emphasis in original. ===Chess publications=== In 1895, Tarrasch's book Dreihundert Schachpartien was published. It was first translated into English in 1959 by Robin Ault and John Kirwan in a limited edition and in a commercial edition in 1999 when S. Schwarz put out Three Hundred Chess Games. Tarrasch released Die moderne Schachpartie in 1912, but it has not been translated yet. He wrote a famous book about the St. Petersburg 1914 chess tournament, which was translated into English in 1993. His fourth major book Das Schachspiel (1931), was translated by G. E. Smith and T. G. Bone as The Game of Chess (1935, ). It was his last book and his most successful. He edited the magazine Deutsche Schachzeitung in 1897, and Tarrasch's Schachzeitung, for the last two years of his life.The Game of Chess, Introduction ==Clash with hypermodern school== He was a target of the hypermodern school, led by Richard R√©ti, Aron Nimzowitsch, and Savielly Tartakower, all of whom criticized his ideas as dogmatic. However, many modern masters regard Tarrasch's actual play as not dogmatic. For example, Tarrasch annotated his victory on the Black side of the Advance French against Louis Paulsen (Nuremberg 1888): :1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Qb6 6. Bd3 cxd4 Tarrasch gives this an exclamation mark, and points out that 6...Bd7 allows 7.dxc5 with a good game. However, most accounts credit Nimzowitsch with such anti-dogmatic hypermodern inventiveness when he played 7.dxc5 against Gersz Salwe almost a quarter of a century later. 7\\\\. cxd4 Bd7 8.

Rg7+ Kh8 ==Contributions to opening theory== A number of chess openings are named after Tarrasch, with the most notable being: *The Tarrasch Defense, Tarrasch's favorite line against the Queen's Gambit in which Black takes on an isolated queen's pawn: 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 c5!? 4.cxd5 exd5. A main line is then 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.g3 Nf6 7.Bg2 Be7 8.0-0 0-0. Tarrasch famously proclaimed, \\"The future will decide who has erred in estimating this defense, I or the chess world!\\"; today it is considered sound, though unfashionable. *The Tarrasch Variation of the French Defense (3.Nd2), which Tarrasch late in his career considered to be refuted by 3...c5 4.exd5 exd5, with Black again \\"acquiring\\" an isolated queen's pawn. This is not thought a refutation today, but is still one of Black's most important lines. *The Tarrasch Variation of the Ruy Lopez, usually known as the Open Defense (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Nxe4). ==Famous Tarrasch combinations== In the game Tarrasch versus Allies, Black seems to be holding here (at least against immediate catastrophe), because the black queen guards against Qb7+ (followed by Kxa5 Ra1#), while the black rook on c8 defends against Rxc5#. Tarrasch played the ingenious interference move 31.Bc7! (known as a Plachutta interference because the pieces both move orthogonally). This blocks off both defences, and whatever piece captures becomes overloaded. That is, if 31...Rxc7, the rook is overloaded, having to look after both the key squares, since the queen is blocked from b7. So White would play 32.Qb7+ Rxb7, deflecting the rook from defence of c5, allowing 33.Rxc5#. But if Black plays instead 31...Qxc7, the queen blocks off the rook's defence of c5 and becomes overloaded: 32.Rxc5+ Qxc5 deflects the queen from defence of b7, allowing 33.Qb7+ Kxa5 34.Ra1#. Black actually resigned after this move. In the game against Walbrodt, Tarrasch played rather poorly, and his opponent had the better of it for a long time. But the game is redeemed by the following startling combination: 34.Rxd4 seems obvious, because 34...cxd4 allows 35.Bxd4 winning the queen. But Black has a seemingly strong counterattack which had to be foreseen ... 34...Nxg3 35.Nxg3 Rxg3+ 36.hxg3 Rxg3+ 37.Kf1! Rxd3 and now the startling 38.Rg4!! with devastating threats of 39. Rf8+ mating and Bxe5 not to mention cxd3 to follow. Black resigned. ==See also== *Tarrasch Defense *Tarrasch Trap *Tarrasch rule ==References== Bibliography * Isidore Singer, Tarrasch, Siegbert, in Jewish Encyclopedia Vol 12. * Andrew Soltis, Grandmaster Secrets: Endings (1997, 2003, ) * Wolfgang Kamm: Siegbert Tarrasch, Leben und Werk (2004, ). * Alfred Brinckmann: Siegbert Tarrasch, Lehrmeister der Schachwelt (1963). == External links == * * Ballo, Harald (1996).

He is best known for his single \\"Stab\\" which peaked at number 18 on the ARIA charts in 2004. ==Career1990s-2002: Early years=== Mandy Kane started playing in high school rock bands and worked I part-time jobs to save money to buy a 4-track recorder. He says his songs are inspired by a variety of rock icons from bygone eras ‚Äì from David Bowie and Gary Numan to The Beatles and Pink Floyd. Seeking other outlets to develop his musical and theatrical sensibilities, he joined local drama groups and rallied locals to play in his band. After he had produced a number of songs with his basic home recording setup, Kane started sending out demos to record companies and managers. Michael Newton of Roundhouse Entertainment can be credited with discovering Kane and taking on a management role in the early stages of his career. Newton's involvement resulted in a publishing deal with Mushroom Music after Michael Gudinski attended one of Kane's showcases at Revolver Upstairs. Kane was eventually signed by Warner Music Australasia. ===2003-2005: Tragic Daydreams=== Mandy Kane relocated to Los Angeles to work with producers Chris Vrenna and Joe Chiccarelli. Tony Espie was commissions to mix Kane's recordings, which were then mastered at The Exchange in London. Mandy Kane's debut single, \\"Stab\\" was released in July 2003. The single is both a statement against teen suicide and a reference to the 'stabbing' Numanesque synths featured throughout. \\"Stab\\" peaked at number 18 in the ARIA charts. \\"Billy Bones\\" was released as the second single in October 2003, reaching number 27 in the ARIA charts. Billy Bones is a fictitious character, vaguely based on Kane's experimentation with home recording equipment as a teenager. A third single titled \\"Stupid Friday\\" was released in March 2004 and peaked at number number 36 in the ARIA charts. Mandy Kane's debut album Tragic Daydreams was released in April 2004 and peaked at number 79 on the ARIA Charts. To promote the album, Kane toured extensively with the original line-up expanded to include Zakk Zedras (Roxus, Serpentine, Red Circle & Rie Nakayama. Kane played a showcase gig at the Australian premiere of the Matrix Revolutions before an audience including Keanu Reeves. This line-up also toured with Marilyn Manson. Mandy Kane's cover version of \\"Ordinary World\\" by Duran Duran features on the soundtrack to the Australian movie \\"One Perfect Day.\\" ===2006-present: Independent releases=== In 2006, Mandy Kane formed his own independent label, \\"Mummy's Boy Records\\" (which would later be renamed \\"The Majestika Creative\\"), through which he released his first independent single, \\"Hanky Panky\\" as a digital download. It features on the EP, \\"Murder in the Daylight\\", which was released in April 2006. Mandy Kane commissioned the then fledgling band Van She to remix the title track from the EP as its second single. The track received an Honourable Mention in the Billboard Song Contest. In May 2008, Mandy Kane released the stand-alone digital single \\"Far From Oblivion\\". He also recorded an acoustic version to include as a B-side. In 2009 Mandy Kane released the single \\"25 Seconds\\". Gary Numan and his producer Ade Fenton were commissioned to remix the song. This remix received considerable rotation on radio and at clubs in Australia and abroad, with Numan himself praising Kane for his songwriting ability. In November 2015, Mandy Kane released the EP Darkness and Divine as well as a re-recording of his debut studio titled Tragic Daydreams Reimagined. ==Artist development, production and management== In addition to continuing to produce and release his own material, Mandy Kane has worked as a producer and manager for several other artists. Mandy Kane worked with Nathaniel Willemse, during which time he co-wrote and produced several songs which resulted in the release of a debut EP for the artist titled Vertigo. The title track, a cover of the popular U2 single, was marketed as part of a Video Hits competition which gave the release four weeks of consecutive rotation on commercial television in Australia. From 2009‚Äì2012, Kane assisted in developing and co- managed Australian act Dancing Heals. He mixed their debut EP Out of This and produced their debut album Into the Night, which was recorded at Red Door Sounds. Kane accompanied the band on a tour of North America in 2010, which saw the band play to sold out venues as well as establishing international fans and industry contacts. The album was well received by reviewers and the public alike, with the single \\"Diamonds\\" enjoying five weeks of repeated rotation on Australia's prime music video television program \\"Rage\\". International audiences also responded favourably, with \\"Into The Night\\" debuting in the Top 20 specialty radio charts in the US. ==DiscographyAlbums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" + List of albums with selected details ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:11em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:17em;\\" Details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\"  Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"  AUS - ! scope=\\"row\\" Tragic Daydreams  * Released: April 2004 * Label: Warner Music Australia (2564601702) * Format: CD, digital download  79 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Tragic Daydreams Reimagined  * Released: November 2015 * Label: Warner Music Australia (2564601702) * Format: digital download, streaming  - } ===Extended Plays=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" + List of EPss with selected details ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"width:11em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"width:17em;\\" Details - ! scope=\\"row\\" Murder in the Daylight  * Released: April 2006 * Label: Mummy's Boy Records (MBRCD00106) * Format: CD, digital download - ! scope=\\"row\\" Darkness and Divine  * Released: 27 November 2015 * Label: Majestika Creative * Format: Digital download, streaming - } ===Singles=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of singles as lead artist and chart position ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:20em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:1em;\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\"  Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:11em;\\" Album - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" AUS - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Stab\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2003  18  rowspan=\\"3\\" Tragic Daydreams - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Billy Bones\\"  27 - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Stupid Friday\\"  2004  36 - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Hanky Panky\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2006  -  rowspan=\\"2\\" Murder in the Daylight - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Murder in the Daylight\\"  - - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Far from Oblivion\\"  2008  -  rowspan=\\"2\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"25 Seconds\\"  2009  - } ==References== Category:Australian rock musicians Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Mandy Kane"},{"id":"517323","text":"Nawab (Bengali: ‡¶®‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶¨/‡¶®‡¶ì‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶æ‡¶¨, Urdu:ŸÜŸàÿßÿ®, Devanagari: ‡§®‡§µ‡§æ‡§¨/‡§®‡§¨‡§æ‡§¨, Persian-Arab: ŸÜŸàÿßÿ®, Hindi: ‡§®‡§µ‡§æ‡§¨‡§∂‡§æ‡§π, ‡§®‡§µ‡§æ‡§¨) also spelt Nawaab, Navaab, Navab, Nowab, Nabob, Nawaabshah, Nawabshah or Nobab, is a Royal title indicating a sovereign ruler, often of a South Asian state, in many ways comparable to the western titles of King. The relationship of a Nawab to the Emperor of India has been compared to that of the Kings of Saxony to the German Emperor. In earlier times the title was ratified and bestowed by the reigning Mughal emperor to semi-autonomous Muslim rulers of subdivisions or princely states in the Indian subcontinent loyal to the Mughal Empire i.e. Nawabs of Bengal. The title is common among Muslim rulers of South Asia as an equivalent to the title Maharaja, however it is not exclusive to Muslims only. \\"Nawab\\" usually refers to males and literally means Viceroy; the female equivalent is \\"Begum\\" or \\"Nawab Begum\\". The primary duty of a Nawab was to uphold the sovereignty of the Mughal emperor along with the administration of a certain province. The title of \\"nawabi\\" was also awarded as a personal distinction by the paramount power, similar to a British peerage, to persons and families who ruled a princely state for various services to the government of British India. In some cases, the titles were also accompanied by jagir grants, either in cash revenues and allowances or land-holdings. During the British Raj, some of the chiefs, or sardars, of large or important tribes were also given the title, in addition to traditional titles already held by virtue of chieftainship. The term \\"zamindari \\" was originally used for the subahdar (provincial governor) or viceroy of a subah (province) or region√ü of the Mughal empire. ==History== Robert Clive, meeting with Nawab Mir Jafar after the Battle of Plassey, by Francis Hayman General Nawab Sir Sadeq Mohammad Khan V, the last ruling Nawab of Bahawalpur Nawab is a Hindustani term, used in Urdu, Hindi, Bengali and many other North-Indian languages, borrowed via Persian from the Arabic honorific plural of naib, or \\"deputy.\\" In some areas, especially Bengal, the term is pronounced nobab. This later variation has also entered English and other foreign languages as nabob. diwan of a Mughal nawab The term \\"Nawaab\\" is often used to refer to any Muslim ruler in north or south India while the term \\"nizam\\" is preferred for a senior official‚Äîit literally means \\"governor of region\\". The Nizam of Hyderabad had several nawabs under him: Nawabs of Cuddapah, Sira, Rajahmundry, Kurnool, Chicacole, et al. \\"Nizam\\" was his personal title, awarded by the Mughal Government and based on the term \\"Nazim\\" as meaning \\"senior officer\\". \\"Nazim\\" is still used for a district collector in many parts of India. The term \\"nawab\\" is still technically imprecise, as the title was also awarded to Hindus and Sikhs, as well, and large zamindars and not necessarily to all Muslim rulers. With the decline of that empire, the title, and the powers that went with it, became hereditary in the ruling families in the various provinces. Under later British rule, nawabs continued to rule various princely states of Awadh, Amb, Bahawalpur, Balasinor, Baoni, Banganapalle, Bhopal, Cambay, Jaora, Junagadh, Kurnool (the main city of Deccan), Kurwai, Mamdot, Multan, Palanpur, Pataudi, Radhanpur, Rampur, Malerkotla, Sachin, Rajoli and Tonk. Other former rulers bearing the title, such as the nawabs of Bengal and Oudh, had been dispossessed by the British or others by the time the Mughal dynasty finally ended in 1857. Some princes became Nawab by promotion, e.g. the ruler of Palanpur was \\"diwan\\" until 1910, then \\"nawab sahib\\". Other nawabs were promoted are restyled to another princely style, or to and back, e.g. in Rajgarh a single rawat (rajah) went by nawab. The style for a nawab's queen is begum. Most of the nawab dynasties were male primogenitures, although several ruling Begums of Bhopal were a notable exception. Before the incorporation of the Subcontinent into the British Empire, nawabs ruled the kingdoms of Awadh (or Oudh, encouraged by the British to shed the Mughal suzerainty and assume the imperial style of Badshah), Bengal, Arcot and Bhopal. ==Ruling nawab families== The Procession of Yusef Ali Khan, a painting depicting Yusef Khan on his way to an encampment for the durbar held at Fatehgarh in 1859 ===Families ruling when acceding to India=== * Nawab of Akbarpur - Asmatara Farida Begum * Nawab Mir Osman Ali Khan Bahadur, the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad * Nawab of Ashwath * Nawab Babi of Balasinor * Nawab of Banganapalle, previously Masulipatam * Nawab of Baoni * Nawab of Basai, Nawab Khwaja Muhammad Khan * Nawab of Berar styled Mirza of Berar (under the Nizam of Hyderabad) * Nawab of Bhikampur and Datawali (Aligarh) * Nawab of Bhopal (female rulers were known as Nawab Begum of Bhopal) * Nawabs of Cambay (Kambay) * the former Nawabs of the Carnatic, restyled Princes of Arcot * Nawab of Dujana * Nawab of Farrukhabad * Nawab of Jaora * Nawab Sahib of Junagadh * Nawab of Maler Kotla * Nawab of Muhammadgar * Nawab Sahib of Palanpur (till 1910 styled Diwan) *Nawab of Awadh * Nawab of Pathari * Nawab of Radhanpur * Nawab of Rajoli, India * Nawab of Rampur * Nawab of Sachin * Nawab of Sardhana * Nawab of Tonk, India ===Former dynasties of princely states in India abolished before independence=== * Nawab of Kurwai * Nawab of Pataudi * Nawab of Savanur * Nawab of Mamdot * Nawab of Tarakote State * Nawab of Farukhnagar * Nawab of Jhajjar * Nawab of Surat ===Families ruling when acceding to Pakistan (including present Bangladesh)=== * Nawab of Amb * Nawab of Bahawalpur * Nawab of Dhaka * Nawab of Dir * Nawab Sahib of Junagadh * Nawab of Karnal, (Mandal-e-Nausherwani) * Nawab of Kharan * Nawab of Makran * Nawab of Maler Kotla * Nawab of Kalabagh (Mianwali District) ===Former dynasties which became political pensioners=== * Padshah-i-Oudh, formerly Nawab Wazir of Awadh, :: also imperial Wazir of all Mughal India, both hereditary * Nawabs of Bengal, as Nawabs of Murshidabad * Nawab of Marauli * Nawab of Patna * Nawab of Surat * Nawab of Longla (Sylhet) === Rohilla Confederation=== All of these states were at some point under the authority of the Nawab of Rohilkhand, later made the Nawab of Rampur.

For the Muslim elite various Mughal-type titles were introduced, including nawab. Among the noted British creations of this type were Nawab Hashim Ali Khan (1858‚Äì1940), Nawab Khwaja Abdul Ghani (1813‚Äì1896), Nawab Abdul Latif (1828‚Äì1893), Nawab Faizunnesa Choudhurani (1834‚Äì1904), Nawab Ali Chowdhury (1863‚Äì1929), Nawaab Syed Shamsul Huda (1862‚Äì1922), Nawab Sirajul Islam (1848‚Äì1923), Nawab Alam yar jung Bahadur, M.A, Madras, B.A., B.C.L., Barr-At-Law (1890‚Äì1974). There also were the Nawabs of Dhanbari, Nawabs of Ratanpur, Nawabs of Baroda and such others. ===Nawab as a court rank=== A picture of whom is believed to be the first ever \\"Nawab\\" of Mughal Empire, \\"Saadat Ali Khan I\\" of Awadh. Nawab was also the rank title‚Äîagain not an office‚Äîof a much lower class of Muslim nobles‚Äîin fact retainers‚Äîat the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad and Berar State, ranking only above Khan Bahadur and Khan, but under (in ascending order) Jang, Daula, Mulk, Umara and Jah; the equivalent for Hindu courtiers was Raja Bahadur. ==Derived titlesNawabzada=== The Nawab of Bengal, Mir Qasim 1757 This style, adding the Persian suffix -zada which means son (or other male descendants; see other cases in prince), etymologically fits a nawbab's sons, but in actual practice various dynasties established other customs. For example, in Bahawalpur only the nawbab's heir apparent used nawabzada before his personal name, then Khan Abassi, finally Wali Ahad Bahadur (an enhancement of Wali Ehed), while the other sons of the ruling nawab used the style sahibzada before the personal name and only Khan Abassi behind. \\"Nawabzadi\\" implies daughters of the reigning nawbab. Elsewhere, there were rulers who were not styled nawbab yet awarded a title nawabzada to others. ===Naib (Ottoman, Iranian, Arabic title)=== The word naib () has been historically used to refer to any local leader in some parts of the Ottoman Empire, successive early modern Iranian kingdoms (Safavids, etc.), and in the eastern Caucasus (e.g. during Caucasian Imamate). Today, the word is used to refer to directly elected legislators in lower houses of parliament in many Arabic-speaking areas to contrast them against officers of upper houses (or Shura). The term Majlis al-Nuwwab (, literally council of deputies) has been adopted as the name of several legislative lower houses and unicameral legislatures. \\"Naib\\" has also been used in the Malay language (especially of the Malaysian variant) to translate the component of \\"deputy\\" or \\"vice\\" in certain titles (e.g \\"Vice President\\" - Naib Presiden) aside from timbalan and wakil (latter predominant in the Indonesian variant). ==\\"Nabob\\", derived colloquial term== In colloquial usage in English (since 1612),Origin of NABOB, Merriam-Webster.com. Retrieved 16 September 2010. adopted in other Western languages, the transliteration \\"nabob\\" refers to commoners: a merchant-leader of high social status and wealth. \\"Nabob\\" derives from the Bengali pronunciation of \\"nawab\\": n√¥bab. During the 18th century in particular, it was widely used as a disparaging term for British merchants or administrators who, having made a fortune in India, returned to Britain and aspired to be recognised as having the higher social status that their new wealth would enable them to maintain. Jos Sedley in Thackeray's Vanity Fair is probably the best known example in fiction. From this specific usage it came to be sometimes used for ostentatiously rich businesspeople in general. \\"Nabob\\" can also be used metaphorically for people who have a grandiose sense of their own importance, as in the famous alliterative dismissal of the news media as \\"nattering nabobs of negativism\\" in a speech that was delivered by Nixon's vice president Spiro Agnew and written by William Safire.\\"nattering nabobs of negativism\\", PoliticalDictionary.com.

Though born in England, Wilson was a resident of Ireland for over 50 years. ==Early life== Wilson was born in Islington, London. His father, a chemist, died when James was only four days old, leaving his widowed mother to bring up three sons alone. Without any family background in music (the only real interest was his mother's slight interest in playing the piano), Wilson began piano lessons in 1931 (at the age of nine), continuing them until 1938. While in his early teens, Wilson attended many operas which fostered his interest in music. After school, and without any formal higher education, Wilson entered the Civil Service after having passed their entrance exam. He served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, from 1942 till 1946. Having finished his military service, Wilson began attending weekly musical composition classes at the Trinity College of Music in London. It was around this time that he left the Civil Service to pursue a full-time career in music. In 1948 he moved to Ireland, where he had been stationed in the latter part of his naval service. ==Musical work== Wilson was a largely self-taught composer. He experimented with many musical styles but did not particularly adhere to any of them. He had an interest in some less typical instruments, and wrote substantial works for the free-bass accordion, the cor anglais, and an electrically modified flute. Wilson's creative output was large and varied: seven operas, three symphonies, twelve concertos, several ballets, about two hundred songs, and a large number of other choral and instrumental works. His works have been performed and broadcast throughout Ireland, the UK, and Scandinavia. Wilson was professor of composition at the Royal Irish Academy of Music. For many years he was also the course director of the annual Ennis/IMRO Composition Summer School. Wilson was a founder-member of Aosd√°na, an association of people in Ireland who have achieved distinction in the arts. In 1999 Wilson became an Irish citizen. He died just six years later in Dublin, on 6 August 2005. He was working on an eighth opera at the time of his death. ==Selected works== Opera *Grinning at the Devil *Letters to Theo *The Hunting of the Snark (children's opera) *Twelfth Night Concerti *For Sarajevo, Calico Pie (triple concerto) *Concerto Giocoso ==Quotations== *Music is the nearest thing that we know to magic: its powers have still to be understood. *In my own work, I seek for clarity and economy and, above all, for the quality of lyricism. ==Bibliography== *Axel Klein: Die Musik Irlands im 20.

Originally performed at Sufi shrines or dargahs throughout South Asia, it gained mainstream popularity and an international audience in late 20th century. Qawwali music received international exposure through the work of Aziz Mian, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Sabri Brothers largely due to several releases on the Real World label, followed by live appearances at WOMAD festivals. Other famous Qawwali singers include Fareed Ayyaz & Abu Muhammad, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Badar Maindad, Rizwan & Moazzam Duo, the late Amjad Sabri, Wadali Brothers, Nizami Bandhu and Bahauddin Qutbuddin. Most modern Qawwali singers including Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Fareed Ayyaz & Abu Muhammad belong to the famed 'Qawwal Bachon ka Gharana' school of Qawwali, which was based in Delhi. ==Definition== Qawl () is an \\"utterance (of the prophet)\\", QawwƒÅl is someone who often repeats (sings) a Qaul, QawwƒÅli is what a QawwƒÅl sings. ==Origins== Delhi's Sufi saint Amir Khusrow of the Chisti order of Sufis is credited with fusing the Persian, Arabic, Turkish, and Indian traditions in the late 13th century in India to create Qawwali as we know it today., Retrieved 16 September 2015 The word Sama is often still used in Central Asia and Turkey to refer to forms very similar to Qawwali, and in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the formal name used for a session of Qawwali is Mehfil-e-Sama. Originally, musical instrument use in Qawwali was prohibited. The following conditions were initially placed on Qawwali: Moreover, such Sufi Saints, such as Nizamuddin Auliya, the teacher of the famous Sufi singer, Amir Khusrow, were quite blunt about the prohbition: Eventually however, musical instrument use found its way into Qawwali and modern performers of musical Qawwali will justify their use of instruments by saying that the Sufi Saints do not stop them when they use them near their shrines. Instruments such as Harmoniums, tabla and dholak are now common in many Qawwali parties. ==Song content== The songs which constitute the qawwali repertoire are primarily in Persian, Urdu, Hindi, Bengali and Punjabi. There are some in Persian from the Mughal era, and a smattering in Saraiki and dialects of north India like Braj Bhasha and Awadhi. There is also qawwali in some regional languages but the regional language tradition is relatively obscure. Also, the sound of the regional language qawwali can be totally different from that of mainstream qawwali. This is certainly true of Chhote Babu Qawwal, whose style of singing is much closer to the Bengali Baul music than to the qawwali of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, for example. The poetry is implicitly understood to be spiritual in its meaning, even though the lyrics can sometimes sound wildly secular, or outright hedonistic. The central themes of qawwali are love, devotion and longing (of man for the Divine). Qawwalis are classified by their content into several categories: * A hamd (ÿ≠ŸÖÿØ), Arabic for praise, is a song in praise of Allah. Traditionally, a qawwali performance starts with a hamd. * A na\`at (ŸÜÿπÿ™), Arabic for description, is a song in praise of Muhammad. The opening hamd is traditionally followed by a naat. * A manqabat (plural manaqib, ŸÖŸÜÿßŸÇÿ®, which means characteristics) is a song in praise of either Imam Ali or one of the Sufi saints. Manaqib in praise of Ali are sung at both Sunni and Shi'a gatherings. If one is sung, it will follow right after the naat. There is usually at least one manqabat in a traditional programme. * A marsiya (ŸÖÿ±ÿ´Ÿäÿ©), Arabic for lamentation for a dead person, is a lamentation over the death of much of Imam Husayn family in the Battle of Karbala. This would typically be sung only at a Shi'a gathering. diwan of a Mughal nawab * A ghazal (ÿ∫ÿ≤ŸÑ), Arabic for love song, is a song that sounds secular on the face of it. There are two extended metaphors that run through ghazals‚Äîthe joys of drinking and the agony of separation from the beloved. These songs feature exquisite poetry, and can certainly be taken at face value, and enjoyed at that level., Google Books Article, Retrieved 17 September 2015 In fact, in Pakistan and India, ghazal is also a separate, distinct musical genre in which many of the same songs are performed in a different musical style, and in a secular context. In the context of that genre, the songs are usually taken at face value, and no deeper meaning is necessarily implied. But in the context of qawwali, these songs of intoxication and yearning use secular metaphors to poignantly express the soul's longing for union with the Divine, and its joy in loving the Divine. In the songs of intoxication, \\"wine\\" represents \\"knowledge of the Divine\\", the \\"cup-bearer\\" (saaqi) is God or a spiritual guide, the \\"tavern\\" is the metaphorical place where the soul may (or may not) be fortunate enough to attain spiritual enlightenment. (The \\"tavern\\" is emphatically not a conventional house of worship. Rather, it is taken to be the spiritual context within which the soul exists.) Intoxication is attaining spiritual knowledge, or being filled with the joy of loving the Divine. In the songs of yearning, the soul, having been abandoned in this world by that cruel and cavalier lover, God, sings of the agony of separation, and the depth of its yearning for reunion. * A kafi is a poem in Punjabi, Seraiki or Sindhi, which is in the unique style of poets such as Sultan Bahoo, Shah Hussain, Bulleh Shah and Sachal Sarmast. Two of the more well-known Kafis include Ni Main Jana Jogi De Naal and Mera Piya Ghar Aaya. * A munajaat (ŸÖŸÜÿßÿ¨ÿßÿ©), Arabic for a conversation in the night or a form of prayer, is a song where the singer displays his thanks to Allah through a variety of linguistic techniques. It is often sung in Persian, with Mawlana JalƒÅl-ad-Dƒ´n Rumi credited as its author. ==Composition of a qawwali party== A group of qawwali musicians, called a party (or Humnawa in Urdu), typically consists of eight or nine men including a lead singer, one or two side singers, one or two harmoniums (which may be played by the lead singer, side singer or someone else), and percussion. If there is only one percussionist, he plays the tabla and dholak, usually the tabla with the dominant hand and the dholak with the other one (i.e. a left- handed percussionist would play the tabla with his left hand). Often there will be two percussionists, in which case one might play the tabla and the other the dholak. There is also a chorus of four or five men who repeat key verses, and who aid percussion by hand-clapping. The performers sit cross- legged on the ground in two rows -- the lead singer, side singers and harmonium players in the front row, and the chorus and percussionists in the back row. Before the fairly recent introduction of the harmonium, qawwalis were usually accompanied by the sarangi. The sarangi had to be retuned between songs; the harmonium didn't, and was soon preferred. Women used to be excluded from traditional Muslim music, since they are traditionally prohibited from singing in the presence of men. These traditions have changed, however, as is evident by the popularity (and acceptance) of female singers such as Abida Parveen. However, qawwali has remained an exclusively male business. There are still no mainstream female qawwals. Although kafi singer Abida Parveen has increasingly incorporated qawwali techniques into her performances, she is still not considered a qawwali singer. ==Musical structure of Qawwali== Songs are usually between 15 and 30 minutes long. However, the longest commercially released qawwali runs slightly over 115 minutes (Hashr Ke Roz Yeh Poochhunga by Aziz Mian Qawwal). The qawwali maestro Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan has at least two songs that are more than 60 minutes long. Qawwalis tend to begin gently and build steadily to a very high energy level in order to induce hypnotic states both among the musicians and within the audience. Almost all Qawwalis are based on a Raga from the Hindustani classical music tradition. Songs are usually arranged as follows: # They start with an instrumental prelude where the main melody is played on the harmonium, accompanied by the tabla, and which may include improvised variations of the melody. # Then comes the alap, a long tonal improvised melody during which the singers intone different long notes, in the raga of the song to be played. # The lead singer begins to sing some preamble verses which are typically not part of the main song, although thematically related to it. These are sung unrhythmically, improvised following the raga, and accompanied only by the harmonium. After the lead singer sings a verse, one of the side singers will repeat the verse, perhaps with his own improvisation. A few or many verses will be sung in this way, leading into the main song. # As the main song begins, the tabla, dholak and clapping begin. All members join in the singing of the verses that constitute the refrain. The lyrics of the main verses are never improvised; in fact, these are often traditional songs sung by many groups, especially within the same lineage. However, the tunes are subtly improvised within the framework of the main melody. As the song proceeds, the lead singer or one of the side singers may break out into an alap. Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan also popularized the interjection of sargam singing at this point. The song usually builds in tempo and passion, with each singer trying to outdo the other in terms of vocal acrobatics. Some singers may do long periods of sargam improvisation, especially alternating improvisations with a student singer. The songs usually end suddenly. The singing style of qawwali is different from Western singing styles in many ways. For example, in words beginning with an \\"m\\", Western singers are apt to stress the vowel following the \\"m\\" rather than the \\"m\\" itself, whereas in qawwali, the \\"m\\" will usually be held, producing a muted tone. Also in qawwali, there is no distinction between what is known as the chest voice and the head voice (the different areas that sound will resonate in depending on the frequency sung). Rather, qawwals sing very loudly and forcefully, which allows them to extend their chest voice to much higher frequencies than those used in Western singing, even though this usually causes a more noisy or strained sound than would be acceptable in the West. == Traditional sequence of a Chishtiya Sufi Order qawwali performance == * Instrumental: This is supposed to be the announcement of the arrival of Moinuddin Chishti, as Sufi believes their saints are free of time-space. Also that Nabi, Siddiq, Shaheed, and Saleh category of faithfuls are never dead, just gone into some other state from where they visit whenever they are mentioned, especially if there is a function in their honor. * Hamd * Na\`at * Manqabat Ali * Manqabats in praise of Sufi saints * Manqabat Shaikh: Praise of the Shaikh/Pir if the performance is at an Urs celebration * Rang or Badhawa: If it is an Urs performance, then it is usually Rang, a poem by Amir Khusro. The audience is often asked to stand when the Rang is sung. If it is the Shaikh's birthday, it is usually the Badhawa. == Notable Qawwals of the past 70 years == * Aziz Mian * Badar Ali Khan, aka Badar Miandad * Bahauddin Qutbuddin * Fateh Ali Khan * Habib Painter * Iqbal Hussain Khan Bandanawazi * Jaafar Husain Khan Badauni * Munshi Raziuddin * Nizami Bandhu * Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan * Qari Muhammad Saeed Chishti * Sabri Brothers * Wadali Brothers * Warsi Brothers ==Current and recent Qawwals== * Ateeq Hussain Khan * Abdullah Manzoor Niazi * Faiz Ali Faiz * Fareed Ayaz * Mehr Ali Sher Ali * Nizami Bandhu * Rahat Fateh Ali Khan * Rizwan Muazzam * Waheed and Naveed Chishti * Warsi Brothers ==See also== * Filmi qawwali * Islamic music * Music of Bangladesh * Music of India * Music of Pakistan * Religious ecstasy * Sama (Sufism) * Sufi music * Urban Qawwali ==References== ==External links== * BBC Radio 3 Audio (45 minutes): The Nizamuddin shrine in Delhi.

Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery, 1565 by Pieter Bruegel, Oil on panel, 24cm x 34cm. Christ and the woman taken in adultery, drawing by Rembrandt Jesus and the woman taken in adultery (often called Pericope Adulterae for short) is a passage (pericope) found in the Gospel of John , that has been the subject of much scholarly discussion. In the passage, Jesus has sat down in the temple to teach some of the people, after he spent the previous night at the Mount of Olives. A group of scribes and Pharisees confronts Jesus, interrupting his teaching session. They bring in a woman, accusing her of committing adultery, claiming she was caught in the very act. They ask Jesus whether the punishment for someone like her should be stoning, as prescribed by Mosaic Law. Jesus first ignores the interruption and writes on the ground as though he does not hear them. But when the woman's accusers continue their challenge, he states that the one who is without sin is the one who should cast the first stone. The accusers and congregants depart realising not one of them is without sin, leaving Jesus alone with the woman. Jesus asks the woman if anyone has condemned her. and she answers no. Jesus says that he, too, does not condemn her, and tells her to go and sin no more. Many analysts of the Greek text and manuscripts of the Gospel of John have argued that it was \\"certainly not part of the original text of St. John's Gospel.\\"'Pericope adulterae', in FL Cross (ed.), The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005). The Jerusalem Bible claims \\"the author of this passage is not John\\".Jerusalem Bible, reference at John 7:53 Leo the Great (bishop of Rome, or Pope, from 440‚Äì61), cited the passage in his 62nd Sermon, mentioning that Jesus said \\"to the adulteress who was brought to him, ‚ÄòNeither will I condemn you; go and sin no more.'\\" In the early 400s, Augustine of Hippo used the passage extensively, and from his writings, it is also clear that his contemporary Faustus of Mileve (considered by many to be a heretic) also used it. The Council of Trent, held between 1545 and 1563, declared that the Latin Vulgate (the Gospels of which were produced by Jerome in 383, based on Greek manuscripts which Jerome considered ancient at that time, and which contains the passage) was authentic and authoritative. In terms of simple quantities, 1,495 Greek manuscripts include the pericope adulterae (or part of it, supporting the inclusion of the passage as a whole), and 267 do not include it. Among those 267, however, are some manuscripts which are exceptionally early and which most textual analysts consider the most important. The subject of Jesus' writing on the ground was fairly common in art, especially from the Renaissance onwards, with examples by artists including those by Pieter Bruegel and Rembrandt. There was a medieval tradition, originating in a comment attributed to Ambrose, that the words written were terra terram accusat (\\"earth accuses earth\\"; a reference to the end of verse Genesis 3:19: \\"for dust you are and to dust you will return\\"),This phrase terra terram accusat is also given in the Gospel Book of Hitda of Maschede and a ninth- century glossa, Codex Sangelensis 292, and a sermon by Jacobus de Voragine attributes the use of these words to Ambrose and Augustine, and other phrases to the Glossa Ordinaria and John Chrysostom, who is usually considered as not referencing the Pericope. ‚Äî see Knust, Jennifer; Wasserman, Tommy, \\"Earth accuses earth: tracing what Jesus wrote on the ground\\" , Harvard Theological Review, October 01, 2010 which is shown in some depictions in art, for example, the Codex Egberti. This is very probably a matter of guesswork based on Jeremiah 17:13. There have been other theories about what Jesus would have written. ==The passage== in the New Revised Standard Version: > 53 Then each of them went home, 1 while Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. > 2Early in the morning he came again to the temple. All the people came to > him and he sat down and began to teach them. 3The scribes and the Pharisees > brought a woman who had been caught in adultery; and making her stand before > all of them, 4they said to him, ‚ÄúTeacher, this woman was caught in the very > act of committing adultery. 5Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such > women. Now what do you say?‚Äù 6They said this to test him, so that they might > have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his > finger on the ground. 7When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up > and said to them, ‚ÄúLet anyone among you who is without sin be the first to > throw a stone at her.‚Äù 8And once again he bent down and wrote on the ground. > 9When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; > and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 10Jesus > straightened up and said to her, ‚ÄúWoman, where are they? Has no one > condemned you?‚Äù 11She said, ‚ÄúNo one, sir.‚Äù And Jesus said, ‚ÄúNeither do I > condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again. ==Interpretation== This episode, and its message of mercy and forgiveness balanced with a call to holy living, have endured in Christian thought. Both \\"let him who is without sin, cast the first stone\\"E.g., Britni Danielle, \\"Cast the First Stone: Why Are We So Judgmental?\\", Clutch, Feb 21, 2011 and \\"go, and sin no more\\"E.g., Mudiga Affe, Gbenga Adeniji, and Etim Ekpimah, \\"Go and sin no more, priest tells Bode George \\", The Punch, 27 Feb 2011. have found their way into common usage. The English idiomatic phrase to \\"cast the first stone\\" is derived from this passage. The passage has been taken as confirmation of Jesus' ability to write, otherwise only suggested by implication in the Gospels, but the word \\"ŒµŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒµŒΩ\\" in John 8:8 could mean \\"draw\\" as well as \\"write\\".An uncommon usage, evidently not found in the LXX, but supported in Liddell & Scott's Greek-English Lexicon (8th ed., NY, 1897) s.v. Œ≥œÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒ±, page 317 col. 2, citing (among others) Herodotus (repeatedly) including 2:73 (\\"I have not seen one except in an illustration\\") & 4:36 (\\"drawing a map\\"). See also, Chris Keith, The Pericope Adulterae, the Gospel of John, and the Literacy of Jesus (2009, Leiden, Neth., Brill) page 19. ==Mosaic Law== states: In this passage and also in , \\"death is fixed as the penalty of adultery\\", applicable to both the man and the woman concerned. However, \\"stoning as the form of death is only specified when a betrothed virgin is violated\\".Expositor's Greek Testament on John 8, accessed 9 May 2016 == Textual history == John 7:52‚Äì8:12 in Codex Vaticanus (c. 350 AD): lines 1&2 end 7:52; lines 3&4 start 8:12. Rodolpho Bernardelli: Christ and the Adulterous Woman, 1881. Museu Nacional de Belas Artes The pericope is not found in most of the early Greek Gospel manuscripts. It is not in \\\\mathfrak{P}66 or in \\\\mathfrak{P}75, both of which have been assigned to the late 100s or early 200s, nor in two important manuscripts produced in the early/mid 300s, Sinaiticus and Vaticanus. The first surviving Greek manuscript to contain the pericope is the Latin/Greek diglot Codex Bezae, produced in the 400s or 500s (but displaying a form of text which has affinities with \\"Western\\" readings used in the 100s and 200s). Codex Bezae is also the earliest surviving Latin manuscript to contain it. Out of 23 Old Latin manuscripts of John 7‚Äì8, seventeen contain at least part of the pericope, and represent at least three transmission-streams in which it was included. According to Eusebius of Caesarea (in his Ecclesiastical History, composed in the early 300s), Papias (circa AD 110) refers to a story of Jesus and a woman \\"accused of many sins\\" as being found in the Gospel of the Hebrews, which might refer to this passage or to one like it. In the Syriac Didascalia Apostolorum, composed in the mid-200s, the author, in the course of instructing bishops to exercise a measure of clemency, states that a bishop who does not receive a repentant person would be doing wrong ‚Äì \\"for you do not obey our Savior and our God, to do as He also did with her that had sinned, whom the elders set before Him, and leaving the judgment in His hands, departed. But He, the searcher of hearts, asked her and said to her, 'Have the elders condemned thee, my daughter?' She said to Him, 'No, Lord.' And He said unto her, 'Go your way; neither do I condemn thee.' In Him therefore, our Savior and King and God, be your pattern, O bishops.\\" The Constitutions of the Holy Apostles Book II.24, composed c. 380, echoes the Didascalia Apostolorum, alongside a utilization of Luke 7:47.The Early Church Fathers Volume 7 by Philip Schaff (public domain) pp. 388‚Äì390, 408 Codex Fuldensis, which was produced in AD 546, and which, in the Gospels, features an unusual arrangement of the text that was found in an earlier document, contains the adulterae pericope, in the form in which it was written in the Vulgate. More significantly, Codex Fuldensis also preserves the chapter-headings of its earlier source-document (thought by some researchers to echo the Diatessaron produced by Tatian in the 170's), and the title of chapter #120 refers specifically to the woman taken in adultery. The important codices L and Delta do not contain the pericope adulterae, but between John 7:52 and 8:12, each contains a distinct blank space, as a sort of memorial left by the scribe to signify remembrance of the absent passage. Pacian of Barcelona (bishop from 365‚Äì391), in the course of making a rhetorical challenge, opposes cruelty as he sarcastically endorses it: \\"O Novatians, why do you delay to ask an eye for an eye? ... Kill the thief. Stone the petulant. Choose not to read in the Gospel that the Lord spared even the adulteress who confessed, when none had condemned her.\\" Pacian was a contemporary of the scribes who made Codex Sinaiticus. The writer known as Ambrosiaster, c. 370/380, mentioned the occasion when Jesus \\"spared her who had been apprehended in adultery.\\" The unknown author of the composition \\"Apologia David\\" (thought by some analysts to be Ambrose, but more probably not) mentioned that people could be initially taken aback by the passage in which \\"we see an adulteress presented to Christ and sent away without condemnation.\\" Later in the same composition he referred to this episode as a \\"lection\\" in the Gospels, indicating that it was part of the annual cycle of readings used in the church-services. Peter Chrysologus, writing in Ravenna c. 450, clearly cited the pericope adulterae in his Sermon 115. Sedulius and Gelasius also clearly used the passage. Prosper of Aquitaine, and Quodvultdeus of Carthage, in the mid-400s, utilized the passage. A text called the Second Epistle of Pope Callistus section 6Clontz, T.E. and J., \\"The Comprehensive New Testament\\", Cornerstone Publications (2008), p. 571, contains a quote that may be from John 8:11 ‚Äì \\"Let him see to it that he sin no more, that the sentence of the Gospel may abide in him: \\"Go, and sin no more.\\"\\" However this text also appears to quote from eighth-century writings and therefore is most likely spurious.The Early church Fathers Volume 8: The Twelve Patriarchs, Excerpts and Epistles, The Clementia, Apocrypha, Decretals, Memoirs of Edessa and Syriac Documents, Remains of the First by Philip Schaff (public domain) pp. 607, 618 Until recently, it was thought that no Greek Church Father had taken note of the passage before the 1100s. However, in 1941 a large collection of the writings of Didymus the Blind (c. 313‚Äì398) was discovered in Egypt, in which Didymus states that \\"We find in certain gospels\\" an episode in which a woman was accused of a sin, and was about to be stoned, but Jesus intervened \\"and said to those who were about to cast stones, ‚ÄòHe who has not sinned, let him take a stone and throw it. If anyone is conscious in himself not to have sinned, let him take a stone and smite her.‚Äô And no one dared,\\" and so forth. This is far from a direct quotation, but it may be a loose summary of the episode. Barring the possibility that Didymus was referring to some other Gospel than the four- Gospel collection that was typically used in the churches in his time, this reference appears to establish that the passage was present in some Greek manuscripts known in Alexandria and elsewhere from the 300s onwards. In Codex Vaticanus, which was produced in the early 300s, perhaps in Egypt (or in Caesarea, by copyists using exemplars from Egypt), the text is marked at the end of John chapter 7 with an \\"umlaut\\" in the margin, indicating that an alternative reading was known at this point. (However, the date of these umlauts, or distigmai, is a matter of some debate.) This codex also has an umlaut alongside blank space following the end of the Gospel of John, which may convey that whoever added the umlaut was aware of additional text following the end of John 21 ‚Äì which is where the pericope adulterae is found in the f-1 group of manuscripts. Jerome, writing around 417, reports that the pericope adulterae was found in its usual place in \\"many Greek and Latin manuscripts\\" in Rome and the Latin West. This is confirmed by some Latin Fathers of the 300s and 400s, including Ambrose of Milan, and Augustine. The latter claimed that the passage may have been improperly excluded from some manuscripts in order to avoid the impression that Christ had sanctioned adultery: > Certain persons of little faith, or rather enemies of the true faith, > fearing, I suppose, lest their wives should be given impunity in sinning, > removed from their manuscripts the Lord's act of forgiveness toward the > adulteress, as if he who had said, Sin no more, had granted permission to > sin.\\"Sed hoc videlicet infidelium sensus exhorret, ita ut nonnulli modicae > fidei vel potius inimici verae fidei, credo, metuentes peccandi impunitatem > dari mulieribus suis, illud, quod de adulterae indulgentia Dominus fecit, > auferrent de codicibus suis, quasi permissionem peccandi tribuerit qui > dixit: Iam deinceps noli peccare, aut ideo non debuerit mulier a medico Deo > illius peccati remissione sanari, ne offenderentur insani.\\" Augustine, De > Adulterinis Conjugiis 2:6‚Äì7. Cited in Wieland Willker, A Textual Commentary > on the Greek Gospels , Vol. 4b, p. 10. ==History of textual criticism on John 7:53‚Äì8:11== Codex Sangallensis 48 with the blanked space for the pericope John 7:53‚Äì8:11 The first to systematically apply the critical marks of the Alexandrian critics was Origen: Early textual critics familiar with the use and meaning of these marks in classical Greek works like Homer, interpreted the signs to mean that the section (John 7:53‚Äì8:11) was an interpolation and not an original part of the Gospel. During the 16th century, Western European scholars ‚Äì both Catholic and Protestant ‚Äì sought to recover the most correct Greek text of the New Testament, rather than relying on the Vulgate Latin translation. At this time, it was noticed that a number of early manuscripts containing John's Gospel lacked John 7:53‚Äì8:11 inclusive; and also that some manuscripts containing the verses marked them with critical signs, usually a lemniscus or asterisk. It was also noted that, in the lectionary of the Greek church, the Gospel-reading for Pentecost runs from John 7:37 to 8:12, but skips over the twelve verses of this pericope. Beginning with Lachmann (in Germany, 1840), reservations about the pericope became more strongly argued in the modern period, and these opinions were carried into the English world by Samuel Davidson (1848‚Äì51), Tregelles (1862),S. P. Tregelles, An Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scripture (London 1856), pp. 465‚Äì468. and others; the argument against the verses being given body and final expression in Hort (1886). Those opposing the authenticity of the verses as part of John are represented in the 20th century by men like Cadbury (1917), Colwell (1935), and Metzger (1971).Bruce M. Metzger, A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament, Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart 2001, pp. 187‚Äì189. According to 19th-century text critics Henry Alford and F. H. A. Scrivener the passage was added by John in a second edition of the Gospel along with 5:3.4 and the 21st chapter. On the other hand, a number of scholars have strongly defended the Johannine authorship of these verses. This group of critics is typified by such scholars as Nolan (1865), and Burgon (1886), and Hoskier (1920). More recently it has been defended by David Otis Fuller (1975), and is included in the Greek New Testaments compiled by Wilbur Pickering (1980/2014), Hodges & Farstad (1982/1985), and Robinson & Pierpont (2005). Rather than endorsing Augustine's theory that some men had removed the passage due to a concern that it would be used by their wives as a pretense to commit adultery, Burgon proposed (but did not develop in detail) a theory that the passage had been lost due to a misunderstanding of a feature in the lection-system of the early church. Almost all modern critical translations that include the pericope adulterae do so at John 7:53‚Äì8:11. Exceptions include the New English Bible and Revised English Bible, which relocate the pericope after the end of the Gospel. Most others enclose the pericope in brackets, and/or add a footnote mentioning the absence of the passage in the oldest witnesses (e.g., NRSV, NJB, NIV, GNT, NASB, ESV). ==Authorship== Papyrus 66 without text of John 7:53‚Äì8:12 ===Arguments against Johannine authorship=== Bishop J.B. Lightfoot wrote that absence of the passage from the earliest manuscripts, combined with the occurrence of stylistic characteristics atypical of John, together implied that the passage was an interpolation. Nevertheless, he considered the story to be authentic history.\\"The passages which touch Christian sentiment, or history, or morals, and which are affected by textual differences, though less rare than the former, are still very few. Of these, the pericope of the woman taken in adultery holds the first place of importance. In this case a deference to the most ancient authorities, as well as a consideration of internal evidence, might seem to involve immediate loss. The best solution may be to place the passage in brackets, for the purpose of showing, not, indeed, that it contains an untrue narrative (for, whencesoever it comes, it seems to bear on its face the highest credentials of authentic history), but that evidence external and internal is against its being regarded as an integral portion of the original Gospel of St. John.\\" J.B. Lightfoot, R.C. Trench, C.J. Ellicott, The Revision of the English Version of the NT, intro. P. Schaff, (Harper & Bro. NY, 1873) Online at CCEL (Christian Classic Ethereal Library) As a result, based on Eusebius' mention that the writings of Papias contained a story \\"about a woman falsely accused before the Lord of many sins\\" (H.E. 3.39), he argued that this section originally was part of Papias' Interpretations of the Sayings of the Lord, and included it in his collection of Papias' fragments. Bart D. Ehrman concurs in Misquoting Jesus, adding that the passage contains many words and phrases otherwise alien to John's writing.Bart D. Ehrman in Misquoting Jesus, (HarperCollins. NY, 2005), p. 65 However, Michael W. Holmes has pointed out that it is not certain \\"that Papias knew the story in precisely this form, inasmuch as it now appears that at least two independent stories about Jesus and a sinful woman circulated among Christians in the first two centuries of the church, so that the traditional form found in many New Testament manuscripts may well represent a conflation of two independent shorter, earlier versions of the incident.\\"Michael W. Holmes in The Apostolic Fathers in English (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2006), p. 304 Kyle R. Hughes has argued that one of these earlier versions is in fact very similar in style, form, and content to the Lukan special material (the so-called \\"L\\" source), suggesting that the core of this tradition is in fact rooted in very early Christian (though not Johannine) memory.Kyle R. Hughes, \\"The Lukan Special Material and the Tradition History of the Pericope Adulterae,\\" Novum Testamentum 55.3 (2013): 232‚Äì251 ===Arguments for Johannine authorship=== There is clear reference to the pericope adulterae in the primitive Christian church in the Syriac Didascalia Apostolorum. (II,24,6; ed. Funk I, 93.) Zane C. Hodges and Arthur L. Farstad argue for Johannine authorship of the pericope.\\"If it is not an original part of the Fourth Gospel, its writer would have to be viewed as a skilled Johannine imitator, and its placement in this context as the shrewdest piece of interpolation in literary history!\\" The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text with Apparatus: Second Edition, by Zane C. Hodges (Editor), Arthur L. Farstad (Editor) Publisher: Thomas Nelson; They suggest there are points of similarity between the pericope's style and the style of the rest of the gospel. They claim that the details of the encounter fit very well into the context of the surrounding verses. They argue that the pericope's appearance in the majority of manuscripts, if not in the oldest ones, is evidence of its authenticity. ==Manuscript evidence== John 7:52‚Äì8:12 in Codex Sinaiticus Both Novum Testamentum Graece (NA28) and the United Bible Societies (UBS4) provide critical text for the pericope, but mark this off with double brackets, indicating that the pericope is regarded as a later addition to the text. Describing its use of double brackets UBS4 states that they \\"enclose passages that are regarded as later additions to the text, but are of evident antiquity and importance.\\" However, UBS4 rates its reconstruction of the wording of the pericope as { A }, meaning \\"virtually certain\\" to reflect the original text of the addition. (In NA28, however, a reading in Second Peter 2:18 that had been ranked \\"A\\" (\\"virtually certain\\") was rejected and replaced with a rival reading.) #Exclude pericope.

The film stars Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as fraternal twins Connor and Murphy MacManus, who become vigilantes after killing two members of the Russian Mafia in self-defense. After both experience an epiphany, the brothers, together with their friend \\"Funny Man\\" Rocco (David Della Rocco), set out to rid their home city of Boston of crime and evil, all the while being pursued by FBI Special Agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe). Duffy indicates that the screenplay was inspired by personal experience while living in Los Angeles. (Republished from Boston Phoenix.) Initially regarded as one of the hottest scripts in Hollywood, the movie had a troubled production. Miramax dropped the project in 1997 before Franchise Pictures picked it up the following year. The film was finally given a limited theatrical release of only five theaters for one week due to movie-studio politicsG. Michael Dobbs (2014). Fifteen Minutes With...: 40 Years of Interviews. BearManor Media, p. 289 and worries about association with the 1999 Columbine High School massacre. It was met with poor critical reviews; however, the film ultimately grossed about $50 million in domestic video sales and developed a large cult following. The movie was followed by a 2009 sequel, The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day, and a third film was in development as of 2015. ==Plot== In Boston, two Irish American twin brothers, Connor and Murphy MacManus, attend Mass, where the priest mentions the fate of Kitty Genovese. Later, when Connor and Murphy are celebrating Saint Patrick's Day with friends, three Russian mobsters arrive and announce they want to close the pub and take over the land it is built on. A brawl ensues, in which the Russians are defeated and humiliated. The next morning, when two of the Russians seek revenge on Connor and Murphy, the mobsters are killed in self- defense. FBI Agent Paul Smecker is assigned to the case, and finds that the police and local news reporters see the MacManus brothers as heroes. The duo turn themselves in at a police station, where Smecker interviews them. After they retell their incident to Smecker, he declines to press charges and allows them to spend the night in a holding cell to avoid attention from the media. That night, they receive a \\"calling\\" from God telling them to hunt down wicked men so that the innocent will flourish. Connor and Murphy resolve to rid Boston of evil men. Connor learns of a meeting of Russian syndicate bosses at a hotel. Having equipped themselves with weaponry from a local underground gun dealer, the brothers quickly kill all nine Russian mobsters, while Rocco, a friend of the brothers and errand boy for local mafia boss Giuseppe \\"Papa Joe\\" Yakavetta, is sent on a hit as an unknowing pawn. The next day, Rocco learns that he was betrayed, having been sent to kill nine Russians with only a six- shot revolver. Rocco commits himself to helping Connor and Murphy. That night, they hunt down and kill Vincenzo Lapazzi, an underboss of the Yakavetta crime family. Concerned he may be a target, Papa Joe contacts a hitman, Il Duce, to deal with them. After killing a criminal that Rocco had a personal hatred for, the three men are ambushed by Il Duce. Although they manage to chase Il Duce away, the three men suffer serious wounds, including the loss of Rocco's finger. The three return to a safehouse where they treat their wounds. Hours later as the police conduct an investigation at the crime scene, the investigation seems futile since the brothers covered their tracks by spraying any blood left behind with ammonia. However, Smecker happens upon the part of the finger lost by Rocco and decides to do an independent investigation to see who was behind the gun battle. Smecker is able to track the evidence down to Rocco and his two allies. This leaves Smecker in a difficult scenario, and struggles with the choice of whether to prosecute the three men, or join them in their cause, as Smecker believes they are doing the right thing. After getting drunk at a gay bar and subsequently getting advice from a reluctant priest, Smecker decides to help the trio. Later, the brothers and Rocco inform Smecker that they plan to infiltrate the Yakavetta headquarters to finish off the family, but Smecker learns they are walking into a trap. The brothers are captured, and Rocco is shot and killed by Papa Joe, but the brothers are able to free themselves. As Papa Joe leaves his house, Smecker arrives in drag and kills a number of soldiers before being knocked unconscious by Il Duce. As the brothers say their family prayer over Rocco, Il Duce enters the room and prepares to open fire. However, he instead finishes the prayer ‚Äì revealing he is the brothers' father and decides to join his sons in their mission. Three months later, Papa Joe is sent to trial for a third time. However, the reporters on-scene anticipate his acquittal. The brothers and Il Duce, aided by Smecker, Dolly, Duffy and Greenly, infiltrate the trial after sliding their weapons over the metal detector. Unmasked, they make a speech stating that they intend to eradicate evil wherever they find it before reciting their family prayer and killing Papa Joe. The media dubs the three as \\"the Saints\\". ==Cast== Norman Reedus (left), Troy Duffy (center), and Sean Patrick Flanery (right) at Drexel University in Philadelphia * Willem Dafoe as FBI Special Agent Paul Smecker, a brilliant but emotionally troubled gay man assigned to the murders linked to the MacManus brothers. * Sean Patrick Flanery as Connor MacManus, one-half of the MacManus brothers. He has a tattoo on his left hand that reads \\"Veritas\\" (\\"truth\\" in Latin).

Connor frequently references John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, and Charles Bronson. * Norman Reedus as Murphy MacManus, the other half of the MacManus brothers. He has a tattoo on his right hand that reads \\"Aequitas\\" (\\"justice/equality\\" in Latin).

Duffy, who was working as a bartender and bouncer, had never written a screenplay before. Duffy completed the screenplay in fall of 1996 and passed it to a producer's assistant at New Line Cinema to be read by a senior executive. The screenplay changed hands through multiple studios and Duffy was approached by multiple producers for the rights. In March 1997, he was contracted by Paramount Pictures for $500,000, and later in the month, Miramax Films won a bidding war to buy The Boondock Saints. The studio offered $450,000 to Duffy to write and direct the film. The documentary Overnight, which chronicled Duffy's \\"rags-to-riches-to-rags\\" story, showed that the script was worth $300,000, and the film itself was originally given a $15 million budget by Miramax's Harvey Weinstein. Duffy's band The Brood would do the soundtrack, and as a bonus, Miramax offered to buy and throw in co- ownership of J. Sloan's, where Duffy worked. Overnight showed that Duffy frequently exhibited abrasive behavior, causing tension for many people involved in the project. Filming of The Boondock Saints was scheduled for the coming autumn in Boston. ===Casting and funding=== Duffy sought to cast Stephen Dorff and Mark Wahlberg as the brothers, though Wahlberg passed for Boogie Nights. The director also wanted to cast Billy Connolly and Kenneth Branagh in the film, with Branagh playing FBI Agent Paul Smecker. Duffy also expressed interest in casting Brendan Fraser, Nicky Katt, and Ewan McGregor, with two of them as the brothers, but no decisions were finalized. The director later sought Patrick Swayze to play Smecker, but Miramax preferred Sylvester Stallone (with whom the studio had an existing relationship), Bill Murray, or Mike Myers. Kevin Spacey and Robert De Niro were also considered for the role of Smecker. Before pre-production work was supposed to begin in Boston in December 1997, Miramax pulled out of the project. Producer Lloyd Segan said that the project had stalled because of casting and location problems. While Duffy was able to keep the writer's fee of $300,000, the studio required the reimbursement of the $150,000 director's fee and the $700,000 advance to develop the project. The independent studio Franchise Pictures sought to finance the project once other elements were in place. Duffy approached Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus to play the brothers, and Willem Dafoe to play the FBI agent. Having found someone to back the film, filming began in Toronto, with the final scenes being filmed in Boston. The name of Duffy's band, The Brood, was changed to The Boondock Saints, following the movie's release. The film featured two songs from the band: \\"Holy Fool\\", which played during Rocco's tavern shootout, and \\"Pipes\\", which played during the credits. ==Release== The Boondock Saints had a very limited theatrical release, with its distributor showing the film in 2000 on only five screens in the United States for a duration of a week. However, the original unrated version of the film was later re-released in theaters on May 22, 2006. Duffy later funded screenings of the film with help from Blockbuster Video. \\"Blockbuster saved us [...] They agreed to take it on exclusively, and from there the rest is history.\\" According to Troy Duffy on his audio commentary of the film on DVD, the film's distributor allowed the limited screening in the United States because of the then-recent Columbine High School massacre. The film was shown on major foreign screens (most notably in Japan) with success. Blockbuster released The Boondock Saints as a \\"Blockbuster Exclusive\\", a collection of independent direct-to-video films. The Boondock Saints gained a following mostly due to word-of-mouth publicity and was a bestseller when released on DVD. Despite its success, Troy Duffy never saw any of the profits from DVD distribution, having signed away the DVD rights in his contract with Indican. According to Duffy, neither he, his producers, nor his principal cast got paid. He sued Franchise Pictures and other undisclosed companies for royalties of the first film and rights to the sequel. After a lengthy lawsuit, Troy Duffy, his producers, and the principal cast received an undisclosed amount of The Boondock Saints royalties, as well as the sequel rights. ===Home media === The Boondock Saints has been released numerous times on DVD, including an import on March 13, 2001, and an uncut Japanese release published by Toshiba Entertainment, whose special features include anamorphic widescreen, audio commentary, trailers, and interviews with the Japanese media. On May 23, 2006, The Boondock Saints Collector's Edition was published and released by 20th Century Fox on DVD, as well as UMD for the PlayStation Portable. The special features include English and Spanish subtitles, commentary by Billy Connolly and Troy Duffy, deleted scenes, and outtakes. It also featured the film's trailer, cast and crew filmographies, and a printable script of the film. 20th Century Fox and Duffy showed an interest in doing a new audio commentary for the special release, but he was unable to because of unresolved legal issues. ==Reception== On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film has a score of 28% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 4.35/10. The site's consensus calls the film, \\"A juvenile, ugly movie that represents the worst tendencies of directors channeling Tarantino.\\" Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club described the film, in his review of the DVD, as \\"less a proper action-thriller\\" than \\"a series of gratuitously violent setpieces strung together with only the sketchiest semblance of a plot\\". Rabin went on to describe the film as \\"all style and no substance, a film so gleeful in its endorsement of vigilante justice that it almost veers (or ascends) into self-parody.\\" Robert Koehler of Variety wrote in his review: \\"A belated entry in the hipster crime movie movement that began with Reservoir Dogs, Troy Duffy's Boondock Saints mixes blood and Catholic-tinged vigilante justice in excessive portions for sometimes wacky and always brutal effect. [The film is] more interested in finding fresh ways to stage execution scenes than in finding meaning behind the human urge for self-appointed righting of wrongs.\\" Koehler also described Flanery and Reedus as \\"curiously stolid and blank\\", while praising supporting actors Connolly, Dafoe, and Rota for making the most of their screen time. Koehler also praised the tech personnel: \\"This uneven exercise in pacing and cutting is abetted by an eclectic score by Jeff Danna and whiz lensing by Adam Kane. Other tech credits fire bull's-eyes.\\" Film critics have taken note of the film's extreme violence and \\"slow-motion bloodletting\\". ===Box office=== In its original run, the film only earned $30,471 at five theaters. It later developed a cult following and has grossed about $50 million in domestic video sales. ==Documentary== The documentary film Overnight was released in 2003, following the story of Troy Duffy during his negotiations with Miramax over The Boondock Saints script, as well as his band's struggles to secure a recording contract. Duffy's abrasive behavior strained his relationships with friends and people in the film industry and ultimately led to Miramax pulling out of the project, leaving the film to be made by another studio at half the originally proposed budget. ==Sequels== After numerous delays, Troy Duffy shot a sequel, The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day, in which the brothers return to continue their run of vengeance. It was released October 30, 2009. In an October 27, 2009, article, director Duffy and actor Connolly mention details regarding a possible third film. They maintained that \\"it is slowly in the works and is still just an idea\\". Duffy insists that he wants to get a few more of his films done before returning to the Boondock Saints. Duffy also added that the proposed working title for the third film would be called \\"Boondock Saints III: Saints Preserve Us\\". Again, on February 26, 2013, Duffy stated that he was getting together with Reedus and Flanery to resume talks about The Boondock Saints 3, in hopes that they could make the film a reality for fans. As of July 2013, Duffy has confirmed in an interview that he is working on the script for the third film, and possibly a TV series, later named as The Boondock Saints: Origins. On September 3, 2014, the third film, subtitled Legion, was revealed to be in pre-production. In 2017, Flanery tweeted that he and Reedus had walked away from The Boondock Saints 3. While he did not elaborate on much, he suggested that the \\"unethical\\" production of the project caused their departure. == Comic book == A two-part comic-book story, serving as a companion to the movie sequel, was released in May 2010. The series is written by Troy Duffy, produced by Innfusion Inc., and released through 12 Gauge Comics. The book focuses on a more in-depth version of Il Duce's back story, as well as telling the story of the brothers during a hit they performed that is not featured in the film. It was paired with a minibook that was featured on the official Boondock Saints website that told a ministory that takes place before the strip-club scene from the first film. These will eventually be released in one single graphic novel. The Boondock Saints: In Nomine Patris was written with J.B. Love and published in November 2011. Another story is currently being proposed that would show the brothers' time in Hoag Prison after the events of All Saints Day. == Video game == A video game was supposed to be made based on the film, but was later cancelled.https://www.complex.com/pop- culture/2012/03/the-boondock-saints-video-game-is-official - author: Michael Rougeau ==References* * * Film School Rejects: 39 Things We Learned From The Boondock Saints' Commentary Category:1999 films Category:1990s buddy films Category:1990s independent films Category:1990s vigilante films Category:1999 action thriller films Category:1999 crime thriller films Category:1999 LGBT-related films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American action thriller films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American vigilante films Category:Cross-dressing in American films Category:English-language films Category:Fictional portrayals of the Boston Police Department Category:Films about brothers Category:Films about Irish-American culture Category:Films about religion Category:Films about the American Mafia Category:Films about the Russian Mafia Category:Films about twin brothers Category:Films produced by Elie Samaha Category:Films scored by Jeff Danna Category:Films scored by Mychael Danna Category:Films set in Boston Category:Films shot in Boston Category:Films shot in Toronto Category:Franchise Pictures films Category:Gay- related films Category:LGBT-related thriller films Category:Saint Patrick's Day films ","title":"The Boondock Saints"},{"id":"517382","text":"The Dells were an American R&B; vocal group, vocal quintets. Formed in high school in 1953 by founding members Marvin Junior, Verne Allison, Johnny Funches, Chuck Barksdale, and Mickey and Lucius McGill, under the name the El- Rays. They released their first recording in 1954 and two years later had their first R&B; hit with \\"Oh What a Night\\". After disbanding due to a near- fatal car crash in 1958, the band reformed in 1960 with Funches being replaced by Johnny Carter. This lineup remained together until Carter's death in 2009. In 2004, The Dells were inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. The group performed until illness forced longtime lead singer Marvin Junior and bass vocalist Chuck Barksdale into retirement, ending the group's 60-year run. ==HistoryEarly career=== The Dells grew up in Harvey, Illinois and began singing together while attending Thornton Township High School. Forming in 1952 under the name the El-Rays, the group initially consisted of Marvin Junior, Mickey McGill, Lucius McGill, Verne Allison, Chuck Barksdale, and Johnny Funches. Lucius McGill soon left the group and the remaining quintet signed with Checker Records, releasing their first single, \\"Darling I Know,\\" which flopped. In 1955, the group renamed themselves the Dells and signed with Vee-Jay Records. In 1956, they recorded their first hit, \\"Oh, What a Night\\" (a song co-written by Johnny Funches, who also sang lead on the recording alongside Marvin Junior), which hit the Top 5 of the R&B; singles chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The song is ranked No. 260 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In November 1958, the Dells suffered a car accident that left McGill in a hospital in Ohio for six months. The group temporarily disbanded and Barksdale sang as a member of Harvey Fuqua's spinoff Moonglows act, Harvey and the Moonglows, which included a young Marvin Gaye. In 1961, the Dells reunited and auditioned for Dinah Washington. After Washington agreed to hire them, Johnny Funches left the group to take care of his family. Funches was replaced by Flamingos founding member Johnny Carter and sang background for Washington for two years. In 1966, they were hired to open for Ray Charles, only to be fired after a performance resulted in several standing ovations. The group would also sing background for Barbara Lewis, mainly on Lewis' 1963 hit, \\"Hello Stranger\\", while also working with Quincy Jones, who helped to fine-tune their vocals for standards and jazz material. ===Successful years=== In 1966, the Dells returned to Chess under the label's Cadet subsidiary working with Bobby Miller and future Earth, Wind & Fire arranger Charles Stepney. In 1967, the Dells issued the album There Is which included their first R&B; chart-topper in years with the title track, which showcased the sharp baritone of Marvin Junior and the harmonies with the four other Dells. The song was also their first top 20 pop hit. Subsequent R&B; hits included \\"Wear It on Our Face,\\" \\"Always Together\\" (Top 20 Pop), \\"I Can Sing a Rainbow - Love is Blue (medley)\\" (UK No. 15), and their first No. 1 R&B; hit and first Top Ten pop hit, 1968's \\"Stay in My Corner,\\" which reached No. 10 on the pop chart and showcased both Carter and Marvin in lead vocals. In the following year, 1969, The Dells' soulful remake of their debut hit, \\"Oh What a Night\\" gave the group their second chart-topping R&B; single and also reached the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100. For a second time, the song sold over a million copies. Subsequent hits included \\"Open Up My Heart,\\" \\"Oh What A Day,\\" and \\"On the Dock of the Bay.\\" In 1971, the Dells' \\"The Love We Had Stays on My Mind\\" became another Top Ten hit on the R&B; chart, also reaching the pop Top 30. By this time Charles Stepney had taken over production duties from Bobby Miller. 1973's \\"Give Your Baby a Standing Ovation\\" was their third certified gold record. The song was written by L.V. Johnson and produced by Don Davis. ===Later years=== Leaving Cadet around the end of 1974 with the parent company in financial difficulties, the group would continue recording in order under the Mercury, ABC, and Virgin labels finding some hits, including 1980's \\"I Touched a Dream\\", which returned the group to the top 40 on the R&B; chart. The Dells were confined mostly to the oldies market afterwards until they were asked to be creative consultants to Robert Townsend's acclaimed 1991 film, The Five Heartbeats, which was loosely based on the lives of The Dells and other groups of its era. The group recorded a composition titled \\"A Heart Is a House for Love\\". The song reached number 13 on the Billboard R&B; chart, making them only one of two groups to have hit singles in five decades. The following year, signing with PIR, they released the album, I Salute You. The Dells continued performing and recording sporadically in the early years of the new millennium. In 2004, the group were inducted to both the Vocal Group Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

This basis in critical thinking set it apart from the pre-critical methods that came before it, the anti-critical methods of those who oppose critically based study, and the post-critical orientation that came after it. Biblical criticism historically included a wide range of approaches and questions within four major methodologies: textual, source, form, and literary criticism. Textual criticism examines the text and its manuscripts to identify what the original text would have said. Source criticism searches the texts for evidence of original sources. Form criticism identifies short units of text and seeks to identify their original setting. Each of these is primarily historical and pre-compositional in its concerns. Literary criticism of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, on the other hand, focuses on the literary structure, authorial purpose, and reader's response to the text through methods such as rhetorical criticism, canonical criticism, and narrative criticism. The rise of modern culture in the European West, in the form of the German Enlightenment, is seen by most scholars as the leading factor in biblical criticism's creation, but some scholars claim that its roots reach back to the Reformation. German pietism played a role in its development, as did British deism, with its greatest influences being rationalism and Protestant scholarship. The Enlightenment age and its skepticism of biblical and ecclesiastical authority ignited questions concerning the historical basis for the man Jesus separately from traditional theological views concerning him. This \\"quest\\" for the Jesus of history began in biblical criticism's earliest stages, reappeared in the nineteenth century, and again in the twentieth, remaining an interest of biblical criticism, on and off, for over 200 years. In the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, biblical criticism was influenced by a wide range of additional academic disciplines and theoretical perspectives, which changed it from a primarily historical approach to a multidisciplinary field. In a field long dominated by white male Protestants, others such as non-white scholars, women, and those from the Jewish and Catholic traditions became prominent voices. Globalization brought a broader spectrum of worldviews into the field, and other academic disciplines as diverse as Near Eastern studies, psychology, cultural anthropology and sociology formed new methods of biblical criticism such as socio-scientific criticism and psychological biblical criticism. Meanwhile, post-modernism and post-critical interpretation began questioning biblical criticism's role and function. These additional world views changed the nature of biblical criticism. Twenty-first century critical methods are no longer primarily historical, and the criteria of neutral judgment has changed to one of beginning from a recognition of the various biases the reader brings to the study of the texts. Biblical criticism's legacy is both undeniable and mixed. == History  Eighteenth century === In the Enlightenment era of the European West, philosophers and theologians such as Thomas Hobbes (1588‚Äì1679), Benedict Spinoza (1632‚Äì1677), and Richard Simon (1638‚Äì1712) began to question the Mosaic tradition that said Moses was the author of the first five books of the Bible. Spinoza wrote that Moses could not have written the preface to Deuteronomy, since he never crossed the Jordan; he also found other problems such as Deuteronomy 31:9 which references Moses in the third person. \\"All these details, the manner of narration, the testimony, and the context of the whole story lead to the plain conclusion that these books were written by another, and not by Moses in person.\\" Jean Astruc (1684‚Äì1766), a French physician, believed these critics were wrong about Mosaic authorship. According to Old Testament scholar Edward Young (1907‚Äì1968), Astruc believed that Moses did assemble the book of Genesis using the hereditary accounts of the Hebrew people. Biblical criticism can be said to have begun when Astruc borrowed methods of textual criticism (used to investigate Greek and Roman texts) and applied them to the Bible in search of those original accounts. Astruc believed that, through this approach, he had identified the separate sources that were edited together into the book of Genesis, thus explaining Genesis' problems while still allowing for Mosaic authorship. Astruc's work was the genesis of biblical criticism, and it became the \\"template\\" for all who followed him in source criticism; therefore he is called the \\"Father of Biblical criticism\\". The questioning of religious authority common to German Pietism contributed to the rise of biblical criticism. Rationalism also became a significant influence in the development of biblical criticism. For example, the Swiss theologian Jean Alphonse Turretin (1671‚Äì1737) attacked conventional exegesis (interpretation) and argued that revelation was necessary but must also be consistent with nature and in harmony with reason. This has become a common modern Judeo-Christian view. Johann Salomo Semler (1725‚Äì1791) argued for an end to all doctrinal assumptions, giving historical criticism its nonsectarian character. As a result, Semler is often called the father of historical-critical research. Semler distinguished between \\"inward\\" and \\"outward\\" religion, the idea that, for some people, their religion is their highest inner purpose, while for others, religion is a more exterior practice: a tool to accomplish other purposes more important to the individual‚Äìsuch as political or economic goals. Modern psychology recognizes this concept. Peter Hanns Reill says \\"Despite the difference in attitudes between the thinkers and the historians [of the German enlightenment], all viewed history as the key\\". John W. Rogerson says there are two views on biblical criticism's origins: one which traces it to the Enlightenment and the other which traces its origins to the Reformation. There are three early scholars of the Reformation era who are considered as having laid the intellectual foundations which bore later fruit: Joachim Camerarius (1500‚Äì1574), Hugo Grotius (1583‚Äì1645), and Matthew Tindal (1653‚Äì1733). Camerarius wrote a philological study of figures of speech in the biblical texts using their context to study and understand them. Grotius paved the way for comparative religion studies by analyzing New Testament texts in the light of Classical, Jewish and early Christian writings. Tindal, as part of English deism, asserted that Jesus taught natural religion, which Tindal characterized as an undogmatic faith, that the Church later changed. Tindal's \\"view of Christianity as a mere confirmation of natural religion and his resolute denial of the supernatural\\" led him to conclude that \\"revealed religion is superfluous\\". Communications scholar James A. Herrick (b. 1954) says that even though most scholars agree that biblical criticism evolved out of the German Enlightenment, there are also histories of biblical scholarship that have found \\"strong direct links\\" with British deism. Herrick references the German theologian Henning Graf Reventlow (1929‚Äì2010) as linking deism with the humanist world view, which has also been significant in biblical criticism. English Deism was also an influence on the philosopher, writer, classicist, Hebraist and Enlightenment free-thinker Hermann Samuel Reimarus (1694‚Äì1768) in developing his criticism of revelation. During this same period, the biblical scholar Johann David Michaelis (1717‚Äì1791) advocated the use of other Semitic languages to understand the Old Testament, and in 1750, wrote the first modern introduction to the New Testament. Instead of interpreting the Bible historically, Johann Gottfried Eichhorn (1752‚Äì1827), Johann Philipp Gabler (1753‚Äì1826), and Georg Lorenz Bauer (1755‚Äì1806) used the concept of myth as a tool for interpreting the Bible. Rudolf Bultmann later picked up this approach, and it became particularly influential in the early- twentieth century. George Ricker Berry says the term \\"higher criticism\\", which is sometimes used as an alternate name for historical criticism, was first used by Eichhorn in his three-volume work Einleitung ins Alte Testament (Introduction to the Old Testament) published between 1780 and 1783. The term was originally used to differentiate higher criticism, the term for historical criticism, from lower, which was the term commonly used for textual criticism at the time.Berry, George Ricker. \\"Biblical Criticism and Archaeology\\". Journal of Bible and Religion, vol. 6, no. 3, 1938, pp. 131‚Äì171. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1457569. Accessed 8 August 2020.p.131 Higher criticism describes a method of study of the biblical texts using the text's own internal evidence to discern the Bible's history. Lower criticism (textual criticism) is concerned with determining the original wording of the text. In the words of Paul Maas: \\"The business of textual criticism is to produce a text as close as possible to the original (constitutio textus)\\"., page 1 The importance of textual criticism means that the term 'lower criticism' is no longer a term used much in twenty-first century studies.  Historical Jesus: the first quest  Reimarus began the first quest for the historical Jesus after his own death. G. E. Lessing (1729‚Äì1781) discovered copies of Reimarus' writings in the library at Wolfenb√ºttel when Lessing worked there as librarian. Reimarus had left permission for his work to be published after his death, and Lessing did so between 1774 and 1778, publishing them as Die Fragmente eines unbekannten Autors (The Fragments of an Unknown Author). Over time, they came to be known as the Wolfenb√ºttel Fragments. Reimarus distinguished between what Jesus taught and how he is portrayed in the New Testament. According to Reimarus, Jesus was a political Messiah who failed at creating political change and was executed by the Roman state as a dissident. His disciples then stole the body and invented the story of the resurrection for personal gain. Reimarus' controversial work garnered a response from Semler in 1779: Beantwortung der Fragmente eines Ungenannten (Answering the Fragments of an Unknown). Semler effectively refuted Reimarus' biblical arguments using biblical criticism, but it was of little consequence. Reimarus' writings had already made a lasting change in the practice of biblical criticism by making it clear that such criticism could exist independently of theology and of faith. Reimarus had shown biblical criticism could serve its own ends, be governed solely by rational criteria, and reject deference to religious tradition. Lessing contributed to the field of biblical criticism by seeing Reimarus' writings published, but he also made contributions of his own, arguing that the proper study of biblical texts requires knowing the context in which they were written. This has since become an accepted concept. ===Nineteenth century=== Theologians Richard and Kendall Soulen say biblical criticism reached full flower in the nineteenth century, becoming the \\"major transforming fact of biblical studies in the modern period\\". The height of biblical criticism's influence is represented by the history of religions school (known in German as the Kultgeschichtliche Schule or alternatively the Religionsgeschichtliche Schule). This school was not a place; it was a group of German Protestant theologians associated with the University of G√∂ttingen. In the late 19th century, they sought to understand Judaism and Christianity within the overall history of religion. Landmarks in understanding the Bible and its background occurred during this century, with many modern concepts having their roots here. For example, in 1835 and again in 1845, theologian Ferdinand Christian Baur (1792‚Äì1860) postulated a sharp contrast between the apostles Peter and Paul. Since then, this concept has occasioned widespread debate within topics such as Pauline studies, New Testament studies, early-church studies, Jewish Law, the theology of grace, and the doctrine of justification. In the mid-nineteenth century, Bible scholar H. J. Holtzmann (1832‚Äì1910) developed a listing of the chronological order of the New Testament texts. Richard and Kendall Soulen note that the people working in biblical criticism at that time \\"saw themselves as continuing the aims of the Protestant Reformation\\". Joseph G. Prior quotes Robert M. Grant and David Tracy as saying, \\"One of the most striking features of the development of biblical interpretation during the nineteenth century was the way in which philosophical presuppositions implicitly guided it\\". Michael Joseph Brown points out that biblical criticism operated according to principles grounded in a distinctively European rationalism. Brown says that, by the end of the nineteenth century, these were recognized by Ernst Troeltsch in an essay, \\"Historical and Dogmatic Method in Theology,\\" where he described three principles of biblical criticism. These are: methodological doubt, analogy (the idea that all events are similar in principle), and mutual inter- dependence. Biblical criticism's focus on the use of pure reason produced what calls a paradigm shift that profoundly changed Christian theology concerning the Jews: the \\"process of the 'emancipation of reason' from the Bible ... runs parallel with the emancipation of Christianity from the Jews\\". The first Enlightenment Protestant to call for the \\"de-Judaizing\\" of Christianity was Johann Semler. Semler took a stand against discrimination in society while at the same time writing theology that was strongly negative toward the Jews and Judaism. He saw Christianity as something that 'superseded' all that came before it. This stark contrast between Judaism and Christianity became a common theme, along with a strong prejudice against Jews and Judaism in Herder (1744‚Äì1803), Schleiermacher (1768‚Äì1834), de Wette (1780‚Äì1849), Baur (1792‚Äì1860), Strauss (1808‚Äì1874), Ritschl (1822‚Äì1889), the history of religions school of the 1890s, and on into the form critics of the twentieth century until World War II.  Historical Jesus: the second quest  The late-nineteenth century saw a renewed interest in the quest for the historical Jesus which primarily involved writing versions of the \\"life of Jesus\\". Important scholars of this quest included David Strauss (1808‚Äì1874), whose cultural significance lies in his contribution to weakening the established authorities, and whose theological significance resides in his confrontation of the doctrine of Christ's divinity with the modern critical study of history. Adolf Von Harnack (1851‚Äì1930) contributed to the quest for the historical Jesus, writing The Essence of Christianity in 1900, where he described Jesus as a reformer. William Wrede (1859‚Äì1906) rejected all the theological aspects of Jesus and the assumption that there was a historical core about him in Mark. Ernst Renan (1823‚Äì1892) promoted the critical method and was opposed to orthodoxy. Wilhelm Bousset (1865‚Äì1920) attained honors in the history of religions school by contrasting Jesus and John the Baptist. While at G√∂ttingen, Johannes Weiss (1863‚Äì1914) wrote his most influential work on the apocalyptic proclamations of Jesus. In 1896, Martin K√§hler wrote The So-called Historical Jesus and the Historic Biblical Christ. It critiqued the quest's methodology, with a reminder of the limits of historical inquiry, saying it is impossible to separate one Jesus from another since the Jesus of history is only known through documents about the Christ of faith. The Second Quest wasn't considered closed until Albert Schweitzer's (1875‚Äì1965) Von Reimarus zu Wrede was published as The Quest of the Historical Jesus in 1910. In it, Schweitzer scathingly critiqued the various late-nineteenth century Lives of Jesus as reflecting more of the lives of the authors than Jesus. Schweitzer revolutionized New Testament scholarship at the turn of the century by proving to most of that scholarly world that Jesus' teachings and actions were determined by his eschatological outlook; he thereby finished the quest's pursuit of the apocalyptic Jesus. He concluded that any future research on the historical Jesus was pointless. === Twentieth century === In the early part of the twentieth century, biblical criticism was shaped by two main factors and the clash between them. First, form criticism arose and turned the focus of biblical criticism from author to genre, and from individual to community. Next, a scholarly effort to reclaim the Bible's theological relevance began. Karl Barth (1886‚Äì1968), Rudolf Bultmann, and others moved away from concern over the historical Jesus and concentrated instead on the kerygma: the message of the New Testament. Scholars, such as theologian Konrad Hammann, call Bultmann the \\"giant of twentieth-century New Testament biblical criticism: His pioneering studies in biblical criticism shaped research on the composition of the gospels, and his call for demythologizing biblical language sparked debate among Christian theologians worldwide\\". Bultmann's demythologizing refers to the reinterpretation of the biblical myths (\\"myth\\" is defined as descriptions of the divine in human terms). It is not the elimination of myth but is, instead, its re-expression in terms of the existential philosophy of Martin Heidegger (1889‚Äì1976). Bultmann claimed myths are \\"true\\" anthropologically and existentially but not cosmologically. As a major proponent of form criticism, Bultmann \\"set the agenda for a generation of leading New Testament scholars\\". Around the midcentury point the denominational composition of biblical critics themselves began to change. This was due to a shift in perception of the critical effort as being possible on the basis of premises other than liberal Protestantism. While form criticism had divided the text into small units, redaction criticism began in the twentieth century to emphasize the literary integrity of the larger literary units instead. The discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls at Qumran in 1948 renewed interest in the contributions archaeology could make to biblical studies as well as to the challenges it presented to various aspects of biblical criticism. New Testament scholar Joachim Jeremias (1900‚Äì1979) used linguistics, and Jesus' first century Jewish environment, to interpret the New Testament. The biblical theology movement of the 1950s produced a massive debate between Old Testament and New Testament scholars over the unity of the Bible. The rise of redaction criticism closed it by bringing about a greater emphasis on diversity. 1953 saw a revival of interest in the historical Jesus. After 1970 biblical criticism began to change radically and pervasively. New criticism developed as an adjunct to literary criticism concerning the particulars of style. New historicism, a literary theory that views history through literature, also developed. Biblical criticism began to apply new literary approaches such as structuralism and rhetorical criticism, which concentrated less on history and more on the texts themselves. In the 1970s the New Testament scholar E. P. Sanders advanced the New Perspective on Paul, which has greatly influenced scholarly views on the relationship between Pauline Christianity and Jewish Christianity in the Pauline epistles. Sanders also advanced study of the historical Jesus by putting Jesus' life in the context of first-century Second-Temple Judaism. In 1974, the theologian Hans Frei published The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative, which became a landmark work leading to the development of post-critical biblical interpretation. The fourth period of focused study on the historical Jesus began in 1985 with the Jesus Seminar. By 1990 biblical criticism, as a primarily historical discipline, had come to its end as it transformed into a group of disciplines with often conflicting interests. New perspectives from different ethnicities, feminist theology, Catholicism and Judaism revealed an \\"untapped world\\" previously overlooked by the majority of white male Protestants who had dominated biblical criticism from its beginnings. Globalization brought different world views, while other academic fields such as Near Eastern studies, sociology, and anthropology became active in biblical criticism as well. These new points of view created awareness that the Bible can be rationally interpreted from many different perspectives. In turn, this awareness changed biblical criticism's central concept from the criteria of neutral judgment to that of beginning from a recognition of the various biases the reader brings to the study of the texts.  Historical Jesus: the third and fourth quests  Ernst Hildebrand's 1910 painting \\"Kreuzigung Christi\\" depicts the crucifixion of Jesus. The crucifixion is widely regarded by historians as a real historical event. The Quest for the historical Jesus became known as Life of Jesus research in the twentieth century. The First Quest began with the posthumous publication of Hermann Reimarus' effort to reconstruct an \\"authentic historical picture of Jesus\\" instead of a theological one. The study flourished in the nineteenth century, making its mark in the theology of the German Protestant liberals. They saw the purpose of a historically true life of Jesus as a critical force that also functioned theologically against the high Christology established by Roman Catholicism centuries before. Interest languished in the early twentieth century, but revived in 1953 when a former student of Bultmann, Ernst K√§semann, gave a famous lecture saying \\"Bultmann's skepticism concerning what could be known about the historical Jesus was too extreme\\". K√§semann claimed that because the Evangelists recorded theology does not preclude them having recorded history as well. This Third Quest focused on Jesus' teachings as interpreted by existentialist philosophy, and interest waned by the 1970s. By the Fourth Quest of the 1980s, Ben Witherington says it became necessary to acknowledge \\"the upshot of the first quests was to reveal the frustrating limitations of the historical study of any ancient person\\". E. P. Sanders explains that, because of the desire to know everything about Jesus, including his thoughts and motivations, and because there are such varied conclusions about him, it seems to many scholars that it is impossible to be certain about anything. Yet according to Sanders, \\"we know a lot\\" about Jesus. While scholars rarely agree about what is known or unknown about the historical Jesus, according to Witherington, scholars do agree that \\"the historic questions should not be dodged\\". == Major methods == Theologian David R. Law writes that textual, source, form, and redaction criticism are employed together by biblical scholars, while the Old Testament (the Hebrew Bible) and the New Testament are distinct bodies of literature that raise their own problems of interpretation. Therefore, separating these methods, and addressing the Bible as a whole, is an artificial approach that is used here only for the purpose of description. === Textual criticism === Textual criticism examines the text itself and all associated manuscripts to determine the original text. It is one of the largest areas of Biblical criticism in terms of the sheer amount of information it addresses. The roughly 900 manuscripts found at Qumran include the oldest extant manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible. They represent every book except Esther, though most are fragmentary. The New Testament has been preserved in more manuscripts than any other ancient work, having over 5,800 complete or fragmented Greek manuscripts, 10,000 Latin manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages including Syriac, Slavic, Gothic, Ethiopic, Coptic and Armenian. The dates of these manuscripts range from c.110‚Äì125 (the papyrus) to the introduction of printing in Germany in the 15th century. There are also a million New Testament quotations in the collected writings of the Church Fathers of the first four centuries. As a comparison, the next best-sourced ancient text is Homer's Iliad, which is found in more than 1,900 manuscripts, though many are of a fragmentary nature. Numbers and dates for these texts change: scholars constantly update, and not all scholars count texts the same way. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, a functional count excluded texts that were dependent on others, whereas twenty-first cemtury textual criticism is much more inclusive, resulting in higher numbers of texts and a more varied textual basis for reconstructing the New Testament. The Rylands fragment P52 verso is the oldest existing fragment of New Testament Papyrus; it contains phrases from the Book of John. These texts were all written by hand, by copying from another handwritten text, so they are not alike in the manner of a printed work. The differences between them are called variants. A variant is simply any variation between two texts, and while the exact number is somewhat disputed, scholars agree the more texts, the more variants. This means there are more variants concerning New Testament texts than Old Testament texts. Variants are not evenly distributed throughout the texts. Textual scholar Kurt Aland explains that charting the variants shows the New Testament is 62.9% variant- free. Folio 41v from Codex Alexandrinus contains the Gospel of Luke with decorative tailpiece. Many variants originate in simple misspellings or mis- copying. For example, a scribe would drop one or more letters, skip a word or line, write one letter for another, transpose letters, and so on. Some variants represent a scribal attempt to simplify or harmonize, by changing a word or a phrase. Textual scholar Bart Ehrman explains: scribe 'A' will introduce mistakes which are not in the manuscript of scribe 'B'. Copies of text 'A' with the mistake will thereafter contain that same mistake. Over time the texts descended from 'A' that share the error, and those from 'B' that do not share it, will diverge further, but later texts will still be identifiable as descended from one or the other because of the presence or absence of that original mistake\\". The multiple generations of texts that follow, containing the error, are referred to as a \\"family\\" of texts. Textual criticism studies the differences between these families to piece together what the original looked like. Sorting out the wealth of source material is complex, so textual families were sorted into categories tied to geographical areas. The divisions of the New Testament textual families were Alexandrian (also called the \\"Neutral text\\"), Western (Latin translations), and Eastern (used by Antioch and Constantinople). Forerunners of modern textual criticism can be found in both early Rabbinic Judaism and the early church. Rabbis addressed variants in the Hebrew texts as early as AD 100. Tradition played a central role in their task of producing a standard version of the Hebrew Bible. The Hebrew text they produced stabilized by the end of the second century, and has come to be known as the Masoretic text, the source of the Christian Old Testament. The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947 has created problems. While 60% of the Dead Sea manuscripts are closely related to Masoretic tradition, others bear a closer resemblance to the Septuagint (the ancient Greek version of the Hebrew texts) and the Samaritan Pentateuch. For textual criticism, this has raised the question of whether or not there is such a thing that can be considered \\"original text\\". The two main processes of textual criticism are recension and emendation. Recension is the selection of the most trustworthy evidence on which to base a text. Emendation is the attempt to eliminate the errors which are found even in the best manuscripts. Jerome McGann says these methods innately introduce a subjective factor into textual criticism despite its attempt at objective rules. Alan Cooper discusses this difficulty using the example of Amos 6.12 which reads: \\"Does one plough with oxen?\\" The obvious answer is 'yes', but the context of the passage seems to demand a 'no.' Cooper explains that a recombination of the consonants allows it to be read 'Does one plough the sea with oxen?' The amendment has a basis in the text, which is believed to be corrupted, but is nevertheless a matter of personal judgment. All of this contributes to textual criticism being one of the most contentious areas of biblical criticism as well as the largest. It uses specialized methodologies, enough specialized terms to create its own lexicon, and is guided by a number of principles. Yet any of these can be contested, as well as any conclusions based on them, and they often are. For example, in the late 1700s, textual critic Johann Jacob Griesbach developed fifteen critical principles for determining which texts are likely the oldest and closest to the original. One of Griesbach's rules is lectio brevior praeferenda: \\"the shorter reading is preferred\\". This was based on the idea scribes were more likely to add to a text than omit from it, making shorter texts more likely to be older. Latin scholar Albert C. Clark challenged this in 1914. Based on his study of Cicero, Clark argued omission was a more common scribal error than addition, saying \\"A text is like a traveler who goes from one inn to another losing an article of luggage at each stop\\". Clark's claims were criticized by those who supported Griesbach's principles. Clark responded, but disagreement continued. Nearly eighty years later, the theologian and priest James Royse took up the case. After close study of multiple New Testament papyri, he concluded Clark was right, and Griesbach's rule of measure was wrong. Some scholars have recently called to abandon older approaches to textual criticism in favor of new computer-assisted methods for determining manuscript relationships in a more reliable way. === Source criticism === Source criticism is the search for the original sources that form the basis of biblical text. In Old Testament studies, source criticism is generally focused on identifying sources of a single text. For example, the 17th-century French priest Richard Simon (1638‚Äì1712) was an early proponent of the theory that Moses could not have been the single source of the entire Pentateuch. According to Simon, parts of the Old Testament were not written by individuals at all, but by scribes recording the community's oral tradition. Shortly thereafter the French physician Jean Astruc, presumed in 1753 that Moses had used ancient documents to write the book of Genesis, which is the first book of the Pentateuch. Astruc's goal became one of identifying and reconstructing those documents by separating the book of Genesis back into those original sources. He discovered Genesis alternates use of two different names for God while the rest of the Pentateuch after Exodus 3 omits that alternation. He found repetitions of certain events, such as parts of the flood story that are repeated three times indicating the possibility of three sources. He also found apparent anachronisms: statements seemingly from a later time than Genesis was set. Astruc hypothesized that this separate material was fused into a single unit that became the book of Genesis thereby creating its duplications and parallelisms. Further examples of the products of source criticism include its two most influential and well-known theories concerning the origins of the Pentateuch (the Documentary hypothesis) and the four gospels (two-source hypothesis).  Source criticism of the Old Testament: Wellhausen's hypothesis  alt = diagram of Wellhausen's theory in its modern form Hywell Clifford writes that source criticism's most influential work is Julius Wellhausen's Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels (Prologue to the History of Israel, 1878) which sought to establish the sources of the first five books of the Old Testament. Wellhausen correlated the history and development of those five books, known as the Pentateuch, with the development of the Jewish faith. The Documentary hypothesis, also known as the JEDP theory, or the Wellhausen theory, says the Pentateuch was combined out of four separate and coherent sources known as J (which stands for Yahwist, which is spelled with a J in German), E (for Elohist), D (for Deuteronomist), and P (for the Priestly source). Old Testament scholar Karl Graf (1815‚Äì1869) suggested the P in 1866 as the last stratum of the Wellhausen theory. This formulation of the Documentary hypothesis is sometimes also referred to as the Graf‚ÄìWellhausen hypothesis. Later scholars of the Newer Documentary Thesis inferred more sources, with increasing information about their extent and inter-relationship. The fragmentary theory was a later understanding of Wellhausen produced by form criticism. This theory argues that fragments of various documents, and not continuous documents, are the sources for the Pentateuch. This accounts for diversity but not structural and chronological consistency. The Supplementary hypothesis can be seen as an evolution of the Documentary hypothesis that solidified in the 1970s. Proponents of this view assert three sources for the Pentateuch, with the Deuteronomist as the oldest source, and the Torah assembled from a central core document, the Elohist, then supplemented by fragments taken from other sources.  Critique  Advocates of the Documentary hypothesis contend it accounts well for the differences and duplication found in each of the Pentateuchal books. Furthermore, they argue, it provides an explanation for the peculiar character of the material labeled P, which reflects the perspective and concerns of Israel's priests, however, the original theory has also been heavily criticized. Old Testament scholar Ernest Nicholson says that by the end of the 1970s and into the 1990s, \\"one major study after another, like a series of hammer blows, ... rejected the main claims of the Documentary theory, and the criteria on ... which those claims are grounded\\". It has been criticized for its dating of the sources, for assuming that the original sources were coherent, and for assuming E and P were originally complete documents. Studies of the literary structure of the Pentateuch have shown J and P used the same structure, and that motifs and themes cross the boundaries of the various sources, which undermines arguments for separate origins. Problems and criticisms of the Documentary hypothesis have been brought on by literary analysis, by anthropological developments, and also by various archaeological findings. According to Thomas L. Thompson, archaeological discoveries during the 1920s and the 1930s transformed the historical aspects of these biblical studies. Few biblical scholars of the twenty‚Äìfirst century hold to Wellhausen's Documentary hypothesis in its classical form. While current debate has modified Wellhausen's conclusions, Nicholson says \\"for all that it needs revision and development in detail, [the work of Wellhausen] remains the securest basis for understanding the Pentateuch\\". Critical scholar Pauline Viviano agrees, stating that the general contours of Wellhausen's view remain with the Newer Documentary Hypothesis providing the best answers to the complex question of how the Pentateuch was formed.  Source criticism of the New Testament: the synoptic problem  In New Testament studies, source criticism has taken a slightly different approach from Old Testament studies by focusing on identifying the common sources of multiple texts instead of looking for the multiple sources of a single set of texts. This has revealed the Gospels are both products of sources and sources themselves. As sources, Matthew, Mark and Luke are partially dependent on each other and partially independent of each other. This is called the synoptic problem, and explaining it is the single greatest dilemma of New Testament source criticism. Any explanation offered must \\"account for (a) what is common to all the Gospels; (b) what is common to any two of them; (c) what is peculiar to each\\". Multiple theories exist to address the dilemma, with none universally agreed upon, however, two theories have become predominant: the two-source hypothesis and the four-source hypothesis. Mark is the shortest of the four gospels with only 661 verses, but six hundred of those verses are in Matthew and 350 of them are in Luke. Some of these verses are verbatim. Most scholars agree that this indicates Mark was a source for Matthew and Luke. There is also some verbatim agreement between Matthew and Luke of verses not found in Mark. In 1838, the religious philosopher Christian Hermann Weisse developed a theory about this. He postulated a hypothetical collection of Jesus' sayings from an additional source called Q, taken from Quelle, which is German for \\"source\\". If this document existed, it has now been lost, but some of its material can be deduced indirectly. According to Harry T. Fleddermann, there are five highly detailed arguments in favor of Q's existence that rest upon the verbal agreement of Mark and Luke, the order of the parables, the doublets, a discrepancy in the priorities of each gospel and each one's internal coherence. Q allowed the two-source hypothesis to emerge as the best supported of the various synoptic solutions. There is also material unique to each gospel. This indicates additional separate sources for Matthew and for Luke. Biblical scholar B. H. Streeter used this insight to refine and expand the two-source theory into a four-source theory in 1925.  Critique  While most scholars agree that the two-source theory offers the best explanation for the Synoptic problem, and some say it has been solved, others such as Zeba Antonin Crook say \\"it is far from solved\\".Crook, Z. A. (2000). The Synoptic Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Leaven: a Test-Case for the Two-Document, Two-Gospel, and Farrer-Goulder Hypotheses. Journal for the Study of the New Testament, 22(78), page=abstract. https://doi.org/10.1177/0142064X0002207802 Donald Guthrie says no single theory offers a complete solution as there are complex and important difficulties that create challenges to every theory. One example is Basil Christopher Butler's challenge to the legitimacy of two-source theory, arguing it contains a Lachmann fallacy that says the two-source theory loses cohesion when it is acknowledged that no source can be established for Mark. F. C. Grant posits multiple sources for the Gospels. === Form criticism === Form criticism began in the early twentieth century when theologian Karl Ludwig Schmidt observed that Mark's Gospel is composed of short units. Schmidt asserted these small units were remnants and evidence of the oral tradition that preceded the writing of the gospels. Bible scholar Richard Bauckham says this \\"most significant insight,\\" which established the foundation of form criticism, has never been refuted. Hermann Gunkel (1862‚Äì1932) and Martin Dibelius (1883‚Äì1947) built from this insight and pioneered form criticism. By the 1950s and 1960s, Rudolf Bultmann and form criticism were the \\"center of the theological conversation in both Europe and North America\\". Form criticism breaks the Bible down into its short units, called pericopes, which are then classified by genre: prose or verse, letters, laws, court archives, war hymns, poems of lament, and so on. Form criticism then theorizes concerning the individual pericope's Sitz im Leben (\\"setting in life\\" or \\"place in life\\"). Based on their understanding of folklore, form critics believed the early Christian communities formed the sayings and teachings of Jesus themselves, according to their needs (their \\"situation in life\\"), and that each form could be identified by the situation in which it had been created and vice versa.  Critique of Form criticism  In the early to mid twentieth century, form critics thought finding oral \\"laws of development\\" within the New Testament would prove form criticism's assertions about how the text developed. Since Mark was believed to be the first gospel, the form critics looked for the addition of proper names for anonymous characters, indirect discourse being turned into direct quotation, and the elimination of Aramaic terms and forms, with details becoming more concrete in Matthew, and then more so in Luke. Instead, in the 1970s, New Testament scholar E. P. Sanders wrote that: \\"There are no hard and fast laws of the development of the Synoptic tradition. On all counts the tradition developed in opposite directions. It became both longer and shorter, both more or less detailed, and both more and less Semitic. 'Even the tendency to use direct discourse for indirect, which was uniform in the post-canonical material which we studied, was not uniform in the Synoptics themselves'...\\" According to Old Testament scholar Rolf Knierim, scholars since the 1970s have produced an \\"explosion of studies\\" on structure, genre, text-type, setting and language that have challenged several of form criticism's aspects and assumptions. Richard Burridge says: \\"The general critique of form criticism came from various sources, putting several areas in particular under scrutiny\\". For example, during the latter half of the twentieth century, field studies of cultures with existing oral traditions impacted form criticism directly. In 1978, research by linguists Milman Parry and Albert Bates Lord undermined Gunkel's belief that \\"short oral narratives evolved into long ones\\". Within these oral cultures, literacy did not replace memory, instead, writing was used to enhance memory in an overlap of written and oral tradition. Susan Niditch concluded from her orality studies that: \\"no longer are many scholars convinced that the most seemingly oral-traditional or formulaic pieces are earliest in date\\". Miller quotes Niditch as saying, \\"oral works can become quite fixed, a virtual 'text,' while written works can display the qualities of performance\\". According to Eddy and Boyd, this directly undermines Sitz im leben: \\"In light of what we now know of oral traditions, no necessary correlation between [the literary] forms and life situations can be confidently drawn\\". Form criticism assumed the early Church was heavily influenced by the Hellenistic culture that surrounded first- century Palestine, but in the 1970s, E. P. Sanders, as well as Gerd Theissen, sparked new rounds of studies that included anthropological and sociological perspectives, reestablishing Judaism as the predominant influence on Jesus, Paul, and the New Testament. New Testament scholar N. T. Wright says, \\"The earliest traditions of Jesus reflected in the Gospels are written from the perspective of Second Temple Judaism [and] must be interpreted from the standpoint of Jewish eschatology and apocalypticism\\". Religion scholar Werner H. Kelber says form criticism throughout the mid-twentieth century was so focused toward finding each pericope's original form, that it was distracted from any serious consideration of memory as a dynamic force in the construction of the gospels or the early church community tradition. What Kelber refers to as form criticism's \\"astounding myopia\\" has revived interest in memory as an analytical category within biblical criticism. For some, the many challenges to form criticism mean its future is in doubt. Bible scholar Tony Campbell says: > Form criticism had a meteoric rise in the early part of the twentieth > century and fell from favor toward its end. For some, the future of form > criticism is not an issue: it has none. But if form criticism embodies an > essential insight, it will continue. ... Two elements embody this insight > and give it its value: concern for the nature of the text and for its shape > and structure. ... If the encrustations can be scraped away, the \\"good > stuff\\" may still be there. === Redaction criticism === A diagram of the complexity of the Synoptic problem Redaction is the process of editing multiple sources, often with a similar theme, into a single document. Daniel Harrington says that redaction criticism is the \\"child\\" of source and form criticism and can be seen as derived from them. As in source criticism, it is necessary to identify the traditions before determining how the redactor used them. Form criticism saw the synoptic writers as mere collectors and focused on the Sitz im Leben as the creator of the texts, whereas redaction criticism deals more positively with the Gospel writers, asserting an understanding of them as theologians of the early church. Redaction criticism rejects source and form criticism's description of the Bible texts as mere collections of fragments. Where form criticism fractures the biblical elements into smaller and smaller individual pieces, redaction criticism attempts to interpret the whole literary unit. According to Richard Burridge, Norman Perrin defines redaction criticism as \\"the study of the theological motivation of an author as it is revealed in the collection, arrangement, editing, and modification of traditional material, and in the composition of new material ... redaction criticism directs us to the author as editor...\\" Redaction criticism developed after World War II in Germany and arrived in England and North America by the 1950s. It focuses on discovering how and why the literary units were originally edited‚Äî\\"redacted\\"‚Äîinto their final forms.  Critique  Redaction criticism assumes an extreme skepticism toward the historicity of Jesus and the gospels just as form criticism does. It seeks the historical community of the final redactors of the gospels, though there is often no textual clue, and Porter and Adams say its method in finding the final editor's theology is flawed. In the New Testament, redaction discerns the original author/evangelist's theology by focusing and relying upon the differences between the gospels, yet it is unclear whether every difference has theological meaning, how much meaning, or whether any given difference is a stylistic or even an accidental change. Further, it is not at all clear whether the difference was made by the evangelist, who could have used the already changed story when writing a gospel. The evangelist's theology more likely depends on what the gospels have in common as well as their differences. Harrington says, \\"over-theologizing, allegorizing, and psychologizing are the major pitfalls encountered\\" in redaction criticism. Followers of other theories concerning the Synoptic problem, such as those who support the Greisbach hypothesis which says Matthew was written first, Luke second, and Mark third, have pointed to weaknesses in the redaction-based arguments for the existence of Q and Markan priority. Mark Goodacre says \\"Some scholars have used the success of redaction criticism as a means of supporting the existence of Q, but this will always tend toward circularity, particularly given the hypothetical nature of Q which itself is reconstructed by means of redaction criticism\\". === Literary criticism === In the mid-twentieth century, literary criticism began to develop, shifting scholarly attention from historical and pre-compositional matters to the text itself, thereafter becoming the dominant form of biblical criticism in a relatively short period of about thirty years. It can be said to have begun in 1957 when literary critic Northrop Frye wrote an analysis of the Bible from the perspective of his literary background by using literary criticism to understand the Bible forms. Frei proposed that \\"biblical narratives should be evaluated on their own terms\\" rather than by taking them apart in the manner we evaluate philosophy or historicity. Frei was one of several external influences that moved biblical criticism from a historical to a literary focus. New Testament scholar Paul R. House says the discipline of linguistics, new views of historiography, and the decline of older methods of criticism were also influential in that process. By 1974, the two methodologies being used in literary criticism were rhetorical analysis and structuralism. Rhetorical analysis divides a passage into units, observes how a single unit shifts or breaks, taking special note of poetic devices, meter, parallelism, word play and so on. It then charts the writer's thought progression from one unit to the next, and finally, assembles the data in an attempt to explain the author's intentions behind the piece. Critics of rhetorical analysis say there is a \\"lack of a well-developed methodology\\" and that it has a \\"tendency to be nothing more than an exercise in stylistics\\". Structuralism looks at the language to discern \\"layers of meaning\\" with the goal of uncovering a work's \\"deep structures:\\" the premises as well as the purposes of the author. In 1981 literature scholar Robert Alter also contributed to the development of biblical literary criticism by publishing an influential analysis of biblical themes from a literary perspective. The 1980s saw the rise of formalism, which focuses on plot, structure, character and themes and the development of reader-response criticism which focuses on the reader rather than the author. New Testament scholar Donald Guthrie highlights a flaw in the literary critical approach to the Gospels: the genre of the Gospels has not been fully determined. No conclusive evidence has yet been produced to settle the question of genre, and without genre, no adequate parallels can be found, and without parallels \\"it must be considered to what extent the principles of literary criticism are applicable\\". The validity of using the same critical methods for novels and for the Gospels, without the assurance the Gospels are actually novels, must be questioned.  Canonical criticism  As a type of literary criticism, canonical criticism has both theological and literary roots. Its origins are found in the Church's views of the biblical writings as sacred, and in the secular literary critics who began to influence biblical scholarship in the 1940s and 1950s. By the mid-twentieth century, the high level of departmentalization in biblical criticism, with its mountains of data and absence of applicable theology, had begun to produce a level of dissatisfaction among both scholars and faith communities. Brevard S. Childs (1923‚Äì2007) proposed an approach to bridge that gap that came to be called canonical criticism. Canonical criticism \\"signaled a major and enduring shift in biblical studies\\". Canonical criticism does not reject historical criticism, but it does reject its claim to \\"unique validity\\". John Barton says \\"canonical criticism does not simply ask what the text might have originally meant, it asks what it means now to the believing community\\". John H. Hayes (theologian) and Carl Holladay say \\"canonical criticism has several distinguishing features: (1) Canonical criticism is synchronic; it sees all biblical writings as a single collection standing together in time instead of focusing on the diachronic questions of the historical approach. (2) Canonical critics approach the books in their finished forms as whole units instead of taking them apart and focusing on isolated pieces. They accept that many texts have been composed over long periods of time, but the canonical critic wishes \\"to interpret the last edition of a biblical book\\" and then relate those books to each other. (3) Canonical criticism opposes approaches like form criticism that isolate individual passages from their canonical setting. In canonical criticism, a single text can only be read as part of the whole Bible and never independently. (4) Canonical criticism emphasizes the relationship between the text and its reader. In an effort to reclaim the relationship between the texts themselves and how the texts were used in the early believing communities of faith, canonical critics focus on how the reader interacts with the biblical writing. (5) 'Canonical criticism is overtly theological in its approach. Canonical critics are primarily interested in what the text means for the canonizing community‚Äîthe community of faith whose predecessors produced the canon, that was called into existence by the canon, and seeks to live by the canon'.\\"  Rhetorical criticism  Rhetorical criticism is also a type of literary criticism, and while James Muilenburg (1896‚Äì1974) is often referred to as \\"the prophet of rhetorical criticism,\\" Herbert A. Wichelns is credited with \\"creating the modern discipline of rhetorical criticism\\" with his 1925 essay \\"The Literary Criticism of Oratory\\". In that essay, Wichelns says that rhetorical criticism and other types of literary criticism, differ from each other because rhetorical criticism is only concerned with \\"effect. It regards a speech as a communication to a specific audience, and holds its business to be the analysis and appreciation of the orator's method of imparting his ideas to his hearers\\". The rhetorical scholar Sonja K. Foss explains that rhetorical criticism is a qualitative analysis. According to Foss, \\"This definition includes three primary dimensions: (1) systematic analysis of the act of criticism; (2) acts and artifacts as the objects of analysis in criticism; and (3) understanding rhetorical processes as the purpose of criticism\\". Foss discusses ten different methods of rhetorical criticism in her book \\"Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice\\" saying that each method will produce different insights. Biblical rhetorical criticism makes use of understanding the \\"forms, genres, structures, stylistic devices and rhetorical techniques\\" common to the Near Eastern literature of the different ages when the separate books of biblical literature were written. It attempts to discover and evaluate the rhetorical devices, language, and methods of communication used within the texts by focusing on the use of \\"repetition, parallelism, strophic structure, motifs, climax, chiasm and numerous other literary devices\\". Phyllis Trible, a student of Muilenburg, has become one of the leaders of rhetorical criticism and is known for her detailed literary analysis and her feminist critique of biblical interpretation.  Narrative criticism  Historical critics began to recognize the Bible was not being studied in the manner other ancient writings were studied, and they began asking if these texts should be understood on their own terms before being used as evidence of something else. According to Mark Allen Powell the difficulty in understanding them on their own terms is determining what those terms are: \\"The problem with treating the gospels 'just like any other book' is that the gospels are not like any other book\\". The New Critics, (whose views were absorbed by narrative criticism), asserted that meaning and value reside within the text itself. It is now accepted as \\"axiomatic in literary circles that the meaning of literature transcends the historical intentions of the author\\". As a form of literary criticism, narrative criticism approaches scripture as story, focusing on the finished form of the texts. Christopher T. Paris says that, \\"narrative criticism admits the existence of sources and redaction but chooses to focus on the artistic weaving of these materials into a sustained narrative picture\\". Narrative criticism analyzes narratives as complete tapestries, organic wholes, and attends to the constitutive features of narratives such as characters, setting, plot, literary devices (for example, irony), point of view, narrator, implied author, and implied reader. According to James L. Resseguie, \\"of the three main components of a literary work‚Äîauthor, text, reader‚Äînarrative criticism is focused primarily on the text\\". Narrative criticism began being used to study the New Testament in the 1970s with the works of David Rhoads, Jack D. Kingsbury, R. Alan Culpepper, and Robert C. Tannehill. A decade later, this new approach in biblical criticism included the Old Testament as well. The first time a published article was labeled narrative criticism wasn't until 1982, in \\"Narrative Criticism and the Gospel of Mark,\\" written by Bible scholar David Rhoads. Stephen D. Moore has written that \\"as a term, narrative criticism originated within biblical studies. As a method, it appropriated narratology\\". It was also influenced by New Criticism which saw each literary work as a freestanding whole with intrinsic meaning. Sharon Betsworth says Robert Alter's work is what adapted New Criticism to the Bible. Scholars such as Robert Alter and Frank Kermode sought to teach readers to appreciate the texts based on their artfulness‚Äîhow [the text] orchestrates sound, repetition, dialogue, allusion, and ambiguity to generate meaning and effect\\". == Biblical criticism's legacy == Ken and Richard Soulen say that \\"biblical criticism has permanently altered perception of the Bible\\". One way this has occurred has been through the forging of what Jonathon Sheehan calls a \\"cultural Bible\\". The Bible has become recognized as \\"the foundational document of our culture\\". It is no longer thought of solely as a religious artifact, and its interpretation is no longer restricted to the community of believers. Walter A. Elwell and Robert W. Yarbrough write that \\"no culturally literate person\\" can afford to be ignorant of what the Bible says. Its cultural impact is therefore studied in multiple academic fields. Michael C. Legaspi says, \\"The Enlightenment not only led to the forging of cultural Bibles; it also produced the modern academic Bible\\". Soulen adds that \\"[Biblical criticism's] leading practitioners have set such high standards of scholarship that they 'remain pace-setting today'.\\" There are also scholars, such as Sheila Devaney, who say that biblical authority has been assaulted by biblical criticism through the \\"autonomy of reason\\". In Devaney's view, biblical criticism has \\"increasingly diminished confidence in the reliability and intelligibility of the Bible\\". According to John Barton, there are aspects of biblical criticism that have been hostile to the Bible and the religions whose scripture it is, in both intent and effect. \\"By 1800 historical criticism in Germany had reached the point where Genesis had been divided into two or more sources, the unity of authorship of Isaiah and Daniel had been disputed, the interdependence of the first three gospels had been demonstrated, and miraculous elements in Old Testament and the New Testament had been explained as resulting from the primitive or pre-scientific outlook of the biblical writers\\". Jeffrey Burton Russell describes biblical criticism's early legacy saying, \\"Faith was transferred from the words of scripture to those of the critics, as '...liberal Christianity retreated hastily before the advance of science and biblical criticism. By the end of the eighteenth century, advanced liberals had abandoned the core of Christian beliefs'.\\" On the one hand, J. W. Rogerson says that \\"historical criticism is not inherently inimical to Christian belief\\". On the other hand, as Michael Fishbane frankly wrote in 1992, \\"We are no longer as we were. No longer are we sustained within a biblical matrix: ...The labor of many centuries has expelled us from this edenic womb and its wellsprings of life and knowledge. ...is this not because the Bible has lost its ancient authority? To be sure, there are those who regard the desacralization of the Bible as the fortunate condition for the rise of new sensibilities and modes of imagination\\". Religion and ethics scholar Jeffrey Stout says this \\"crisis of authority\\" is part of what led to the creation of the modern world. What this means for the community of faith is the question on the other hand: can the text, after two hundred years of biblical criticism, still be seen as sacred? Fishbane says, \\"This question affects our innermost cultural being and our relationship to the foundational text of our cultural and religious origins\\". Fishbane compares biblical criticism to Job, a prophet who destroyed \\"self-serving visions for the sake of a more honest crossing from the divine textus to the human one\\". Or as Rogerson says: biblical criticism has been liberating for those who want their faith \\"intelligently grounded and intellectually honest\\". According to Fishbane, traditional Judaism teaches the fourfold meaning of the biblical text: its plain meaning, its hermeneutical meaning as it developed within communities, its hidden meanings within its symbolic structures, and the 'deep, divine affinities' found within its transcendent texts. [Part of the legacy of biblical criticism is that the community of faith now sees that] \\"the sacrality of the Bible is at once simple and symbolic, individual and communal, practical and paradoxical. Thus we may say that the Bible itself can help retrieve the notion of a sacred text\\". === Evangelical === The American fundamentalist movement of the 1920s and 1930s began, at least partly, as a response to what was seen as the of higher criticism in nineteenth century liberalism. Some fundamentalists believed liberal critics had invented an entirely new religion \\"completely at odds with the Christian faith\\". There have also been conservative Protestants who accepted biblical criticism. William Robertson Smith (1846‚Äì1894) is an example of a nineteenth century evangelical who believed historical criticism was a legitimate outgrowth of the Protestant Reformation's focus on the biblical text. He saw it as a \\"necessary tool to enable intelligent churchgoers\\" to understand the Bible, and was a pioneer in establishing the final form of the supplementary hypothesis of the documentary hypothesis. A similar view was later advocated by the Primitive Methodist biblical scholar A. S. Peake (1865‚Äì1929). Evangelical Protestant scholars (such as Edwin M. Yamauchi, Paul R. House, and Daniel B. Wallace) have continued the tradition of conservatives contributing to critical scholarship. Mark Noll says that \\"in recent years, a steadily growing number of well qualified and published scholars have broadened and deepened the impact of evangelical scholars\\". === Catholic === Monseigneur Joseph G. Prior says, \\"Catholic studies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries avoided the use of critical methodology because of its rationalism [so there was] no significant Catholic involvement in biblical scholarship until the nineteenth century\\". In 1890, the French Dominican Marie-Joseph Lagrange (1855‚Äì1938) established the √âcole Biblique in Jerusalem to encourage study of the Bible using the historical-critical method. Two years later he funded a journal, spoke thereafter at various conferences, wrote Bible commentaries that incorporated textual critical work of his own, did pioneering work on biblical genres and forms, and laid the path to overcoming resistance to the historical-critical method among his fellow scholars. Then Pope Leo XIII (1810‚Äì1903) condemned biblical scholarship based on rationalism in his encyclical letter Providentissimus Deus (\\"On the Study of Holy Scripture\\") on 18 November 1893. It declared that no exegete was allowed to interpret a text to contradict church doctrine. Later, in 1943 on the fiftieth anniversary of the Providentissimus Deus, Pope Pius XII issued the papal encyclical Divino afflante spiritu ('Inspired by the Holy Spirit') sanctioning historical criticism, opening a new epoch in Catholic critical scholarship. The Jesuit Augustin Bea (1881‚Äì1968) had played a vital part in its publication. This tradition is continued by Catholic scholars such as John P. Meier, and Conleth Kearns who also worked with Reginald C. Fuller and Leonard Johnston preparing the New Catholic Commentary. === Jewish === Hebrew Bible scholar Jon D. Levenson has described how some Jewish scholars, such as rabbinicist Solomon Schechter , did not participate in biblical criticism at first because they saw criticism of the Pentateuch as a threat to Jewish identity. The growing anti-semitism in Germany of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the perception that higher criticism was an entirely Protestant Christian pursuit, and the sense that many Bible critics were not impartial academics but were proponents of supersessionism, prompted Schechter to describe \\"Higher Criticism as Higher Anti-semitism\\". One of the earliest historical-critical Jewish scholars of Pentateuchal studies was M. M. Kalisch, who began work in the nineteenth century. In the early twentieth century, historical criticism of the Pentateuch became mainstream among Jewish scholars. In 1905, Rabbi David Zvi Hoffmann wrote an extensive, two-volume, philologically based critique of the Wellhausen theory, which supported Jewish orthodoxy. Bible professor Benjamin D. Sommer says it is \\"among the most precise and detailed commentaries on the legal texts [Leviticus and Deuteronomy] ever written\\". According to Aly Elrefaei, the strongest refutation of Wellhausen's Documentary theory came from Yehezkel Kaufmann in 1937. Kaufmann was the first Jewish scholar to fully exploit higher criticism to counter another hypothesis of higher criticism. Wellhausen's and Kaufmann's methods were similar yet their conclusions were opposed. Mordechai Breuer, who branches out beyond most Jewish exegesis and explores the implications of historical criticism for multiple subjects, is an example of a twenty-first century Jewish biblical critical scholar. === Feminist === Feminist criticism is an aspect of the feminist theology movement which began in the 1960s and 1970s as part of the feminist movement in the United States. Three phases of feminist biblical interpretation are connected to the three phases, or 'waves', of the movement. Feminist theology has since responded to globalization, making itself less specifically Western, thereby moving beyond its original narrative \\"as a movement defined by the USA\\". In the 1980s, Phyllis Trible and Elisabeth Sch√ºssler Fiorenza reframed biblical criticism itself by challenging the supposed disinterest and objectivity it claimed for itself, and exposing how ideological-theological stances had played a critical role in interpretation. The patriarchal model of ancient Israel had become an aspect of biblical criticism through the anthropology of the nineteenth century. Feminist scholars of second-wave feminism appropriated it. Third wave feminists began raising concerns about its accuracy. Meyers concludes \\"male dominance was real; but it was fragmentary, not hegemonic\\". Feminist criticism embraces the inter-disciplinary approach to biblical criticism, encouraging a reader-response approach to the text that includes an attitude of \\"dissent\\" or \\"resistance\\". === Global === In the mid to late 1990s, a global response to the changes in biblical criticism began to coalesce as \\"Postcolonial biblical criticism\\". Fernando F. Segovia and Stephen D. Moore postulate that it emerged from \\"liberation hermeneutics, or extra-biblical Postcolonial studies, or even from historical biblical criticism, or from all three sources at once\\". It has a focus on the indigenous and local with an eye toward recovering those aspects of culture that Colonialism had erased or suppressed. The Postcolonial view is rooted in a consciousness of the geopolitical situation for all people, and is \\"transhistorical and transcultural\\". According to Laura E. Donaldson, Postcolonial criticism is oppositional, multidimensional, and \\"attentive to culture, race, class and gender\\". === African-American === Michael Joseph Brown writes that African-Americans responded to the assumption of universality in biblical criticism by challenging it. He says all Bible readings are contextual in that readers bring with them their own context: perceptions and experiences harvested from social and cultural situations. African-American biblical criticism is contextual, based on liberation theology and black theology, and looks for what is potentially liberating in the texts. === Changes in Methods === Socio-scientific criticism is a development of historical criticism that is part of the wider trend in biblical criticism to reflect interdisciplinary methods and diversity. It grew out of form criticism's Sitz im Leben and the sense that historical form criticism had failed to adequately analyze the social and anthropological contexts which form criticism claimed had formed the texts. Using the perspectives, theories, models, and research of the social sciences to determine what social norms may have influenced the growth of biblical tradition, it is similar to historical biblical criticism in its goals and methods and has less in common with literary critical approaches. It analyzes the social and cultural dimensions of the text and its environmental context. New historicism emerged as traditional historical biblical criticism changed. Lois Tyson says this new form of historical criticism developed in the 1970s. It \\"rejects both traditional historicism's marginalization of literature and New Criticism's enshrinement of the literary text in a timeless dimension beyond history\\". Literary texts are seen as \\"cultural artifacts\\" that reveal context as well as content, and within New Historicism, the \\"literary text and the historical situation\\" are equally important\\". In the 1940s and 1950s the term postmodern came into use to signify a rejection of modern conventions. Many of these early postmodernist views came from France following World War II. Postmodernism has been associated with Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, radical politics, and arguments against metaphysics and ideology. It questions anything that claims \\"objectively secured foundations, universals, metaphysics, or analytical dualism\\". Biblical scholar A. K. M. Adam says postmodernism has three general features: 1) it denies any privileged starting point for truth; 2) it is critical of theories that attempt to explain the \\"totality of reality;\\" and 3) it attempts to show that all ideals are grounded in ideological, economic or political self-interest. Post-critical interpretation, according to Ken and Richard Soulen, \\"shares postmodernism's suspicion of modern claims to neutral standards of reason, but not its hostility toward theological interpretation\\". It begins with the understanding that biblical criticism's focus on historicity produced a distinction between the meaning of what the text says and what it is about (what it historically references). The biblical scholar Hans Frei wrote that what he refers to as the \\"realistic narratives\\" of literature, including the Bible, don't allow for such separation. Subject matter is identical to verbal meaning and is found in plot and nowhere else. \\"As Frei puts it, scripture 'simultaneously depicts and renders the reality (if any) of what it talks about'; its subject matter is 'constituted by, or identical with, its narrative'\\". == Notes == == References == == Further reading == * See Section 6, Future Trends in Biblical Interpretation, overview of some current trends in biblical criticism. * See review at Reviews a survey of postmodernist biblical criticism. * See review at Discusses contemporary form criticism. ==External links== *Allen P.

Category:Biblical studies ","title":"Biblical criticism"},{"id":"517387","text":"Nevalƒ± √áori () was an early Neolithic settlement on the middle Euphrates, in ≈ûanlƒ±urfa Province, Southeastern Anatolia, Turkey. The site is known for having some of the world's oldest known temples and monumental sculpture. Together with the earlier site of G√∂bekli Tepe, it has revolutionised scientific understanding of the Eurasian Neolithic period. The oldest domesticated Einkorn wheat was found there. The settlement was located about 490 m above sea level, in the foothills of the Taurus Mountains, on both banks of the Kantara stream, a tributary of the Euphrates. ==Excavation== The site was examined from 1983 to 1991 in the context of rescue excavations during the erection of the Atat√ºrk Dam below Samsat. Excavations were conducted by a team from the University of Heidelberg under the direction of Professor Harald Hauptmann. Together with numerous other archaeological sites in the vicinity, Nevalƒ± √áori has since been inundated by the damming of the Euphrates.The Archaeological Settlements of Turkey - TAY Project ==Archaeological chronology== Model of Nevali √áori site Nevalƒ± √áori could be placed within the local relative chronology on the basis of its flint tools. The occurrence of narrow unretouched Byblos-type points places it on Oliver Aurenche's Phase 3, i.e. early to middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB). Some tools indicate continuity into Phase 4, which is similar in date to Late PPNB. An even finer chronological distinction within Phase 3 is permitted by the settlement's architecture; the house type with underfloor channels, typical of Nevalƒ± √áori strata I-IV, also characterises the \\"Intermediate Layer\\" at √áay√∂n√º, while the differing plan of the single building in stratum V, House 1, is more clearly connected to the buildings of the \\"Cellular Plan Layer\\" at √áay√∂n√º. ===Common date=== In terms of absolute dates, four radiocarbon dates have been determined for Nevalƒ± √áori. Three are from Stratum II and date it with some certainty to the second half of the 9th millennium BC, which coincides with early dates from √áay√∂n√º and with Mureybet IVA and thus supports the relative chronology above. The fourth dates to the 10th millennium BC, which, if correct, would indicate the presence of an extremely early phase of PPNB at Nevalƒ± √áori.Early Places Without Metals ==Houses== Archaeological illustration from Nevalƒ± √áori, eastern Turkey The settlement had five architectural levels. The excavated architectural remains were of long rectangular houses containing two to three parallel flights of rooms, interpreted as mezzanines. These are adjacent to a similarly rectangular ante-structure, subdivided by wall projections, which should be seen as a residential space. This type of house is characterized by thick, multi-layered foundations made of large angular cobbles and boulders, the gaps filled with smaller stones so as to provide a relatively even surface to support the superstructure. These foundations are interrupted every 1-1.5m by underfloor channels, at right angles to the main axis of the houses, which were covered in stone slabs but open to the sides. They may have served the drainage, aeration or the cooling of the houses. 23 such structures were excavated, they are strikingly similar to structures from the so-called channeled subphase at √áay√∂n√º. An area in the northwest part of the village appears to be of special importance. Here, a cult complex had been cut into the hillside. It had three subsequent architectural phases, the most recent belonging to Stratum III, the middle one to Stratum II and the oldest to Stratum I. The two more recent phases also possessed a terrazzo-style lime cement floor, which did not survive from the oldest phase. Parallels are known from Cay√∂n√º and G√∂bekli Tepe. Monolithic pillars similar to those at G√∂bekli Tepe were built into its dry stone walls, its interior contained two free- standing pillars of 3 m height. The excavator assumes light flat roofs. Similar structures are only known from G√∂bekli Tepe so far. Soundings cut to examine the western side of the valley also revealed rectilinear architecture in 2-3 layers. ==Sculpture and clay figurines== Fragment of Neolithic art from Nevalƒ± √áori depicting a hunting scene The local limestone was carved into numerous statues and smaller sculptures, including a more than life-sized bare human head with a snake or sikha-like tuft. There is also a statue of a bird. Some of the pillars also bore reliefs, including ones of human hands. The free-standing anthropomorphic figures of limestone excavated at Nevalƒ± √áori belong to the earliest known life-size sculptures. Comparable material has been found at G√∂bekli Tepe. Several hundred small clay figurines (about 5 cm high), most of them depicting humans, have been interpreted as votive offerings. They were fired at temperatures between 500-600 ¬∞C, which suggests the development of ceramic firing technology before the advent of pottery proper. ==Bas relief== A bas relief on a fragment of a limestone bowl depicts two humans and one tortoise-like creature dancing. Figure 13. ==Burials== Some of the houses contained depositions of human skulls and incomplete skeletons.Hauptmann, H., Ein Kultgeb√§ude in Nevalƒ± √áori, in: M. Frangipane u.a.

It is the burial site of many prominent members of the Boston Brahmins, as well being a National Historic Landmark. Dedicated in 1831 and set with classical monuments in a rolling landscaped terrain, it marked a distinct break with Colonial-era burying grounds and church-affiliated graveyards. The appearance of this type of landscape coincides with the rising popularity of the term \\"cemetery,\\" derived from the Greek for \\"a sleeping place,\\" instead of graveyard. This language and outlook eclipsed the previous harsh view of death and the afterlife embodied by old graveyards and church burial plots. The cemetery is important both for its historical aspects and for its role as an arboretum. It is Watertown's largest contiguous open space and extends into Cambridge to the east, adjacent to the Cambridge City Cemetery and Sand Banks Cemetery. It was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 2003 for its pioneering role in 19th-century cemetery development. ==History== The land that became Mount Auburn Cemetery was originally named Stone's Farm, though locals referred to it as \\"Sweet Auburn\\" after the 1770 poem \\"The Deserted Village\\" by Oliver Goldsmith. Mount Auburn Cemetery was inspired by P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris and was itself an inspiration to cemetery designers, most notably at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn (1838) and Abney Park in London. Mount Auburn Cemetery was designed largely by Henry Alexander Scammell Dearborn with assistance from Jacob Bigelow and Alexander Wadsworth. Bigelow came up with the idea for Mount Auburn as early as 1825, though a site was not acquired until five years later. Bigelow, a medical doctor, was concerned about the unhealthiness of burials under churches as well as the possibility of running out of space. With help from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, Mount Auburn Cemetery was founded on of land authorized by the Massachusetts Legislature for use as a garden or rural cemetery. The original land cost $6,000; it later extended to . The main gate was built in the Egyptian Revival style and cost $10,000 ($249,818.60 in 2015). The first president of the Mount Auburn Association, Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, dedicated the cemetery in 1831. Story's dedication address, delivered on September 24, 1831,Joseph Story, An Address Delivered on the Dedication of the Cemetery at Mount Auburn, September 24, 1831 (Boston, J.T. & Edward Buckingham 1831) set the model for many more addresses in the following three decades.Alfred L. Brophy, \\"These Great and Beautiful Republics of the Dead\\": Public Constitutionalism and the Antebellum Cemetery Garry Wills focuses on it as an important precursor to President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.Garry Wills, Lincoln at Gettysburg: The Words that Remade America The cemetery is credited as the beginning of the American public parks and gardens movement. It set the style for other suburban American cemeteries such as Laurel Hill Cemetery (Philadelphia, 1836), Mount Hope Cemetery (Bangor, Maine, 1834), America's first municipal rural cemetery; Green-Wood Cemetery (Brooklyn, 1838), The Green Mount Cemetery (Baltimore, Maryland, 1839) Mount Hope Cemetery (Rochester, NY, 1838), Allegheny Cemetery (Pittsburgh, 1844), Albany Rural Cemetery (Menands, New York, 1844), Swan Point Cemetery (Providence, Rhode Island 1846), Spring Grove Cemetery (Cincinnati, 1844), and Forest Hills Cemetery (Jamaica Plain, 1848) as well as Oakwood Cemetery in Syracuse, New York. It can be considered the link between Capability Brown's English landscape gardens and Frederick Law Olmsted's Central Park in New York (1850s). Mount Auburn was established at a time when Americans had a sentimental interest in rural cemeteries. It is still well known for its tranquil atmosphere and accepting attitude toward death. Many of the more traditional monuments feature poppy flowers, symbols of blissful sleep. In the late 1830s, its first unofficial guide, Picturesque Pocket Companion and Visitor's Guide Through Mt. Auburn, was published and featured descriptions of some of the more interesting monuments as well as a collection of prose and poetry about death by writers including Nathaniel Hawthorne and Willis Gaylord Clark. Because of the number of visitors, the cemetery's developers carefully regulated the grounds: They had a policy to remove \\"offensive and improper\\" monuments and only \\"proprietors\\" (i.e., plot owners) could have vehicles on the grounds and were allowed within the gates on Sundays and holidays. In the 1840s, Mount Auburn was considered one of the most popular tourist destinations in the nation, along with Niagara Falls and Mount Vernon. A 16-year-old Emily Dickinson wrote about her visit to Mount Auburn in a letter in 1846. 60,000 people visited the cemetery in 1848 alone. ==Buildings== The cemetery has three notable buildings on its grounds. Washington Tower was designed by Bigelow and built in 1852‚Äì54. Named for George Washington, the tower was built of Quincy granite and provides excellent views of the area. Bigelow Chapel was built in the 1840s and rebuilt in the 1850s, also of Quincy granite, and was renovated in 1899 under the direction of architect Willard Sears to accommodate a crematorium. Its interior was again renovated in 1924 by Allen and Collins. Through all of these alterations, stained glass windows by Scottish firm of Allan & Ballantyne were preserved. In 1870 the cemetery trustees, feeling the need for additional function space, purchased land across Mount Auburn Street and constructed a reception house. This building was supplanted in the 1890s by the construction of the Story Chapel and Administration Building, adjacent to the main gate. The first reception house was designed by Nathaniel J. Bradlee, and is (like the cemetery) listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The second building was designed by Willard Sears, and is built of Potsdam sandstone in what Sears characterized as \\"English Perpendicular Style\\". The chapel in this building was redecorated in 1929 by Allen and Collins to include stained glass by New England artist Earl E. Sanborn. ==Cemetery today== More than 93,000 people are buried in the cemetery as of 2003. A number of historically significant people have been interred there since its inception, particularly members of the Boston Brahmins and the Boston elite associated with Harvard University, as well as a number of prominent Unitarians. The cemetery is nondenominational and continues to make space available for new plots. The area is well known for its beautiful environs and is a favorite location for bird-watchers; over 220 species of birds have been observed at the cemetery since 1958.eBird. 2012. eBird: An online database of bird distribution and abundance [web application]. eBird, Ithaca, New York. Available: http://www.ebird.org. (Accessed: May 16, 2014). Guided tours of the cemetery's historic, artistic, and horticultural points of interest are available. Mount Auburn's collection of over 5,500 trees includes nearly 700 species and varieties. Thousands of very well-kept shrubs and herbaceous plants weave through the cemetery's hills, ponds, woodlands, and clearings. The cemetery contains more than 10 miles (17 km) of roads and many paths. Landscaping styles range from Victorian-era plantings to contemporary gardens, from natural woodlands to formal ornamental gardens, and from sweeping vistas through majestic trees to small enclosed spaces. Many trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants are tagged with botanic labels containing their scientific and common names. The cemetery was among those profiled in the 2005 PBS documentary A Cemetery Special. == Notable burials == Bigelow Chapel ==Photo gallery== Mount Auburn Cemetery Fir Avenue.jpg Fir Avenue mark in cemetery Mount Auburn Cemetery Entrance gate.jpg Egyptian revival entrance to Mount Auburn Cemetery MtAuburnTower.JPG The Washington Tower in the cemetery Jacob Bigelow Grave.jpg  Cemetery designer, Dr. Jacob Bigelow's grave Nathaniel Bowditch in Mount Auburn Cemetery.JPG  Nathaniel Bowditch 2005-08 DCI Trip- Boston 001.JPG Mary Baker Eddy Memorial Mount Auburn Cemeter - Misc View.JPG Mount Auburn Cemetery Mount Auburn Cemeter - Hunnewell.JPG Hunnewell family obelisk Benjamin Waterhouse grave.jpg Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse's grave CharlesSumnerGrave.jpgCharles Sumner's grave Pitman family marker, Mount Auburn Cemetery (4402353191).jpgPitman family marker Mount Auburn Cemetery - Martin Milmore sphinx.jpgSphinx monument by Martin Milmore, 1872 Weeping_Japanese_Pagoda_Tree_in_Mount_Auburn_Cemetery,_Cambridge- Watertown,_MA_-_8-1-2015.jpgWeeping Japanese pagoda tree Weeping_European_Beech_Tree_in_Mount_Auburn_Cemetery,_Cambridge- Watertown,_MA_-_8-1-2015.jpgWeeping European beech tree ==See also== * List of National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts * National Register of Historic Places listings in Cambridge, Massachusetts * Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto, modelled after Mount Auburn ==References== ==Further reading== * Nathaniel Dearborn.

Sadarangani. Pg 60 His predecessors were Fariduddin Ganjshakar, Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki, and Moinuddin Chishti, who were the masters of the Chishti spiritual chain or silsila in the Indian subcontinent. Nizamuddin Auliya, like his predecessors, stressed love as a means of realising God. For him his love of God implied a love of humanity. His vision of the world was marked by a highly evolved sense of religious pluralism and kindness.Bhakti poetry in medieval India By Neeti M. Sadarangani. Pg 63 It is claimed by the 14th century historiographer Ziauddin Barani that his influence on the Muslims of Delhi was such that a paradigm shift was effected in their outlook towards worldly matters. People began to be inclined towards mysticism and prayers and remaining aloof from the world.Amir Hasan Sijzi, Fawaid-ul-Fuad (Delhi, 1865), pp. 150, 195-97 ==Life== Nizamuddin Auliya was born in Badayun, Uttar Pradesh (Also, spelled as Baduan, it is located near the Ganges river in the center of Western [Uttar Pradesh]). At the age of five, after the death of his father, Syed Abdullah bin Ahmad AlHussaini Badayuni, he came to Delhi with his mother, Bibi Zulekha.Nizamuddin Auliya His biography finds mention in Ain-i-Akbari, a 16th-century document written by Mughal Emperor Akbar‚Äôs vizier, Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak.Nizamuddin Auliya Ain-i-Akbari, by Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak.

(Awliy√°-i- Hind), page 365.\\" At the age of twenty, NizƒÅmuddƒ´n went to Ajodhan (the present Pakpattan Sharif in Pakistan) and became a disciple of the Sufi saint Fariduddin Ganjshakar, commonly known as Baba Farid. NizƒÅmuddƒ´n did not take up residence in Ajodhan but continued with his theological studies in Delhi while simultaneously starting the Sufi devotional practices and the prescribed litanies. He visited Ajodhan each year to spend the month of Ramzan in the presence of Baba Farid. It was on his third visit to Ajodhan that Baba Farid made him his successor. Shortly after that, when NizƒÅmuddƒ´n returned to Delhi, he received news that Baba Farid had died. Chilla Nizamuddin Auliya, residence of Nizamuddin Auliya, towards the north-east from Humayun's tomb, Delhi NizƒÅmuddƒ´n lived at various places in Delhi, before finally settling down in Ghiyaspur, a neighbourhood in Delhi undisturbed by the noise and hustle of city life. He built his Khanqah here, a place where people from all walks of life were fed, where he imparted spiritual education to others and he had his own quarters. Before long, the Khanqah became a place thronged with all kinds of people, rich and poor alike. Many of his disciples achieved spiritual height, including Shaikh Nasiruddin Chirag Delhavi,In The Name Of Faith Times of India, 19 April 2007. and Amir Khusro, noted scholar/singer, and the royal poet of the Delhi Sultanate. He died on the morning of 3 April 1325. His shrine, the Nizamuddin Dargah, is located in Delhi.Nizamuddin Auliya Dargah, history and structures and the present structure was built in 1562. The shrine is visited by people of all faiths, through the year, though it becomes a place for special congregation during the death anniversaries, or Urs, of Nizamuddin Auliya and Amƒ´r Khusro, who is also buried at the NizƒÅmuddƒ´n DargƒÅh. ==Key beliefs== Besides believing in the traditional Sufi ideas of embracing God within this life (as he was opposed to the idea that such partial merger with God is possible only after death), by destroying the ego and cleansing the soul, and that this is possible through considerable efforts involving Sufi practices, Nizamuddin also expanded and practised the unique features introduced by past saints of the Chisti Sufi order in India. These included: * Emphasis on renunciation and having complete trust in God. * The unity of mankind and shunning distinctions based on social, economic and religious status. * Helping the needy, feeding the hungry and being sympathetic to the oppressed. * Strong disapproval of mixing with the Sultans, the princes and the nobles. * Exhortation in making close contact with the poor and the downtrodden * Adopting an uncompromising attitude towards all forms of political and social oppression. * Adopting the permissibility of Sema. * Holding the stance however that Sema is only permissible when musical instruments and dancing are not present. * Holding the orthodox Sunni belief that musical instruments are prohibited. Muhammad Ibn Mubarak Kirmani, the Mureed of Khwaja Fareed al-Deen Ganj-e-Shakar, wrote in his Siyar al-Awliya that Nizamuddin Auliya said the following: Furthermore, Nizamuddin Auliya is himself quoted as saying: Nizamuddin did not much bother about the theoretical aspects of Sufism, believing rather that it were the practical aspects that counted, as it was anyway not possible to describe the diversified mystical experiences called spiritual states or stations which a practicing Sufi encountered. He discouraged the demonstration of Keramat and emphasised that it was obligatory for the Auliya (which roughly means the friends of God) to hide the ability of Keramat from the commoners. He also was quite generous in accepting disciples. Usually whoever came to him saying that he wanted to become a disciple was granted that favour. This resulted in him being always surrounded by people from all strata of society. == Ancestral history == Like many saints before him, Nizamuddin Aulia traced his lineage from the family of Muhammad. ==Spiritual history== Nizamuddin Auliya's tomb (onion dome), Jama'at Khana Masjid (red wall) and Mughal princess Jahan Ara's tomb (doorway at left), all in Nizamuddin Dargah complex, Delhi He was merely sixteen or seventeen years old when he first heard the name of Farƒ´duddƒ´n Ganjshakar, and feelings of love and respect arose in his heart right then. He narrates to his disciples that he never felt the same after hearing or even meeting any other Sufi. The love kept increasing like a burning fire. If his classmates would like to have some work out of him they used to invoke the name of Baba Farid, and he never refused anything asked in his name. He didn't feel the same for anyone else in his entire lifetime. He became his disciple after completing his studies at the age of 20. He visited him thrice in his lifetime. == Students == He had more than 600 khalifas (a khalifa is a disciple who is given the authority to take his own disciples and thus propagate the spiritual lineage) who continued his lineage all over the world. Some of his most famous disciples are: ===Nasiruddin Chiragh Dehlavi=== He was the spiritual successor of Nizamuddin Auliya. He is considered fifth amongst the big five of the Chisti order in India (the others being Moinuddin Chishti, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, Fariduddin Ganjshakar, Nizamuddin Auliya). His shrine is in Chirag Dilli, New Delhi, India. ===Amir Khusrow=== He was the most loved disciple of his master. He was so close to his master that once NizƒÅmuddƒ´n AuliyƒÅ' said, \\"If the sharƒ´'ah allowed me I would have liked him to be buried with me in the same grave.\\"Cited as a tradition by Omer Tarin in Some Chishti Sufis of the 13-14th c, Historical Studies journal No 12, 2011, p 125 It is said that he also said once that whoever comes to visit his grave must visit the grave of Amƒ´r Khusro first and then his.Omer Tarin aa . He died within a few months of his master's death. He was buried at the feet of his master. His shrine is in NizƒÅmuddƒ´n DargƒÅh, New Delhi. ===Qazi Qawam-Udeen Siddiqui=== He was given the title Zubtadul Awliya and was a disciple of his master. He along with his father-in-law Qazi Sultan Zulqarni build Rohtak fort. His descendants are named Qawami Siddiquis and now number in thousands, all have migrated to Pakistan and can be found in Mirpur AK, Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore and Multan. ===Akhi Siraj Aainae Hind=== He was given the title of ƒÄainae-Hind (Mirror of India) by NizƒÅmuddƒ´n AuliyƒÅ' and lived with him for a long time. He was amongst the earliest disciples of NizƒÅmuddƒ´n AuliyƒÅ', who sent him to Bengal. His shrine is at Pirana Pir Dargah, Malda City, Malda, West Bengal. ===Burhanuddin Gharib=== He is also amongst the earliest disciples of Nizamuddin Auliya and lived with the master until his death. After the death of Nizamuddin Auliya, he went to the Deccan, and the place where he lived became famous thereby. His shrine is in Khuldabad in Maharashtra. ===Jalaluddin Peer Manik Bhandari=== He is also amongst the earliest disciples (Khalifa)of Nizamuddin Auliya Mehbub e Ilahi Delhi. He ran the Langar khana of Nizamuddin Auliya. He went to the Deccan with Burhanuddin Gharib with 1400 palki, and became famous by the name of Bhandari. His shrine is in Fatehabad Taluka Gangapur District Aurangabad of Maharashtra. His Grand family is living in Aurangabad Maharashtra. And they are conducting Urs shareef every year continuously. His current Sajjada Nashin is Sufi Shaikh Tajuddin Chisty Bhandari & Nayab Sajjada Nashin is Sufi Shaikh Fayazuddin Chisty Bhandari (Tausif Jalal). ===Syed Mahmood Kashkinakar=== He holds a very special position among those who follows chishti Sufi. He is believed to be alive in the invisible world even after his death in the visible world. There are miracles in the literature of the Chisti order which are attributed to this. ==Quotations== # The wilayat (domain) of gnosis and faith can suffer decay. The wilayat of compassion can not. # The love of Auliya (saints) is stronger than their reason. # The lock of spiritual perfection has very many keys. All those keys are to be possessed. If one does not open it, others can. # He who has knowledge, reason, and love, is deserving to become a caliph of the Sufi sheikhs. == Descendants == Nizamuddin Auliya did not marry. However he had one brother named Jamaluddin. He told him, \\"your descendants will be my descendants\\". Omer Tarin, \\"Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya Mahbub e Ilahi and the establishment of the Chishti Nizami Sufi Order\\" in Khilwat magazine of Sufism, pub Ahmadabad, India, 2016. No 109, p:31-36. Jamaluddin had one son named Ibrahim. He was nurtured by Nizamuddin Auliya after Jamaluddin's death. Nizamuddin Auliya sent his nephew to Bengal in Eastern India along with one of his disciples (khalifa) Akhi Siraj Aainae Hind, known as Aaina-e-Hind. Alaul Haq Pandavi (the master (Pir) of Ashraf Jahangir Semnani) became his disciple and khalifa. Ala-ul-Haq Pandwi married his sister-in-law (sister of Syed Badruddin Badr-e-Alam Zahidi)Syed Qayamuddin Nezami, (2004), \\"Sharfa ki Nagri(Vol. 1)\\", biography of Sufis of Bihar, \\"Nezami Academy\\", Karachi, Pakistan. p. 126 to Ibrahim. They had one son, Fariduddin Tavaela Bukhsh, who became a well known Chisti Sufi of Bihar. He was married to the daughter of Alaul Haq Pandavi. He became the khalifa of Noor Qutb-e-Aalam Padwi (the eldest son and spiritual successor of Alaul Haq Pandavi). His shrine is in Chandpura, Bihar Sharif, Bihar. Many of his descendants are well known Sufis, namely Moinuddin Sani, Naseeruddin Sani, Sultan Chisti Nizami, Bahauddin Chisti Nizami, Deewan Syed Shah Abdul Wahab (his shrine is in Choti Takiya, Biharsharif), Sultan Sani, Amjad Hussain Chisti Nizami, among others. He spread Chisti Nizami order all over Northern India. Ijaza of his Silsila (order) is present in all the existing khanqahs of Bihar. His descendants still reside in Bihar Sharif and can be found in many parts of the world. The current Sajjada Nasheen of Chillah of Usman Harooni is his direct descendant. Fariduddin Tavaela Bukhsh commomerated (originated) the Urs of Usman Harooni at his chillah in Belchi, Bihar Sharif (First Sajjada Nasheen). Nizamuddin Aulia also had one sister named Bibi Ruqayya who is buried next to Bibi Zulekha, the mother of Khwaja Nizamuddin Aulia in Adhchini village in Delhi. Nizamuddin Auliya did not marry. He brought his Pir/Shaikh's grandson named Khwaja Muhammad Imam, who was the son of Bibi Fatima (daughter of Baba Farid and Badruddin is'haq) as mentioned in Seyrul Aulia book, Nizami bansari, The life and time of Khwaja Nizamuddin Aulia by Khaliq Ahmed Nizami. Still the descendants of Khwaja Muhammad Imam are the caretakers of dargah sharif. == The Chisti Nizami order == Nizamuddin Auliya was the founder of the Chisti Nizami order. He had hundreds of disciples (khalifa) who had Ijaza (khilafat) from him to spread the order. Many of the Sufis of the Chisti Nizami order are recognised as great Sufis; the following is a list of notable Sufis of the Chisti Nizami order, which includes his descendants as well as his disciples and their subsequent disciples: Naseeruddin Chiragh Dilli (New Delhi), Amir Khusro, Muhammad Hussaini Gisudaraz Bandanawaz, Gulbarga (near Hyderabad), Karnataka; Alaul Haq Pandavi and Noor Qutb-e-Alam Pandwi, Pandua, West Bengal; Ashraf Jahangir Semnani, Kichaucha, Uttar Pradesh; Makhdoom Husamuddin Manikpuri (Pratapgarh ,Uttar Pradesh) Faqruddin Faqr Dehlvi, Mehrauli, New Delhi; Shah Niyaz Ahmad Barelvi, Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh; Shafruddin Ali Ahmed and Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, Chirag Dilli, New Delhi; Zainuddin Shirazi, Burhanpur, Madhya Pradesh; Muhiuddin Yousuf Yahya Madani Chishti, Medina; Kaleemullah Dehlvi Chishti, Delhi; Nizamuddin Aurangabadi; Nizamuddin Hussain, and Meerza Agha Mohammad; Muhammad Sulman Taunswi, Pakistan, Mohammad Meera Hussaini, Hesamuddin Mankpuri, Mian Shah Mohammad Shah, Hoshiarpur, Punjab, India, Mian Ali Mohammad Khan, Pakpattan, Pakistan. Khuwaja Noman Nayyir Kulachvi (Khalifa e Majaz) Kulachi, Pakistan, Khalifa Omer Tarin Chishti- Nizami Ishq Nuri , Qalandarabad, Pakistan. ===Branches=== Nizamuddin Auliya was an unparalleled Sufi of his time amongst all the existing Sufi orders of that time. Many of his contemporaries were doubtless very powerful spiritual leaders, but he was the most famous of all. In his career of approximately 70 years as a Sufi he saw the reign of seven rulers of the Delhi sultanate. The kings were very loyal to him and respectful of him. When he first arrived as the Qutb of Delhi he settled down at a lonely place on the outskirts of Delhi, Ghyaspur. But he became so famous that Ghyaspur became the main hub of Delhi and so densely populated that he wanted to leave that place but did not. He was buried in the campus of his khanqah. Ghyaspur is now a central locality of New Delhi, and is known after his name Nizamuddin. The area is so vast that it is divided into four parts: Nizamuddin Dargah (where his shrine is situated), Nizamuddin East, Nizamuddin West and Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station. The Chisti order branched out with Nizamuddin Auliya to form the Chisti Nizami order. A parallel branch which started with Alauddin Sabir Kaliyari, another disciple of Baba Farid, was the Chisti Sabiri branch. People started adding Nizami gracefully after their name. He spiritually made many great Sufis amongst his students, descendants and the Sufis of the Nizami order. The branches of the Chisti Nizami order are as follows: Naseeria His disciple Nasiruddin Muhammad Chirag-e-Dehli started the Nizamia Naseeria branch. Hussainia The Hussainia branch is named for Syed Muhammad Kamaluddin Hussaini Gisudaraz Bandanawaz. He was the most famous and loved disciple of Nasiruddin Muhammad Chirag-e-Dehli. The khanqah he established in Gulbarga, Karnataka, is still in existence. Fakhri The \\"Fakhri\\" branch is named for Muhib Un Nabi Maulana Fakhr Ud Din Fakhr E Jahan Dehlvi, peer o murshid of Shah Niyaz Be Niyaz. Niyazia Shah Niyaz Ahmad Barelvi, in the 19th century started the Niyazia branch. Serajia The Nizamia Serajia branch was started by Serajuddin Aqi Seraj. This branch is also known as Chistia Serajia. Ashrafia The Chistia Ashrafia branch was started by Ashraf Jahangir Semnani.'Hayate Makhdoom Syed Ashraf Jahangir Semnani(1975), Second Edition(2017) , Maktaba Jamia Ltd, Shamshad Market, Aligarh 202002, India. He established a khanqah, still in existence at Kichaucha sharif, Uttar Pradesh, India. Faridia The Chistia Serajia Faridia order was started by Fariduddin Tavaelabukhsh, a descendant of Nizamuddin Auliya and a Sufi of the Serajia branch of the Chisti order. This branch is also known as Nizamia Serajia Faridia. ===Ishq-Nuri=== The Ishq Nuri order, branch of the main Chishti- Nizami, was founded by Shaikh Khwaja Khalid Mahmood Chishti sahib, in Lahore, Pakistan, in the 1960s. It is the most contemporary expression of this traditional Sufi lineage. It is mostly found in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, although now some followers are also to be found in the West. Lutfia Silsila Chishtia-Nizamia-Lutfia was continued by Moulana Lutfullah Shah Dankouri. The disciples of this silsila are found in Pakistan, India, England, Canada and USA. ==During the short reign of Qutbu'd-Din Mubarak Shah == During the last years of 'Ala'u'd-Din's life, the intrigues of Malik Na'ib deprived Khizr Khan of succeeding legitimately to the throne. Malik Na'ib had Khizr Khan blinded and Qutbu'd-Din Mubarak Shah (1316‚Äì20), another claimant to the throne, narrowly escaped death. When Mubarak Shah ascended the throne he had Khizr Khan and the latter's brothers executed. Shaikh Nizamu'd-Din took no interest in political upheavals but could not escape the brunt of Sultan Mubarak Shah's fury for having made Khizr Khan his disciple. Speaking disparagingly of the Shaikh he began to hatch schemes against him. He prohibited his nobles from visiting Ghiyaspur. Mubarak Shah also constructed a mosque, the Masjid-i Miri, Where all the Sufis and 'ulama' were ordered to perform their prayers. The Shaikh refused to comply with the Sultan's orders, remonstrating that the mosque in his neighborhood had a greater claim on him. On the first day of each month, the entire religious community of Delhi, gathered at the palace to offer congratulations prayer to the Sultan. The Shaikh further angered the Sultan by sending a servant as his delegate. The Sultan threatened the Shaikh with serious consequences if he personally failed to pay homage. Refusing to heed the threat, the Shaikh quietly prayed at his mother's tomb and returned to his jama'at-khana. As the last day of the month approached, the capital was filled with anxiety, while the Shaikh himself remained calm. But the first day of the next month did not come for the Sultan. He was assassinated on the first night of Jumada II, 720/8 July 1320 by his favorite and protege, Khusraw Khan Barwar, who was later overthrown by Ghazi Malik who later came to be known as Ghiyasu'd-Din Tughluq.A history of Sufism: Saiyid Athar Abbas Rizvi == Urs == The Urs (death anniversary) of Nizamuddin Auliya is celebrated at the Nizamuddin Dargah on the 17th-18th of Rabi II (Rabi-ul-Aaqir), and that of Amir Khusro on the 18th of Shawwal. ==In popular culture== Arziyan, a qawwali in the film Delhi 6 (2009) composed by A. R. Rahman is dedicated to Nizamuddin Auliya. Kun Faya Kun a song in the movie Rockstar (2011) is also dedicated to him, and was shot at the dargah.A famous Bangla song 'Nizamuddin Aulia\\" is made dedicated to him on his historic return to Delhi. ==Further reading== * \\"Nizami Bansari\\" by Khawaza Hasan Nizami; also available in Urdu & Hindi by his successor Khawaza Hasan Sani Nizami * The Life and Times of Shaikh Nizam-u'd-din Auliya, by Khaliq Ahmad Nizami; Idarah-i Adabyat-i Delli, 1991. * Nizam Ad-Din Awliya: Morals for the Heart, by Bruce B.

Thomas Jefferson designed the plantation and used the property as a private retreat and a revenue-generating plantation. Jefferson inherited the property in 1773 and began designing and working on the plantation in 1806. While Jefferson is the most famous individual associated with the property, it had several owners before being purchased for restoration, preservation, and exhibition in 1984. Poplar Forest was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1971 and is presently operated as a historic house museum by the nonprofit Corporation for Jefferson‚Äôs Poplar Forest. The Corporation is also responsible for the ongoing archaeological study and restoration work at the property. ==History== The land upon which Poplar Forest was built shows archaeological evidence of having been populated by native peoples from the Paleo-Indian through Late Woodland periods. The 4,000-acre property was legally defined by a 1745 patent in which William Stith (a colonial minister and planter) assumed ownership, but did not live on the land. He passed ownership to his daughter Elizabeth Pasteur and her cousin Peter Randolph, who maintained ownership until 1764. John Wayles purchased the original property in 1764 and slowly added an additional 819 acres prior to 1770; he was the first to use slave labor on the property. Similar to Stith, Wayles did not live on the property due to his career as an attorney and businessman in Charles City County, VA. Thomas Jefferson by Thomas Sully, 1821. This portrait is considered a truthful representation of Jefferson's appearance during the time which Poplar Forest was designed and constructed Wayles‚Äô daughter Martha Wayles Skelton was married to Thomas Jefferson, and the couple inherited the full 4,819 acres when Wayles died in 1773. The Jeffersons did not immediately continue developing Poplar Forest, nor were they frequent visitors to the property ‚Äì their focus was on developing Monticello, Thomas's political and legal career, and raising their family. Martha Jefferson died in 1782, and Thomas spent time away from Virginia in public service following her death, serving as Minister to France (1785-1789), Secretary of State (1790-1793), Vice President (1797-1801), and President (1801-1809). Even in Jefferson's absence, the plantation was generating revenue from slave labor under the watch of a general steward and a team of overseers; the slave labor force at Poplar Forest produced annual tobacco and wheat crops after 1790. Jefferson conducted annual visits to Poplar Forest beginning in 1810 and ending in 1823; he designed Poplar Forest as his retreat from his larger estate at Monticello. The retreat house was completed in 1816 and his visits ranged from a few days to weeklong stays. He frequently brought his granddaughters Ellen and Cornelia Jefferson Randolph to the house after it was completed in 1816, and always traveled to Poplar Forest with a small cadre of enslaved men and women who were based at Monticello. Jefferson maintained sole ownership of the property and the slaves until 1790, when he gave 1,000 acres and six slave families to his daughter Martha and her husband Thomas Mann Randolph Jr. Randolph would later divide and sell the rest of Jefferson's landholdings; he also sold many of Jefferson's slaves to repay debts. Near the end of his life, Jefferson sought to find permanent residents for the property, and his grandson Francis W. Eppes and wife Mary Elizabeth moved to Poplar Forest shortly after their 1823 marriage. Jefferson died in 1826, and made his last visit to Poplar Forest in 1823. The Eppeses sold Poplar Forest in November 1828 to William Cobbs; Cobbs assigned the task of managing the property to his son in law Edward Hutter in 1840 following his marriage to Cobb's daughter Emma. This period from 1745-1840 in which Poplar Forest was sold many times in quick succession meant that many enslaved men, women, and children were separated from their families as the owners settled their predecessor's debts. The Cobbs and Hutter families maintained ownership of Poplar Forest into the twentieth century. The Hutter's son Christian purchased the property in the late nineteenth century and used it as a summer home and working farm into the 1940s using labor from both black and white hired farmhands and tenant farmers. Christian Hutter sold the property to James Watts‚Äô family in 1946; the Watts family operated Poplar Forest as a dairy farm and worked with Phelps Barnum and W. Stuart Thompson to restore the house to the way it appeared during Jefferson's time. They also did significant landscape development, and sold a majority of the remaining land to a developer who constructed a nine- hole golf course and a lake along the eastern and southern part of the property. Dr. James Johnson purchased the house and 50 acres of land from the Watts family in 1980; the nonprofit Corporation for Jefferson's Poplar Forest purchased the acreage and the remaining physical structures on the property in 1984. The organization has worked in recent years to reacquire land within the original plantation boundaries, and as of 2008 owned 617 acres of the original property. == Architectural design == When construction began at Poplar Forest in 1806, Jefferson was still President of the United States. He supervised the construction from Washington, DC. Thomas Jefferson was a self-taught architect known for his work at Monticello and the Virginia State Capitol; he frequently borrowed designs from classical sources, and was attracted to Palladio's classical architecture in Rome as well as designs from 16th century France. Jefferson designed Poplar Forest as his personal retreat house and selected the property because of its distance from his public life. The octagonal house may have been the first of its kind to have been built in the United States. The house at Poplar Forest is made of brick and has an octagonal floor plan; it consists of a central square space and three sides made of elongated octagon rooms. There is an entry hall on the remaining side of the house, which is two smaller rooms divided by a short entry hall. There is a skylight in the central dining room and its dimensions are 20‚Äô x 20‚Äô x 20‚Äô, which makes it a perfect cube. Jefferson also elected to add pedimented porticoes on low arcades that were attached to both the northern and southern facades as well as the east and west stairwells. Scholars agree that the retreat house at Poplar Forest is an excellent example of octagonal symmetry; Jefferson's design for the building reflects a consistent geometric approach likely made possible by his well-known proficiency in algebra, geometry, trigonometry and Newtonian calculus. ==Post-Jeffersonian modifications and preservation== By different owners, the main house underwent many alterations, and the plantation's acreage was incrementally reduced to 50 acres (20 ha) at the time of acquisition by the Corporation for Jefferson's Poplar Forest. There was a fire in 1845; the Cobbs and Hutter families chose to rebuild in the Greek revival style and to add an attic story for sleeping; this modified the interior plan of the house. The original walls, chimney, and columns remained after the renovation. The Corporation for Jefferson's Poplar Forest is using early 19th-century building materials including heavy timber frame construction, hemp sash cord, iron hardware from Colonial Williamsburg as well as 19th-century building techniques in their restoration work including column rendering and burning limestone to produce traditional lime mortar and plaster. The goal of the restorations is to restore Poplar Forest to Jefferson's original architectural vision. == Slavery == Slaves were present on the property from 1766 through 1865, when slavery was formally abolished in the United States. Present-day knowledge of the slave populations and their contributions to Poplar Forest is based on both archaeological and archival evidence. John Wales used slave labor to originally develop roadwork on the property, and when Thomas and Martha Jefferson inherited the land that included Poplar Forest from Wales, they also inherited 135 enslaved men, women, and children as well as other tracts of land in Amherst, Cumberland, Charles City, Goochland, and Powhatan counties. Because Wayles chose to split his estate among several heirs, slave families were separated in order for his heirs to pay his debts. As Jefferson turned more attention to Poplar Forest, he brought slaves from Monticello, Elk Hill, Indian Camp, and Judith's Creek, thus increasing the slave population at Poplar Forest. Jefferson kept consistent records of the slaves living at Poplar Forest; these records show that the slave population fluctuated between as few as 28 and as many as 95 individual slaves were working at Poplar Forest between the years 1774 and 1819. As an active participant in the slave trade, Jefferson sold and purchased slaves throughout the time he owned Poplar Forest, including a sale of 40 slaves from his various properties in Bedford County, VA in the 1790s. The Eppeses inherited the house, about 1,075 acres of land, and several enslaved men and women after Jefferson's death in 1826. The Cobbs and Hutter families also used slave labor on the property through emancipation and maintained some former slaves as hired workers following. === Plantation and slave economics === Slave labor was vital to Poplar Forest's economic success. Beginning in 1790, the slaves at Poplar Forest initially grew tobacco and livestock for profit, and later began growing wheat. Records from Edward Hutter's tenure at Poplar Forest show that slaves were regularly tasked with tilling fields and digging ditches in addition to their work growing and harvesting plants to be sold at market. Slaves worked six days each week, and were also responsible for constructing and maintaining their housing structures. Scholars have determined that the enslaved community at Poplar Forest devised a commerce system amongst themselves; slaves were allowed a small plot of land with which to grow food and produce goods that could be traded or sold to fellow slaves as well as the owners' families and the outside market. Archaeologists at Poplar Forest have uncovered clothing accessories such as buttons, glass beads, gilt chains, aiglet/lace tips, and fancy buckles that were likely used as currency amongst slaves at Poplar Forest and the surrounding plantations. Documents from the 19th century show that the transition from tobacco-based to mixed-crop plantation agriculture left Poplar Forest with an abundance of laborers; William Cobbs, in particular, is known to have hired out slaves from the plantation to external projects. Other individual slaves (including two women named Lucy and Matilda) are known to have had access to money during this time so that they could buy items on behalf of the Cobbs/Hutter families. Edward Hutter regularly leased slaves from Poplar Forest to businesses and planters in Bedford County. === Family networks === Records show that by the 1790s, there were seven different slave families represented at Poplar Forest. Jefferson encouraged common-law unions amongst the slaves, and recorded the birth dates of each slave born on the property. He also rewarded women who married a fellow slave from Poplar Forest with a pot; archaeologists have found remnants of these gifts in archaeological studies of the property. Jefferson kept records of family connections - surviving records have allowed scholars to conclude that multiple generations of single families were enslaved at Poplar Forest and had relatives strewn about other plantations in Virginia. William and Marian Cobbs inherited a slave family that included Mary and her daughters Lucy and Matilda (who are recorded to have worked as house servants) as well as other siblings and extended family members. === Known enslaved people === Hannah was not born at Poplar Forest, but served there from the time she was a teenager until ca.1821. She married and had a family with a fellow slave, was literate, and worked for a time as Jefferson's housekeeper. James (Jame) Hubbard was purchased by Jefferson when he was 30 and went on to oversee field laborers at Poplar Forest. He fathered six children with a fellow slave named Cate and fostered several others, and worked as a hogkeeper when he was older. Scholars are also able to trace his family members and their roles at Poplar Forest, which included Nace, Hannah, Nancy, Joan, James, and Phill. Phill was born at Poplar Forest to James Hubbard and his wife Cate. Phill briefly worked at Monticello before returning to Poplar Forest, where he married Hanah and had a son. He died at age 33, reportedly of poisoning. William (Billy) was born at Poplar Forest and violently rebelled against slavery by attacking an overseer on more than one occasion. Jefferson sent him and three others to Louisiana, where William attempted to run away, but was caught and sold. John Hemmings never lived at Poplar Forest, but documentary records show that he was responsible for much of the interior woodwork in the retreat house at Poplar Forest. Lydia Johnson lived at Poplar Forest when Edward Hutter owned the property. She named one of her children Ida Reeder, after Hutter's niece; expense records show that he purchased a dress for her as a gift. Lydia continued to work for the family after Emancipation until she died in 1919. Will appears in a ledger from 1772 noting that he purchased rum, buttons, thread, and cloth. == Archaeology == There have been several archaeological digs at Poplar Forest. The 1993 accidental discovery of building remnants used by African American slaves when staff members were checking the ground for objects of historical significance before planting trees sparked scholarly interest in excavating the property. Initial digs revealed that the ground on the hillside east of the poplar grove had been farmed; this discovery led to the discovery of a small cellar of a structure dating to Jefferson's time at the property. More recent excavations focused on an area believed to have held paper mulberry trees; Jefferson planted two rows in order to help create naturalistic wings to complement the Palladian style of his retreat house. Archaeologists at Poplar Forest found stains in the ground indicating areas in which trees were previously planted, and their goal is to analyze the levels of charcoal and pollen to determine which areas were most likely the original location(s) for the paper mulberry trees. Other ongoing and future excavation plans include the area surrounding an antebellum slave cabin as well as Jefferson's ornamental plant nursery. Slaves at Poplar Forest participated in an informal economy by trading and selling objects as well as hiring themselves out or being hired out for paid work. Archaeological excavations have revealed objects that offer scholars a more complete idea of the types of objects and work that were valued in this economy. Future excavations will be geared towards determining the landscape as it was when Jefferson designed and spent time at Poplar Forest so that the present-day museum can re-create Jefferson's vision for visitors. === Slave sites === Archaeological excavations of Poplar Forest have yielded evidence suggesting that maps of Poplar Forest created in Jefferson's time were incomplete and did not illustrate the extent to which slaves were present. Current scholarship suggests that the enslaved men and women at Poplar Forest lived and worked at one of three sites, but it is possible that there were even more than are currently known.  Old plantation / North Hill site  The Old Plantation/North Hill is believed to have been established in the 1770s/1780s and was the site of the oldest slave farm structures at Poplar Forest dating from 1764, and maps suggest that the original structures included an overseer house, large barn, and slave housing built over the course of 40 years. Scholars also refer to this area as the Old Quarter, and it was located to the south and west of the main house.  Wingos quarter site  The Wingo quarter farm dates from 1790-1812 at Poplar Forest and was operational when Jefferson owned Poplar Forest; he gave the land on which it was located to Martha and Thomas Mann Randolph as a wedding present. Jefferson's surviving notes tell us that three carpenters were able to construct a slave cabin in three days and that the slaves most often lived next to their field or shop work sites. Documentary evidence suggests that the slave housing structures at Poplar Forest were made of logs and that each house had two rooms that each measured 12.5 x 15 feet; this is corroborated by archaeological evidence suggesting that the slave structures contained root cellars designed by the occupants, which were used to store clothing, tools, and iron hardware. Archaeologists used soil stains to discover storage pits, burned tree roots, and postoles; this analysis also yielded fragments of glass, ceramics, and iron which were discovered to have been parts of plates, bottles, and cooking pots. One other structure discovered is believed to have functioned as a smokehouse as well as a residence, while a third is believed to have been built later than the other two, and used primarily as housing. Soil analysis also suggests that there were fences in the slave quarters. Excavations at this site also yielded a number of objects related to slave life at Poplar Forest. Archaeologists discovered iron saw files, gimlets, wedges, croze irons, and a hinge from a folding ruler; it is likely that these objects are from tools used by slaves either in their work assignments or in their personal space. Scissors, straight pins, and thimbles found at the site suggest that women sewed for both work and for their families. The excavations uncovered stoneware and earthenware that scholars believe to have been used to prepare food; enslaved men and women at Poplar Forest ate fruits and vegetables as well as beef, pork, venison, opossum, rabbit, chicken, turkey, and fish, and possibly had access to firearms with which to hunt animals.  Site A  This is the newest of the three sites; current scholarship indicates that it was built in the 1830s and was operational until emancipation. Scholars believe that the site was home to a slave cabin likely occupied between 1840-1860. Archaeologists have uncovered a 3 ft. pit that would have been located underneath the floor of the cabin, postholes, and remnants of a shone chimney. The excavation at Site A has yielded buttons, straight pins, needles, thimbles, and the bone cap of a needle case; this suggests that this site may have been the home of a seamstress. == Present day == The Corporation for Thomas Jefferson's Poplar Forest has been in charge of Poplar Forest since 1984, when the 501(c)(3) organization purchased 50 acres of land and the original buildings with the goal to preserve the estate for the educational benefit of the public. The Corporation currently operates Poplar Forest as a historic house museum and cites their mission as seeking to both preserve Thomas Jefferson's personal retreat and inspire visitors to explore Jefferson's legacy. Poplar Forest first welcomed visitors in 1986, and presently conducts guided tours thematically dedicated to the main retreat house and the enslaved community in addition to its ongoing restoration and archaeological work. The property is a National Historic Landmark and designated a Virginia History Trails site as part of Virginia's 2019 Commemoration. == See also == * Jeffersonian architecture * List of National Historic Landmarks in Virginia * National Register of Historic Places listings in Bedford County, Virginia == References == == External links == *Poplar Forest, State Route 661, Forest, Bedford County, VA: 75 photos, 10 color transparencies, 22 measured drawings, 6 data pages, and 6 photo caption pages at Historic American Buildings Survey *\\"Thomas Jefferson's Poplar Forest\\", website of the Corporation for Jefferson's Poplar Forest *Thomas Jefferson's architecture, University of Virginia Category:Slave cabins and quarters in the United States Category:Jefferson family residences Category:Thomas Jefferson buildings Category:National Historic Landmarks in Virginia Category:Octagon houses in Virginia Category:Museums in Bedford County, Virginia Category:Houses completed in 1826 Category:Historic house museums in Virginia Category:Presidential homes in the United States Category:Plantation houses in Virginia Category:Presidential museums in Virginia Category:Palladian Revival architecture in Virginia Category:Houses in Bedford County, Virginia Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Virginia Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Bedford County, Virginia Category:1806 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Poplar Forest"},{"id":"517439","text":"Sperry may refer to: ==Places== In the United States: *Sperry, Iowa, community in Des Moines County *Sperry, Missouri *Sperry, Oklahoma, town in Tulsa County *Sperry Chalet, historic backcounty chalet, Glacier National Park, Montana *Sperry Glacier, located in Glacier National Park in the state of Montana *William Miller Sperry Observatory or Sperry Observatory, an astronomical observatory owned by Union County College and operated by Amateur Astronomers, Incorporated on Union County College on their Cranford, New Jersey campus ==Sperry Corporation== *Sperry Corporation, a former American equipment and electronics manufacturer (1910‚Äì1986) **Sperry Gyroscope Company (1910‚Äì1933), founded by Elmer Ambrose Sperry ***Lawrence Sperry Aircraft Company (1918‚Äì1924), founded by Lawrence Sperry **Sperry Corporation, 1933‚Äì1955 **Sperry Rand, 1955‚Äì1978 **Sperry Corporation, 1978‚Äì1986 *Honeywell v.

It has been regarded in the past as something of mystery, displaying fluctuations in water level and salinity which were not entirely explained by variation in rainfall levels; it has been known to dry out almost completely.W. V. Brelsford: ‚ÄúThe Problem of Mweru-Wantipa‚Äù, The Northern Rhodesia Journal, Vol 2, No 5 (1954) This is compounded by its remoteness and it not receiving the same attention from geographers and geologists as its larger and more accessible neighbours, Lake Tanganyika, 25 km east, and Lake Mweru, 40 km west, with which its name is sometimes confused. Lake Mweru Wantipa is a rift valley lake lying in a branch of the East African Rift, running from the Luapula River to Lake Tanganyika. There are some hot springs characteristics of a rift valley to the east. Its water is muddy in appearance, at times appearing reddish and 'slightly oily'. In the local dialect \\"wa ntipa\\" means \\"with mud\\", hence \\"Mweru Wantipa\\" distinguishes it from its bigger neighbour, Lake Mweru, which has clearer water.Camerapix: \\"Spectrum Guide to Zambia\\", Camerapix International Publishers, Nairobi, 1996 ==Sources and drainage== Rivers and streams, none very large, flow into Lake Mweru Wantipa and its swamps from the Mporokoso plateau about 32 km south, and the hills to the north-east in DR Congo. It was thought to drain via its south-western swamps and a dambo called the Mofwe into the Kalungwishi River, which flows into Lake Mweru. However, at the junction of the Kalungwishi and the Mofwe, the elevation is 942 m but the surface of the lake is at only 932 m. It is evident that the Kalungwishi overflows in the rainy season into Mweru Wantipa, but perhaps not vice versa, though one report in 1931 after very heavy rains reported a flood from the Mofwe into the Kalungwishi. Most of the time, though, Mweru Wantipa has no outlet and forms an isolated river basin. ==Lake extent== Around 2005, Lake Mweru Wantipa's main north-east to south-west axis was about 65 km long and it was about 20 km wide, but a narrow branch extends roughly 30 km east from the northern end, giving a surface area of about 1500 km¬≤.Google Earth accessed 5 February 2007 In the south-east at Kampinda, a peninsula divides off a swampy inlet containing the Chimbwe Pools and a lagoon called Lake Cheshi.Terracarta: \\"Zambia 1:1,500,000 Second Edition\\", International Travel Maps, Vancouver, 2000 However at various times in the recent past it has been reported to be not a lake but a swamp with hardly any open water surface, and even to be a plain of dried out mud (littered with fish scales and bones, and the skeletons of dead crocodiles and hippos). These variations in open water surface occur not just within a single dry and rainy season cycle, but over years or decades. For instance it was reported as being a lake in 1890, 1897, 1911, 1919 and 1938, but a swamp in 1892, 1900‚Äì11, 1912‚Äì19, and 1922; and as having dried out around 1916. Its greatest depth has been reported as 5 m, but at times may be less than 1 m deep over most of its surface. The salinity also shows long term variation, it was reported as being freshwater in 1929 and 1939, but saline in 1949. ==Factors determining water level and salinity== While rainfall is the main factor, this may not be the complete story. Blockage of the Mofwe and of the rivers draining into Mweru Wantipa by papyrus and the growth of rushes may be part of the answer. It may also be that the effects of dry years may be delayed for a few years by the release of groundwater from surrounding hills into dambos which flow into the lake. ==Natural resources and environmental pressures== Lake Mweru Wantipa's fishery has been productive in the past but has been depleted in recent years. The lake supports a large population of hippopotamus and crocodiles. Except for birds and waterfowl, the wildlife on land and in the marshes, once extensive, has been reduced despite the existence of the Mweru Wantipa National Park. The park lies mainly on the lake's western shore but covers the lake surface, much of the marshes and part of the southern shore. The lake is only a few kilometres from the DR Congo border on its northern side and wars and conflicts in that country have caused many thousands of refugees to enter the district at Kaputa, putting pressure on resources. Most of the refugees have been moved to camps in Kawambwa and Mporokoso districts before repatriation.http://www.zambia-travel-guide.com/bradt_guide.asp?bradt=1386 Bradt Travel Guide to Zambia, website accessed 5 February 2007 ==Settlements and roads== The main centre of population on the lake is the town of Kaputa, which also forms an administrative district of the Northern Province. At one time the principal road serving the lake was the one from Mporokoso to its south-east shore where there was a ferry at Bulaya, but that has deteriorated and now the main highway is the one from Lake Mweru along the western and northern shores to Kaputa. ==References== Category:Ramsar sites in Zambia Mweru Category:Geography of Northern Province, Zambia Mweru Category:Zambezian flooded grasslands ","title":"Lake Mweru Wantipa"},{"id":"517442","text":"Horary astrology is an ancient branch of horoscopic astrology in which an astrologer attempts to answer a question by constructing a horoscope for the exact time at which the question was received and understood by the astrologer. The answer to the horary question might be a simple yes or no, but is generally more complex with insights into, for example, the motives of the questioner, the motives of others involved in the matter, and the options available to them. ==Approach== Horary astrology has its own strict system. The position of and aspects to the moon are of prime importance. The person asking the question, or querent, is represented by the ruler of the sign the first house cusp falls on in the horoscope. Planetary aspects to the house cusps are considered more important than in other branches of astrology (although it is the planetary rulers of the houses in question that take precedence in analysis). Other key elements used in horary astrology include the lunar nodes, the planetary antiscia, the fixed stars and the Arabic parts. Typically, a horary chart is read by first assigning the thing asked about, the quesited, to a particular house in the chart. For instance, asking \\"Where is my lost dog?\\" would be represented by the sixth house, as it is the house that governs small animals (traditionally, smaller than a goat). The house cusp of the sixth house will be in a particular sign, for example Libra. Libra is ruled by Venus, so Venus is considered the significator of the lost dog. Venus's state in the horoscope (its dignity, aspects, etc.) will give clues to the animal's location. Horary astrology is suited for situations and divination but not suited for obtaining details, e.g. addresses, names and so on. ==Assigning houses== Houses play a more crucial role in horary astrology than they do in other branches of astrology; however the meaning of all 12 of the houses in horary astrology are still the same as in the other astrological branches. Any house system preferred by the astrologer may be used, but commonly horary astrologers choose to divide the chart using the Regiomontanus house system. Understanding the correct house for the context of the question is pivotal to the correct interpretation of a horary question. Everything can be assigned to a house and it is to that house, and its ruler, that the assignation of the quesited is derived. Whatever planet is ruling the sign on the cusp of the house is called the quesited. The context of the horary will often determine the house. For example, if the horary is about matters pertaining to career, the ruler of the 10th House, natural house for careers and jobs, will be the quesited. A short, non-exhaustive, list of possible associations with houses follows: :The First House ::The querent (person asking the question). The querent's physical appearance (hair color and body type for example) or temperament, so mental state. :The Second House ::The querent's finance, wealth and general material and financial possessions. Moveable possessions as opposed to immovable possessions. Allies or supports for the querent, such as your lawyer in court cases. Any personal (moveable) goods and belongings, immovable possessions such as houses are fourth house. Questions about the value of any of your possessions would be second house, for example the buying and selling of a car would be second house (not third). :The Third House ::Siblings and neighbors. Any general concern about relatives may be considered third house. Communications and contracts. General comings and goings and short journeys and travels. Letters, emails and paperwork. (Cars may be second or third depending on the context of the question- in matters of travel, the third may be used, in matters pertaining to the value of the car, or of buying or selling a car, then the second may be used.) Lower education such as elementary, junior high/middle and high school. :The Fourth House ::Parents. Immovable possessions as opposed to movable possessions, e.g. your houses, garden, orchard. Mines, oil, buried treasure and anything which comes from the 'bowels of the earth'. :The Fifth House ::Children, love affairs, romance, sex (pleasure and procreation). Gambling, speculation, arguments, games and pleasure. Any venue that caters to our pleasures or provide entertainment including restaurants, clubs, bars and music venues, basically any place you go and have fun. :The Sixth House ::Illness and disease or sickness. Also servants, or anyone who works for you, such as a plumber, electrician or anyone in your employ. Pets and small animals, traditionally considered smaller than a goat (larger animals are twelfth house). Work & work environment. People with whom you work together in some kind of agreement. :The Seventh House ::Marriage, partners and partnerships - both business and personal. Competitors and opponents of all kinds. It is the house of open enemies, by which it is meant enemies that you are aware of. Hidden enemies are the twelfth house. If no other house suffices, use the seventh house to represent 'any old person'. :The Eighth House ::Death, fears, anxiety. It is also commonly used to \\"the house of other people's money\\" . (see 'Turning the chart' below). :The Ninth House ::Long distance travel, or, travel to unknown or 'exotic' locations. Foreigners and foreign lands. Universities and students of any subject of higher education such as doctors, lawyers, priests and astrologers. Visions, dreams and religion, as well as churches and philosophies. Books. Pilgrimages or journeys for spiritual or religious reasons. :The Tenth House ::Career and persons of authority. Heads of state, the government generally, judges and royalty. It is also commonly used to indicate the property belonging to the partner or opponent (see 'Turning the chart' below). :The Eleventh House ::Friendships or groups. Wishes, hopes and aspirations. It is considered the house of 'Good Fortune'. Most people know this as the house of friends and acquaintances. (see 'Turning the chart' below). :The Twelfth House ::Secrets, hidden motives and enemies, captivity, imprisonment and self-undoing. Things not yet known to the querent. Any form of non-voluntary bondage or captivity, monasteries, being voluntary and religious are ninth house. Magick, Witchcraft or any manner of secretly undermining the querent. ==Turning the chart== In addition, houses may gain extra meaning by way of 'turning the chart'. If you know that the fourth house relates to the father, and that the third house relates to siblings, you can turn the chart to get the father's sibling by taking the third house (siblings) from the fourth house (father), in other words, by counting three houses from the fourth. In this manner the sixth house (third from the fourth), in addition to its natural meaning, may also be used for any brothers and sisters of the father. In a horary question about, for example, your aunt or uncle, it would make sense to turn the chart and use the sixth house if it is your father's brother or sister, or, alternatively, to use the twelfth house (third from tenth) if it is your mother's brother or sister. Turned houses are called derived houses, as opposed to the normal radical houses. If you doubt whether the fourth or the tenth house represents the father, you can ask a horary question: Which house represents the father in horary? Look closely at the moon (co-significator of You), first (You), fourth and tenth house rulers. This will give you an answer that will work for you. ==Interpretation== Fundamental to horary astrology is the concept of planetary dignity and reception. Dignity comes in two forms, essential and accidental. Essential refers to the quality of a planet at a particular degree of the zodiac and its ability to express its true/good nature. For instance, a horoscope is drawn and Mars is in Scorpio. Using traditional rulerships, Mars here is in its own sign, so it is considered essentially strong; a well- behaved Mars. Mars in Taurus, on the other hand, is in its detriment, so is essentially weak. In a horary question where Mars is a significator, Mars's essential dignity will indicate something of the quality of the quesited. Accidental dignity refers to how the planet \\"finds itself\\". That is, if the planet is in a traditionally bad house (6th, 8th, or 12th) in the chart, if it is retrograde, aspected by a malefic planet (Saturn or Mars), combust, etc., then it is considered an accidental debility. As an example, consider a valuable ring which happens to be lost. Its inherent condition is that it is valuable and so has much essential dignity. However, its current state is that it is lost and so has little accidental dignity. The significator for the ring in this horary might, for example, be Venus in Taurus (good essential dignity) but retrograde and combust (accidentally debilitated). However, some horary astrologers consider a retrograde significator a good sign that the object will come back, or be found. This is particularly true if the significator of the querent and that of the quesited are making aspect to each other. For example, the trine would mean that it is found relatively easily, whereas the opposition may mean that it will be found, but the querent will almost wish it hadn't been. In the above case, the ring may be found, but in such bad shape that the querent would rather not have seen it in its terrible condition. If this question were about a missing person, the person will be found, but in very bad shape. Reception refers to how each planet in a horary question chart \\"view\\" or \\"receive'\\" each other, either favourably, unfavourably, or somewhere in between. If Mars is in Taurus, and Venus is in Scorpio, then each of the planets is in the sign the other planet rules. (Venus is ruler of Taurus, Mars of Scorpio). This is called mutual reception by rulership, and although each planet is in its detriment, it nevertheless receives the other planet favourably.

During the 1885 North-West Rebellion he led the first medical corps to Saskatoon. After the rebellion he worked as a farmer, before opening a general store in Saskatoon in 1896. In January 1903 he was elected overseer over the village of Saskatoon, and when on July 1 of that year the village was incorporated as a town, he became its first mayor. He served until 1904, and again later as mayor of the by now city of Saskatoon from 1907-1908. He also sat on the city council from 1914-1919. In his times as mayor he personally guaranteed a bank loan that allowed for the completion of sewer, water and electrical works, and it was also whilst he was mayor that Saskatoon's City Park was purchased. Wilson also tried his hand at national politics, standing unsuccessfully as a federal candidate for the Conservatives in 1908, before managing to be elected in 1917.

Its population of 5,073 at the 2001 census rose to 5,207 by 2011. A 2018 estimate put the population at 5050.Retrieved 16 August 2020. Once a medieval market and fair town, its site had been settled at least since Roman times. The first written record of it appears in the 1086 Domesday Book. ==Etymology== Noent, Newent's original name, may have meant \\"new place\\" in Celtic. It also may mean \\"new inn\\", referring to lodgings for travellers to Wales, according to John Leland (c. 1503‚Äì1552), who mentioned a house called New Inn, later named the Boothall. According to Leland, there was a house called \\"New Inn\\", later named The Boothall, which provided lodging along the road to Wales. ==Geography== Newent is on the northern edge of the Forest of Dean, within the Forest of Dean District of Gloucestershire. and south-east of the River Wye. The river was connected via Newent to Gloucester in the late 18th century by the 34-mile Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal. ==HistoryRomano-British period=== A Roman road was laid between Newent and Ariconium, near what is now Ross-on-Wye. Within of Newent, there were several metal-working sites used by the Romans. Further evidence of Romano-British settlement occurs at 56 sites within of the town. Archaeological finds there include Roman coins and pottery near the town itself, Roman coins and treasure at Little Gorsley, and a settlement at Dymock. ===Medieval period=== The priory established in Newent was a cell of Cormeilles Abbey, founded in Normandy in 1060 by William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford. The abbey received an endowment from him that included the manor of Newent and surrounding woods, the church and its income, and other property he owned in England. The once Benedictine priory became part of the College of Fotheringhay after the suppression of alien priories during the Hundred Years' War with France. Its site is now occupied by the Court House, adjacent to the parish church. The Domesday Book records that in 1066 the lord of Noemt (Newent) had been Edward the Confessor. Twenty years later the tenant-in-chief and one of the lords was Cormeilles Abbey. Other lords were Durand of Gloucester (brother of Roger de Pitres) and William son of Baderon (William fitzBaderon). Newent, with 34.5 households, was located within the Botloe Hundred of Gloucestershire. There were 10 villagers, 19 smallholders, four serfs and one reeve. There were also four lord's plough teams, 19 men's plough teams, and three mills. Henry III approved an annual fair in 1226 and additionally allowed for a weekly market, which began in 1253. The town still has a half-timbered market house. ===St Mary's=== The Church of England Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary is a Grade I listed building located in Church Street. It dates from the 13th century, but the site had been occupied since the Anglo-Saxon period. St Mary's has stained glass windows from the famed company of Clayton and Bell. Set on a tower with a ring of eight bells is a spire. The church organ was built in 1737 by Thomas Warne, a resident of the town. ===19th century=== In 1848, Newent had a population of 3,099, of whom 1,454 people lived in the town itself. This was fewer than in earlier periods. There were mineral springs near the canal. The Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal between Gloucester and Ledbury closed on 30 June 1881 and the section between Ledbury and Gloucester was converted into a railway line. The line opened on 27 July 1885 as a branch of the Great Western Railway. It closed in 1959, but the canal is now being restored.) ===Survivals=== Church Street, Newent Newent's many historical buildings include a stilted Market House and several other black-and-white, half- timbered buildings typical of Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. Behind Church Street, an erstwhile museum of Victorian life called the Shambles took the form of a replica 19th-century street. The shops are now occupied by real traders. Historic England lists over 50 town-centre buildings and monuments, including most of Church Street and the Devonia in High Street, a Grade II- listed house of the Georgian period. The early 18th-century Court House, standing in a small park by the parish church, occupies the site of the ancient priory and is reputed to contain its foundations. Its historic features include a fine Rococo plaster ceiling and several completely panelled rooms. It was restored by R. V. Morris, Chairman of Gloucester Civic Trust. ==Transport== The nearest railway station is 9 miles (14.5 km) away at Ledbury on the Cotswold Line. Bus routes through the town connect it to Ross and Gloucester. Newent used to be served by Newent railway station on the Ledbury and Gloucester Railway, which opened in 1885, opposite what is now the fire station. It was closed to passengers in 1959 and for freight traffic in 1964. The buttresses of the Station Bridge can be seen in Old Station Road. ==Outdoor attractions== Newent is near a National Birds of Prey Centre, just east of the neighbouring village of Cliffords Mesne, and a vineyard, the Three Choirs. It is at the centre of the Golden Triangle, so-called after the daffodils in the surrounding area. The town's \\"Onion Fayre\\" includes competitions for growing onions and for eating them. It dates from 1996 as a revival of an agricultural fair suspended about the time of World War I. It claims to be Gloucestershire's largest free, one-day festival, with up to 15,000 visitors on the second Saturday in September. ==The arts== The town is home to an orchestra, founded in 1940, a choral society, and several other amateur musical and performing groups. Traditionally, May Day was celebrated by morris dancing on the summit of nearby May Hill at dawn, after which the dancers would process into Newent. Between 2007 and 2014, a Joe Meek festival was held in venues around the town. Artist Paul Nash took a collection of photographs around Carswalls Farm, Upleadon, Newent in the late 1930s or early 1940s that are held in the archives of the Tate. ==Education== Education commissioners in the reign of Edward VI (1547‚Äì53) noted the lack of schooling in Newent, then a market town with over 500 inhabitants, but \\"all the youth of a great distance there hence rudely brought up and in no manner of knowledge and learning, where were a place meet to... erect a school for the better and more godly bringing up of the same youth.\\"Quoted by Joan Simon, Education and Society in Tudor England, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967, p. 229. Today's Newent has three schools, two of them federated, all within the town. The federated Glebe Infant School and Picklenash Junior School provides primary education. Newent Community School offers secondary and tertiary education to those aged 11 and up. ==Sports and recreation== *The town's football team, Newent Town AFC, plays in the Hellenic League System. It was promoted as Champions of the North Gloucester Premier League after winning the title on 14 May 2013. Newent Town also won the Northern Senior \\"Reg Davis\\" League Cup in 2015/2016 and 2016/2017. It then won the Hellenic Div 2 West at its first attempt in the 2017/2018 season. Its reserve team plays in the Hellenic League 2 West. There is a third team which plays in the North Gloucester League. At youth level, the Under 16s won the Cheltenham top division without losing a game in the 2016/2017 season. In the 2018/2019 season there were only Under 18s.

It is taken from the personal motto of Charles V (24 February 1500 ‚Äì 21 September 1558), Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain (as Charles I), and is a reversal of the original phrase non plus ultra (\\"Nothing further beyond\\"). This was said to have been inscribed as a warning on the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar, which marked the edge of the known world in antiquity. Charles adopted the motto following the discovery of the New World by Columbus, and it also has metaphorical suggestions of taking risks and striving for excellence. ==Charles V== The motto was suggested to the young king in 1516 by his physician and adviser Luigi Marliano. It was emblem of Marliano's vision of a Christian empire spanning beyond the boundaries of the Old World. It was associated in particular with the desire to bring the Reconquista past Gibraltar and into North Africa. At Charles's entry into Burgos in 1520, an arch was set up bearing on one side, \\"Plus ultra\\", and on the other \\"All of Africa weeps because it knows that you have the key [Gibraltar and] have to be its master\\". The motto is first recorded on the back of Charles's chair in the church of St Gudule, Brussels. The original French motto Plus oultre was translated into Latin due to the hostility Spaniards bore for the French advisors and ministers Charles brought with him to Spain. ==Spain== The motto continued to be popular in Spain after Charles V's death. It appeared in Habsburg propaganda and was used to encourage Spanish explorers to ignore the old warning and go beyond the Pillars of Hercules. Today it is featured on both the flag and arms of Spain. ==Other uses== *The French built the Lines of Ne Plus Ultra which they hoped would stop the army of the Duke of Marlborough during the 1711 campaigning season in the War of Spanish Succession, but his army breached them without loss. *The motto is used by Veracruz State in Mexico as part of its flag. *The motto is used by a number of institutions around the world, including the National University of San Marcos, the University of Mexico, Shepherd University, the Colombian Navy, St Peters Lutheran College in Indooroopilly, Queensland, Trompsburg Primary School, and Immanuel College (Australia) in Adelaide, South Australia. The French version, Plus oultre, is used as the motto of the Belgian city Binche and the US Air Force Academy's 15th Cadet Squadron. Charles V was born in Ghent, Flanders and as a result the motto is also used in this region. *The English philosopher Sir Francis Bacon used ‚Äúplus ultra‚Äù as his personal motto. *In 1926 a crew of Spanish aviators including Ram√≥n Franco and Julio Ruiz de Alda Miqueleiz completed the first transatlantic flight between Spain and South America on a seaplane named the Plus Ultra. 1930 saw the formation of a Madrid-based football team AD Plus Ultra, which eventually developed into Real Madrid Castilla. *The Plus Ultra Brigade, composed of troops from five Spanish-speaking countries (Spain, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador), served in the Iraq War in 2003. *The motto is written on the wall tiles of the cloak room at Mar-a-Lago, a resort in Florida currently owned by Donald Trump. *The motto appears frequently in popular culture. In the manga and anime series My Hero Academia, it is used as the motto of the hero academy U.A. High School. The light novel series The Saga of Tanya the Evil, which uses Latin phrases and mottos for most of its titles, uses it as the name of the second volume. In the 2015 movie Tomorrowland, the Plus Ultra Society is the name of the fictional group of people responsible for creating a better tomorrow, whose founding members were Gustave Eiffel, Nikola Tesla, Thomas Edison, and Jules Verne. The motto is seen tattooed on the arm of Octane, one of the playable characters in the 2019 videogame Apex Legends, and Non terrae plus ultra is one of his possible voice lines entering a battle. ==See also== * A solis ortu usque ad occasum (), another quote from the Spanish Coat of Arms * List of national mottos * Plus Ultra (aircraft) ==References== Category:Latin mottos Category:Spanish culture Category:National mottos ","title":"Plus ultra"},{"id":"517490","text":"Burrell 6nhp (nominal) general purpose engine, at Great Dorset Steam Fair in 2018 A traction engine is a steam-powered tractor used to move heavy loads on roads, plough ground or to provide power at a chosen location. The name derives from the Latin tractus, meaning 'drawn', since the prime function of any traction engine is to draw a load behind it. They are sometimes called road locomotives to distinguish them from railway locomotives - that is, steam engines that run on rails. Traction engines tend to be large, robust and powerful, but also heavy, slow, and difficult to manoeuvre. Nevertheless, they revolutionized agriculture and road haulage at a time when the only alternative prime mover was the draught horse. They became popular in industrialised countries from around 1850, when the first self-propelled portable steam engines for agricultural use were developed. Production continued well into the early part of the 20th century, when competition from internal combustion engine-powered tractors saw them fall out of favour, although some continued in commercial use in the United Kingdom well into the 1950s and later. All types of traction engines have now been superseded in commercial use. However, several thousand examples have been preserved worldwide, many in working order. Steam fairs are held throughout the year in the United Kingdom, and in other countries, where visitors can experience working traction engines at close hand. Traction engines were cumbersome and ill-suited to crossing soft or heavy ground, so their agricultural use was usually either \\"on the belt\\" - powering farm machinery by means of a continuous leather belt driven by the flywheel - or in pairs, dragging an implement on a cable from one side of a field to another. However, where soil conditions permitted, direct hauling of implements (\\"off the drawbar\\") was preferred - in America, this led to the divergent development of the steam tractor. ==History== Aveling & Porter traction engine 'Avellana' A 110 horse power Traction Engine hauling timber in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. 2. Traction engine hauling war material for the Nicarauguan government. Limits of technical knowledge and manufacturing technology meant that practicable road vehicles, powered by steam, did not start to appear until the early years of the 19th century. The traction engine, in the form recognisable today, was developed from an experiment in 1859 when Thomas Aveling modified a Clayton & Shuttleworth portable engine, which had to be hauled from job to job by horses, into a self-propelled one. This alteration was made by fitting a long driving chain between the crankshaft and the rear axle. Thomas Aveling is regarded as \\"the father of the traction engine\\". Other influences were existing vehicles which were the first to be referred to as traction engines such as the Boydell engines manufactured by various companies and those developed for road haulage by Bray. The first half of the 1860s was a period of great experimentation but by the end of the decade the standard form of the traction engine had evolved and would change little over the next sixty years. Until the quality of roads improved there was little demand for faster vehicles and engines were geared accordingly to cope with their use on rough roads and farm tracks. Right through to the first decades of the twentieth century, manufacturers continued to seek a solution to realise the economic benefits of direct-pull ploughing and, particularly in North America, this led to the American development of the steam tractor. British companies such as Mann's and Garrett developed potentially viable direct ploughing engines, however market conditions were against them and they failed to gain widespread popularity. These market conditions arose in the wake of the First World War when there was a glut of surplus equipment available as a result of British Government policy. Large numbers of Fowler ploughing engines had been constructed in order to increase the land under tillage during the war and many new light Fordson F tractors had been imported from 1917 onwards. === Decline === Preserved Burrell road locomotive pulling a water cart, near Jodrell Bank, Cheshire, England Road steam disappeared through restrictions and charges that drove up their operating costs. Through 1921, steam tractors had demonstrated clear economic advantages over horse power for heavy hauling and short journeys. However, petrol lorries were starting to show better efficiency and could be purchased cheaply as war surplus; on a busy route a 3-ton petrol lorry could save about ¬£100 per month compared to its steam equivalent, in spite of restrictive speed limits, and relatively high fuel prices and maintenance costs. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s there were tighter restrictions on road steam haulage, including speed, smoke and vapour limits and a 'wetted tax', where the tax due was proportional to the size of the wetted area of the boiler; this made steam engines less competitive against domestically produced internal combustion engined units (although imports were subject to taxes of up to 33%). As a result of the Salter Report on road funding, an 'axle weight tax' was introduced in 1933 in order to charge commercial motor vehicles more for the costs of maintaining the road system and to do away with the perception that the free use of roads was subsidising the competitors of rail freight. The tax was payable by all road hauliers in proportion to the axle load and was particularly restrictive on steam propulsion, which was heavier than its petrol equivalent. Initially, imported oil was taxed much more than British-produced coal, but in 1934 Oliver Stanley, the Minister for Transport, reduced taxes on fuel oils while raising the Road Fund charge on road locomotives to ¬£100 per year, provoking protests by engine manufacturers, hauliers, showmen and the coal industry. This was at a time of high unemployment in the mining industry, when the steam haulage business represented a market of 950,000 tons of coal annually. The tax was devastating to the businesses of heavy hauliers and showmen and precipitated the scrapping of many engines. The last new UK-built traction engines were constructed during the 1930s, although many continued in commercial use for many years while there remained experienced enginemen available to drive them. === Preservation === From the 1950s, the 'preservation movement' started to build as enthusiasts realised that traction engines were in danger of dying out. Many of the remaining engines were bought by enthusiasts, and restored to working order. Traction engine rallies began, initially as races between engine owners and their charges, later developing into the significant tourist attractions that take place in many locations each year. The Traction Engine Register records the details of traction engines, steam road rollers, steam wagons, steam fire engines and portable engines that are known to survive in the United Kingdom and Irish Republic. It recorded 2851 self moving engines and wagons, 687 portable engines (non-self moving), 160 steam fire engines existing in 2016. A new edition of the Register is planned in 2020. It was previously estimated in May 2011 by an unknown source that over 2,000 traction engines have been preserved. This figure may include engines preserved elsewhere in the world, particularly the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but if so, is an underestimate. Comprehensive information on past UK manufacturers and their production is recorded by the Road Locomotive Society based in the UK. ==Operation== Hornsby chain tractor (working scale model) :See: steam engine for a description of how the actual engine worked. Although the first traction engines employed a chain drive, it is more typical for large gears to be used to transfer the drive from the crankshaft to the rear axle. The machines typically have two large powered wheels at the back and two smaller wheels for steering at the front. However, some traction engines used a four-wheel-drive variation, and some experimented with an early form of caterpillar track. ==Types and usage== Traction engines saw commercial use in a variety of roles between the mid- nineteenth and mid-twentieth centuries. Each role required a machine with a different set of characteristics, and the traction engine evolved into a number of different types to suit these different roles. ===Agricultural (general purpose) engine=== An agricultural engine, towing a living van and a water cart: Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies Ltd 6 nhp Jubilee of 1908 Big Lizzie\\", a purpose built tractor with two trailers, designed and built by Frank Bottrill using the Dreadnaught wheel which he designed. When built \\"Big Lizzie\\" was the biggest tractor in Australia and thought to be the biggest in the world, at high by wide, and weighing . The most common form in the countryside. They were used for hauling and as a stationary power source. Even when farmers did not own such a machine they would rely upon it from time to time. Many farms would use draught horses throughout the year, but during the harvest, threshing contractors would travel from farm to farm hauling the threshing machine which would be set up in the field and powered from the engine - a good example of the moveable stationary engine. US (agricultural) traction engine Favourable soil conditions meant that US traction engines usually pulled their ploughs behind them, thereby eliminating the complexities of providing a cable drum and extra gearing, hence simplifying maintenance. American traction engines were manufactured in a variety of sizes, with the 6 nhp Russell being the smallest commercially made, and the large engines made by Russell, Case, and Reeves being the largest. ===Ploughing engine=== A John Fowler & Co. Ploughing Engine - the winding drum is mounted below the boiler (the 'drum' on the side is actually a hose for refilling the water tank). A lockable tool box may be seen on the front axle; the 'spud tray' would be mounted in the same way, behind the axle. A distinct form of traction engine, characterised by the provision of a large diameter winding drum driven by separate gearing from the steam engine. Onto the drum a long length of wire rope was wound, which was used to haul an implement, such as a plough, across a field, while the engine remained on the headland. This minimized the area of land subject to soil compaction. The winding drum was either mounted horizontally (below the boiler), vertically (to one side), or even concentrically, so that it encircled the boiler. The majority were underslung (horizontal), however, and necessitated the use of an extra-long boiler to allow enough space for the drum to fit between the front and back wheels. These designs were the largest and longest traction engines to be built. Mostly the ploughing engines worked in pairs, one on each side of the field, with the rope from each machine fastened to the implement to be hauled. The two drivers communicated by signals using the engine whistles. A variety of implements were constructed for use with ploughing engines. The most common were the balance plough and the cultivator - ploughing and cultivating being the most physically demanding jobs to do on an arable farm. Other implements could include a mole drainer, used to create an underground drainage channel or pipe, or a dredger bucket for dredging rivers or moats. The engines were frequently provided with a 'spud tray' on the front axle, to store the 'spuds' which would be fitted to the wheels when travelling across claggy ground. The man credited with the invention of the ploughing engine, in the mid-nineteenth century, was John Fowler, an English agricultural engineer and inventor. However a ploughing engine, devised by Peter, Lord Willoughby de Eresby and his bailiff George Gordon Scott, and constructed at Swindon Works, was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London, some years before Fowler's system appeared. Lord Willoughby had indicated that his design could be copied freely, and Fowler had visited Grimsthorpe Castle, the estate where the ploughing engines were deployed. Chapter 2 Ploughing engines were rare in the US; ploughs were usually hauled directly by an agricultural engine or steam tractor. ===Steam tractor (US)=== : In North America, the term steam tractor usually refers to a type of agricultural tractor powered by a steam engine, used extensively in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. ===Steam tractor (UK)=== The Diamond Queen engine at work in 2015 In Great Britain, the term steam tractor is more usually applied to the smallest models of traction engine - typically those weighing below five tons for the engine to be single manned (anything above had to be manned by at least two people; a driver and steersman); used for hauling small loads on public roads. Although known as light steam tractors, these engines are generally just smaller versions of the road locomotive. They were popular in the timber trade in the UK, although variations were also designed for general light road haulage and showman's use. The most popular of these designs was probably the Garrett 4CD, meaning 4 nominal horse power Compound.Garrett Steam Tractors & Rollers, R A Whitehead, 1999 ===Road locomotive=== A Showman's Engine at the Great Dorset Steam Fair Steam traction heavy haulage Fowler's Monarch of the Road showman's engine Designed for haulage of heavy loads on public highways, it was common for two or even three to be coupled together to allow heavier loads to be handled. The characteristic features of these engines are very large rear driving wheels fitted with solid rubber tyres, three-speed gearing (most traction engine types have only two gears), rear suspension, and belly tanks to provide a greater range between the stops needed to replenish water. All these features are to improve the ride and performance of the engine, which were used for journeys of hundreds of miles. Most road locomotives are fitted with a winch drum on the back axle. This can be used by removing the driving pins from the rear wheels, allowing the drive train to power the winch drum instead of the wheels. James Boydell worked with the British steam traction engine manufacturer Charles Burrell & Sons to produce road haulage engines from 1856 that used his Dreadnaught Wheels which were particularly suited to bad roads or off-road use. A number of road locomotives are fitted with a crane boom on the front. The boom pivot is mounted on the front axle assembly and a small winch is mounted on an extension to the smokebox in front of the chimney, the cable passing over a sheave at the top of the boom arm. The winch is powered by bevel gears on a shaft driven directly from the engine, with some form of clutch providing raise/lower control. These road locomotives can be used to load a trailer as well as to haul it to a new location. They are often referred to as 'crane engines'. A particularly distinctive form of road locomotive was the showman's engine. These were operated by travelling showmen both to tow fairground equipment and to power it when set up, either directly or by running a generator. These could be highly decorated and formed part of the spectacle of the fair. Some were fitted with a small crane that could be used when assembling the ride. ===Steamroller=== Kemna steamroller Related to the steam traction engine, the steam roller was used for road building and flattening ground. Typically designed with a single heavy roller (in practice, usually a pair of adjacent rollers) replacing the front wheels and axle, and smooth rear wheels without strakes. Some traction engines were designed to be convertible: the same basic machine could be fitted with either standard () road wheels, or else smooth rolls - the changeover between the two being achieved in less than half a day. ==Relatives of the traction engine== Portable engine showing the lack of self-driven wheels A number of other steam-powered vehicles share design features with the traction engine, usually because the same technology was re-used in a new application. ===Portable engine=== A portable engine is a type of self-contained steam engine and boiler combination that may be moved from site to site. Although bearing a strong family resemblance, in both appearance and (stationary) operation, the portable engine is not classed as a traction engine as it is not self- propelled. However, it is included in this list because the traction engine is a direct descendant. ===Steam wagon=== Foden C-Type 5 ton 'overtype' steam wagon A steam wagon is a steam-powered road vehicle for carrying freight. It was the earliest form of lorry (truck) and came in two basic forms: overtype and undertype ‚Äì the distinction being the position of the engine relative to the boiler. Among the firms that specialized in them in the 1900s was the short-lived Invicta Works of Maidstone, owned by Jesse Ellis. The overtype had a steam engine mounted on top of a fire-tube boiler, in a similar manner to a traction engine. The front of an overtype steam wagon bears a close family resemblance to traction engines, and manufacturers who made both may well have been able to use some common parts. The undertype had the steam engine mounted under the boiler, usually between the frames of the chassis. The boiler was usually mounted well forward and was often a vertical and/or water tube type. Steam wagons were the dominant form of powered road traction for commercial haulage in the early part of the twentieth century, although they were a largely British phenomenon, with few manufacturers outside Great Britain. Competition from internal-combustion-powered vehicles and adverse legislation meant that few remained in commercial use beyond the Second World War. ===Traction engines as railway locomotives=== An Aveling and Porter traction engine-based railway locomotive, as used by Holborough Cement Co. Several traction engine builders (such as Aveling and Porter and Fowler) built light railway locomotives based on their traction engines. In their crudest form these simply had flanged steel wheels to enable them to run on rails. More sophisticated models had the boiler and engine mounted on a chassis which carried railway-wagon style axles. The rear axle was driven from the engine by gear or chain-drive. These unusual locomotives were sold to small industries for use in shunting and marshalling duties, although they also found favour with engineering firms engaged in the construction of mainline railways for hauling men, equipment and materials over the partly constructed line. ==Terminology== * spud or lug - strip of angled metal that could be bolted to the driving wheels to provide greater traction on soft or heavy ground. Spuds were often required on ploughing engines when moving across farmland. * strake - name for the diagonal strips cast into or rivetted onto the wheel rims to provide traction on unmade ground (similar to the tread on a pneumatic tyre). * Nominal horse power- nhp is the typical way that traction engines are rated. However, it has long been accepted that nominal horse power greatly understates the actual power of the engine. There are many ways to estimate the actual horse power but none of them gives an accurate answer, for example, a 4 nhp engine is said to be approximately ; however a 4 nhp engine can easily pull a laden 8-wheeler lorry while a diesel engine of cannot. Thus, many have resigned themselves that this debate will never be settled and, while nominal horsepower gives a convenient way of rating traction engines, it may never be converted accurately into diesel HP. ==Modern use== Two operators seen after taking part in a parade with their engine, 'Earl Douglas' at Otley carnival in Yorkshire, England Although no longer used commercially, traction engines of all types continue to be maintained and preserved by enthusiastic individuals and are frequently exhibited at agricultural shows in Europe (particularly the UK), Canada and the United States. They are often a main attraction in a live steam festival (see List of steam fairs). Model traction engines, powered by steam, are manufactured by several companies, notably Mamod and Wilesco. Larger scale model engines are popular subjects for model engineers to construct, either as a supplied kit of parts, or machined from raw materials. ==Traction engines in popular culture== ;In film *The 1962 film The Iron Maiden featured a showman's engine as the film's star, along with many others, at the annual rally at Woburn Abbey. *In the 2004 film Tremors 4: The Legend Begins, the people of Rejection, Nevada had a traction engine and were proud of it. During the final battle, two of the characters fired their guns from the traction engine, and the traction engine rammed and killed the last graboid. ;In literature *Trevor the Traction Engine is one of the non-railway characters featured in The Railway Series of children's books by the Rev. W. Awdry. Appearing in several of the books, the traction engine was originally 'saved from scrap' by The Vicar of Wellsworth with the help of Edward the Blue Engine. Trevor has also appeared in a number of episodes in the TV spin-off Thomas & Friends. Another traction engine, Fergus the Railway Traction Engine, also appears in Thomas & Friends, but unlike Trevor, Fergus runs on rails instead of roads. Theo from Journey Beyond Sodor is based on a Brill Tramway No. 1.

Some months later, the two vehicles are instrumental in thwarting a pair of car thieves. The end-papers of the book include a simplified cut-away drawing of the traction engine: a single-cylinder, 6 nhp Fowler light tractor built in 1903. *Traction engines for road haulage feature prominently in Keith Roberts' alternate-history novel Pavane. *In the 1960s, cutaway drawings of traction engines by Geoffrey Wheeler featured in Eagle comics and a Blue Peter annual. ;On television *Fred Dibnah of Bolton, England, was known as a National Institution in Great Britain for the conservation of old traction engines and other steam engines.

There are a number of breeds, with varying characteristics, but all share common traits of strength, patience, and a docile temperament which made them indispensable to generations of pre- industrial farmers. Draft horses and draft crossbreds are versatile breeds used today for a multitude of purposes, including farming, draft horse showing, logging, recreation, and other uses. They are also commonly used for crossbreeding, especially to light riding breeds such as the Thoroughbred, for the purpose of creating sport horses of warmblood type. While most draft horses are used for driving, they can be ridden and some of the lighter draft breeds are capable performers under saddle. ==Characteristics== Size comparison of a draft horse of Percheron breeding with a stock horse type light riding horse Draft horses are recognizable by their tall stature and extremely muscular build. In general, they tend to have a more upright shoulder, producing more upright movement and conformation that is well suited for pulling. They tend to have broad, short backs with powerful hindquarters, again best suited for the purpose of pulling. Additionally, the draft breeds usually have heavy bone, and a good deal of feathering on their lower legs. Many have a straight profile or \\"Roman nose\\" (a convex profile). Draft breeds range from approximately high and from . Draft horses crossbred on light riding horses adds height and weight to the ensuing offspring, and may increase the power and \\"scope\\" of the animal's movement. The largest horse in recorded history was probably a Shire named Sampson (later Mammoth), who was born in 1846. He stood high, and his peak weight was estimated at . At over , a Shire gelding named Goliath was the Guinness Book of World Records record holder for the world's tallest horse until his death in 2001. ==History== Humans domesticated horses and used them to perform a variety of duties. One type of horse-powered work was the hauling of heavy loads, plowing fields, and other tasks that required pulling ability. A heavy, calm, patient and well- muscled animal was desired for this work. Conversely, a light, more energetic horse was needed for riding and rapid transport. Thus, to the extent possible, a certain amount of selective breeding was used to develop different types of horse for different types of work. Clydesdale at Eglinton Country Park in Scotland. It is a common misunderstanding that the Destrier that carried the armoured knight of the Middle Ages had the size and conformation of a modern draft horse, and some of these Medieval war horses may have provided some bloodlines for some of the modern draft breeds. The reality was that the high- spirited, quick-moving Destrier was closer to the size, build, and temperament of a modern Andalusian or Friesian. There also were working farm horses of more phlegmatic temperaments used for pulling military wagons or performing ordinary farm work which provided bloodlines of the modern draft horse. Records indicate that even medieval drafts were not as large as those today. Of the modern draft breeds, the Percheron probably has the closest ties to the medieval war horse. These Shire horses are used to pull a brewery dray delivering beer to pubs in England. In this picture, members of the public are being given a ride. By the 19th century horses weighing more than that also moved at a quick pace were in demand. Tall stature, muscular backs, and powerful hindquarters made the draft horse a source of \\"Horsepower\\" for farming, hauling freight and moving passengers. The railroads increased demand for working horses, as a growing economy still needed transport over the 'last mile' between the goods yard or station and the final customer. Even in the 20th century, draft horses were used for practical work, including over half a million used during World War I to support the military effort, until motor vehicles became an affordable and reliable substitute. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, thousands of draft horses were imported from Western Europe into the United States. Percherons came from France, Belgians from Belgium, Shires from England, Clydesdales from Scotland. Many American draft registries were founded in the late 19th century. The Percheron, with 40,000 broodmares registered as of 1915, was America's most numerous draft breed at the turn of the 20th century. A breed developed exclusively in the U.S. was the American Cream Draft, which had a stud book established by the 1930s. Beginning in the late 19th century, and with increasing mechanization in the 20th century, especially following World War I in the US and after World War II in Europe, the popularity of the internal combustion engine, and particularly the tractor, reduced the need for the draft horse. Many were sold to slaughter for horsemeat and a number of breeds went into significant decline. Today draft horses are most often seen at shows, pulling competition and entered in competitions called \\"heavy horse\\" trials, or as exhibition animals pulling large wagons. However, they are still seen on some smaller farms in the US and Europe. They are particularly popular with groups such as Amish and Mennonite farmers, as well as those individuals who wish to farm with a renewable source of power. They are also sometimes used during forestry management to remove logs from dense woodland where there is insufficient space for mechanized techniques. Crossbred draft horses also played a significant role in the development of a number of warmblood breeds, popular today in international FEI competition up to the Olympic Equestrian level. Small areas still exist where draft horses are widely used as transportation due to legislation preventing automotive traffic, such as on Mackinac Island in the United States. ==Care== Feeding, caring for and shoeing a one-ton draft horse is costly. Although many draft horses can work without a need for shoes, if they are required, farriers may charge twice the price to shoe a draft horse as a light riding horse because of the extra labor and specialized equipment required. Historically, draft horses were shod with horseshoes that were significantly wider and heavier than those for other types of horses, custom-made, often with caulkins. The draft horse's metabolism is a bit slower than riding horse breeds, more akin to that of ponies, requiring less feed per pound of body weight. This is possibly due to their calmer nature. Nonetheless, because of their sheer size, most require a significant amount of fodder per day. Generally a supplement to balance nutrients is preferred over a large quantity of grain. They consume hay or other forage from 1.5% to 3% of their body weight per day, depending on work level. They also can drink up to of water a day. Overfeeding can lead to obesity, and risk of laminitis can be a concern. ==World record== The Shire horse holds the record for the world's biggest horse; Sampson, foaled in 1846 in Bedfordshire, England, stood at his withers, and weighed approx . ==Breeds== A number of horse breeds are used as draft horses, with the popularity of a given breed often closely linked to geographic location. In North America there were five draft horse breeds on the classic list: Belgian, Clydesdale, Percheron, Shire, and Suffolk. The Draft Cross Breeders and Owners Association recognizes the following breeds as draft horses:List of breeds Other breeds may be classified as draft horses by various organizations. ===Harness horses=== Harness and carriage horses, such as the Dutch harness horse, are powerful, but of a lighter build and livelier disposition than draft horses The terms harness horse and light harness horse refer to horses of a lighter build, such as traditional carriage horses and show horses, and are not terms generally used to denote \\"heavy\\" or draft horses. Harness horse breeds include heavy warmblood breeds such as the Oldenburg and Cleveland Bay, as well as lighter breeds such as the Hackney, and in some disciplines, such as combined driving, light riding breeds such as the Thoroughbred or Morgan may be seen. ==See also== * List of horse breeds * Working animal ==References== ==External links== * Draft Cross Breeders and Owners Association * Heavyhorses.org.uk Category:Types of horse Category:Animal-powered transport * ","title":"Draft horse"},{"id":"517513","text":"Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste (; 21 June 1226 ‚Äì 7 December 1279) was Duke of Sandomierz in Lesser Poland from 1232 and High Duke of Poland from 1243 until his death, as the last male representative of the Lesser Polish branch of Piasts. ==Birth and nickname== Boles≈Çaw V was born on 21 June 1226 at Stary Korczyn,Date provided by the Rocznik kapitu≈Çy krakowskiej and Rocznik Traski.

It was given to him by his subjects because of the vows of chastity that Boles≈Çaw V and his wife Kinga of Hungary had jointly taken; for this reason, their marriage was never consummated. The marital chastity and lack of mistresses by the Prince resulted from his exceptional devotion and mortification, and was evidently influenced by his closest female relatives. ==YouthFather's death=== On 24 November 1227, during the Congress of GƒÖsawa, Boles≈Çaw V's father, Leszek the White, was killed. Like his own father and paternal grandfather before him, he was orphaned at young age. After Duke Leszek's death many people claimed the custody of his only son. The nobility of Krak√≥w wanted the regency to be exercised by Dowager Duchess Grzymis≈Çawa, jointly with the local voivode and bishop; however, this was contrary to the treaty of mutual inheritance signed in 1217 by Leszek and W≈Çadys≈Çaw III Spindleshanks, under which it was agreed that in the event of the death of one of them, the other would take the government of his domains and custody of his minor children. On 6 December 1227 Casimir I of Kuyavia - who probably represented his father Konrad I of Masovia at the funeral of Leszek I - advanced his father's claims over the custody of Boles≈Çaw V and his inheritance as his closest male relative.J. Szymczak: Udzia≈Ç syn√≥w Konrada I Mazowieckiego w realizacji jego plan√≥w politycznych, \\"Rocznik ≈Å√≥dzki\\" 29, 1980, p. 9. Due to the lack of response, Konrad I came to Skaryszew to negotiate with Grzymis≈Çawa and the local nobility in the first half of March 1228, with regard to assuming the guardianship of his nephew during his minority.Benedykt Zientara: Henryk Brodaty i jego czasy, ed. TRIO, Warsaw 2006, p. 292 The nobility, especially the Gryfici family, preferred the rule of W≈Çadys≈Çaw III Spindleshanks, but at that point he was in the midst of fighting with his nephew W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic and was unable to claim his rights. Konrad I then appeared in the northern part of Krak√≥w, but at his side were only the Top√≥r and Sztarza families,W. Semkowicz: R√≥d Awda≈Ñc√≥w w wiekach ≈õrednich, vol. 3, p. 163 and so this attempt to take the Seniorate failed. According to Kazimierz Krotowski, the absence from Lesser Poland was the cause of the Prussian invasion to Masovia.Kazimierz Krotoski: Walka o tron krakowski w roku 1228, ed. W. L. Anczyc i Sp., 1895, p. 348. ===Adoption by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Spindleshanks === On 5 May 1228, a meeting was organized in Cienia between W≈Çadys≈Çaw Spindleshanks and a delegation of Krak√≥w nobles, which included Bishop Iwo OdrowƒÖ≈º; voivode Marek Gryfita; Pakos≈Çaw Awdaniec the Old, voivode of Sandomierz; and M≈õciw√≥j, castellan of Wi≈õlica. Under the terms of the meeting, W≈Çadys≈Çaw agreed to the adoption of Boles≈Çaw V, making him his successor over Krak√≥w and Greater Poland. After the meeting, W≈Çadys≈Çaw arrived in Krak√≥w, where Grzymis≈Çawa formally gave him the rule of the city. The dowager duchess and her son received the Duchy of Sandomierz, where she exercised the regency. Shortly afterwards W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic escaped from prison and the fight for Greater Poland was resumed. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Spindleshanks was forced to leave Krak√≥w. Then the local nobility, with the consent of Grzymis≈Çawa, called Henry the Bearded to Krak√≥w, but only to rule as a governor.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Spindleshanks formally retained the rights of high duke, and in 1228 Henry I the Bearded did not accept the title of Duke of Krak√≥w. In the summer of 1228 Konrad I of Masovia attacked Krak√≥w, but was defeated at the Battle of Ska≈Ça by Henry I's son, Henry the Pious. However, a year later Konrad I captured Henry the Bearded and occupied Sieradz-≈Åƒôczyca and later Sandomierz, removing Grzymis≈Çawa from power, despite resistance from the local nobility. In 1230 W≈Çadys≈Çaw Spindleshanks, with the help of Henry I, made an unsuccessful attempt to recover his lands. W≈Çadys≈Çaw died one year later in exile in Racib√≥rz. W≈Çadys≈Çaw's will named Henry the Bearded heir to Krak√≥w and Greater Poland. In 1231, with the support of the Gryfici family, Henry obtained the rule over Sandomierz, after Grzymis≈Çawa (who feared for the future of the inheritance of her infant son) surrendered the regency. During 1231-1232 Henry fought against Konrad for Lesser Poland; by the autumn of 1232 Henry finally obtained control over Lesser Poland and Konrad could only keep Sieradz-≈Åƒôczyca. ===Imprisonment by Konrad I of Masovia=== In 1233 Konrad I of Masovia captured Grzymis≈Çawa and her son after personally robbing and beating them, according to a bull of Pope Gregory IX. Boles≈Çaw V and his mother were imprisoned firstly in Czersk and then in Sieciech√≥w. The humiliations to the dowager duchess continued there, including a slap in the face by Konrad I. Henry the Bearded decided to rescue the imprisoned prince and his mother; shortly thereafter Boles≈Çaw and Grzymis≈Çawa managed to escape from the monastery of Sieciech√≥w with the help of Krak√≥w voivode Klement of Ruszcza and Miko≈Çaj Gall, who was in charge of the prisoners. Both Klement and Miko≈Çaj bribed the guards, who were busy drinking, and did not pay attention to the prisoners, who left the monastery in disguise. Jan D≈Çugosz described the events as follows: ::When one night the guards after drink and feast forgot their duties, abandoned their posts and quietly during the night Duke Boles≈Çaw and his mother secretly left the monastery. For safety reasons, Henry the Bearded hid Boles≈Çaw and his mother in the fortress of Ska≈Ça near the valley of the PrƒÖdnik river. Then, on behalf of her son, Grzymis≈Çawa renounced his rights over Krak√≥w to Henry. In 1234 a war between Henry and Konrad for Lesser Poland broke out. Thanks to Archbishop Pe≈Çka, the Treaty of Luchani was signed in August of that year, under which Boles≈Çaw received Sandomierz and gave several castles to Henry. In June 1235, Pope Gregory IX approved the Treaty of Luchani; however, shortly afterwards Konrad invaded Sandomierz, and as a result of this invasion Boles≈Çaw lost the district of Radom. Henry the Bearded died in 1238, and his son Henry the Pious succeeded him. Like his father, he took the regency of Boles≈Çaw and his Duchy of Sandomierz. In 1239 in Wojnicz, the 13-year-old Boles≈Çaw met his bride, the 15-year-old Kinga (also known as Kunigunda), daughter of King B√©la IV of Hungary. The wedding was celebrated shortly thereafter. Kinga spent her first years in Sandomierz with her mother- in-law. On 9 July of that year, a meeting also took place in Przedb√≥rz between Boles≈Çaw and Konrad, at which the Masovian ruler agreed to renounce his claims over Sandomierz. It was at this point that Boles≈Çaw began his personal government. ===Fall of Krak√≥w=== In 1241 the first Mongol invasion of Poland occurred. In January the Mongols took Lublin and Zawichost. Boles≈Çaw, with his mother and wife, fled to Hungary at the side of his older sister Salomea, wife of the Hungarian prince Coloman, leaving his lands without his leadership. On 13 February the Mongols conquered and burned Sandomierz, and on 11 March he refused to participate in the Battle of Chmielnik. One month later, on 9 April, the Battle of Legnica took place, in which the army commanded by High Duke Henry II the Pious was defeated, and the duke himself was killed. After the defeat of the Hungarian army at the Battle of the Saj√≥ River two days later (11 April) - where Prince Coloman was seriously injured and died shortly after - Boles≈Çaw V and his family (including Salomea, now a widow) fled to Moravia, and then eventually returned to Poland. After the death of Henry the Pious, his eldest son, Boles≈Çaw the Bald, took the title of high duke; however, he did not appear in Krak√≥w, where the government was exercised by Klement of Ruszcza on his behalf. Konrad I of Masovia took this opportunity, and despite the strong resistance of the knights and nobility, he finally entered Krak√≥w on 10 July 1241. A few months later, the fortress of Ska≈Ça, held by Klement of Ruszcza, capitulated. Despite his success, Konrad failed to gain the support of the local nobility, victims of Konrad's mercenaries (the Teutonic Order) themselves, who in 1243 appointed Boles≈Çaw the Chaste as their new ruler. On 25 May of that year the Battle of Suchodo≈Çy took place, in which the Lesser Poland and Hungarian (Sarmatian) troops, under the command of Klemens of Ruszcza, defeated the Masovian troops of Konrad. With this victory, Boles≈Çaw the Chaste regained the government over Krak√≥w. Now at the age of 17, he was the high duke of Poland; however, he remained under the strong influence of his mother until her death. Later that year, Konrad tried to regain the control over Krak√≥w and attacked Boles≈Çaw, but was again defeated. ==AdulthoodStruggle with Konrad=== Konrad I of Masovia until his death attempted to realize his ambition to become high duke and ruler of Krak√≥w. In 1246, together with his son Casimir and supported by Lithuanian and Opole troops, he attacked Lesser Poland again. In the Battle of Zarysz√≥w the troops of Boles≈Çaw were defeated. The duke of Krak√≥w lost Lel√≥w, but Krak√≥w and Sandomierz managed to resist. The lack of funds for war forced Boles≈Çaw to take some properties of his wife, Kinga, which were paid only on 2 March 1257 during a meeting at Nowy Korczyn, when she received the district of Stary SƒÖcz. In the autumn of 1246 was brought the final solution to the conflict when Boles≈Çaw retook Lel√≥w. Konrad died on 31 August 1247, but his son Casimir continued the fight. During 1254-1255 Boles≈Çaw sought the release of Siemowit I of Masovia and his wife, Pereyaslava, who were captured by his brother Casimir. They were finally released in the spring of 1255 after lengthy negotiations. In 1258 Boles≈Çaw the Pious started a long and destructive war against Casimir and his ally ≈öwiƒôtope≈Çk (Swantopolk) II for the castellany of LƒÖd. Boles≈Çaw the Chaste joined in the Greater Poland coalition against the duke of Kuyavia. Between 29 September and 6 October 1259 Boles≈Çaw the Chaste, together with Boles≈Çaw the Pious, sacked Kujawy. A peace treaty was finally concluded on 29 November 1259. In 1260, Casimir I took over the fortress of Lel√≥w. On 12 December during a meeting at Przedb√≥rz, Boles≈Çaw the Chaste mediated the dispute between Casimir and Siemowit, which ended in a mutual treaty. ===Cooperation with Hungary=== Boles≈Çaw the Chaste and Boles≈Çaw the Pious were both allies of the Kingdom of Hungary. Their links with the Hungarians probably resulted from their family relationships, as both of their wives were daughters of King B√©la IV and most of their Polish and Hungarian knights were descendants of the Sarmatian Iazyges, Siraces and Serboi. In 1245 both rulers supported the expedition of Rostislav Mikhailovich, who was the Hungarian candidate for the throne of Halych. On 17 August the Battle of Jaros≈Çaw took place, where the Polish and Hungarian troops were defeated. Finally, a peace treaty was signed at ≈Åƒôczyca. In June and July 1253 Polish- Russian forces, including the army of Boles≈Çaw the Chaste, rushed to Moravia in support of the Hungarian expedition to Vindelicia (Austria), which was under the rule of King Ottokar II of Bohemia. The war failed to achieve a settlement, despite the Polish-Russian army looting several villages. The conflict ended with a treaty; at this time, Ottokar (with the help of Bishop Pawe≈Ç of Krak√≥w) tried to persuade Boles≈Çaw the Chaste to join at his side. In 1260 another conflict erupted between Hungary and Bohemia, when the Hungarian prince Stephen organized a marauding expedition to the Duchy of Carinthia. From June to July 1260 Boles≈Çaw, with Leszek the Black, helped the Hungarians with troops in their fight against Bohemia. On 12 July the Battle of Kressenbrunn took place, which ended with the defeat of the Hungarian army. On 29 January 1262 during a meeting at Iwanowice, Boles≈Çaw the Chaste promised to give military support to Boles≈Çaw the Pious in his conflict with Henry the White, who was a supporter of the Kingdom of Bohemia. On 7 June a second meeting took place at Dank√≥w, where peace negotiations with Henry took place. At this opportunity, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolski tried unsuccessfully to make a quadruple alliance with the Bohemian king, Boles≈Çaw the Chaste, and Boles≈Çaw the Pious. King B√©la IV came into conflict with his son Stephen, which caused an civil war in Hungary. In March 1266 Boles≈Çaw and his wife Kinga arranged a meeting at Buda, at which Stephen was committed to maintain peaceful relations with his father, Ottokar II, Boles≈Çaw the Chaste, Leszek the Black, and Boles≈Çaw the Pious. In 1270 the new King Stephen V of Hungary visited Boles≈Çaw the Chaste in Krak√≥w, where they signed an eternal peace. In the same year, Stephen V renewed the war against Bohemia for the Babenberg inheritance, which ended in the defeat of Hungary. In 1271 Boles≈Çaw, with the help of Rurikid princes, organized an expedition to the Duchy of Wroc≈Çaw, because Henry the White was an ally of Bohemia. King Stephen V died on 6 August 1272, and after this the alliance between Boles≈Çaw the Chaste and the Kingdom of Hungary was completely broken. In 1277 Boles≈Çaw finally made a peace treaty with Bohemia at Opava. With the new king of Hungary, Ladislaus IV, a minor, Boles≈Çaw became an ally of the Kingdom of Bohemia; however, during the conflict between Ottokar and King Rudolph I of Germany, he opted for the Hungarian side. On 26 August 1278 Boles≈Çaw was present in the decisive Battle on the Marchfeld, where Ottokar was defeated and killed. ===Christianization of the Yotvingians=== One of the aims of Boles≈Çaw's foreign policy was the Christianization of the Yotvingians. During 1248-1249 he organized an expedition against them, supported by Siemowit I. However, the expedition ended in failure. Between 1256-1264 the Yotvingians invaded and plundered Lesser Poland. In the spring of 1264, Boles≈Çaw organized a retaliatory expedition against them, which ended with a victory of the Krak√≥w-Sandomierz troops and the death of the Yotvingian prince Komata. For the Christianization of this tribe, Boles≈Çaw created a bishopric in ≈Åuk√≥w on the northeastern border of Lesser Poland. In this cause he counted on the support of his sister Salomea and Pope Innocent IV, who in 1254 issued a special document. In the end the mission failed. ===Second Mongol invasion=== Prince Daniel of Galicia was at the side of Boles≈Çaw as an ally of Hungary in the conflict with the Kingdom of Bohemia. In 1253 after the war with Bohemia, the relation between Boles≈Çaw and Daniel was good. Daniel visited Krak√≥w, where he met the papal legate Opizo, who wanted to crown him. The coronation finally took place at Drohiczyn on the Bug River. Boles≈Çaw and his sister Salomea supported this event, because they wanted Daniel and his principality to acquire the Latin rite. The second Mongol invasion of Poland shattered those plans. In November 1259 the Mongols and Ruthenians invaded and destroyed Sandomierz, Lublin and Krak√≥w; Boles≈Çaw fled to either Hungary or Sieradz, ruled by Leszek the Black. In February 1260 the Mongols left Lesser Poland, and Boles≈Çaw then returned to his lands. At this point his relations with Daniel of Galicia improved; in 1262 they signed a treaty in Tarnawa. After Daniel's death in 1265 a Lithuanian-Russian army invaded and ravaged the Lesser Poland districts of Skaryszew, Tarczek, and Wi≈õlica. During 1265‚àí66 Boles≈Çaw fought against Daniel's son Shvarn and brother Vasilko Romanovich, who helped the Lithuanians in their invasion into Lesser Poland. On 19 June 1266 Shvarn was defeated at the Battle of Wrota. The conflict ended in 1266, when Boles≈Çaw abandoned his expeditions to Yotvingia. In July 1273 the Lithuanians invaded Lublin. In retaliation, Leszek the Black organized an expedition to Yotvingia in December of that year. In 1278 the Lithuanians again invaded Lublin, and they clashed with Leszek's army at the Battle of ≈Åuk√≥w. ===Adoption of Leszek the Black=== Because Boles≈Çaw and his wife Kinga made a vow of chastity, their marriage was childless. In 1265 Boles≈Çaw adopted Leszek the Black as his heir. In 1273 W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolski organized a military expedition to Krak√≥w, because he refused to accept the adoption. On 4 June the Battle of Bogucin Ma≈Çy took place, where the army from Opole-Racib√≥rz was defeated. At the end of October, Boles≈Çaw made a retaliatory expedition against Opole-Racib√≥rz; however, the forces were limited only to destroy specific areas of the duchy. In 1274 W≈Çadys≈Çaw and Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste decided to conclude a peace, under which the Duke of Opole-Racib√≥rz gave up his claims over the throne of Krak√≥w. ===Internal policies=== Boles≈Çaw V paid particular attention to urban development. On 27 February 1253 he granted privileges to the city of Bochnia. On 5 June 1257 during a meeting at Kopernia near Pi≈Ñcz√≥w, he granted the Magdeburg rights to the district of Krak√≥w, and a year later to the city of Nowy Korczyn. In 1264, the city of Skaryszew also received the rights, and in 1271 during a meeting at Krak√≥w, the city of Jƒôdrzej√≥w also obtained the rights. The implementation of the German-styled law led to the rapid economic development in the principality, which experienced losses, up to 75% in population alone, due to Mongol raids. In addition, the reform in the administration of the salt mines of Bochnia and Wieliczka was noteworthy. In 1251 deposits of halite were discovered in Bochnia; previously, only brine had been found there. Boles≈Çaw V prompted the district to mine the salt, which became a source of regular income. During his reign, Boles≈Çaw took special care of the church, and above all, to the Bishopric of Krak√≥w. In 1245, thanks to the efforts of Boles≈Çaw's sister Salomea, a Poor Clare monastery was founded in Zawichost. On 28 August 1252 during a meeting at Oglƒôd√≥w, the Duke and his mother Grzymis≈Çawa granted an immunity privilege to the Bishopric, which guaranteed to the local clergy greater autonomy in economic and judicial matters. On 17 September 1253, thanks to the joint efforts of Boles≈Çaw and the bishop of Krak√≥w, Pope Innocent IV canonized Stanis≈Çaw (Stanislaus) of Szczepan√≥w. On 8 May 1254 celebrations were held in Krak√≥w to honour Saint Stanislaus, including a meeting of the Piast princes. On 18 June another meeting took place at Chroberz, where Boles≈Çaw confirmed the privileges granted to the Bishopric of Krak√≥w at Oglƒôd√≥w. In 1257 a synod was held in ≈Åƒôczyca, where it was established that any ruler who kidnapped a bishop would be automatically excommunicated, and his domains placed under the interdict. Between 11‚Äì12 June 1258 a meeting was held at Sandomierz, at which Boles≈Çaw approved further privileges for the Church in Lesser Poland. At the invitation of Boles≈Çaw V and his wife Kinga, the Franciscans came to Krak√≥w around 1258. ==Death== A copy of Boles≈Çaw's tombstone at the Little Market Square in Krak√≥w . Boles≈Çaw the Chaste died on 7 December 1279.Kalendarz katedry krakowskiej, p. 190 (under 7 December entry): \\"Dux Bolezlaus Pudicus filius Lestkonis obiit\\". Jan D≈Çugosz recorded the event as follows: ::He was deeply grieved not only by his own people, but also by the neighboring nations because of the modesty and majesty that he showed. His funeral took place three days later, on 10 December.Rocznik franciszka≈Ñski krakowski, p. 50. He was buried in the Church of St. Francis of Assisi in Krak√≥w. There is a gravestone with the inscription: ::Anno Domini MCCLXX obiit ilustrissimus princeps et dnus, Vladislaus dictus pius dux Cracov. Kazimierz Stronczy≈ÑskiKazimierz Stronczy≈Ñski: Mniemany grobowiec Boles≈Çawa Wstydliwego w Krakowie, \\"Biblioteka Warszawska\\" 24, 1849, p. 502. alleged that the gravestone was false, but the fact that contemporary sources established that Boles≈Çaw's body was placed in the church, does not raise any objections.Latopis hipacki, p. 880; Udzia≈Ç Rusi, p. 175, footnote 25. After the death of her husband, Kinga entered the Poor Clares convent in Stary SƒÖcz. By virtue of the previous agreement, Leszek II the Black inherited Krak√≥w and Sandomierz. ==Church foundations== In 1263 Boles≈Çaw founded a church dedicated to Mark the Evangelist in Krak√≥w (pl: Ko≈õci√≥≈Ç ≈õw.

Bed Bath & Beyond operates many stores in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Bed Bath & Beyond was founded in 1971. It is counted among the Fortune 500 and the Forbes Global 2000. ==History== Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein worked in management positions at discount store chain Arlan's. As the company suffered financial difficulties, and the two believed that the market would shift toward specialty stores, they decided to leave and form their own company. In 1971, they opened a store in Springfield, New Jersey called Bed 'n Bath. By 1985, Eisenberg and Feinstein were operating 17 stores in the New York metropolitan area and California. Also in 1985, the first superstore was opened, as an attempt to remain competitive with Linens 'n Things, Pacific Linen, and Luxury Linens. In order to properly represent the size increase in its retail stores, the company changed its name to Bed Bath & Beyond in 1987. The company adopted integrated computer-based inventory management systems in 1993 to better compete with Linens ‚Äòn Things, which had utilized computer inventory management since the late 1980s. The company went public in June 1992, making its IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange, where its stock continues to trade under ticker symbol BBBY. Bed Bath & Beyond first reached $1 billion in annual sales in 1999. In March 2019, three activist investment firms‚ÄîLegion Partners, Marcellum Advisors, and Ancora Advisors‚Äîannounced their intent to remove current CEO Steven Temares and restructure Bed Bath & Beyond‚Äôs current board of directors. The activist investors highlighted several instances of perceived nepotism, including the acquisition of Buybuy Baby, which was founded by two of Bed Bath & Beyond co- founder Leonard Feinstein‚Äôs children, and the acquisition of Chef Central, which was created by co-founder Warren Eisenberg‚Äôs son, as examples of poor business practices at Bed Bath & Beyond. This pressure led five independent directors to step down on April 22, 2019, and also resulted in the company restructuring its board to include only 10 directors instead of the previous 12 members. On April 13, 2019 there was a report that the chain will close 40 stores but open 15 new locations. On May 13, 2019, Bed Bath & Beyond announced that CEO Steven Temares would step down ‚Äúeffectively immediately‚Äù and would resign his seat on the board of directors. Mary Winston, who had been appointed to the company's board as a result of the activist investment firms‚Äô efforts, replaced Temares as interim CEO. On November 4, 2019, Mark Tritton, who was previously Target's chief merchandising officer, started as Bed Bath & Beyond's CEO. The company, which has for decades used coupon mailers and other promotional discounting tactics to attract consumers, also announced in April that it would reduce its use of promotional coupons and tighten restrictions on their use. To combat declining profitability, Bed Bath & Beyond is also creating private-label brands and opening ‚Äúlab stores‚Äù that focus on home decor, food and drink, and health and beauty products. Bed Bath & Beyond currently operates approximately 1,530 stores in all 50 U.S. states, as well as in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Canada. In addition to more than 1,020 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, the company also operates approximately 280 Cost Plus World Markets, 100 Buybuy Baby stores, roughly 80 Christmas Tree Shops (and related brands), and more than 50 Harmon stores. The company is expected to close up to 60 stores around the United States in early 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company announced it would close more that 200 or 21% of its stores over 2 years. ==Competition== Since the liquidation of Linens N Things in 2008, Bed Bath and Beyond has several major retail competitors, including Walmart, Target, and JCPenney, as well as several mid-sized competitors like Pier 1 Imports. Companies such as Crate & Barrel, IKEA, and the numerous Williams Sonoma companies like Pottery Barn and West Elm are competitors as well. ==SubsidiariesAcquisitions=== * Harmon Stores ‚Äì acquired in March 2002, operates Face Values * Buy Buy Baby ‚Äì acquired in March 2007 for $67 million * Cost Plus, Inc. ‚Äì acquired in May 2012 for $495 million, operates Cost Plus World Market and World Market * Linen Holdings ‚Äì acquired in June 2012 for $105 million * Of a Kind ‚Äì acquired in August 2015 for an undisclosed amount * One Kings Lane ‚Äì acquired in June 2016 for an undisclosed amount ===Other subsidiaries=== * Bed Bath & Beyond Canada L.P. \\\\- 53 stores across Canada in 9 provinces (none in Quebec, Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon) * Bed Bath & Beyond Mexico ‚Äì a joint venture with Home & More to operate four stores in Mexico under the name \\"Bed Bath & Beyond\\" * Bed Bath & Beyond Invitations ‚Äì an online wedding invitation venture ==New Zealand chain== There is a New Zealand chain with the name \\"Bed Bath & Beyond\\", which has no corporate connection with the American company.

Like many others of his generation, he left school at an early age to work on a fishing boat. In his spare time, Durelle liked to box and while still working in the fishery, he began prize fighting on weekends. Dubbed as the Fighting Fisherman, he began his professional career in 1948, boxing at various venues around the province of New Brunswick. By August 1950, Yvon showed only one defeat in twenty three starts, the lone blemish a loss by disqualification, to Billy Snowball. Over time he was gaining a reputation as a tough opponent with a hard punch. A large fan following in Chatham, one in Newcastle and as well in Fredericton resulted in a groundswell of popularity as his victories eventually made him one of the top ranked middleweight fighters in Canada. ===Championship years=== In May 1953, Durelle won the Canadian middleweight championship then, after defending his title and winning 8 straight bouts, he moved up in weight class to fight in the light heavyweight division where in his first fight against a heavier and stronger opponent, he defeated the Canadian champion to take the light-heavyweight title. The following year, he fought outside his native Canada for the first time, going to Brooklyn, New York to fight Floyd Patterson, an up-and-coming American Golden Gloves champion. Outpointed in 8 rounds by the man who soon became the heavyweight champion of the world, Durelle's strong performance in a losing cause against Patterson gained him wide respect in the international boxing world. In New York City in March 1957, Durelle broke into the top ten world rankings with a 10-round decision over Angelo Defendis. In May he won the British Empire light-heavyweight championship and the following month fought the top-ranked contender in the world, Tony Anthony. In a fight most experts say he won handily, Durelle was given only a draw against the heavily favored Anthony but it elevated him to the number 3 ranking in the world. He became a much talked about sports personality in his native country after he beat the German champion, Willi Besmanoff. In 1958, he defeated Clarence Hinnant, regarded by many as one of the best all around boxers of the time. The victory provided Durelle with the opportunity for his first chance to fight for a world title. Yvon Durelle's light-heavyweight championship fight against the great Archie Moore on December 10, 1958 at the Forum in Montreal, Quebec, is one of the most memorable fights in boxing history. Listed as a 4-to-1 underdog, the bout made Yvon Durelle a legend in Canada, gaining him near cult status for his performance. In one of the first fights broadcast coast-to-coast on American television, Durelle stunned boxing patrons by knocking the champion down 3 times in the first round. Under boxing rules today (except those of the World Boxing Council), the fight would have been stopped after three knockdowns in one round and Yvon Durelle would have been world champion. Also, he missed an opportunity when, after the first knockdown, he stood over Moore watching for several seconds before returning to his corner. As a result of his delay, the referee had to wait to begin the count, and Moore made it to his feet at the count of nine. Durelle swarmed all over the champion for four more rounds and knocked him to the canvas again in round five but Moore held on and eventually wore Durelle down to retain his world championship with an eleventh-round knockout. The fight was the talk of the boxing world and members of the Canadian press voted it the sporting event of the year. In an interview in 1994, Archie Moore, upon recounting the fight still hailed as classic, had this to say: \\"As the fight wore on and I got stronger, I thought to myself that this fella was the toughest man I'd ever fought. I turned professional in 1936 and fought until 1965--229 bouts. And I still think Durelle was the toughest man I ever faced.\\" ===From boxing to wrestling=== Six months later, in June 1959, at Durelle's home village of Baie-Ste-Anne, thirty-five fishermen died when they were swept out to sea by 40-foot tidal waves that pounded the wharf. Distraught at the loss of friends and relatives, in August he lost in a world title fight rematch with Archie Moore by a third-round knockout. In November of that year he lost in 12 rounds to the Canadian heavyweight champion, George Chuvalo. Durelle fought only a few more times, before taking up professional wrestling in 1961. He returned to boxing in 1963 winning twice more before retiring permanently. He continued to earn a living at wrestling, primarily in eastern Canada but on occasion with Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling, in Calgary, Alberta. ===Later life and death=== Despite his size and brutal profession, Durelle is often referred to as a modest and gentle man (his nickname was \\"doux\\", meaning \\"soft\\"). However, in the 1970s an event profoundly impacted him and his family when, in a bar that he owned and operated, he shot and killed a man who had attacked him. Charged with murder, he was defended by a young lawyer by the name of Frank McKenna and was acquitted on the grounds of self-defence. The trial received massive and sustained publicity and McKenna eventually went into politics and was elected premier of the province of New Brunswick. Retired in his native village, a small museum with souvenirs of his twenty-year boxing career was built attached to his home where he and his wife of more than fifty years greeted fans who still showed up to see the New Brunswick boxer. In an article for ESPN.com about the most memorable matches in boxing history, current-day referee Mills Lane said: \\"I don't think you'll ever see a fight like Durelle- Moore again...That fight transcended what great fights are.\\" Durelle incurred a stroke on December 25, 2006, and died at age 77 on January 6, 2007, at the Moncton Hospital in Moncton, New Brunswick. He also had Parkinson's disease prior to this. His funeral was held on January 11, 2007, from Ste-Anne Roman Catholic Church in Baie-Ste-Anne, New Brunswick. ==Professional boxing record== -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"8\\"87 Wins (48 Knockouts), 24 Losses (9 Knockouts), 2 Draws, 1 No Contest - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#e3e3e3;\\"  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Result  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Record  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Opponent  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Type  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Round  style=\\"border- style:none none solid solid; \\"Date  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Location  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Notes - align=center Loss 87-24-2 align=left Jean-Claude Roy    align=left align=left - align=center Win 87-23-2 align=left Phonse LaSaga    align=left align=left - align=center Win 86-23-2 align=left Cecil Gray    align=left align=left - align=center Loss 85-23-2 align=left Paul Wright    align=left align=left - align=center Win 85-22-2 align=left John Armstrong    align=left align=left - align=center Win 84-22-2 align=left Ray Batey    align=left align=left - align=center Win 83-22-2 align=left Emile Dupre    align=left align=left - align=center Loss 82-22-2 align=left George Chuvalo    align=left align=left - align=center Win 82-21-2 align=left Young Beau Jack    align=left align=left - align=center Win 81-21-2 align=left Charlie Jones    align=left align=left - align=center Win 80-21-2 align=left Al Anderson    align=left align=left - align=center Loss 79-21-2 align=left Archie Moore    align=left align=left - align=center Win 79-20-2 align=left Teddy Burns    align=left align=left - align=center Loss 78-20-2 align=left Archie Moore    align=left align=left - align=center Win 78-19-2 align=left Louis Jones    align=left align=left - align=center Win 77-19-2 align=left Freddie Mack    align=left align=left - align=center Win 76-19-2 align=left Mike Holt    align=left align=left - align=center Win 75-19-2 align=left Germinal Ballarin    align=left align=left - align=center Loss 74-19-2 align=left Tony E.

The village is located in the North York district of Toronto, just west of York University and southeast of the Jane and Steeles intersection. It overlooks Black Creek, a tributary of the Humber River. The village is a recreation of life in 19th-century Ontario and gives an idea how rural Ontario might have looked in the early-to-mid-19th century. The village is a regular destination for field trips by schoolchildren from the Greater Toronto Area. It was opened in 1960 and is operated by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority. Napier Simpson, 1925-1978, a restoration architect in Ontario devoted his professional life to raising public awareness of the importance of heritage conservation including the Black Creek Pioneer Village project. ==Collection== over forty 19th century buildings. The pioneer village consists of over forty 19th century buildings, decorated in the style of the 1860s with period furnishings. It is operated by historical interpreters and craftspeople housed in the restored buildings. The site also features historical re-enactments and visiting artisans. Buildings include Dalziel barn, period houses, the original Stong Family farm buildings, a water-powered grist mill, a general store, a blacksmith's shop along with over 10 other trades buildings, a hotel, a church, and a one-room schoolhouse. A core of buildings built by the Stong family are on their original sites, while others have been moved in from across Southern Ontario. The majority of the buildings were moved from their original sites (notably the large Halfway House and Mennonite Meeting House), and some re-built on their current locations. The board and batten blacksmith shop was originally built in the 1850s in Nobleton. The gunsmith shop was built in Bolton, and the Taylor Cooperage building was built in the 1850s in Paris. The weaver shop is within what was originally a Temperance Hall built in Kettleby in 1850 by the Sons of Temperance. ==Affiliations== The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada. ==Future== Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on August 23, 2019, that the Ontario government has no plans to close the village, despite the government's instructions to conservation authorities in Ontario to wind down activities unrelated to protecting watersheds and drinking water or preventing floods. ==See also== * List of museums in Toronto * List of oldest buildings and structures in Toronto * Upper Canada Village ==References== ==External links== * Category:Folk museums in Canada Category:Living museums in Canada Category:Open-air museums in Canada Category:Museums in Toronto Category:History museums in Ontario Category:History of Toronto Category:North York Category:1960 establishments in Ontario Category:Blacksmith shops ","title":"Black Creek Pioneer Village"},{"id":"517542","text":"Zagorje is a Slavic toponym which literally means \\"land beyond the hills\\".

As such, Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n Chishtƒ´'s legacy rests primarily on his having been \\"one of the most outstanding figures in the annals of Islamic mysticism.\\"Nizami, K.A., \\"ƒåisÃ≤hÃ≤tƒ´\\", in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Additionally Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n Chishtƒ´ is also notable, according to John Esposito, for having been one of the first major Islamic mystics to formally allow his followers to incorporate the \\"use of music\\" in their devotions, liturgies, and hymns to God, which he did in order to make the foreign Arab faith more relatable to the indigenous peoples who had recently entered the religion or whom he sought to convert.John Esposito (ed.), The Oxford Dictionary of Islam (Oxford, 2004), p. 53 Others contest that the Chisti order ever permitted musical instruments and a famous Chisti, Nizamuddin Auliya, is quoted as stating that musical instruments are prohibited. He is very famous among the chishti sufis . Having arrived in Delhi during the reign of the sultan Iltutmish (d. 1236), Mu øƒ´n al- Dƒ´n moved from Delhi to Ajmer shortly thereafter, at which point he became increasingly influenced by the writings of the famous Sunni Hanbali scholar and mystic  øAbdallƒÅh An·π£ƒÅrƒ´ (d. 1088), whose famous work on the lives of the early Islamic saints, the ·π¨abƒÅqƒÅt al-·π£≈´fiyya, may have played a role in shaping Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n's worldview. It was during his time in Ajmer that Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n acquired the reputation of being a charismatic and compassionate spiritual preacher and teacher; and biographical accounts of his life written after his death report that he received the gifts of many \\"spiritual marvels (karƒÅmƒÅt), such as miraculous travel, clairvoyance, and visions of angels\\"Mu·∏•ammad b. MubƒÅrak KirmƒÅnƒ´, Siyar al-awliyƒÅ æ, Lahore 1978, pp. 54-58. in these years of his life. Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n seems to have been unanimously regarded as a great saint after his passing. ==Life== Born in 1143 in Sistan, Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n Chishtƒ´ was a teenager when his father, Sayyid GÃ≤hÃ≤iyƒÅtÃ≤hÃ≤ al-Dƒ´n (d. c. 1155), died, with the latter leaving his grinding mill and orchard to his son. His father, Ghayasuddin, and mother, Bibi Ummalwara (alias Bibi Mahe- Noor), were the descendants of Ali, through his sons Hassan and Hussain.Shah Baba, Nawab Gudri, Muinul Arwah æ (2009) He lost both his parents at an early age of sixteen years. Although he was initially hoping to continue his father's business, history says that he is very kind and open minded ,\\" whence he soon began to develop strong contemplative and mystic tendencies in his personal piety. Soon after, Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n gave away all of his financial assets, and began a life of destitute itineracy, wandering in search of knowledge and wisdom throughout the neighbouring quarters of the Islamic world. As such, he visited the famous seminaries of Bukhara and Samarkand, \\"and acquired religious learning at the feet of eminent scholars of his age.\\" It is also entirely probable that he visited the shrines of Muhammad al- Bukhari (d. 870) and Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (d. 944) during his travels in this region, who were both widely venerated figures in the Islamic world by this point in time. While travelling to Iraq, the young Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n encountered in the district of Nishapur the famous Sunni saint and mystic ·∏¥hÃ≤wƒÅjÃ≤a  øUtÃ≤hÃ≤mƒÅn (d. c. 1200), who initiated the willing seeker into his circle of disciples. Accompanying his spiritual guide for over twenty years on the latter's journeys from region to region, Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n also continued his own independent spiritual travels during the time period. It was on his independent wanderings that Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n encountered many of the most notable Sunni mystics of the era, including Abdul-Qadir Gilani (d. 1166) and Najmuddin Kubra (d. 1221), as well as NajÃ≤ƒ´b al-Dƒ´n  øAbd al-·∏≤ƒÅhir Suhrawardƒ´, Ab≈´ Sa øƒ´d Tabrƒ´zƒ´, and  øAbd al-Wa·∏•id GÃ≤hÃ≤aznawƒ´ (all d. c. 1230), all of whom were destined to become some of the most highly venerated saints in the Sunni tradition. Due to Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n's subsequent visits to \\"nearly all the great centers of Muslim culture in those days,\\" including Bukhara, Samarkand, Nishapur, Baghdad, Tabriz, Isfahan, Balkh, Ghazni, Astarabad, and many others, the preacher and mystic eventually \\"acquainted himself with almost every important trend in Muslim religious life in the middle ages.\\" ==Arrival in Lahore== Arriving in India in the early thirteenth century, Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n first travelled to Lahore to meditate at the tomb-shrine of the famous Sunni mystic and jurist Ali Hujwiri (d. 1072), who was venerated by the Sunnis of the area as the patron saint of that city. From Lahore, Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n continued forward on his journey towards Ajmer, which he reached prior to the city's conquest by the Ghurids. It was in Ajmer that Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n got married at an advanced age; and, according to the seventeenth-century chronicler  øAbd al-·∏§aqq Dihlawƒ´ (d. 1642), the mystic actually took two wives, one of whom was the daughter of a local Hindu raja. Having three sons‚ÄîAb≈´ Sa øƒ´d, FakÃ≤hÃ≤r al-Dƒ´n and ·∏§usƒÅm al-Dƒ´n by name‚Äîand one daughter named Bƒ´bƒ´ JamƒÅl, it so happened that only the latter inherited her father's mystic leanings, whence she too was later venerated as a saint in local Sunni tradition. After settling in Ajmer, Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n worked at firmly establishing the Chishti order of Sunni mysticism in India, and many later biographic accounts relate the numerous miracles wrought by God at the hands of the saint during this period. ==Preaching in India== Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n Chishtƒ´ was not the originator or founder of the Chishtiyya order of mysticism as he is often erroneously thought to be. On the contrary, the Chishtiyya was already an established Sufi order prior to his birth, being originally an offshoot of the older Adhamiyya order that traced its spiritual lineage and titular name to the early Islamic saint and mystic Ibrahim ibn Adham (d. 782). Thus, this particular branch of the Adhamiyya was renamed the Chishtiyya after the 10th-century Sunni mystic Ab≈´ Is·∏•ƒÅq al-ShƒÅmƒ´ (d. 942) migrated to Chishti Sharif, a town in the present-day Herat Province of Afghanistan in around 930, in order to preach Islam in that area. The order spread into the Indian subcontinent, however, at the hands of the Persian Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n in the 13th- century, after the saint is believed to have had a dream in which the Prophet Muhammad appeared and told him to be his \\"representative\\" or \\"envoy\\" in India. øAlawƒ´ KirmƒÅnƒ´, Mu·∏•ammad, Siyar al-awliyƒÅ æ, ed.

According to the various chronicles, Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n's tolerant and compassionate behavior towards the local population seems to have been one of the major reasons behind conversion to Islam at his hand.Rizvi, Athar Abbas, A History of Sufism in India (New Delhi, 1986), I/pp. 116-125Nizami, Khaliq Ahmad, '·π¢≈´fƒ´ Movement in the Deccan', in H. K. Shervani, ed., A History of Medieval Deccan, vol. 2 (Hyderabad, 1974), pp. 142-147. Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n Chishtƒ´ is said to have appointed Bakhtiar Kaki (d. 1235) as his spiritual successor, who worked at spreading the Chishtiyya in Delhi. Furthermore, Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n's son, Fakhr al- Dƒ´n (d. 1255), is said to have further spread the order's teachings in Ajmer, whilst another of the saint's major disciples, ·∏§amƒ´d al-Dƒ´n ·π¢≈´fƒ´ NƒÅgawrƒ´ (d. 1274), preached in Nagaur, Rajasthan. ==Spiritual lineage== 19th century die with the genealogy of the Chishti Order As with every other major Sufi order, the Chishtiyya proposes an unbroken spiritual chain of transmitted knowledge going back to the Islamic prophet Muhammad through one of his Companions, which in the Chishtiyya's case is Ali (d. 661). Thus, Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n Chishtƒ´'s spiritual lineage is traditionally given as follows: # Muhammad. #  øAlƒ´ b. Abƒ´ ·π¨ƒÅlib (d. 661), # ·∏§asan al-Ba·π£rƒ´ (d. 728), # Abdul Wahid bin Zaid (d. 786), # al-Fu·∏çayl b.  øIyƒÅ·∏ç (d. 803), # Ibrahim ibn Adham al-Balkhƒ´ (d. 783), # ·∏§udhayfa al-Mar øashƒ´ (d. 890), # Abu Hubayra al-Basri (d. 900), # Khwaja Mumshad Uluw Al Dƒ´nawarƒ´(d. 911), # Abu Ishaq Shami (d. 941), # Abu A·∏•mad Abdal Chishti (d. 966), # Abu Mu·∏•ammad Chishti (d. 1020), # Abu Yusuf ibn Saman Mu·∏•ammad Sam øƒÅn Chishtƒ´ (d. 1067), # Maudood Chishti (d. 1133), # Shareef Zandani (d. 1215), # Usman Harooni (d. 1220), # Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n Chishtƒ´, ==Dargah Sharif== Dargah of Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n Chishtƒ´, Ajmer, Rajasthan, India The tomb (dargƒÅh) of Mu øƒ´n al-Dƒ´n became a deeply venerated site in the century following the preacher's death in March 1236.

It is located from the center of Paris, between Charles de Gaulle Airport and le Bourget Airport. ==Name== The name Le Blanc-Mesnil was recorded for the first time in the 11th century as Mansionile Blaun. This name is a compound of Medieval Latin Mansionile, meaning \\"little houses\\", from Latin mansio (accusative mansionem), and of Germanic (Old Frankish) blanch, blaun, meaning \\"glossy, shining, white\\", which gave French blanc (\\"white\\") and English blank. The name is interpreted by some as a reference to the houses of Le Blanc- Mesnil which were whitened due to the flour dust coming from the windmills located there in ancient times. One researcher, however, thinks that blanc had also the meaning of \\"free\\" in Old French, and so the name would mean \\"free mesnil, free village\\", perhaps because the villagers had been freed from serfdom.

Modern preparations can be made with unconventional ingredients such as lamb, fish, venison, turkey, chicken, shrimp, or steak. == United States == Texas hash with cornbread and green beans \\"Hash\\" of many forms was part of the American diet since at least the 18th century, as is attested by the availability of numerous recipes and the existence of many \\"hash houses\\" named after the dish.No Matter How You Chop It, Hash Makes Leftovers Into A Feast. William Rice, Chicago Tribune In the United States, September 27 is \\"National Corned Beef Hash Day.\\" Classic American corned beef hash originated in the New England region of the United States as a way to use up the leftovers from a traditional boiled dinner of beef, cabbage, potatoes, and onions. A red flannel hash is made with beets instead of potatoes. Fish hash, including salt cod hash, has been observed in historical New England cuisine. Corned beef and cabbage dinners is an Irish-American tradition from the 1800s that is now commonly observed across the United States on St. Patrick's Day. Corned beef hash is also commonly served on St. Patrick's Day, as well as around American Thanksgiving and Christmas. In the Midwest it was common to bind a hash together with a white sauce thickened with flour. Alternatively, in the southern United States, the term \\"hash\\" may refer to two dishes: * a Southern traditional blend of leftover pork from a barbecue mixed with barbecue sauce and served over rice. This is a common side dish at barbecue restaurants and pig pickin's notably in South Carolina and Georgia. * In Texas, a thick stew made up of pork, chicken and beef, traditionally seasoned with salt and pepper and other spices, is reduced overnight over an open flame in an iron washpot or hashpot. Some areas in the South also use the term hash to refer to meat, such as wild game, that is served as barbecue or pulled meat that is boiled first. == UK == As early as the 14th century, English people were making hache or hachy. According to cookbook author Steven Raichlen, \\"The English diarist Samuel Pepys waxed grandiloquent about a rabbit hash he savored in 1662\\", and during World War I, American GIs consumed a steady diet of corned beef hash, which they christened ‚Äúcorned Willie.‚Äù An 18th century recipe for \\"excellent hash\\" was made by preparing a seasoned roux with herbs and onion, cayenne, mace and nutmeg, then adding to it broth or gravy and stirring in mushroom catsup. In this sauce the cold beef would be simmered over gentle heat. Simpler recipes would omit some of the fancier ingredients like mushroom catsup and add filling root vegetables like carrots and boiled potatoes. \\"Norman hash\\" was a dish of gravy and onions served over slices of leftover roast beef. == Other countries == Hash in Denmark, known in Danish as \\"biksemad\\" (roughly translated, \\"tossed together food\\"), is a traditional leftover dish usually made with pork, a fried egg, Worcestershire sauce, pickled red beet slices, and ketchup or Bearnaise sauce. The coarsely- diced ingredients, rather than being mashed into a paste, are readily discernible in their cooked form. In Sweden, there is a version of hash called pyttipanna and in Finland, pyttipannu and Norway, pyttipanne. It is similar to the Danish version. The Swedish variety Pytt Bellman calls specifically for beef instead of other meats and adding cream to the hash. It is named after Sweden's 18th century national poet Carl Michael Bellman. In Austria and perhaps more specifically Tyrol, there exists a similar dish called \\"Gr√∂stl\\", usually consisting of chopped leftover meats (often being pork sausage), potato and onions fried with herbs (typically marjoram and parsley) and then served topped with a fried egg. In Slovenia it is called ha≈°e and very often used as a spaghetti sauce. It is made out of minced pork and veal meat, potato sauce, onion, garlic, flour and spices. In Spanish, Portuguese and Latin American cuisines, there is a similar dish called picadillo (Spanish) or carne mo√≠da (Portuguese).

By 1875, the Canal de l'Ourcq (Ourcq canal) and new railway lines served to divide the town into two parts‚Äîthe \\"Village\\" and the \\"Quatre Chemins\\". ===Heraldry=== ==Future== The recent construction of a science park along the Bassin de la Villette on the former site of city abattoirs has improved pedestrian access to Paris, as well as encouraging urban regeneration in Pantin itself. A key policy discussed since the 2008 mayoral election has been the possibility of integrating the ten banlieue towns of Bagnolet, Les Lilas, Le Pr√©-Saint-Gervais, Romainville, Pantin, Noisy-le-Sec, Montreuil, Bobigny, Bondy and Rosny-sous-Bois into an \\"intercommune\\" of around 440,000 people. This new municipality could be created as early as January 2010. This project was implemented, it gathers nine communes. In 2016, Pantin was declared France's most polluted town by the World Health Organization.https://www.thelocal.fr/20160929/and-the-most- polluted-town-in-france-is ==DemographicsImmigration=== ==Economy== Pantin Mills, headquarters of BNP Paribas Securities Services since 2009. Pantin was once the site of Motobecane's operations. 2,000 companies are located in Pantin, including 21 of more than 100 employees. Huge firms are located in the town, like Herm√®s (580 jobs ‚Äì upholstery and luxury luggage), Bourjois, Chanel, Gucci, Agn√®s b., Sergent-Major, Elis (500 jobs ‚Äì linen rental), Forclum, UTB (400 jobs ‚Äì public works), Photovista Legrand, BNP Paribas, Boiron, Alliance Healthcare, Vetura, Fabio Lucci ... and publishers as computer Software Arkeia Software and MT Software. 3,000 employees of BNP Paribas Securities Services were installed in the historic building Grands Moulins de Pantin at the end of October 2009. Herm√®s finished an expansion project in the city center. The city has created a \\"craft center\\" to \\"4 Chemins\\" especially with the House Revel to promote arts jobs. Pantin is home to a hub of non-profit environmental organization, housed since 2014 in the \\"cit√© de l'environnement\\", like Bruitparif, the noise observatory of √éle-de- France that monitors the environmental noise in the Paris agglomeration. ==Administration== Town hall Since the French canton reform which came into effect in March 2015, Pantin is part of the canton of Pantin, which also includes the commune Le Pr√©-Saint-Gervais. The current mayor of Pantin is Bertrand Kern of the Parti Socialiste (PS). Kern was re-elected in 2014 for a third 6-year mayoral term. ==Transport== Pantin is served by three stations on Paris Metro line 5: Hoche, √âglise de Pantin, and Bobigny ‚Äì Pantin ‚Äì Raymond Queneau. Pantin is also served by Aubervilliers ‚Äì Pantin ‚Äì Quatre Chemins station on Paris Metro line 7. Pantin is also served by Pantin station on Paris RER line E. Finally Pantin is served by numerous bus lines (151, 152, 249, 148). Outside the hours of normal public transport the town is served by the N13 and N142 Noctilien night bus services with stops outside the Centre de la Danse, the Mairie and Rue Delizy. Pantin is recently served by the tramway 3b (Delphine Seyrig; Elle Fitzerald: Grands Moulins de Pantin). ==Education== The commune has 11 preschools,\\"Ecoles maternelles.\\" Pantin.

purpose. Testing these procedures to achieve an installed software system that may be used is known as installation testing. These procedure may involve full or partial upgrades, and install/uninstall processes. Installation testing may look for errors that occur in the installation process that affect the user's perception and capability to use the installed software. There are many events that may affect the software installation and installation testing may test for proper installation whilst checking for a number of associated activities and events. Some examples include the following: * A user must select a variety of options. * Dependent files and libraries must be allocated, loaded or located. * Valid hardware configurations must be present. * Software systems may need connectivity to connect to other software systems. Installation testing may also be considered as an activity-based approach to how to test something. For example, install the software in the various ways and on the various types of systems that it can be installed. Check which files are added or changed on disk. Does the installed software work? What happens when you uninstall? This testing is typically performed in Operational acceptance testing, by a software testing engineer in conjunction with the configuration manager. Implementation testing is usually defined as testing which places a compiled version of code into the testing or pre-production environment, from which it may or may not progress into production. This generally takes place outside of the software development environment to limit code corruption from other future or past releases (or from the use of the wrong version of dependencies such as shared libraries) which may reside on the development environment. The simplest installation approach is to run an install program, sometimes called package software. This package software typically uses a setup program which acts as a multi-configuration wrapper and which may allow the software to be installed on a variety of machine and/or operating environments. Every possible configuration should receive an appropriate level of testing so that it can be released to customers with confidence. In distributed systems, particularly where software is to be released into an already live target environment (such as an operational website) installation (or software deployment as it is sometimes called) can involve database schema changes as well as the installation of new software. Deployment plans in such circumstances may include back-out procedures whose use is intended to roll the target environment back if the deployment is unsuccessful. Ideally, the deployment plan itself should be tested in an environment that is a replica of the live environment. A factor that can increase the organizational requirements of such an exercise is the need to synchronize the data in the test deployment environment with that in the live environment with minimum disruption to live operation. This type of implementation may include testing of the processes which take place during the installation or upgrade of a multi-tier application. This type of testing is commonly compared to a dress rehearsal or may even be called a \\"dry run\\". ==References== Category:Software testing ","title":"Installation testing"},{"id":"517600","text":"Sevran () is a commune in the northeastern suburbs of Paris, France.

Germania () was the projected renewal of the German capital Berlin during the Nazi period, part of Adolf Hitler's vision for the future of Nazi Germany after the planned victory in World War II. Albert Speer, the \\"first architect of the Third Reich\\", produced many of the plans for the rebuilt city in his capacity as overseer of the project, only a small portion of which was realized between the years 1938 and 1943 when construction took place. Some of the projects were completed, such as the creation of a great East‚ÄìWest city axis, which included broadening Charlottenburger Chaussee (today Stra√üe des 17. Juni) and placing the Berlin victory column in the centre, far away from the Reichstag, where it originally stood. Others, however, such as the creation of the Grosse Halle (Great Hall), had to be shelved owing to the beginning of war. A great number of the old buildings in many of the planned construction areas were, however, demolished before the war, and eventually defeat stopped the plans. ==Name== It was Adolf Hitler who conceived of rebuilding Berlin to be the capital of the new world he would be instrumental in creating, and who provided the new name for it, 'Germania'.Friedrich, Thomas (2012) Hitler's Berlin: Abused City. New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press. pp.370-72. According to records of Hitler's \\"table talk\\" of 8 June 1942, Hitler's purpose in the renaming was in order to give a Greater Germanic world empire of the New Order a clear central point: Hitler described his vision for the city several months earlier: The official plan for rebuilding Berlin, which Albert Speer was put in charge of, was called the \\"Comprehensive Construction Plan for the Reich Capital\\" (German: Gesamtbauplan f√ºr die Reichshauptstadt). The Schwerbelastungsk√∂rper was built in order to determine whether the unconsolidated Berlin ground could support the weight of the planned triumphal arch. ==Planning== Doubts persisted at the time as to whether the marshy Berlin ground could have taken the load of the proposed projects, leading to the construction of an exploration building (Schwerbelastungsk√∂rper, literal translation: heavy load-bearing body), which still exists near the site where the Arch of Triumph would have been built. It is basically an extremely heavy block of concrete used by the architects to test how much weight the ground was able to carry. Instruments monitored how far the block sank into the ground. The Schwerbelastungsk√∂rper sank in the three years it was to be used for testing, compared to a maximum allowable settlement of . Using the evidence gathered by these gargantuan devices, it is unlikely the soil could have supported such structures without further preparation. The plan was to cover the Schwerbelastungsk√∂rper by building a bridge over it. The arch would have been near by, but problems with the axis running through infrastructure would have made it difficult to establish any convenient location. Speer was reprieved by Martin Bormann when he contacted Protestant and Catholic authorities: following Hitler's religious views, churches were not to receive building sites in the new areas.Albert Speer. (1997). Inside the Third Reich: Memoirs. New York: Simon and Schuster, p. 177. ==Demolition== The razing of old buildings to make way for the reconstruction of Berlin began in 1938 in various places around the city, including the Alsen district, where the Great Hall would stand, and the Tiergarten district, where Speer planned to build the House for German Foreign Transport, and where the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Strasse would intersect with the great East-West Axis which was to be built. The East-West Axis was completed in time for Hitler's 50th birthday celebration a year later, in 1939, when Speer ceremoniously presented it to Hitler with the words \\"My F√ºhrer. I should like to report the completion of the east-west axis. May the work speak for itself.\\" ==Built== Speer designed a new Chancellery, which included a vast hall designed to be twice as long as the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles. Hitler wanted him to build a third, even larger Chancellery, although it was never begun. The second Chancellery was destroyed by the Soviet Army in 1945. Swedish Bohus granite was imported to be used as building material in Germania. ==Construction halted== At the time of the beginning of World War II, with the German invasion of Poland in 1939, construction was suspended, but started again after the clear German victory. When France was defeated in 1940, and Hitler visited Paris for a short period with Speer and a few chosen others, the F√ºhrer's desire to \\"give Berlin a new face\\" was revitalized, and the work was redoubled at his command. At Speer's instigation, Hitler signed a decree which read: > In the shortest possible time Berlin must be redeveloped and acquire the > form that is its due through the greatness of our victory as the capital of > a powerful new empire. In the completion of what is now the country's most > important architectural task I see the most significant contribution to our > final victory. I expect that it will be completed by the year 1950. > [emphasis in the original] However, after serious setbacks in the German invasion of the Soviet Union, which Hitler had initially seen as another blitzkrieg (\\"lightning war\\"), construction on \\"Germania\\" was halted for good in March 1943. A model of Germania ==Never constructedAvenue of Splendours=== Almost none of the other buildings planned for Berlin were ever built. Berlin was to be reorganised along a central boulevard known as the Prachtallee (\\"Avenue/Boulevard of Splendour(s)\\"). This would run south from a crossroads with the East-West Axis close to the Brandenburg Gate, following the course of the old Siegesallee through the Tiergarten before continuing down to an area just west of Tempelhof Airport. This new North-South Axis would have served as a parade ground, and have been closed off to traffic. Vehicles would have instead been diverted into an underground highway running directly underneath the parade route; sections of this highway's tunnel structure were built, and still exist today. No work was ever begun above ground although Speer did relocate the Siegesallee to another part of the Tiergarten in 1938 in preparation for the avenue's construction. The plan also called for the building of two new large railway stations as the planned North-South Axis would have severed the tracks leading to the old Anhalter and Potsdamer stations, forcing their closure. These new stations would be built on the city's main Hundekopf (dog's head) geography S-Bahn ring with the Nordbahnhof in Wedding and the larger S√ºdbahnhof in Tempelhof-Sch√∂neberg at the southern end of the avenue. The Anhalter Bahnhof, no longer used as a railway station, would have been turned into a swimming pool ‚Äì in post-World War II Berlin. ===Gro√üer Platz=== At the northern end of the avenue on the site of the K√∂nigsplatz (now the Platz der Republik) there was to be a large open forum known as Gro√üer Platz (\\"Grand Plaza\\") with an area of around . This square was to be surrounded by the grandest buildings of all, with the F√ºhrer's palace on the west side on the site of the former Kroll Opera House, the 1894 Reichstag Building on the east side and the third Reich Chancellery and high command of the German Army on the south side (on either side of the square's entrance from the Avenue of Splendours). On the north side of the plaza, straddling the River Spree, Speer planned to build the centrepiece of the new Berlin, an enormous domed building, the Volkshalle (people's hall), designed by Hitler himself. Had it been built, the Volkshalle would still be the largest enclosed space in the world today. Although war came before work could begin, all the necessary land was acquired, and the engineering plans were worked out. The building would have been over high and in diameter, sixteen times larger than the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. ===Triumphal Arch=== Towards the southern end of the avenue would be a triumphal arch based on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, but again, much larger; it would be almost high, and the Arc de Triomphe (at the time the largest triumphal arch in existence) would have been able to fit inside its opening, evidently with the intention of replacing the rather long history associated with this Arch and in particular the unique ceremonies, with reference to the history of France, connected with it. As a result of the occupation of Berlin by Soviet troops in 1945, a memorial was constructed with two thousand of the Soviet dead buried there in line with this proposed 'Triumphal Arch'. It had been intended that inside this generously proportioned structure the names of the 1,800,000 German dead of the First World War should be carved. ==See also== * Fascist architecture * F√ºhrer city - other cities in Germany and Austria which were to be extensively rebuilt * Global city * Nazi architecture * Nordstern (city) * Palace of the Soviets * Speer und Er * Stalinist architecture * Der Untergang * Volkshalle - the Great Hall ==References== Notes Bibliography * Further reading * ==External links== * 3D Virtual recreation * Reuters report * Erratik Institut Berlin, discussion of recurring elements of simulated architecture and simulacra in both the actual planning and media representation of Germania * Hitler's Berlin.

He was the son of Venetian explorer John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto) and his Venetian wife Mattea. After his father's death, Cabot conducted his own voyages of discovery, seeking the Northwest Passage through North America for England. He later sailed for Spain, traveling to South America, where he explored the Rio de la Plata and established two new forts. ==Early life and education== Accounts differ as to Sebastian Cabot's place and date of birth. The historian James Williamson reviewed the evidence for various given dates in the 1480s and concluded that Sebastian was born not later than 1484, the son of John Cabot, a Venetian citizen credited with Genoese or Gaetan origins by birth, and of Mattea Caboto, also Venetian.James A. Williamson, The Cabot Voyages and Bristol Discovery under Henry VII (Hakluyt Society, 2nd Series no 120, 1962), pp. 33-6 Late in life, Cabot himself told Englishman Richard Eden that he was born in Bristol, and that he travelled back to Venice with his parents at four years of age, returning again with his father, so that he was thought to be Venetian.C. Raymond Beazley, John and Sebastian Cabot (London and New York, 1898), p.77 At another time, he told the Venetian ambassador at the court of Charles V, Gasparo Contarini (who noted it in his diary), that he was Venetian, educated in England. In 1515 Sebastian's friend Peter Martyr d'Anghiera wrote that Cabot was a Venetian by birth, but that his father (John Cabot) had taken him to England as a child. His father had lived in Venice from 1461, as he received citizenship (which required 15 years' residency) in 1476. The Caboto family moved to England in 1495 if not before. Sebastian, his elder brother Ludovico and his younger brother Santo were included by name with their father in the royal letters patent from King Henry VII of March 1496 authorizing their father's expeditions across the Atlantic.O. Hartig, \\"John and Sebastian Cabot\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia (New Advent, 1908), accessed 24 April 2015 They are believed by some historians, including Rodney Skelton, to have still been minors since they were not mentioned in the 1498 patent their father also received. John Cabot sailed from Bristol on the small ship Matthew and reached the coast of a \\"New Found Land\\" on June 24, 1497. Historians have differed as to where Cabot landed, but two likely locations often suggested are Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. ===1494 Cabot scouting expedition=== According to Cartograf√≠a Mar√≠tima Hispana,Luisa Martin Mer√°s, Cartograf√≠a Mar√≠tima Hispana (1993, Madrid) Sebastian Cabot included a handwritten text in Latin on his famous map of North America (published in Antwerp, 1544) claiming to have discovered North America with his father in 1494, three years before his father's voyage.The only copy, found in Bavaria in 1843, is kept in the French National Library, Dept. of Maps, Res. Ge. AA 582 (A facsimile of a portion of the map related to South America is available at ) Sancho Gutierrez repeated this text in Castilian on his 1551 map.Downloadable hi-res image of Gutierrez map from 1551: Esta Carta General en plano hizo Sancho Gutierrez cosmographo ..., onb.ac.at (in German)Gutierrez 1551 map, Europeana website, The European Library Placed next to the border of North America, the text reads: > This land was discovered by Johannes Caboto, venetian and Sebastian Caboto, > his son, in the year of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ MCCCCXCIV, 24th > of June in the morning. They put to it the name 'prima terra vista' and > [...] This big island was named Saint John, as it was discovered on Saint > John holiday. People there wander wearing animal furs. They use bow and > arrow to fight, javelins and darts and wooden batons and slings. This is a > very sterile land, there are a lot of white bears and very big deers, big as > horses, and many other animals. As well there are infinite fish: plaices, > salmons, very long soles, 1 yard long and many other varieties of fish. Most > of them are called cod. And there are also black hawks, black as ravens, > eagles, partridges and many other birds. The year is stated as MCCCCXCIV (1494) in both hand-written versions. There cannot be confusion with the commonly accepted date for the Cabots' voyage, in 1497. Two suppositions can explain this. Sebastian Cabot and Sancho Guti√©rrez may have changed the date in the middle of the sixteenth century. Intentional changes and inaccuracies were very common among geographers at the time, depending on the political interests of their sponsors. As Cabot was funded at the time of the map by Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain, he may have been interested in showing that the first travel to North America was in 1494 and thus funded by Castilians or by Portuguese, and not by English or French. By the time Cabot was sponsored by Germany and Spain, both England and France had started claiming shares of the New World in competition with Spain and Portugal. If Cabot and Guti√©rrez stated the correct year, it would mean the Cabots sailed to North America on their own account, before proposing their services to England in 1496. No conteporaneous documentation for this has survived. ==Early career with England and Spain== In 1504 Sebastian Cabot led an expedition from Bristol to the New World, using two ships: Jesus of Bristol and Gabriel of Bristol. These were mastered by Richard Savery and Philip Ketyner, respectively, and fitted out by Robert Thorne and Hugh Elyot. They brought back a certain amount of salted fish, which suggests the voyage was at least partly commercial and that other expeditions may also have included fishing. Cabot was granted an annuity of ¬£10 on 3 April 1505 by Henry VII for services \\"in and aboute the fyndynge of the new founde landes\\". Presumed course of Sebastian Cabot's voyage of 1508-9, based on Peter Martyr's 1516 account and subsequent references to it. In 1508‚Äì09 Cabot led one of the first expeditions to find a North-West passage through North America. He is generally credited with gaining \\"the high latitudes,\\" where he told of encountering fields of icebergs and reported an open passage of water, but was forced to turn back. Some later descriptions suggest that he may have reached as far as the entrance of Hudson Bay. According to Peter Martyr's 1516 account Sebastian then sailed south along the east coast of North America, passing the rich fisheries off the coast of Newfoundland, going on until he was 'almost in the latitude of Gibraltar' and 'almost the longitude of Cuba'. This would imply that he reached as far as Chesapeake Bay, near what is now Washington, D.C..Evan T. Jones and Margaret M. Condon, Cabot and Bristol's Age of Discovery: The Bristol Discovery Voyages 1480-1508 (University of Bristol, 2016), pp. 67-70. Returning home 'he found the King dead, and his son cared little for such an enterprise'.'Marcantonio Contarini's Report on Sebastian Cabot's Voyage, 1536'. James Williamson, Cabot Voyages and Bristol Discovery under Henry VII (Cambridge University Press, 1962), p. 270. This suggests Sebastian arrived back in England shortly after the death of Henry VII (April 1509) and the accession of Henry VIII, who did indeed show much less interest in the exploration of the New World than his father. By 1512 Cabot was employed by Henry VIII as a cartographer, supplying the king with a map of Gascony and Guienne.James Williamson, Cabot Voyages and Bristol Discovery under Henry VII (Cambridge University Press, 1962), p.281; Heather Dalton, Merchants and Explorers: Roger Barlow, Sebastian Cabot, & Networks of Atlantic Exchange 1500-1560 (Oxford 2016), p. 34 In the same year he accompanied the Marquess of Dorset's expedition to Spain, where he was made captain by Ferdinand V. Cabot believed that Spain was more interested in major exploration, but his hopes of getting Ferdinand's support were lost with the king's death. In the turmoil afterward, no plans would be made for new expeditions, and Cabot returned to England. The scholar and translator/civil servant Richard Eden, who came to know Cabot towards the end of his life, ascribed to the explorer 'the governance' of a voyage of c.1516 under English flag.Sebastian M√ºnster, translated Richard Eden, A treatyse of the newe India (1553), preface This has been accepted and elaborated by a number of English writers, particularly of the turn of the nineteenth century.Thomas Southey, Chronological History of the West Indies, Longman, et al., (1827) p. 127; Sir Harry Johnston, Pioneers in Tropical America, Read Books, 2006, p. 101 ; Robert Kerr, A General History and Collection of Voyages and Travels, W. Blackwood, 1824, pp. 11‚Äì12 Rodney Skelton, author of Cabot's entry in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography, connected Eden's text to a known expedition of 1517 which indeed aborted, but is not known to have involved Cabot;David Beers Quinn, England and the Discovery of America 1481-1620 (London, 1974), pp. 163-9 while the historian Alwyn Ruddock transferred Eden's story of the opposition to Cabot's plans of Thomas Spert, future master of the king's ship Mary Rose, to the explorer's voyage of 1508-9. Cabot's effort's in 1521 to bring together and lead an English discovery voyage to North America are well attested. He had the support of Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey, and some offers of backing in money and ships from both Bristol and London merchants. But the Drapers Company expressed their distrust of Sebastian, and offered only limited funds. The response of other livery companies is unknown. The project was abandoned, and Cabot returned to Spain.David Beers Quinn, England and the Discovery of America 1481-1620 (London, 1974), pp. 144-7 ==Marriages and family== Cabot married Joanna (later recorded as Juana in Spanish documents.) They had children before 1512, the year he entered Spanish service. That year he had returned to London to bring his wife and family to Seville. By 14 September 1514, his wife was dead. Among his children was a daughter Elizabeth. An unnamed daughter was recorded as dying in 1533. In Spain Cabot married again, in 1523, to Catalina de Medrano, widow of the conquistador Pedro Barba.Heather Dalton, Merchants and Explorers: Roger Barlow, Sebastian Cabot, & Networks of Atlantic Exchange 1500-1560 (Oxford, 2016), pp. 63-71, 127-8. It is not known if the marriage produced offspring. But since the Spanish wills of both Catalina (1547) and Sebastian (1548) name nieces of Catalina as their heirs, it is unlikely that by the time of Catalina's death the pair had children surviving from their marriage. Catalina died on 2 Sept. 1547. ==Service to Spain== Believing that King Ferdinand II of Aragon was giving more financial support to exploration than the English, Cabot moved to Spain from England in 1512.William Goldsmith, The Naval History of Great Britain from the Earliest Period, J. Jaques, 1825, p. 51 When King Ferdinand died in 1516 it ended a period of exploration and Cabot returned to England. By 1522, he was once again working for Spain as a member of the Council of the Indies and holding the rank of Pilot-Major, where he supervised naval and navigator training, etc. Cabot secretly offered his services to Venice in communications with the Council of Ten. He promised to undertake to find the Northwest Passage to China for Venice if they would receive him. Cabot was commissioned at the rank of captain general in Spain. On March 4, 1525, he was given command of a fleet that was to determine from astronomical observation the precise demarcation of the Treaty of Tordesillas, which defined the area of Spanish and Portuguese monopolies. He was also to convey settlers to the Molucca Islands in the Pacific, to strengthen Spanish claims in the spice islands. This voyage was officially noted as an expedition for the discovery of Tarshish, Ophir, Eastern Cathay, and Cipango (Japan). This expedition consisted of four ships with 250 men, and set sail from Sanl√∫car de Barrameda on April 3, 1526. By this time the survivors of Magellan's expedition had completed their circumnavigation of the world, finding it larger than previously known. The voyage had increased pressure on Spain and Portugal to define their territories, as old boundaries seemed superseded by new data. Cabot was directed to cross the Pacific twice and he might have accomplished a second circumnavigation of the world. When Cabot landed with his expedition in Brazil, however, he heard of the rumours of the great wealth of the Incan king and the nearly-successful invasion of Aleixo Garcia. He abandoned his charge and explored the interior of the R√≠o de la Plata along the northern border of present-day Argentina. Cabot had already earned the disapproval of his crew by stranding the fleet in the doldrums and running the flagship aground off Santa Catarina Island. His decision regarding the R√≠o de la Plata led to open resistance from Martin M√©ndez (his lieutenant general), Miguel de Rodas (pilot of the Capitana), and Francisco de Rojas (the captain of one of the other vessels). He dealt with the mutiny by marooning these men and other officers on Santa Catarina Island, where they are believed to have died. Cabot sailed into the wide R√≠o de la Plata and spent five months exploring the estuary. He established a fort called San Salvador at the confluence of the Uruguay and the R√≠o San Salvador. This was the first Spanish settlement in modern-day Uruguay. Leaving the two larger ships there, he sailed up the Paran√° River in the brigantine and a galley constructed at Santa Catarina. His party constructed a small fort called Santo or Esp√≠ritu Santo at the confluence of the Paran√° and the R√≠o Carcara√±√°. This was the first Spanish settlement in present-day Argentina; the town of Cabot was later constructed nearby and named in his honour. Losing 18 men to an ambush, Cabot returned to San Salvador, passing Diego Garc√≠a's expedition as he went. As a result of this encounter, Cabot sent one ship back to Spain. The Trinidad sailed on 8 July 1528 with his reports, accusations against the mutineers, and requests for further aid.Heather Dalton, Merchants and Explorers: Roger Barlow, Sebastian Cabot, & Networks of Atlantic Exchange 1500-1560 (Oxford, 2016), pp. 106-7 In the spring of 1529, he returned upriver to Esp√≠ritu Santo, which he discovered had been overwhelmed and burnt by the Indians during his absence. He recovered the cannon and returned to San Salvador. At a council on August 6, 1529, he decided to return to Spain. Cabot sailed with Garc√≠a to S√£o Vicente. Purchasing 50 slaves there, he traveled along the coast of Brazil before heading across the Atlantic, reaching Seville on 22 July 1530, with one ship and 24 men. He was arraigned on charges from the Crown, by Rojas, and by the families of Rodas and M√©ndez. He was condemned by the Council of the Indies on charges of disobedience, misadministration, and causing the death of officers under his command. He was sentenced to heavy fines and a two-year banishment to Oran in North Africa.Heather Dalton, Merchants and Explorers: Roger Barlow, Sebastian Cabot, & Networks of Atlantic Exchange 1500-1560 (Oxford, 2016), pp. 118-9, 124-5 During these proceedings, however, the Emperor of Spain had been absent in Germany. Upon his return, Cabot presented him with descriptions of the region. Although no pardon is recorded and the fines were still paid, it is known that Cabot never went into exile. He retained the post of pilot-major of Spain until 1547. Without losing either title or pension, he left Spain and returned to England. ==Later years== In the year 1553, Cabot discussed a voyage to China and re-joining the service of Charles V with Jean Scheyfve, the king's ambassador in England.Royall, Tyler, ed., Calendar State Papers Spanish, vol. 11 (1916), pp. 30‚Äì32, 38‚Äì39. In the meantime Cabot had reopened negotiations with Venice, but he reached no agreement with that republic. After this he acted as an advisor for \\"English ventures for discovery of the Northwest Passage. He became governor of the Muscovy Company in 1553 and, along with John Dee, helped it prepare for an expedition led by Sir Hugh Willoughby and Richard Chancellor. He was made life-governor of the \\"Company of Merchant Adventurers\\", and equipped the 1557 expedition of Steven Borough. By February 1557 he was replaced as governor of the Muscovy Company. He was recorded as receiving a quarterly pension, which he was first paid in person. Someone picked up for him in June and September 1557, and no one was paid in December, suggesting that he had died by then. ==Reputation== From the later sixteenth century until the mid-nineteenth century, historians believed that Sebastian Cabot, rather than his father John, led the famous Bristol expeditions of the later 1490s, which resulted in the European discovery, or rediscovery after the Vikings, of North America. This error seems to have been attributed to Sebastian's accounts in his old age.Peter E. Pope, The Many Landfalls of John Cabot (University of Toronto Press, 1997), pp. 58‚Äì64. The result was that the influential geographical writer Richard Hakluyt represented his father John Cabot as a figurehead for the expeditions and suggested that Sebastian actually led them. When new archival finds in the nineteenth century demonstrated that this was not the case, Sebastian was denigrated, disparaged by Henry Harrisse, in particular, as a man who willfully appropriated his father's achievements and represented them as his own.Henry Harrisse, John Cabot, the Discoverer of North-America and Sebastian, his Son (London, 1896), pp. 115‚Äì25. Because of this, Sebastian received much less attention in the twentieth century. But other documentary finds, as summarized above, have demonstrated that he did lead some exploratory voyages from Bristol in the first decade of the sixteenth century. A. C. H. Smith wrote a biographical novel about him, Sebastian The Navigator (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1985). ==Honors== * A 19th-century bronze relief of Cabot and Henry VII is located in the British Houses of Parliament.William Theed (the Younger), 'Sebastian Cabot before Henry VII' ==Sources== * Evan T.

The species is widely distributed in the Indo-West Pacific region from South Asia to Papua New Guinea and Northern Australia. ==Origin of name== Indigenous Australian rock art depicting barramundi fish Barramundi is a loanword from an Australian Aboriginal language of the Rockhampton area in Queenslandhttp://www.kasei.ac.jp/library/kiyou/2001/13.YOKOSE.pdf meaning \\"large-scaled river fish\\". Originally, the name barramundi referred to Scleropages leichardti and Scleropages jardinii. However, the name was appropriated for marketing reasons during the 1980s, a decision that has aided in raising the profile of this fish significantly. L. calcarifer is broadly referred to as Asian seabass by the international scientific community, but is also known as Australian seabass. ==Description== This species has an elongated body form with a large, slightly oblique mouth and an upper jaw extending behind the eye. The lower edge of the preoperculum is serrated with a strong spine at its angle; the operculum has a small spine and a serrated flap above the origin of the lateral line. Its scales are ctenoid. In cross section, the fish is compressed and the dorsal head profile clearly concave. The single dorsal and ventral fins have spines and soft rays; the paired pectoral and pelvic fins have soft rays only; and the caudal fin has soft rays] and is truncated and rounded. Barramundi are salt and freshwater sportfish, targeted by many. They have large, silver scales, which may become darker or lighter, depending on their environments. Their bodies can reach up to long, though evidence of them being caught at this size is scarce. The maximum weight is about . The average length is about . Its genome size is about 700 Mb, which was sequenced and published in Animal Genetics (2015, in press) by James Cook University. Barramundi are demersal, inhabiting coastal waters, estuaries, lagoons, and rivers; they are found in clear to turbid water, usually within a temperature range of 26‚àí30¬∞C. This species does not undertake extensive migrations within or between river systems, which has presumably influenced establishment of genetically distinct stocks in Northern Australia. ==Lifecycle== The barramundi feeds on crustaceans, molluscs, and smaller fish (including its own species); juveniles feed on zooplankton. The barramundi is euryhaline, but stenothermal. It inhabits rivers and descends to estuaries and tidal flats to spawn. In areas remote from fresh water, purely marine populations may become established. At the start of the monsoon, males migrate downriver to meet females, which lay very large numbers of eggs (several millions each). The adults do not guard the eggs or the fry, which require brackish water to develop. The species is sequentially hermaphroditic, with most individuals maturing as males and becoming female after at least one spawning season; most of the larger specimens are therefore female. Fish held in captivity sometimes demonstrate features atypical of fish in the wild; they change sex at a smaller size, exhibit a higher proportion of protogyny and some males do not undergo sexual inversion. ==Recreational fishing== Prized by anglers and sport-fishing enthusiasts for their good fighting ability, barramundi are reputed to be good at avoiding fixed nets and are best caught on lines and with fishing lures. In Australia, the barramundi is used to stock freshwater reservoirs for recreational fishing. These \\"impoundment barramundi\\", as they are known by anglers, have grown in popularity as a \\"catch and release\\" fish. Popular stocked barramundi impoundments include Lake Tinaroo near Cairns in the Atherton Tablelands, Lake Proserpine west of Proserpine, Queensland, Teemburra Dam near Mackay, Lake Moondarra near Mount Isa, Lake Awoonga near Gladstone, and Lake Monduran south of Lake Awoonga. ==Commercial fishing and aquaculture== The fish is of commercial importance; it is fished internationally and raised in aquaculture in Australia, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Israel, Thailand, the United States, Poland, and the United Kingdom. A Singapore investment firm has invested in an upcoming barramundi fish farm in Brunei. The Australian barramundi industry is relatively established, with an annual production of more than 4000 tons. In the broader Southeast Asian region, production is estimated to exceed 30,000 tons. By contrast, the US industry produces about 800 tons a year from a single facility, Australis Aquaculture, LLC. In 2011, VeroBlue Farms in Iowa started and aims to produce 500 tons annually. Barramundi under culture commonly grow from a hatchery juvenile, between 50 and 100 mm in length, to a table size of 400-600 g within 12 months and to 3.0 kg within 18‚Äì24 months. ==Aquarium use== Juveniles are a popular aquarium fish, and can be very entertaining, especially at feeding time. However, they grow quickly, so they are recommended to be kept in setups of 500 l or larger. In aquaria, they become quite tame and can be hand-fed; they are not aggressive, but their feeding reflex is violent and sudden, so they cannot be kept with any tank mates small enough to be swallowed. ==As food== Barramundi piebald colour morph Barramundi have a mild flavour and a white, flaky flesh, with varying amount of body fat. Barramundi are a favorite food of the region's apex predator, saltwater crocodiles, which have been known to take them from unwary fishermen. Nile perch--a similar fish found in the Afrotropical realm, or sub-Saharan Africa--is often mislabeled as barramundi. ===Australian cuisine=== In Australia, such is the demand for the fish that a substantial amount of barramundi consumed there is actually imported. This has placed economic pressure on Australian producers, both fishers and farmers, whose costs are greater due to remoteness of many of the farming and fishing sites, as well as stringent environmental and food safety standards placed on them by government. While country-of-origin labelling has given consumers greater certainty over the origins of their barramundi at the retail level, no requirement exists for the food service and restaurant trades to label the origins of their barramundi. ===Bengali cuisine=== Locally caught bhetki (barramundi) is a popular fish among Bengali people, mainly served in festivities such as marriages and other important social events. It is cooked as bhetki machher paturi, bhetki machher kalia, or coated in suji (semolina) and pan fried. It is very popular among people who are usually sceptical about eating fish with a lot of bones. Bhetki fillets have no bones in them. In Bengali cuisine, therefore, fried bhetki fillets are popular and considered to be of good quality. The dish is commonly called \\"fish fry\\". ===Goan cuisine=== Locally caught chonak (barramundi) is a favourite food, prepared with either recheado (a Goan red masala) or coated with rava (sooji, semolina) and pan fried. The fish is generally filleted on the diagonal. It is eaten as a snack or as an accompaniment to drinks or the main course. It is one of the more expensive fish available. ===Thai cuisine=== Barramundi from local fish farms are known as pla kapong () in Thailand.Fishing in Thailand Since its introduction, it has become one of the most popular fish in Thai cuisine. It is often eaten steamed with lime and garlic, as well as deep-fried or stir- fried with lemongrass, among a variety of many other ways. Pla kapong can be seen in aquaria in many restaurants in Thailand, where sometimes this fish is wrongly labeled as \\"snapper\\" or \\"sea bass\\" on menus.Ruen Urai, Thai cuisine Traditionally, Lutjanidae snappers were known as pla kapong before the introduction of barramundi in Thai aquaculture, but presently, snapper is rarely served in restaurants in the main cities and in interior Thailand. ===United States=== In the US, barramundi is growing in popularity. Monterey Bay Aquarium has deemed US and Vietnam-raised barramundi as \\"Best Choice\\" under the Seafood Watch sustainability program. ==See also== *Japanese lates, a very similar species ==ReferencesFisheries Western Australia - Barramundi Fact Sheet * Betting On Barramundi: The Green- Friendly Fish, Feature Story on National Public Radio's \\"All Things Considered\\" * Native Fish Australia article * * * Queensland Department of Industries and Fisheries, Fishweb: \\"Fish Note: Barramundi (Giant Perch)\\" Category:Lates Category:Fish of the Indian Ocean Category:Marine fish of Northern Australia Category:Fish of New Guinea Category:Freshwater fish of Southeast Asia Category:Freshwater fish of Australia Category:Fish described in 1790 Category:Taxa named by Marcus Elieser Bloch Category:Sport fish Category:Australian cuisine ","title":"Barramundi"},{"id":"517645","text":"Bricqueville is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. ==Population== ==See also== *Communes of the Calvados department *Bricqueville-la-Blouette *Bricqueville-sur-Mer ==References== Category:Communes of Calvados (department) Category:Calvados communes articles needing translation from French Wikipedia ","title":"Bricqueville"},{"id":"517648","text":"Camboinhas is one of the 48 neighborhoods into which the city of Niter√≥i, in Brazil, is divided. The name originated in a marine accident in the 1950s. In that decade, a ship called Camboinhas grounded on the beach. A Brazilian Navy corvette named \\"Angostura\\" was sent to save the ship, but grounded during her attempts to tow \\"Camboinhas\\" out of the beach. The Navy then abandoned their attempts to salvage the \\"Camboinhas\\" and concentrated all efforts on saving the \\"Angostura\\", which they eventually succeeded in doing. Today, the remains of the hull of the Camboinhas can be seen on the beach, during low tide. The neighborhood has shores on both the Itaipu Lagoon and the Atlantic Ocean and was inhabited primarily by fishermen until 1978, when a company named Veplan started lotting the land for the real estate market. Between the years of 1980 and 1991, the place experienced a population growth rate of 14.84% per year, leading the city's statistics in that category. As a result, in 1991 it had a population of 926, which equals 0.21% of the total population of the municipality. On the Atlantic shore, the place is marked by typical vegetation of the region, with sand dunes and restinga vegetation. In terms of occupation, the area is dominated by middle and upper-class family residences. 95.51% of the houses have plumbing. Tourism: the views of Rio de Janeiro from this beach are some of the most beautiful around. It's a wonderful place to spend the day. It's about a 1 hr drive from Rio. The beach is not very crowded at all during the week, it's very swimmable and walkable, there are kiosks/little restaurants right on the beach serving snacks, full meals (great seafood) and cold drinks. It's worth staying for the gorgeous sunsets.

It is also compatible with Interface 1. ==Currah ŒºSpeech for the ZX Spectrum== The Currah ŒºSpeech, commonly referred to as the Microspeech plugged into the expansion port on the back of the ZX Spectrum. Additional leads were provided to feed the sound and UHF signal from the computer into the unit. The TV aerial lead plugged into the unit and speech sounds were added into the UHF signal generated by computer.

Typing LET KEYS=0 would turn this feature off. ===Programming speech=== Specific words and phrases could be spoken by assigning a value to the reserved string variable \`S$\`. This was interpreted letter-by-letter unless brackets were used to denote other allophones. A simple example would be \\"(dth)is\\", (dth) representing the voiced dental fricative /√∞/.

The unit allocated itself the top 256 bytes of memory at switch- on and moved down the USR graphics and RAMTOP. This made it incompatible with some programs, particularly games, which use that space for machine code. For cost reasons, the unit did not provide for daisy-chaining of further devices on the computer's expansion port. Many joystick interface manufacturers took the same approach, meaning that you could not have a joystick and the MicroSpeech unit plugged in at the same time.

He was one of the most celebrated writers of the Urdu language in Pakistan. Outside literature, he has been described as \\"a man of wide experience\\" having been a teacher, an army officer, a journalist, a trade unionist and a broadcaster.Sisir Kumar Das, History of Indian Literature: 1911-1956, struggle for freedom : triumph and tragedy, Sahitya Akademi, 2005, p. 476 Faiz was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature and won the Lenin Peace Prize. Born in Punjab, British India, Faiz went on to study at Government College and Oriental College. He went on to serve in the British Indian Army. After Pakistan's independence, Faiz became the editor to The Pakistan Times and a leading member of the Communist Party before being arrested in 1951 as an alleged part of conspiracy to overthrow the Liaquat administration and replace it with a left-wing government. Faiz was released after four years in prison and went on to become a notable member of the Progressive Writers' Movement and eventually an aide to the Bhutto administration, before being self-exiled to Beirut. Faiz was an avowed Marxist, and he received the Lenin Peace Prize by the Soviet Union in 1962. His work remains influential in Pakistan literature and arts. Faiz's literary work was posthumously publicly honoured when the Pakistan Government conferred upon him the nation's highest civil award, Nishan-e-Imtiaz, in 1990. ==Personal lifeEarly life=== Faiz Ahmad Faiz was born into a Tattla Jutt family on 13 February 1911, in Kala Qader (present-day Faiz Nagar), District Narowal, Punjab, British India. Faiz hailed from an academic family that was well known in literary circles. His home was often the scene of a gathering of local poets and writers who met to promote the literacy movement in his native province. His father Sultan Muhammad Khan was a barrister who worked for the British Government, and an autodidact who wrote and published the biography of Amir Abdur Rahman, an Emir of Imperial Afghanistan. ===Education=== Although his family were devoted Muslims, Faiz was brought up in a secular tradition of Islam. Following the Muslim South Asian tradition, his family directed him to study Islamic studies at the local Mosque to be oriented to the basics of religious studies by Maulana Hafiz Muhammad Ibrahim Mir Sialkoti, an Ahl-i Hadith scholar.Andreas Rieck, The Shias of Pakistan: An Assertive and Beleaguered Minority, Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 57 According to Muslim tradition, he learned Arabic, Persian, Urdu language and the Quran. Faiz was also a Pakistan nationalist, and often said \\"Purify your hearts, so you can save the country...\\". His father later took him out of Islamic school because Faiz, who went to a Madrassa for a few days found that the impoverished children there, were not comfortable having him around and ridiculed him, as much as he tried to make them feel at ease. Faiz came to the Madrassa in neat clothes, in a horse-drawn carriage, while the students of the school were from very poor background and used to sit on the floor on straw matsFaiznama In 'Faiznama', his close friend Dr. Ayub Mirza recalls that Faiz came home and told his father he was not going to attend the Madrassa anymore. His father then admitted him in the Scotch Mission School, which was managed and run by a local British family. After matriculation, he joined the Murray College at Sialkot for intermediate study. In 1926, Faiz enrolled in Department of Languages and Fine Arts of the Government College University (GCU), Lahore. While there, he was greatly influenced by Shams-ul-Ulema, Professor Mir Hassan who taught [Arabic] and Professor Pitras Bukhari . Professor Hasan had also taught the renowned philosopher, poet, and politician of South Asia, Dr. Muhammad Iqbal. In 1926, Faiz attained his BA with Honors in Arabic language, under the supervision of Professor Mir Hassan. In 1930, Faiz joined the post- graduate programme of the GCU, obtaining MA in English literature in 1932. The same year, Faiz passed his post-graduate exam in the 1st Division from Punjab University's Oriental College, where he obtained a master's degree in Arabic in 1932. It was during his college years that he met M. N. Roy and Muzaffar Ahmed who influenced him to become a member of the Communist Party. ===Marriage=== In 1941, Faiz became affectionate with Alys Faiz, a British national and a member of Communist Party of the United Kingdom, who was a student at the Government College University where Faiz taught poetry. While Alys opted for Pakistan citizenship, she was a vital member of Communist Party of Pakistan, played a significant role in Rawalpindi Conspiracy Case when she brought together the communist fwa .Together, the couple gave birth to two daughters Salima and Moneeza Hashmi. ==CareerAcademia and literacy=== In 1935 Faiz joined the faculty of Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College at Amritsar, serving as a lecturer in English and British literature. Later in 1937, Faiz moved to Lahore to reunite with his family after accepting the professorship at the Hailey College of Commerce, initially teaching introductory courses on economics and commerce. In 1936, Faiz joined a literary movement, (PWM) and was appointed its first secretary by his fellow Marxist Sajjad Zaheer. In East and West-Pakistan, the movement gained considerable support in civil society. In 1938, he became editor-in-chief of the monthly Urdu magazine \\"Adab-e-Latif (lit. Belles Letters) until 1946. In 1941, Faiz published his first literary book \\"Naqsh-e-Faryadi\\" (lit. Imprints) and joined the Pakistan Arts Council (PAC) in 1947. Faiz was a good friend of Soviet poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko who once said \\"In Faiz's autobiography... is his poetry, the rest is just a footnote\\". During his lifetime, Faiz published eight books and received accolades for his works. Faiz was a humanist, a lyrical poet, whose popularity reached neighbouring India and Soviet Union. Indian biographer Amaresh Datta, compared Faiz as \\"equal esteem in both East and West\\". Throughout his life, his revolutionary poetry addressed the tyranny of military dictatorships, tyranny, and oppressions, Faiz himself never compromised on his principles despite being threatened by the right-wing parties in Pakistan. Faiz's writings are comparatively new verse form in Urdu poetry based on Western models. Faiz was influenced by the works of Allama Iqbal and Mirza Ghalib, assimilating the modern Urdu with the classical. Faiz used more and more demands for the development of socialism in the country, finding socialism the only solution of country's problems. During his life, Faiz was concerned with more broader socialists ideas, using Urdu poetry for the cause and expansion of socialism in the country. The Urdu poetry and Ghazals influenced Faiz to continue his political themes as non-violent and peaceful, opposing the far right politics in Pakistan. ===Military service=== On 11 May 1942, Faiz was commissioned in the British Indian Army as a second lieutenant in the 18th Royal Garhwal Rifles. Initially assigned as a public relations officer in the General Staff Branch, Faiz received rapid promotions in succession to acting captain on 18 July 1942, war-substantive lieutenant and temporary captain on 1 November 1942, acting major on 19 November 1943 and to temporary major and war-substantive captain on 19 February 1944. On 30 December 1944, he received a desk assignment as an assistant director of public relations on the staff of the North-Western Army, with the local rank of lieutenant-colonel. For his service, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, Military Division (MBE) in the 1945 New Year Honours list. Faiz served with a unit led by Akbar Khan, a left-wing officer and future Pakistan Army general. He remained in the army for a short period after the war, receiving promotion to acting lieutenant-colonel in 1945 and to war-substantive major and temporary lieutenant-colonel on 19 February 1946. In 1947, Faiz opted for the newly established State of Pakistan. However, after witnessing the 1947 Kashmir war with India, Faiz decided to leave the army and submitted his resignation in 1947. ===Internationalism and communism=== Faiz believed in Internationalism and emphasised the philosophy on Global village. In 1947, he became editor of the Pakistan Times and in 1948, Faiz became vice-president of the Pakistan Trade Union Federation (PTUF). In 1950, Faiz joined the delegation of Prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan, initially leading a business delegation in the United States, attending the meeting at the International Labour Organization (ILO) at San Francisco. During 1948‚Äì50, Faiz led the PTUF's delegation in Geneva, and became an active member of World Peace Council (WPC). Faiz was a well-known communist in the country and had been long associated with the Communist Party of Pakistan, which he founded in 1947 along with Marxist Sajjad Zaheer and Jalaludin Abdur Rahim. Faiz had his first exposure to socialism and communism before the independence of State of Pakistan which he thought was consistent with his progressive thinking. Faiz had long associated ties with the Soviet Union, a friendship with atheist country that later honoured him with high award. Even after his death, the Russian government honoured him by calling him \\"our poet\\" to many Russians. However his popularity was waned in Bangladesh after 1971 when Dhaka did not win much support for him. Faiz and other pro-communists had no political role in the country, despite their academic brilliance. Although Faiz was a not a hardcore or far-left communist, he spent most of the 1950s and 1960s promoting the cause of communism in Pakistan. During the time when Faiz was editor of the Pakistan Times, one of the leading newspapers of the 1950s, he lent editorial support to the party. He was also involved in the circle lending support to military personnel (e.g. Major General Akbar Khan). His involvement with the party and Major General Akbar Khan's coup plan led to his imprisonment later. Later in his life, while giving an interview with the local newspaper, Faiz was asked by the interviewer as if he was a communist. He replied with characteristic nonchalance: \\"No. I am not, a communist is a person who is a card carrying member of the Communist party ever made. The party is banned in our country. So how can I be a communist?...\\". ===Rawalpindi plot and exile=== The Liaquat Ali Khan's government failure to capture Indian-administered Kashmir had frustrated the military leaders of the Pakistan Armed Forces in 1948, including Jinnah. A writer had argued that Jinnah had serious doubt of Ali Khan's ability to ensure the integrity and sovereignty of Pakistan. After returning from the United States, Ali Khan imposed restrictions on Communist party as well as Pakistan Socialist Party. Although the East Pakistan Communist Party had ultimate success in East- Pakistan after staging the mass protest to recognise Bengali language as national language. After Jinnah founded it, the Muslim League was struggling to survive in West-Pakistan. Therefore, Prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan imposed extreme restrictions and applied tremendous pressure on the communist party that ensured it was not properly allowed to function openly as a political party. The conspiracy had been planned by left-wing military officer and Chief of General Staff Major-General Akbar Khan. On 23 February 1951, a secret meeting was held at General Akbar's home, attended by other communist officers and communist party members, including Marxist Sajjad Zaheer and communist Faiz. General Akbar assured Faiz and Zaheer that the communist party would be allowed to function as a legitimate political party like any other party and to take part in the elections. But, according to communist Zafar Poshni who maintained, in 2011, that \\"no agreement was reached, the plan was disapproved, the communists weren't ready to accept General's words and the participants dispersed without meeting again\\". However the next morning, the plot was foiled when one of the communist officer defected to the ISI revealing the motives behind the plot. When the news reached the Prime minister, orders for massive arrests were given to the Military Police by the Prime minister. Before the coup could be initiated, General Akbar among other communists were arrested, including Faiz. In a trial led by the Judge Advocate General branch's officers in a military court, Faiz was announced to have spent four years in Montgomery Central Jail (MCJ), due to his influential personality, Liaquat Ali Khan's government continued locating him in Central Prison Karachi and the Central Jail Mianwali. The socialist Huseyn Suhravardie was his defence counselor. Finally on 2 April 1955, Faiz's sentence was commuted by the Prime minister Huseyn Suhrawardy, and he departed to London, Great Britain soon after. In 1958, Faiz returned but was again detained by President Iskander Mirza, allegedly blamed Faiz for publishing pro-communist ideas and for advocating a pro-Moscow government. However, due to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's influence on Ayub Khan, Faiz's sentence was commuted in 1960 and he departed to Moscow, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; he later settled in London, United Kingdom. ===Return to Pakistan and government work=== In 1964, Faiz finally returned to his country and settled down in Karachi, and was appointed Rector of Abdullah Haroon College. Having served as the secretary of the Pakistan Arts Council from 1959-1962, he became its Vice-President the same year. In 1965, Faiz was first brought to government by the charismatic democratic socialist Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who was tenuring as Foreign minister in the presidency of Ayub Khan. Bhutto lobbied for Faiz and gave him an honorary capacity at the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MoIB) working to rallying the people of West-Pakistan to fight against India to defend their motherland. During the 1971 Winter war, Faiz rallied to mobilise the people, writing patriotic poems and songs that opposed the bloodshed during separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan. In 1972, Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto brought him back when Bhutto appointed Faiz as Culture adviser at the Ministry of Culture (MoCul) and the Ministry of Education (MoEd). Faiz continued serving in Bhutto's government until 1974 when he took retirement from the government assignments. Faiz had strong ties with Bhutto, and was deeply upset upon Bhutto's removal by Chief of Army Staff General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1977, in a military coup codename Fair Play. Again, Faiz was monitored by Military Police and his every move watched. In 1979, Faiz departed from Pakistan after learning the news that Bhutto's execution had taken place. Faiz took asylum in Beirut, Lebanon, where he edited the Soviet-sponsored magazine Lotus and met well-known Arab figures like Edward Said and Yasser Arafat,Arif Azad (1 September 2019), \\"ESSAY: FAIZ, PALESTINE, LOTUS AND BEIRUT\\", Dawn. Retrieved 3 April 2020. but returned to Pakistan in poor health after the renewal of the Lebanon War in 1982. In 1984, Faiz died in Lahore, Punjab Province, shortly after hearing that he had received a nomination for the Nobel Prize for Literature. ==Legacy== Although living a simple and restless life, Faiz's work, political ideology, and poetry became immortal, and he has often been called the \\"greatest poet\\" of Pakistan. Faiz remained an extremely popular and influential figure in the literary development of Pakistan's arts, literature, and drama and theatre adaptation. In 1962, Faiz was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize which enhanced the relations of his country with the Soviet Union which at that time had been hostile and antagonistic relations with Pakistan. The Lenin Peace Prize was a Soviet equivalent of Nobel Peace Prize, and helped lift Faiz's image even higher in the international community. It also brought Soviet Union and Pakistan much closer, offering possibilities for bettering the lives of their people. Most of his work has been translated into the Russian language. Faiz, whose work is considered the backbone of development of Pakistan's literature, arts and poetry, was one of the most beloved poets in the country. Along with Allama Iqbal, Faiz is often known as the \\"Poet of the East\\". While commenting on his legacy, classical singer Tina Sani said: ===Accolades and international recognition=== Faiz was the first Asian poet to receive the Lenin Peace Prize, awarded by the Soviet Union in 1962. In 1976 he was awarded the Lotus Prize for Literature. He was also nominated for the lenin Prize shortly before his death in 1984. At the Lenin Peace Prize ceremony, held in the grand Kremlin hall in Moscow, Faiz thanked the Russian government for conferring the honour, and delivered an acceptance speech, which appears as a brief preface to his collection Dast-i-tah-i-Sang (Hand under the rock): In 1990, he was belatedly honoured by the Pakistan Government when ruling Pakistan Peoples Party led by Prime minister Benazir Bhutto, accepting the recommendation, and posthumously awarded Faiz, the highest civilian award, Nishan-e-Imtiaz in 1990., Faiz Ahmad Faiz's Nishan-e-Imtiaz Award info on aaj.tv website, Retrieved 3 June 2016 In 2011, the Pakistan Peoples Party's government declared the year of 2011 \\"as the year of Faiz Ahmed Faiz\\". In accordance, the Pakistan Government set up a \\"Faiz Chair\\" at the Department of Urdu at the Karachi University and at the Sindh University, followed by the Government College University of Lahore established the Patras, Faiz Chair at the Department of Urdu of the university, also in 2011. The same year, the Government College University (GCU) presented golden shields to the University's Urdu department. The shields were issued and presented by the GCU vice-chancellor Professor Dr. Khaleequr Rehman, who noted and further wrote: \\"Faiz was poet of humanity, love and resistance against oppression\\". In 2012, at the memorial ceremony was held at the Jinnah Garden to honour the services of Faiz by the left-wing party Avami National Party and Communist Party, by the end of the ceremony, the participants chanted his name: \\"The Faiz of workers is alive! The Faiz of farmers is alive...! Faiz is alive....!\\". ===Translations=== Faiz Ahmad Faiz's poetry has been translated into many languages, including English and Russian. A Balochi poet, Mir Gul Khan Nasir, who was also a friend of Faiz Ahmad Faiz, translated his book Sar-e-Wadi-e-Seena into Balochi with the title Seenai Keechag aa. Gul Khan's translation was written while he was in jail during Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's regime for opposing the government's policies. It was only published in 1980, after Zia-ul-Haq toppled Bhutto's government and freed all the political prisoners of his (Bhutto's) regime. Victor Kiernan, British Marxist historian translated Faiz Ahmed Faiz's works into English, and several other translations of whole or part of his work into English have also been made by others;Omer Tarin, Faiz Ahmad Faiz: The Living Verse and its English Translators, in Punjab Journal of the Humanities, Lahore, Pakistan, Vol 3, 2008, pp. 21‚Äì23 a transliteration in Punjabi was made by Mohinder Singh. Faiz Ahmad Faiz, himself, also translated works of notable poets from other languages into Urdu. In his book \\"Sar-i Waadi-i Seena ÿ≥ÿ±Ÿê ŸàÿßÿØ€åŸê ÿ≥€åŸÜÿß\\" there are translations of the famous poet of Dagestan, Rasul Gamzatov. \\"Deewa\\", a Balochi poem by Mir Gul Khan Nasir, was also translated into Urdu by Faiz.\\"Warsa-i Nasiriyat Ÿàÿ±ÿ´€Ç ŸÜÿµ€åÿ±€åÿßÿ™\\" by Abdul Sabur Baloch, p 166.\\"Shairi- iShar Gadaari ÿ¥ÿßÿπÿ±€å ÿßÿ¥ÿπÿßÿ± ÿ∫ÿØÿßÿ±€å\\" by Mir Aqil Khan Mengal in Maahnaama Balochi, December 1987, p 11. ==Plays, music, and dramatic productions on Faiz== * \\"Hum Dekhenge\\" ⁄æŸÖ ÿØ€å⁄©⁄æ€å⁄∫ ⁄Ø€í by Iqbal Bano * Sheeshon ka Maseeha ÿ¥€åÿ¥Ÿà⁄∫ ⁄©ÿß ŸÖÿ≥€åÿ≠ÿß by Omer Khawaja and Shabana Azmi. * Dard Aayega Dabe Paon ÿØÿ±ÿØ ÿ¢ÿ¶€í ⁄Øÿß ÿØÿ®€í Ÿæÿßÿ§⁄∫ by Sheela Bhatiya. * Kuchh Ishq kiya Kuchh Kaam ⁄©⁄Ü⁄æ ÿπÿ¥ŸÇ ⁄©€åÿß ⁄©⁄Ü⁄æ ⁄©ÿßŸÖ written by Danish Iqbal and staged by IPTA Delhi.

A Union victory, it was the first organized land action of the war, though generally viewed as a skirmish rather than a battle. However, the Northern press celebrated it as an epic triumph and this encouraged Congress to call for the drive on Richmond that ended with the Union defeat at First Bull Run in July. It brought overnight fame to Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan and was notable for the first battlefield amputations. The Union victory was the first of a series of victories that pushed Confederate forces out of northwest Virginia, which allowed Unionists in Wheeling to continue organizing the Union government for Virginia, ultimately leading to the creation of the state of West Virginia. As the largely-untrained Confederates had fled the battlefield with barely any resistance, the Union jokingly referred to the engagement as the Philippi Races. ==Background== After the commencement of hostilities at Fort Sumter in April 1861, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan returned to the Army and on May 13 assumed command of the Department of the Ohio, headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio.Official Records, Chap. IX, p. 2. McClellan planned an offensive into what is now the State of West Virginia (at the time the northwestern counties of the Commonwealth of Virginia) which he hoped would lead to a campaign against the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. His immediate objectives were to occupy the territory to protect the largely pro-Union populace in the counties along the Ohio River, and to keep open the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad line, a critical supply line for the Union. On May 26, McClellan, in response to the burning of bridges on the Baltimore & Ohio near the town of Farmington, ordered Col. Benjamin Franklin Kelley of the (Union) 1st West Virginia InfantryMcClellan privately confided to Scott on June 4 [1861] that \\"comparatively few of the Virginia troops thus far raised,\\" such as those in Kelley's command, were really Virginians but \\"mostly from Penna and Ohio.\\" Ethan S. Rafuse, McClellan's War: The Failure of Moderation in the Struggle for the Union, pg. 104 with his regiment and Company A of the 2nd West Virginia Infantry, to advance from Wheeling to the area and safeguard the important bridge over the Monongahela River at Fairmont, a distance of about southeast of Wheeling. Kelley's men were supported by the 16th Ohio Infantry under Col. James Irvine. After securing Fairmont, the 1st West Virginia advanced again and seized the important railroad junction of Grafton, about southeast of Fairmont, on May 30. Meanwhile, the 14th Ohio Infantry Regiment, under Col. James B. Steedman, was ordered to occupy Parkersburg and then proceed to Grafton, about to the east. By May 28, McClellan had ordered a total of about 3,000 troops into Western Virginia and placed them under the overall command of Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Morris, commander of Indiana Volunteers. Position of McClellan's Advance on the Heights Round Philippi. (This contemporary soldier's sketch shows the disposition of some of Morris's troops just northwest of Philippi on the threshold of the battle.) On May 4 Confederate Col. George A. Porterfield had been assigned command of the state forces in northwestern Virginia and ordered to Grafton to take charge of enlistments in the area. As the Union columns advanced, Porterfield's poorly armed 800 recruits retreated to Philippi, about south of Grafton. Philippi was the county seat of Barbour County, which had voted in favor of Virginia's secession ordinance. A palmetto secession flag had been flying above the courthouse since January, 1861.A History of Barbour County At Philippi, a covered bridge spanned the Tygart Valley River and was an important segment of the vital Beverly-Fairmont Turnpike. While Porterfield had a command of regimental strength it was composed of independent companies that had not yet been formally organized into regiments. Most were local recruits from Taylor, Pocahontas, Upshur, Hardy, Pendleton, Harrison, Barbour, Marion and the Valley counties of Augusta, Bath, Rockbridge, and Highland. The companies were the Letcher Guards, Pocahontas Rescues, Upshur Grays, Franklin Guards, Hardy Blues, Marion Guards, Harrison Rifles, Highland County Highlanders, Barbour Grays, Potomac Guards, Bath Grays, Second Rockbridge Dragoons, Churchville Cavalry and the Barbour Lighthorse Cavalry. These companies were eventually organized into the 25th Virginia Infantry, the 31st Virginia Infantry, The 11th Virginia Cavalry and the 14th Virginia Cavalry, with the Barbour Lighthorse Cavalry disbanding after the battle.Confederate Forces in the 1861 Rich Mountain CampaignWallace, Lew A., Jr., A Guide to Virginia Military Organizations 1861-1865, Virginia Civil War Commission, Richmond, 1964 ==Battle== Richmond Enquirer June 11, 1861, Confederate troops at Grafton, Va. Col. Kelley devised a two-prong attack against the Confederate force in Philippi, approved by Gen. Morris on his arrival in Grafton on June 1. The principal advance would be 1,600 men led by Kelley himself, and would include six companies of his own regiment, nine of the 9th Indiana Infantry Regiment under Col. Robert H. Milroy, and six of the 16th Ohio Infantry. In order to deceive the enemy into thinking the objective was Harpers Ferry, they departed by train to the east. They disembarked at the small village of Thornton and marched south on a back road on the same side of the river as Philippi, intending to arrive at the rear of the town. Meanwhile, the 7th Indiana under Col. Ebenezer Dumont were sent to Webster, about southwest of Grafton. They would unite with the 6th Indiana under Col. Thomas T. Crittenden and the 14th Ohio under Col. Steedman. The column, with a total of 1,400 men under Col. Dumont (with the assistance of Col. Frederick W. Lander, volunteer aide-de-camp to Gen. McClellan), would march directly south from Webster on the Turnpike. In this way, the Union force would execute a double envelopment of the outnumbered Confederates. On June 2, the Union columns set off to converge on Philippi. After an overnight march in rainy weather, both arrived at Philippi before dawn the following morning. Morris had planned a predawn assault to be signaled by a pistol shot. The green Confederate volunteers had failed to establish picket lines for perimeter security, choosing instead to escape the cold rain and stay inside their tents. A Confederate sympathizer, Mrs. Thomas Humphreys, saw the approaching Union troops and sent her young son on horseback to warn the Confederates. As Mrs. Humphreys watched, she saw Union pickets capture her son and fired her pistol at them. She missed, but her shots began the attack prematurely. The Union attackers began firing their artillery, which awakened the Confederates from their slumber. Those who were armed fired a few shots at the advancing bluecoats, then Southerners broke and began running to the south, some still in their bed clothes. This caused Union journalists to refer to the battle as the \\"Races at Philippi\\". Dumont's soldiers entered the town from the bridge (Col. Lander's ride down the steep hillside through heavy underbrush was considered such a feat of horsemanship that Leslie's Weekly gave an illustrated account of it shortly afterwardDayton, Ruth Woods. \\"The Beginning ‚Äì Philippi, 1861\\".), but Kelley's column had arrived from the north on the wrong road and were unable to block the Confederate retreat. Kelley himself was shot while pursuing some of the retreating Confederates, but Col. Lander chased down and captured the man who shot Kelley. The Confederates retreated to Huttonsville, about to the south. ==Aftermath== Philippi was the first organized land action in the warEicher, Longest Night, p. 75, wrote \\"Although this minor skirmish was glorified in the press ... it had little significance.\\" The National Park Service battle description concludes, \\"Although a small affair, this was considered the first major land action in the Eastern Theater.\\" The other contender for first battle in the East is Big Bethel, on June 10. (the impromptu Battle of Fairfax Court House, two days earlier, could not be counted as such), and Union victory in this relatively bloodless battle propelled McClellan into the national spotlight. The Northern press, hungry for battle stories, presented it as an epic triumph, encouraging politicians to demand the big advance on Richmond, which became Bull Run. The civilian population of Philippi were the first in western Virginia to feel the devastation of the war. The town was primarily secessionist in sentiment, and many had fled south with as many of their valuables as they could carry in fear of the Federal advance. In July, a month after the battle, it was reported that \\"with the exception of our troop [Philippi] is almost deserted, only three families having as yet returned, among them is Mr. Wilson and family, one of the most influential families in Barbour county.\\"Daily Intelligencer July 9, 1861\\"Return of a Foraging Party to Philippi, Virginia\\", Harper's Weekly, August 17, 1861 A correspondent of the Cincinnati Times wrote \\"The village bears more than any other I have seen, the ruinous effect of the war. Many of the houses have been sacked and maliciously damaged. Not the half of them are now occupied, the inhabitants having fled. It was a rabid secession town, and the women yet lean strongly that way.\\"Daily Intelligencer October 14, 1861 A record book of soldier violations was found a few months after the battle containing the following entries: \\"Edward F. Grant enters a complaint against Colonel McCook's 9th Ohio Regiment for breaking into the houses of Haynes and Hovatter, June 25, 1 p.m.\\" \\"Two privates in the guard house for stealing glassware and vegetables.\\" \\"Four men in the guard house for theft. Discharged.\\" \\"Ninety-six men in guard house for breaking into dwellings and houses.\\"Maxwell, Hu, The History of Barbour County, West Virginia, Acme Publishing Co., 1899, pg. 301 Many of the men of Philippi had left before or just after the battle, some not returning until after the war and leaving the women to care for families and property.Dayton, Ruth Woods, The Beginning- Philippi 1861 There were two significant Confederate casualties. Both were treated with battlefield amputations, believed to be the first such operations of the war. One was a Virginia Military Institute cadet, Fauntleroy Daingerfield. The other Confederate was James E. Hanger, an 18-year-old college student. After recovering and being released, Hanger returned home to Virginia. He made an artificial leg from barrel staves with a hinge at the knee. His design worked so well that the Virginia State Legislature commissioned him to manufacture the ‚ÄúHanger Limb‚Äù for other wounded soldiers. After the war, Hanger patented his prosthetic device and founded what is now the Hanger Orthopedic Group, Inc. As of 2007, Hanger Orthopedic Group is the United States market leader in the manufacture of artificial limbs. Following the battle, Col. Porterfield was replaced in command of Confederate forces in western Virginia by Brig. Gen. Robert S. Garnett. The short-story writer and satirist Ambrose Bierce (1842‚Äìca. 1914) was a Union recruit at the Battle of Philippi. Twenty years later, he wrote, in an autobiographical fragment he called On a Mountain: The quotation marks indicate the wryness with which Bierce and his fellow veterans, who were to undergo far more harrowing fights, must have regarded the designation of \\"first battle\\". ==See also== *Philippi Covered Bridge, used by both sides during the battle. ==Notes== ==References== * Carnes, Eva Margaret.

The fort and the point on which the fort was built were named after Henry Hamilton, former Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of Quebec.Mecredy 2000, p. 88. The original fort was constructed during the War of 1812 to protect the Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard (the site of the present-day Royal Military College of Canada) on Point Frederick from a possible American attack during the war and to monitor maritime traffic on the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario. The original fort was replaced by a much larger construction in the 1830s to maintain protection of the naval dockyard and protect the southern entrance to the Rideau Canal. The fort was restored in the 1930s and is a significant tourist attraction. ==HistoryBackground=== In the years immediately following the American Revolution, British-American hostilities still concerned the British, and the high promontory of Point Henry was considered to be a good location for a defensive fortification. However, a fortification was not built on the hill until the beginning of the War of 1812. In 1783, the British military established a post in what is now Kingston by partly refurbishing and garrisoning the ruined French fort (Fort Frontenac). The garrison and the developing townsite near the fort were deemed difficult to defend and so Captain John Ross, the British officer in charge of settling Loyalist refugees in the area, proposed to move the stronghold along with the townsite to the more defensible Point Henry.Mika 1987, p. 180. In 1794, Lord Dorchester ordered the survey of Point Henry, Point Frederick, and \\"the adjacent Country and Coves taking in whatever may lye near enough to affect the Security or convenience of the Port\\" to investigate the location of a navy base. Lt. Alexander Bryce of the Royal Engineers preferred Haldimand Cove (now Navy Bay) as a navy base and recommended a fortification on Point Henry to defend it.Osborne 2011, p. 48. ===First fort=== In November 1812, batteries from the Fort helped repel American warships pursuing HMS . At the beginning of the War of 1812, local militia erected a blockhouse and battery on Point Henry to defend the important naval base on Point Frederick, located across Haldimand Cove to the west, and to monitor maritime traffic on the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario. On November 10, 1812, this battery was involved in repelling several American warships that were attacking the Provincial Marine sloop Royal George as the ship was taking refuge in Kingston Harbour.The Discriminating General - The War of 1812 Retrieved March 19, 2015 This naval action strengthened the view that a stronger fortification was needed and so the militia and regular army began building a more permanent fortification in 1813. The fort was one of several defensive structures built in and around Kingston during the war. By 1820 the fort consisted of earth and stone ramparts, demi-bastions, redans, ditches, magazines, barracks, signal towers and support batteries.Osborne 2011, p. 50. ===Second fort=== Completed in 1836, the second Fort was used by the British Army until 1871, and the Canadian Militia until 1891. Distrust between the Americans and British continued after the War of 1812. This led to the original fort being demolished to make way for a more extensive fort, which was constructed between 1832 and 1836Mika 1987, p. 68.Ontario Heritage Plaque - Fort Henry Retrieved September 02, 2015 to defend the Lake Ontario end of the strategic Rideau Canal, the harbour, and the naval dockyard. In 1843, the advanced battery overlooking the lake to the south was completed when the casemated commissariat stores and magazines were built. These stone buildings connected the advanced battery to the main redoubt. A system of more elaborate defensive works was planned but cost overruns in the construction of the canal limited the fortifications to four Martello towers and the fort itself. At the time, these fortifications were the strongest defences in Canada west of Quebec City. Neither the original nor the second Fort Henry was ever attacked. The fort was once referred to as the \\"Citadel of Upper Canada\\". Imperial (British) troops were deployed at the site of Fort Henry from 1813 to 1870. The Canadian Militia then garrisoned the fort until 1891. British garrisons included the Royal Regiment of Artillery, 24th Regiment of Foot, Black Watch, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, the Royal Welch Fusiliers and the Royal Canadian Rifle Regiment. Canadian units who used the fort include \\"A\\" and \\"B' Batteries of Garrison Artillery, and the 14th Battalion, Princess of Wales' Own Rifles. As relations with the United States continued to improve, the need for defences along the border ceased. Abandoned by the military, the fort fell into disrepair. Fort Henry temporarily held prisoners of the 1837‚Äì38 Rebellions. German, Austrian and Turkish prisoners of war and some civilians, including Ukrainian immigrants described as \\"enemy aliens\\" during Canada's first national internment operations of 1914‚Äì20 were also held at the fort. During the Second World War, the fort served as a prisoner of war camp for German Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine personnel. ==Present use== National Historic Site of Canada, and is administered presently by Parks Canada. In the 1930s, under the leadership of Ronald L. Way, restorations took place as part of a government work program during the Great Depression. \\"Old Fort Henry\\" became a living museum with the introduction of the Fort Henry Guard, and was opened on August 1, 1938. Fort Henry is administered by Parks Canada and operated by the St. Lawrence Parks Commission. Uniformed military interpreters known as the Fort Henry Guard staff the fort and conduct demonstrations of British military life and tours for visitors. Self-guided tours are also available. Other activities and demonstrations include historical reenactments of drills and battle tactics, the Garrison Parade, the Victorian School Room, and the Muster Parade, where young visitors are dressed in period uniforms and taught to march by a qualified member of the Guard. A Sunset Ceremony is held every Wednesday in July and August, where a full program of historic drill, music and artillery is presented. During evenings year-round a tour company conducts tours of the fort that highlight the fort's supposedly haunted past. Fort Henry has been designated as a National Historic Site of Canada, and in 2007 was included in the designation of the Rideau Canal as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. ==Legacy== On 30 June 1983 Canada Post issued 'Fort Henry, Ont.' in the \\"Forts Across Canada Series\\" (1983 and 1985).

A resident of Ottawa, Ontario, she was the New Democratic Party candidate for the riding of Ottawa South, a traditionally Liberal riding, in the 2004 federal election. In June 2015 she was appointed National Coordinator of the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group. ==Early life and education== Mazigh was born and raised in Tunisia and emigrated to Canada in 1991, at the age of 21. Mazigh has a Ph.D. in financial economics from McGill University and speaks Arabic, English and French fluently. In 2000, she started working for the University of Ottawa as a research assistant and later as a French-language instructor. She has stated that until 2002, her goal was to become a professor instead of a politician. ==The Maher Arar case and political activism== Mazigh first entered the public spotlight when her husband was deported to Syria in 2002 by the US government, on suspicion of terrorist links. He was tortured and held without charge for over a year before being returned to Canada. Mazigh joined with a number of human rights groups to press the government for his release. She appeared frequently in the media and was widely respected for her tireless efforts. Of her willingness to speak out, she has said that she was never afraid: \\"I had lost my life. I didn't have more to lose.\\" She was courted by the Liberal Party, but chose to stand as a candidate for the NDP. Mazigh had reportedly grown personally close with NDP foreign affairs critic, and former federal leader, Alexa McDonough, and she perceived the NDP as having been more emphatic than the other parties in calling for her husband's release. During a leaders' debate, NDP leader Jack Layton said that the party was proud to have her as a candidate. However, Mazigh's candidacy was unusual in that Mazigh personally does not support same-sex marriage; had she been elected she would have been the only NDP MP, alongside Desmond McGrath, NDP candidate in the riding of Random-Burin-St. George's in Newfoundland and Labrador, to oppose same-sex marriage by abstaining from a vote. While campaigning Mazigh said that she would abstain if Parliament was ever called to vote on the issue because of her reluctance to vote against a human rights issue.Ottawa Citizen. \\"Ottawa South candidates unlikely allies on gay marriage\\". June 5, 2004. pg. B.1 She also joined several individuals and groups in criticizing the NDP's more friendly attitude to Israel following the departure of Svend Robinson from the role of foreign affairs critic. She ran against but lost to Liberal candidate David McGuinty, the brother of Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty.

It is used in engineering, construction and other manual trades, such as printing. It is a dark green, gelatinous, thixotropic substance used to clean grease, oil, printer's ink, or general persistent, hydrophobic dirt from the skin. Swarfega is used by working a small amount into dry skin, then wiping or rinsing off. As with other such cleaners, it can be more effective than soap or other common cleansing products at removing such dirt; accordingly, Swarfega has become virtually ubiquitous in environments where this kind of dirt is common, such as garages and machine shops. ==History== Swarfega was invented in 1947 by Audley Bowdler Williamson (28 February 1916 - 21 November 2004), an industrial chemist from Heanor, Derbyshire.\\"Latest Wills\\", The Register, The Times, 19 August 2006, page 67. In 1941 he had founded a detergent-sales company, Deb Silkware Protection Ltd., based in Belper, to produce a formulation for extending the life of silk stockings. The name derived from \\"debutante\\", to signify the newness of the company and its products. The introduction of nylon stockings threatened to render it superfluous; however, Williamson purportedly suggested that mechanics had already found it useful for cleaning their hands. This may have been a myth encouraged to attract interest, but the product was reformulated and marketed as Swarfega, becoming the company's main product. (The company‚Äôs name had been changed to Deb Chemical Proprietaries Ltd.) Before Swarfega, mechanics used a variety of harsh home-brewed cleaners such as paraffin (kerosene), sand and petrol. These removed the skin's natural oils, leading to dry, cracked skin and the risk of occupational dermatitis. The effectiveness of Swarfega is due to the hydrophobic ingredients, including medium-chain (C9-C16) alkanes and cycloalkanes; in combination with an emulsifier (Trideceth-5 in current formulations). These are more efficient at solubilizing oil and grease than a detergent alone. In the UK, the word \\"Swarfega\\" may be used as a generic term for all similar cleaners, particularly if they have the same green jelly-like appearance as genuine Swarfega. According to the company website, the name derives from \\"swarf\\", a Derbyshire word for oil and grease, and \\"ega\\", as in \\"eager to clean\\". \\"Swarf\\" now commonly refers to the metal shavings and chips resulting from metalworking operations. The word did not originally mean oil or grease as Deb claimed, but rather the waste material from a grindstone (or similar material resulting from wear in a machine). This material would be a wet or oily mixture of grit abraded from the wheel and filings from the workpiece. Deb expanded its product range and has long offered a range of products either related to detergent ingredients, or sold to the same mechanical trades. Many of these such as Jizer, a water-rinsable degreaser used for washing mechanical parts rather than mechanics, first defined the original market for a new product that has now become commonplace. It was reported on 3 March 2010 that the manufacturer of Swarfega had been sold to an investment firm for ¬£325 million. In 2015 Deb Group Ltd. was acquired by SCJohnson. ==Competing products== Swarfega has lost the ubiquity it once had. There are now many competing products, such as Rozalex Two Fives and Rozalex Gauntlet. Deb have even repositioned their own \\"Suprega\\" and \\"Tufanega\\" for industrial use. This has an orange colour, emphasising its \\"natural\\" origins and citrus oil ingredients. A similar orange-coloured product called \\"Dirty Paws\\" was available in the UK in the 1950s but is no longer available. ==See also== * List of cleaning products == References == ==External links== *Company website Category:British brands Category:Cleaning products Category:Soap brands Category:Companies based in Derbyshire Category:Products introduced in 1947 ","title":"Swarfega"},{"id":"517718","text":"Interaction protocols are possible communication scenarios between individual agents in multi-agent systems.

As of the 2016 census, the population of the community was 257. The settlement of West Montrose is designated as a Cultural Heritage Landscape by the Township of Woolwich because of its history of pioneer settlement, its traditional bridges and the Old Order Mennonite culture. Section 4.4 Located in West Montrose are single family homes, a church, a small store, a bed-and-breakfast and the West Montrose Covered Bridge, a local tourist attraction. ==History== United Church and Cemetery, established 1907 West Montrose was made up of Lots Seventy, Seventy-one, and Seventy-four of the Germany Company survey in Woolwich Township. Land was purchased from the German Company sometime after 1807 by Daniel Erb, David Eby and Christian Stauffer in 1807. However it was not settled until about 1850. A few Scots arrived at that time, including Andrew L. Anderson from Montrose, Scotland who bought land in the 1850s; presumably he named the village Montrose after his home town. The word West was added in about 1865 to differentiate the community from Montrose in Welland County. Section: West Montrose By the early 1850s, other Mennonites from Pennsylvania began arriving to this part of Waterloo County, settling in nearby St. Jacobs and also on farms surrounding West Montrose. They were the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch. The word \\"Dutch\\" does not refer to the Netherlands but is a misnomer for Deitsch or Deutsch (German). Isaac Swope settled here in 1858 and built a log cabin. Many others owned land here but did not actually settle; they sold it later to other settlers. Jacob Benner, opened a woolen mill in 1858 and a sawmill in 1861. By that time, the village had a station of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The first church was built in 1862 by the United Brethren congregation which included Methodists, Baptists, and Mennonites. The first school was built in 1865. By 1869, West Montrose had a post office, a population of about 100, a lumber yard, a gunsmith, a carpenter, a hotel and keeper, a stock dealer, a post office, a general merchant, several coopers, and a minister, according to historical records. Today, several 19th Century buildings bear the Heritage designation from the Township. There was no railway connection until 1907. By then, the population had dropped from a peak of 200 in 1890 to a mere 50. Also in 1907, the current United Church and cemetery were built; the property was historically designated by Woolwich Township in May 2014. The horse and buggy was the primary transportation among the Mennonites for decades. Today, Old Order Mennonites still use this mode of transportation. In 2011, residents of West Montrose were involved in a project to prevent Capital Paving from starting a gravel pit within 180 metres from the covered bridge at core of the community. The company had announced in 2008 that it planned to dig up an estimated 2.6 million tonnes of sand and gravel that sits \\"underneath a cornfield in the Mennonite area\\". The volunteers of the Bridge Keepers group succeeded thanks in part to reliance on a study by the University of Waterloo's heritage resources centre about the cultural heritage of the landscape. When Woolwich Township amended its official plan, designating the lands around West Montrose as a Cultural Heritage Landscape, Capital Paving withdrew its application. A celebration was held in September 2013; it was attended by the Chair of Waterloo Region, Ken Seiling, whose comments indicated praise for the role played by the community in preventing the gravel pit. ==Geography== Winterbourne Mennonite Meetinghouse and Cemetery In addition to the core of the settlement, the area defined as West Montrose on the Township's Cultural Heritage Landscape map is quite large, including the Winterbourne Mennonite Meetinghouse and Cemetery. On maps and rural addresses, the West Montrose area also extends quite far from the core, into an area that some might consider to be Winterbourne, Ontario. The Grand River flows through West Montrose. ==Demographics== The settlement and the surrounding countryside are noted by The Region of Waterloo Official Plan as home to a large Mennonite community. Together with nearby St. Jacobs and Elmira West Montrose lies in the centre of an area of Woolwich Township which has a historically large settlement of Old Order Mennonite families. The Mennonites are noted for their traditional customs, dress and use of horse and buggies. ==Attractions== The West Montrose Covered Bridge over the Grand River was constructed in 1880-1881 by John and Benjamin Bear. The only covered bridge remaining in Ontario, it was designated a Provincial Historic Site in 1960. In 2007, the Township of Woolwich designated it as being of cultural heritage value or interest under the Ontario Heritage Act. It was listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places in 2007. This is one of under 200 covered bridges still surviving in Canada. ==Notable people== * W. T.

It is measured from (the former LC&DR; platforms also being measured from ). It is served by London Overground services, with a limited service to under the control of the London Rail division of Transport for London, and a daily Southeastern service to once a day. It is close to tube station, and interchange between the two is counted as an Out of Station Interchange on Oyster, so that users are charged for only one journey, rather than two separate journeys. ==History== The station was opened on 25 August 1862 by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) as Clapham, renamed Clapham & North Stockwell from May 1863. The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) route (current Atlantic Line, often referred to by its old name of South London Line) was authorized by an 1863 Act of Parliament and parallels the original 1862 LCDR route eastwards between Wandsworth Road and Brixton and beyond. Until the 1923 grouping all lines through the station were owned by the LCDR, with two leased to the LBSCR for their sole use. A 1908 Railway Clearing House map of lines around Clapham High Street The original 'south' 1862 line was leased to the LBSCR in 1867 and the LCDR used the new 'north' 1867 lines. The existing platforms, together with the Grade II listed 1862 station building, form the original station. These platforms were used by the LCDR from 1862 to 1867, and the LBSCR until the 1923 grouping.London Railway Record July 2012The London Brighton and South Coast Railway Vol 2 JT Howard Turner The 1867 LCDR platforms were closed on 3 April 1916 and subsequently demolished.Clapham High Street Transport Urban Design The eastbound platform's station building was destroyed by a bomb in 1944. The LCDR 1866 station building (on the north side) was partially demolished in 1924 after the 1916 closure, finally being demolished in the late 1970s. In British Rail days, access to the platforms was via a subway on the north side.London Railway Record July 2012 Page 103 The original south 1862 building was sold, being initially used as a furniture warehouse before being redeveloped in 2003 as residential accommodation. It is now Grade II listed. The platform had a full-length canopy that was demolished in the late 1970s. The line between and was electrified at 6600 V AC on the overhead system on 1 December 1909. It was re-electrified in 1928 using third rail 660 V DC and the overhead was dismantled.

In February 2017, this service was running with one early morning train a day in each direction from Monday to Friday only. Otherwise, Southeastern trains calling at Denmark Hill and Victoria in normal service can pass through the platform lines without stopping, but can be diverted (via Crofton Road Junction between Peckham Rye and Denmark Hill stations) over the non-platform lines when required. Until December 2012, Southern also ran a service from to Clapham High Street but this was later cut back to from Kensington Olympia before being withdrawn completely on 17 June 2013. As a nominal replacement for the former Southern-operated South London line route to/from , a single train in each direction to/from Highbury & Islington was maintained after the December 2012 timetable change (leaving Battersea Park at 06.17 and returning as the 22.17 Highbury & Islington to Battersea Park).

It is the largest German war cemetery in Normandy and contains the remains of over 21,200 German military personnel. Initially, American and German dead were buried in adjacent fields but American dead were later disinterred and either returned to the US or re-interred at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial . After the war over 12,000 German dead were moved from approximately 1,400 field burials across Normandy to La Cambe. The cemetery is maintained and managed by the voluntary German War Graves Commission (Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr√§berf√ºrsorge). ==History== La Cambe was originally the site of a battlefield cemetery created on 10 June 1944 by the 607th Quartermaster Graves Registration Company during the Battle of Normandy. American and German soldiers, sailors and airmen were buried in two adjacent fields. Following the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, the American Battle Monuments Commission began exhuming the remains of American servicemen and transferring them in accordance with the wishes of their families. Beginning in 1945, the Americans transferred two-thirds of their fallen from this site back to the United States while the remainder were re-interred at the new permanent American Cemetery and Memorial at Colleville-sur-Mer, which overlooks the Omaha Beach landing site. Due to the rapid advance of the Allies during the latter stage of the Normandy campaign, German war dead were scattered over a wide area, many of them buried in isolated field graves or small battlefield cemeteries. In the years following the war, the German War Graves Commission (Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr√§berf√ºrsorge) sought to establish six main German cemeteries in the Normandy area. ==Formation== La Cambe, as an existing site of German war dead with over 8,000 interments, was already informally cared for by the German War Graves Commission, was a natural choice for one of the six formal sites. After the signing in 1954 of the Franco-German Treaty on War Graves, La Cambe was formally cared for, allowing the remains of 12,000 German soldiers to be moved in from 1,400 locations in the French departments of Manche, Calvados and the Orne. In 1954, the Franco-German War Graves Agreement ratified that the Reinternment Commission of the Volksbund could move German bodies from field graves and village cemeteries. During the removals many previously anonymous German soldiers were identified. In 1958, the youth section of the Volksbund drew people from seven nations to work on the cemetery. Layout and landscaping of the site began immediately after formal handover, with a large central tumulus (or kamaradengraben), flanked by two statues and topped by a large dark cross in basalt lava, which marks the resting place for 207 unknown and 89 identified German soldiers, interred together in a mass grave.(de)Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr√§berf√ºrsorge e. V. (Hrsg.): Normandie. Deutsche Kriegsgr√§berst√§tten. Kassel. p. 10 (Brochure with short comments on Normandy's war cemeteries) The tumulus is surrounded by 49 rectangular grave fields with up to 400 graves each. On the large grass areas graves are identified by flat grave markers.√úbersichtsplan der Deutschen Kriegsgr√§berst√§tte La Cambe La Cambe was officially inaugurated as a war cemetery in September 1961 [(along with the German cemeteries at Marigny, Orglandes and Saint-D√©sir-de-Lisieux). Special trains were organised to bring former comrades and family members to La Cambe. Since that date, the remains of more than 700 soldiers found on battlefields across Normandy have been re-interred at La Cambe. The sign in front of the cemetery reads as follows: ==Notable graves== Grave of Michael Wittmann with the crew of Tiger 007, La Cambe Cemetery, France. The majority of the German war dead buried at La Cambe fell between June 6 (D-Day landings) and August 20, 1944 (the end of the Battle of Normandy) and their ages range from 16 to 72. Casualties of the war in Normandy are still being found after some 75 years, although formal burial ceremonies are less frequent nowadays. In total, as of July 2008, there are the remains of 21,222 German soldiers, sailors and airmen buried at La Cambe. The buried include: *Generalmajor Sigismund-Helmut von Dawans, killed in the RAF raid on the Panzergruppe West's GHQ. *SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Adolf Diekmann: the most senior officer at the massacre of Oradour-sur-Glane on 10 June 1944. Ordered to be court martialled, he was killed in battle in Normandy on 29 June. *SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Michael Wittmann: Tiger tank ace, who along with his tank crew was informally buried in an unmarked site following their deaths on 8 August 1944. Rediscovered in 1983, the crew was re-interred at La Cambe. ==Information Center== Since the mid-1990s, there has been an Information Center on the site. It commemorates the memory of the losses of Operation Overlord, when in summer 1944 more than 100,000 people died: American, British, German, French, Canadian, Poles and members of other nations. Also at least 14,000 French civilians died. Human fates and reconciliation are special themes. Visitors can also view a permanent exhibition about the German War Graves Commission and have access to a database to locate the graves of dead German soldiers. A peace-garden with 1,200 maple-trees from gifts symbolizes that peace ought to grow.(de)Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr√§berf√ºrsorge e. V. (Hrsg.): Normandie. Deutsche Kriegsgr√§berst√§tten. Kassel. p. 10-11. (Brochure with short comments on Normandie's war cemeteries) ==Volunteer maintenance== Unlike the American and Commonwealth War Graves Commissions, the German Commission is entirely voluntary and relies on gifts and collections to further its work. During the summer months one may see international school children tending the graves. They volunteer to work with the Volksbund during their school holidays and visit American and German war cemeteries, memorials, sites of the invasion and take part in the memorial ceremony with veterans and the mayor of La Cambe.Sophia K√ºhn, Pauline Schurund, Lisa Thuriam: Eine wundervolle Erfahrung (Tales of some workcamp participants) ==German cemeteries in Normandy== There are six German war cemeteries graveyards in Normandy with La Cambe being the largest: * Champigny-St. Andr√© (19,836) * Mont-de-Huisnes (11,956). * Orglandes (10,152) * Marigny (11,169) * St. D√©sir-de-Lisieux (3,735) ==See also== *List of military cemeteries in Normandy ==References== ==External links== * Website of Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr√§berf√ºrsorge (German war graves Commission and details on La Cambe German cemetery) * ANEG:Cimeti√®res allemands en France.

The chromed layer can be decorative, provide corrosion resistance, ease cleaning procedures, or increase surface hardness. Sometimes, a less expensive imitator of chrome may be used for aesthetic purposes. ==Process== Chrome plating a component typically includes these stages: * Degreasing to remove heavy soiling * Manual cleaning to remove all residual traces of dirt and surface impurities * Various pretreatments depending on the substrate * Placement into the chrome plating vat, where it is allowed to warm to solution temperature * Application of plating current for the required time to attain the desired thickness There are many variations to this process, depending on the type of substrate being plated. Different substrates need different etching solutions, such as hydrochloric, hydrofluoric, and sulfuric acids. Ferric chloride is also popular for the etching of nimonic alloys. Sometimes the component enters the chrome plating vat while electrically live. Sometimes the component has a conforming anode made from lead/tin or platinized titanium. A typical hard chrome vat plates at about per hour. Various finishing and buffing processes are used in preparing components for decorative chrome plating. The chrome plating chemicals are very toxic. Disposal of chemicals is regulated in most countries. Some common industry specifications governing the chrome plating process are AMS 2460, AMS 2406, and MIL-STD-1501. ==Hexavalent chromium== Hexavalent chromium plating, also known as hex-chrome, Cr6+, and chrome (VI) plating, uses chromium trioxide (also known as chromic anhydride) as the main ingredient. Hexavalent chromium plating solution is used for decorative and hard plating, along with bright dipping of copper alloys, chromic acid anodizing, and chromate conversion coating. A typical hexavalent chromium plating process is: (1) activation bath, (2) chromium bath, (3) rinse, and (4) rinse. The activation bath is typically a tank of chromic acid with a reverse current run through it. This etches the work-piece surface and removes any scale. In some cases the activation step is done in the chromium bath. The chromium bath is a mixture of chromium trioxide (CrO3) and sulfuric acid (sulfate, SO4), the ratio of which varies greatly between 75:1 to 250:1 by weight. This results in an extremely acidic bath (pH 0). The temperature and current density in the bath affect the brightness and final coverage. For decorative coating the temperature ranges from , but for hard coating it ranges from . Temperature is also dependent on the current density, because a higher current density requires a higher temperature. Finally, the whole bath is agitated to keep the temperature steady and achieve a uniform deposition. ===Disadvantages=== One functional disadvantage of hexavalent chromium plating is low cathode efficiency, which results in bad throwing power. This means it leaves a non-uniform coating, with more on edges and less in inside corners and holes. To overcome this problem the part may be over-plated and ground to size, or auxiliary anodes may be used around the hard-to-plate areas. From a health standpoint, hexavalent chromium is the most toxic form of chromium. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency regulates it heavily. The EPA lists hexavalent chromium as a hazardous air pollutant because it is a human carcinogen, a \\"priority pollutant\\" under the Clean Water Act, and a \\"hazardous constituent\\" under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Due to its low cathodic efficiency and high solution viscosity, a toxic mist of water and hexavalent chromium is released from the bath. Wet scrubbers are used to control these emissions. The discharge from the wet scrubbers is treated to precipitate the chromium from the solution because it cannot remain in the waste water. Maintaining a bath surface tension less than 35 dynes/cm requires a frequent cycle of treating the bath with a wetting agent and confirming the effect on surface tension. Traditionally, surface tension is measured with a stalagmometer. This method is, however, tedious and suffers from inaccuracy (errors up to 22 dynes/cm have been reported), and is dependent on the user's experience and capabilities. Additional toxic waste created from hexavalent chromium baths include lead chromates, which form in the bath because lead anodes are used. Barium is also used to control the sulfate concentration, which leads to the formation of barium sulfate (BaSO4). ==Trivalent chromium== Trivalent chromium plating, also known as tri-chrome, Cr3+, and chrome (III) plating, uses chromium sulfate or chromium chloride as the main ingredient. Trivalent chromium plating is an alternative to hexavalent chromium in certain applications and thicknesses (e.g. decorative plating). A trivalent chromium plating process is similar to the hexavalent chromium plating process, except for the bath chemistry and anode composition. There are three main types of trivalent chromium bath configurations: *A chloride- or sulfate-based electrolyte bath using graphite or composite anodes, plus additives to prevent the oxidation of trivalent chromium to the anodes. *A sulfate-based bath that uses lead anodes surrounded by boxes filled with sulfuric acid (known as shielded anodes), which keeps the trivalent chromium from oxidizing at the anodes. *A sulfate-based bath that uses insoluble catalytic anodes, which maintains an electrode potential that prevents oxidation. The trivalent chromium-plating process can plate the workpieces at a similar temperature, rate and hardness, as compared to hexavalent chromium. Plating thickness ranges from . === Advantages and disadvantages === The functional advantages of trivalent chromium are higher cathode efficiency and better throwing power. Better throwing power means better production rates. Less energy is required because of the lower current densities required. The process is more robust than hexavalent chromium because it can withstand current interruptions. From a health standpoint, trivalent chromium is intrinsically less toxic than hexavalent chromium. Because of the lower toxicity it is not regulated as strictly, which reduces overhead costs. Other health advantages include higher cathode efficiencies, which lead to less chromium air emissions; lower concentration levels, resulting in less chromium waste and anodes that do not decompose. One of the disadvantages when the process was first introduced was that decorative customers disapproved of the color differences. Companies now use additives to adjust the color. In hard coating applications, the corrosion resistance of thicker coatings is not quite as good as it is with hexavalent chromium. The cost of the chemicals is greater, but this is usually offset by greater production rates and lower overhead costs. In general, the process must be controlled more closely than in hexavalent chromium plating, especially with respect to metallic impurities. This means processes that are hard to control, such as barrel plating, are much more difficult using a trivalent chromium bath. ==TypesDecorative=== Art Deco portfolio with chrome-plated cover, ca 1925 ' is designed to be aesthetically pleasing and durable. Thicknesses range from , however they are usually between . The chromium plating is usually applied over bright nickel plating. Typical base materials include steel, aluminium, plastic, copper alloys, and zinc alloys. Decorative chrome plating is also very corrosion resistant and is often used on car parts, tools and kitchen utensils. ===Hard=== Hard chrome plating ', also known as ' or ', is used to reduce friction, improve durability through abrasion tolerance and wear resistance in general, minimize galling or seizing of parts, expand chemical inertness to include a broader set of conditions (such as oxidation resistance), and bulking material for worn parts to restore their original dimensions. It is very hard, measuring between 65 and 69 HRC (also based on the base metal's hardness). Hard chrome tends to be thicker than decorative chrome, with standard thicknesses in nonsalvage applications ranging from , but it can be an order of magnitude thicker for extreme wear resistance requirements, in such cases or thicker provides optimal results. Unfortunately, such thicknesses emphasize the limitations of the process, which are overcome by plating extra thickness then grinding down and lapping to meet requirements or to improve the overall aesthetics of the \\"chromed\\" piece. Increasing plating thickness amplifies surface defects and roughness in proportional severity, because hard chrome does not have a leveling effect.. Pieces that are not ideally shaped in reference to electric field geometries (nearly every piece sent in for plating, except spheres and egg shaped objects) require even thicker plating to compensate for non-uniform deposition, and much of it is wasted when grinding the piece back to desired dimensions. Modern \\"engineered coatings\\" do not suffer such drawbacks, which often price hard chrome out due to labor costs alone. Hard chrome replacement technologies outperform hard chrome in wear resistance, corrosion resistance, and cost. Rockwell hardness 80 is not extraordinary for such materials. Using spray deposition, uniform thickness that often requires no further polishing or machining is a standard feature of modern engineered coatings. These coatings are often composites of polymers, metals, and ceramic powders or fibers as proprietary embodiments protected by patents or as trade secrets, and thus are usually known by brand names. Hard chromium plating is subject to different types of quality requirements depending on the application; for instance, the plating on hydraulic piston rods are tested for corrosion resistance with a salt spray test. ==Automotive use== Most bright decorative items affixed to cars are referred to as \\"chrome\\", meaning steel that has undergone several plating processes to endure the temperature changes and weather that a car is subject to outdoors (although the term then passed on to cover any similar-looking shiny decorative auto parts, including silver plastic trim pieces in casual terminology). Triple plating is the most expensive and durable process, which involves plating the steel first with copper and then nickel before the chromium plating is applied. Prior to the application of chrome in the 1920s, nickel electroplating was used. In the short production run prior to the US entry into the Second World War, the government banned plating to save chromium and automobile manufacturers painted the decorative pieces in a complementary color. In the last years of the Korean War, the US contemplated banning chrome in favor of several cheaper processes (such as plating with zinc and then coating with shiny plastic). In 2007, a Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) was issued banning several toxic substances for use in the automotive industry in Europe, including hexavalent chromium, which is used in chrome plating. However, chrome plating is metal and contains no hexavalent chromium after it is rinsed, so chrome plating is not banned. ==See also== *Stainless steel *Metal toxicity ==References== ==Further reading== *SAE AMS 2406 * SAE AMS 2438 * SAE AMS 2460 - Plating, Chromium Category:Automotive styling features Category:Chromium Category:Corrosion prevention Category:Metal plating th:‡πÇ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏° ","title":"Chrome plating"},{"id":"517740","text":"Cambes may refer to several communes in France: * Cambes, Gironde, in the Gironde d√©partement * Cambes, Lot, in the Lot d√©partement * Cambes, Lot-et- Garonne, in the Lot-et-Garonne d√©partement * Cambes-en-Plaine, in the Calvados d√©partement ","title":"Cambes"},{"id":"517741","text":"ETO may refer to: * ETO (gene) * Electro-technical officer * Emitter turn off thyristor * Engineer to order * English Touring Opera * Ethylene oxide * ETO Park, a multi-use stadium in Gy≈ër, Hungary * European Theater of Operations * Gy≈ëri ETO KC, a Hungarian women's handball club * Efforts to Outcomes, software produced by Social Solutions ==See also== * Eto, a Japanese name ","title":"ETO"},{"id":"517746","text":"Cambes-en-Plaine is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. ==Population== ==See also== *Communes of the Calvados department ==References== Category:Communes of Calvados (department) Category:Calvados communes articles needing translation from French Wikipedia ","title":"Cambes-en-Plaine"},{"id":"517747","text":"Cambremer is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

He was the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons from 2007 to 2008 and again from 2011 to 2015. ==Biography== Born in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Van Loan is of Estonian heritage on his maternal side. His mother and grandparents fled Estonia during World War II and immigrated to Canada. Van Loan was educated at the University of Toronto and York University and holds a bachelor's degree, a Masters in International Relations and an additional master's degree in geography. Van Loan graduated from York University's Osgoode Hall Law School and was admitted to the Bar of Ontario in 1989. Prior to his election to public office, Van Loan was a partner and Chair of the Planning and Development Law Group at the law firm of Fraser Milner Casgrain LLP in Toronto, Ontario. Van Loan was also an Adjunct Professor of Planning at the University of Toronto. He served as president of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario during Mike Harris' term of office and then of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada for a brief period. He resigned from the latter post in 2000 after a series of disagreements with its leader, Joe Clark. Van Loan was a key figure in the unsuccessful attempt to convince Premier of New Brunswick Bernard Lord to run for the leadership of the federal Progressive Conservatives in late 2002. He was a key organizer in the \\"Yes\\" Campaign, led by Tory Leader Peter MacKay, to ratify the merger of the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance into the Conservative Party of Canada. Van Loan then again attempted to recruit Lord to run for the leadership of the new party, and again was unsuccessful. In an article from January 24, 2008, Van Loan was classified as one of \\"Harper's 12\\", the twelve most influential people in Ottawa, by Maclean's Magazine. Other cabinet ministers included were Jim Prentice, John Baird, and Jim Flaherty. On October 30, 2008, Jay Hill replaced Van Loan as Government House Leader and Steven John Fletcher took over the Minister for Democratic Reform post. Van Loan became the Minister for Public Safety, as Stockwell Day became the Minister of International Trade. On these changes Don Martin wrote: \\"The House of Commons might become a slightly friendlier place now that Peter Van Loan has lost the job of Question Period cheap shot specialist to become Public Safety Minister, a good move that seems to back Harper‚Äôs pledge to play nice with others during the upcoming session.\\" On January 19, 2010, Prime Minister Stephen Harper designated Van Loan as the next Minister of International Trade. It has been suggested that Harper removed the MP from his post as Public Safety Minister because of dissatisfaction with his leadership pertaining to the correctional system. On December 5, 2012, on the floor of the House of Commons Van Loan was involved in an altercation with NDP Leader Tom Mulcair. Van Loan crossed the aisle and used an inappropriate word during the confrontation. He was restrained by Defence Minister Peter MacKay. Van Loan was one of thirteen Canadians banned from travelling to Russia under retaliatory sanctions imposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in March 2014. In response to the ban, Van Loan said that the ban was \\"not of serious consequence\\" and that he would \\"not be losing sleep over being on the list.\\" On July 29, 2018, Van Loan announced that he would be retiring from politics. He retired from the House of Commons on September 30. ==Electoral record== ==References* Peter Van Loan on how Ottawa can help businesses abroad * Van Loan 'erred' in prison transfer requests * Come to Canada!: Van Loan Category:1963 births Category:University of Toronto alumni Category:Members of the 28th Canadian Ministry Category:Members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Ontario Category:Conservative Party of Canada MPs Category:Lawyers in Ontario Category:York University alumni Category:People from Niagara Falls, Ontario Category:People from the Regional Municipality of York Category:Canadian people of Estonian descent Category:Living people Category:Recipients of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana, 2nd Class Category:Osgoode Hall Law School alumni Category:Presidents of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario ","title":"Peter Van Loan"},{"id":"517786","text":"Canteloup may refer to communes in France: * Canteloup, Calvados, in the Calvados d√©partement * Canteloup, Manche, in the Manche d√©partement ==See also== *Cantaloupe (disambiguation) ","title":"Canteloup"},{"id":"517789","text":"Worcestershire Wildlife Trust is one of 46 wildlife trusts throughout the United Kingdom.

The area was part of the Jesuitic Sesmaria, where the Jesuits built a cemetery and a church consecrated to Saint Francis Xavier. The name of the neighborhood derives from the Latin word caritas, meaning charity, which is inscribed on the church's door. In the 18th century, a landowner donated to the Saint Joseph Seminar, in Rio de Janeiro, the piece of land that came to be the Jurujuba Farm and upon which a mansion, known as Casar√£o (big house) was built. In 1853, the Saint Isabel Naval Hospital was opened and originally run by the sanitarist Francisco de Paula C√¢ndido, in whose honor the neighborhood was first named \\"Paula C√¢ndido\\". The hospital's function was to isolate the sick people that came with the ships that docked in Rio de Janeiro's harbor. Later, the hospital was turned into a safe house to receive children that had been infected with tuberculosis known as Prevent√≥rio, after which the local beach came to be known. In the 1940s, an aeroclub was built in the area. It still exists and can handle small, private planes and helicopter landings and take-offs. The neighborhood's limits are: the waters of the Guanabara Bay, the neighborhood of Piratininga (at the Vira√ß√£o Hill) and the neighborhoods of Jurujuba and S√£o Francisco (contiguous boundary).

Retrieved 2015-2-2. ==Life== In his only surviving poem, which was written in Fleet Prison, he claims that he has been convicted by false information and thus wrongly accused, though it is not known what the accusation was.The poem has the title \\"The Knight and the Lady\\"; it is in BL Add. MS. 31922 and is no. 20 in The Nw Oxford Book of English Verse, 1972. He may not be the composer of the music found in the Eton Choirbook, which may alternatively be by his father, also named William Cornysh, who died c. 1502. The younger Cornysh had a prestigious employment at court, as Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal; and being responsible for the musical and dramatic entertainments at court and during important diplomatic events such as at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520; and visits to and from the courts of France and the Holy Roman Empire, which he fulfilled until his death. He died in 1523, his birth date unknown. ==Musical works== The Eton Choirbook (compiled c. 1490‚Äì1502) contains several works by Cornysh: Salve Regina (found in several other sources as well), Stabat mater, Ave Maria mater Dei, Gaude virgo mater Christi, and a lost Gaude flore virginali. The Caius Choirbook (c. 1518‚Äì1520) contains a Magnificat. Other sources refer to lost works: three Masses, another Stabat mater, another Magnificat, Altissimi potentia, and Ad te purissima virgo. He also produced secular vocal music and the notable English sacred anthem Woefully arrayed. There is also an extended and somewhat erudite three-part instrumental work based on steps of the hexachord and its mutations, Fa la sol, and another untitled piece. These secular works are found in the so-called Fayrfax Book (copied in 1501). If all the earlier sacred music is by the same Cornysh (junior) as the secular music then he was a composer of some breadth, although not without parallel. The works by \\"Browne\\" in the Fayrfax Book display a similar difference in style to those by the John Browne of the Eton Choirbook, but are probably the same composer nonetheless. The occurrence of Cornysh's Magnificat (in the same style as the Eton works) falls nearly two decades after the death of the older Cornysh, and thus is far more likely the work of the younger Cornysh, by then by far one of the country's most important musicians. Furthermore, the works by Cornysh in the Eton Choirbook seem to be amongst the most \\"modern\\" in that collection. While they do not pursue the simplifying approach of Fayrfax (an almost exact contemporary of Cornysh junior, and fellow at Court and Chapel), and remain in a more old-fashioned florid melodic style, they adopt proto- madrigalian manners (for example in the setting of words like \\"clamorosa\\", \\"crucifige\\" and \\"debellandum\\" in the Stabat mater) and have a particularly developed sense of tonal movement (for example, in the Stabat mater, the closing \\"Amen\\" features deliberate use of F sharps as leading notes to give a sense of tonal cadence into G, or employing E flats at \\"Sathanam\\" to give a tonal cadence onto B flat, emphasizing the \\"strong\\" nature of the text at that moment, employing the bass-movement V-I), as well as adopting a more modern sense of the expressive appoggiatura in melodic shapes and in bringing out the stresses of the Latin by such devices (for example, again the Stabat mater, the use of appoggiaturas in the Bassus part to express \\"ContriSTANtem et doLENtem\\" in the first few measures, and again at \\"Contemplari doLENtem cum filio?\\"), and the use of purely rhetorical gestures (such as the exclamation \\"O\\" by full choir in the middle of the soloists' section starting the Stabat mater). It is not impossible to see in these mannerisms the work of a great dramatist. The works of John Browne are given pride of place in the Eton manuscript. It seems that in the examples given above that Cornysh may have been emulating Browne (his own Stabat mater features a celebrated madrigalian setting of \\"crucifige\\", and his O Maria salvatoris Mater features the exclamation \\"En\\" (=\\"Oh\\") in a similar way to Cornysh's interjection in his Stabat mater). Thus it seems that the Eton Cornysh was writing after Browne, and this would place his work amongst the later ones of the Eton Choirbook: additionally the approaches do not seem to be those of an older man, being much more suggestive of a young and original composer. The traditional ascription of all the works to Cornysh junior is the one more generally accepted. However, the possibility that the Eton works are the works of a generation earlier remains, and has interesting implications if true. The musicologist David Skinner, in the booklet to The Cardinall's Musick's CD Latin Church Music, puts forward the proposition that the pre-Reformation Latin church music (including the works in the Eton manuscript) was composed by the father, whilst the son is the composer of the pieces in English and the courtly songs. ==References== ==Further reading== *Scholes, Percy (1970) The Oxford Companion to Music; 10th ed.

It also paid many porters well enough to have a middle-income lifestyle and prominence within their own communities. Working for the Pullman Company was, however, less glamorous than the image the company promoted. Porters depended on tips for much of their income and thus on the generosity of white passengers who often referred to all porters as \\"George\\", the first name of George Pullman, the company's founder (see also Society for the Prevention of Calling Sleeping Car Porters \\"George\\"). The company required porters to travel 11,000 miles, nearly 400 hours, per month to earn a basic wage. In 1934, porters on regular assignments worked an average of over 73 hours per week and earned 27.8 cents an hour while workers in manufacturing jobs averaged under 37 hours per week and earned an average of 54.8 cents per hour. They spent roughly ten percent of their time in unpaid \\"preparatory\\" and \\"terminal\\" set- up and clean-up duties, and they had to pay for their food, lodging, and uniforms, which could consume up to half of their wages. They were also charged whenever their passengers stole a towel or a water pitcher. Porters could ride at half fare on their days off ‚Äî but not on Pullman coaches. They were not eligible for promotion to conductor, a job reserved for whites, despite frequently performing some of the conductor duties. The company had squelched any efforts they made to organize during the first decades of the 20th century by isolating or firing union leaders. Like many other large companies of the time, the company employed spies to keep tabs on their employees; in extreme cases, company agents assaulted union organizers. When 500 porters met in Harlem on August 25, 1925, they decided to make another effort to organize. During this meeting, they secretly launched their campaign, choosing Randolph, not employed by Pullman and thus beyond retaliation, to lead the effort. The union chose a motto to sum up their resentment over the working conditions: \\"Fight or Be Slaves\\". ==Organizing the union== A Pullman Porter, photographed in Chicago in 1943. The AFL, despite touting equal rights for workers, was actively discriminatory.Santino, J. (1983). Miles of Smiles, Years of Struggle: The Negotiation of Black Occupational Identity Through Personal Experience Narrative. The Journal of American Folklore, 96 (382) pp 393-412. Furthermore, and foremost, white supremacy remained entrenched in almost every institution that existed in the US, and these racist beliefs, both subtle and overt, precluded the white labor movement from recognizing the black workers or their organized fronts. In the 1920s, as some elements within the AFL began to lower these barriers, while groups as diverse as the Urban League, the Socialist Party of America and Communist Party began to focus on the rights of black workers. Randolph himself was a prominent member of the Socialist Party. From its inception, the BSCP fought to open doors in the organized labor movement in the US for black workers, even though it faced staunch opposition and blatant racism. As BSCP co-founder and First Vice President Milton Price Webster, put it, \\"...any time we have an American institution composed of white people there is prejudice in it....In America, if we should stay out of everything that's prejudiced we wouldn't be in anything.\\" As early as 1900, efforts were put forth by various collectives of Pullman porters to organize the porters into a union, each effort having been crushed by Pullman. In 1925, in the early days of organizing the BSP union, Randolph was invited, by BSCP union organizer Ashley Totten, to address the Porters Athletic Association, in New York City. Exhibiting a sound understanding of the plight of the black worker and the need for a genuine labor union, Randolph was asked to undertake the job of organizing the porters into a bona fide labor union. The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters was launched on the night of August 25, 1925. Key to the success of the union was to galvanize membership by way of a national membership drive, with three of the Pullman company's largest terminals being most important ‚Äî Chicago, Oakland, and St. Louis. The man to see in Chicago was Milton Price Webster. He was the son of enslaved parents from Clarksville, Tennessee, who, after successfully purchasing their own freedom, eventually moved to Chicago, where Webster was raised. A former Pullman Porter of twenty years, and a devoted husband (Louie Elizabeth Harris) and father of three, Webster had been fired by the company for attempting to organize porters in the Railroad Men's Benevolent Association. Webster was a man of strong convictions. As a Lincoln Republican and a tenured, highly respected captain of Chicago's Sixth Ward black Republican machine, Webster was a stern, but gregarious leader of men who was well connected throughout the Chicago politic. Not the orator of Randolph's skill, and not college educated, Webster devoured books and the news of the day, and was a stalwart back room negotiator. He captured his audience with his command of the subject, his keen wit and sharp intellect, and his commitment to alleviating the struggles of the working man. A Pullman Porter making the bed of an upper berth, 1942. Although skeptical of Randolph's socialist affiliations, on the recommendations of fellow union organizer John C. Mills of Chicago, Webster facilitated a series of public meetings for Randolph and Chicago porters, nightly for two weeks. At the initial meeting, after hearing Randolph speak, Webster turned to Mills, agreeing that Randolph was the man to head the organization of the new union. For the next two weeks, nightly meetings were held, with two speakers campaigning for Chicago chapter membership‚ÄîMilton Webster opening and A. Philip Randolph closing‚Äîeffectively launching the Chicago division of the Brotherhood. The Pullman Company's response was to denounce, with support from the ministers and African American newspapers whom it had cultivated (or bought), the new union as an outside entity motivated by foreign ideologies, while sponsoring its own company union, variously known as the Employee Representation Plan or the Pullman Porters and Maids Protective Association, to represent its loyal employees. Local authorities, such as Boss Crump in Memphis, Tennessee in some cases helped the company by interfering with or banning BSCP meetings. For the first several years of its existence, the union continued fighting the Pullman Company, its allies in the black community, the white power structure, and rival unions within the AFL that were hostile to its members' job claims. The BSCP also tried to involve the federal government in its fight with the Pullman Company: on September 7, 1927 the brotherhood filed a case with the Interstate Commerce Commission, requesting an investigation of Pullman rates, porters' wages, tipping practices, and other matters related to wages and working conditions; the ICC ruled that it did not have jurisdiction. While it had organized roughly half of the porters within the company, the union was seemingly no closer to obtaining recognition than it had been in 1925. By 1928 BSCP leaders decided that the only way to force the issue was to strike the company. The leadership was, however, divided on what a strike could accomplish: some rank-and-file leaders wanted to use the strike as a show of strength and an organizing tool, while Randolph was more cautious, hoping to use the threat of a strike as the lever to get the federal National Mediation Board established pursuant to the Railway Labor Act to bring the Pullman Company to the table while mobilizing support from supporters outside the industry. After secretly meeting with the Pullman Company, the NMB refused to follow precedent it had set in the case of a group of white railroad workers, and refused to act on behalf of the BSCP. The NMB argued that the brotherhood was incapable of disrupting the Pullman sleeping car service. Although the union had voted for a strike, the Pullman Company convinced the NMB that the union did not have the strength in numbers or resources to pull it off. In July 1928, the NMB formally retired the case and Randolph called off the strike just hours before it was scheduled to begin. Randolph, Webster, and the leadership of the BSCP recognized, in the end, that a strike at that time would have seriously crippled the brotherhood, agreeing that the union was still not strong enough to carry off a strike against the powerful corporate giant like Pullman. That provoked an internal crisis, deepened by the Great Depression, paucity of funding for the union, and perpetual reprisals against the porters by the Pullman company, which led to a sharp drop in BSCP membership. The union might have disappeared altogether if it had not been for the vigilance and dedication of Randolph, Webster, Totten, Mills, C. L. Dellums, Bennie Smith, S. E. Grain, E. J. Bradley, Paul Caldwell, George Price, C. Francis Stratford and Roy Lancaster, who formed the initial organizers and board members of the BSCP. The relationship between Randolph and Webster, the long-standing first vice president of the BSCP and the head of the Chicago Division, was centered on their common devotion to a common cause. Together they had a mutually aggressive and genuine commitment to the imperative that the black worker be organized to improve the working conditions, workers rights and the lives of black workers, their families and their communities. In 1929, the American Federation of Labor granted affiliated status to individual chapters of the BSCP as local unions rather than to the international organization as a whole. The locals were Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Detroit, Fort Worth, Kansas City, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Oakland, St. Louis, St. Paul, and Washington D.C. By 1933, BSCP membership dropped to 658, and the headquarters lost telephone and electric service because of nonpayment of bills. In 1934 the Roosevelt administration amended the RLA, then passed the Wagner-Connery Act, which outlawed company unions and covered porters, the following year. The BSCP immediately demanded that the NMB certify it as the representative of these porters. The BSCP defeated the company union in the election held by the NMB and on June 1, 1935 was certified. Negotiations for increasing labor standards with the Pullman Company began but were repeatedly deadlocked. The BSCP requested the assistance of the National Mediation Board in April, 1937, a time when the company was still using informants to report on union meetings. A contract between the BSCP and the Pullman Company was signed on August 25, 1937. It went into effect in October 1937, raising the wages of porters and maids, establishing a basic 240-hour month, and providing time- and-a-half overtime pay after 260 hours. Pullman claimed the wage increases would cost the company approximately $1,500,000 per year. The company also agreed to pay for the uniforms of porters after they'd been employed for ten years. ==Role of women== The BSCP was founded for all Pullman attendants, including maids. Many of the maids were well-educated African-American or Chinese-American women but were classified as \\"unskilled service workers,\\" expected to clean berths, care for the unwell, and give free manicures to passengers. Six weeks after the foundation of the BSCP, female Pullman employees and relatives of male union members formed the Women's Economic Councils, officially recognized as the International Ladies' Auxiliary to the BSCP in 1938.Chateauvert, M. (1990). Marching Together: Women of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. NWSA Journal (2), 687‚Äì689. Many of these women had worked in New York's booming garment industry and gained experience in union activism within the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, which sought to increase African-American membership in the late 1920s. This adjunct organization focused on fundraising and disseminating pro-union information to the general public. Maids were often fired for union activism. Individuals also made impacts. When her husband was fired due to his BSCP work, Rosina C. Tucker successfully demanded his reinstatement; she would go on to become a founding member of the ILA, a recruiter for the BSCP, and a civil rights activist in Washington, DC. Halena Wilson (1895-1975), president of the Chicago ILA, pushed the chapter to fight for wage and price controls and consumer cooperatives and against poll taxes. Civil rights activist Frances Albrier organized her fellow Pullman maids during the 1920s, recalling: \\"Our responsibility was trying to educate the black public and black women\\" about the union. ==International growth== During 1917‚Äì1939 working conditions on Canadian railways and transportation industries were poor. Porters working under the Canadian National Railways (CNR) began resistance movements, demanding representation and bargaining rights.Agnes, C. (1988). Blacks on Canadian Railways. Canadian Ethnic Studies, 20 (2).

Retrieved from, http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/edu/ViewLoitDa.do?method=preview‚ü®=EN&id;=18721 There was widespread enthusiasm amongst Canadian workers for the adoption of BSCP Ibid. Just three years after expanding to Canadian provinces, the work of the BSCP brought about reforms in wages, working standards among other matters, while expanding the number of workers represented by the union.Carson, J. (2002) Review: Riding the Rails: Black Railroad Workers in Canada and the United States. Labour/ Le Travail (50) 275-295. ==Civil rights leadership== The BSCP won a charter from the AFL in 1935, the same year it was certified by the NMB. In the years before then, when the AFL refused to recognize the organization itself, Randolph accepted \\"federal local\\" status for a number of locals of the BSCP -- an unsatisfactory compromise that assumed that these locals had no union of their own, and allowed them to affiliate directly with the AFL on that basis. That half-measure, however, allowed Randolph into AFL conventions and other meetings, where he advocated organization of black workers on an equal footing with whites. Randolph kept the BSCP in the AFL, where most of the railroad brotherhoods remained, after John L. Lewis led the split that resulted in the formation of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Randolph expanded his agenda once he became the leader of the foremost black labor organization in the U.S. Randolph was chosen as the leader of the National Negro Congress, an umbrella organization founded in 1937 that united many of the major black civil rights organizations of the day. Randolph later resigned from the NNC in a dispute over policy with communist activists within it. The NNC went into eclipse, while Randolph's stature continued to grow. In 1941 he used the threat of a march on Washington and support from the NAACP, Fiorello La Guardia and Eleanor Roosevelt to force the administration to ban discrimination by defense contractors and establish the Fair Employment Practices Committee to enforce that order. Milton Webster, the BSCP's First Vice-President, worked to make the FEPC an effective tool in combatting employment discrimination. Randolph achieved his other demand -- the end of racial segregation within the military -- seven years later, when President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9981 banning it. BSCP members played a significant role in the Civil Rights Movement in the 1940s and 1950s. E. D. Nixon, a BSCP member and the most militant spokesperson for the rights of African Americans in Montgomery, Alabama for most of the 1940s and 1950s, exemplified the leadership that the union provided. Nixon could take advantage of his experience organizing under difficult circumstances and his immunity to economic reprisals from local businesses and authorities. BSCP members also helped spread information and create networks between the different communities their work took them to, bringing the newspapers and political ideas they picked up in the North back to their hometowns. Randolph helped negotiate the return of the CIO to the AFL in 1955. Randolph by that time had achieved elder statesman status within the civil rights movement, even as changes in the railroad industry were gradually displacing many of the union's members. Randolph and one of his chief lieutenants, Bayard Rustin -- who, ironically, had bitterly criticized Randolph for calling off the 1941 March on Washington -- were the moving force behind the 1963 March on Washington. As Randolph said from the podium at that march: :Let the nation know the meaning of our numbers. We are not a pressure group. We are not an organization. We are not a mob. We are the advance guard of a massive moral revolution that is not confined to the Negro, nor is it confined to civil rights, for our white allies know that they are not free while we are not. In 1953, when Violet King Henry became the first black woman lawyer in Canada (and the first black law graduate in Alberta) the union's president and vice-president traveled to Alberta to recognize her. ==Merger with BRAC== Passenger rail travel dropped sharply after its peak in the 1940s, when the BSCP had 15,000 members, to the 1960s, when only 3000 porters had regular runs. After four decades of service as the first vice president of the BSCP, Milton Webster was designated to be Randolph's successor as president when Randolph retired. That transition never occurred. In February 1965, Webster suffered a fatal heart attack in the lobby of the Americana Hotel in Bal Harbour, Florida while he and Randolph were attending an AFL-CIO Convention. C. L. Dellums replaced Randolph as president of the BSCP in 1968. The BSCP merged with the Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks BRAC a decade later.\\"Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.\\" Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working-Class History, 2006. History Study Center, http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&res;_dat=xri:ho- us&rft;_dat=xri:ho:sup_ref:uslb89 Dellums' successor and last president of the BSCP as an independent organization, Leroy J. Shackelford, became president of BRAC's Sleeping Car Porters Division. In 1984, the Sleeping Car Porters Division was combined, along with Amtrak clerical employees, into a new Amtrak Division of the union having approximately 5000 members, 3500 clerical and 1500 in on-board services, comprising the largest single unit of organized labor on the Amtrak system. Upon Mr. Shackelford's retirement in 1985, his position was not filled, its duties devolving upon the general chairman of the BRAC Amtrak Division, Michael J. Young, and his successors. Thus ended the direct lineage of BSCP leadership, with Young becoming the first non-African American to lead the on-board group. The three unions representing Amtrak on- board service workers, BRAC, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees (HERE), and the Transport Workers Union (TWU) joined to form the Amtrak Service Workers Council (ASWC). Craft lines and separate seniority lists for on-board workers were eliminated, with one labor agreement covering all. The chairmanship of the ASWC rotates annually among the chief executive officers of each constituent union's Amtrak bargaining unit. ==Stage and film== In 1982 an award-winning documentary was produced titled Miles of Smiles, Years of Struggle. An oral history book of the same name inspired by and based on the film was produced several years later. The story of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters was made into the 2002 Robert Townsend film 10,000 Black Men Named George starring Andre Braugher as A. Philip Randolph. The play Pullman Porter Blues (2012) by Cheryl West dramatizes a night aboard the Panama Limited train and the challenges and tensions among three generations of Pullman Porters. ==Notable Pullman porters== * Big Bill Broonzy * Matthew Henson * Claude McKay * Benjamin Mays * Oscar Micheaux * E.

It is a sub-prefecture of the Nord department. It is situated 14 km from the Belgian border, and 18 km south of Maubeuge, the nearest larger town. The river Helpe Majeure, a tributary of the Sambre, flows through the town. Upstream of Avesnes on the river there is the Lac du Val-Joly, an artificial lake. ==History== Avesnes was founded in the 11th century. The first known lord was Wedric II of Avesnes (born about 990), son of Wedric I de Morvois. The house of Avesnes played an important role in the low countries, including several Counts of Holland. It was destroyed by Louis XI in 1477 after his victory in the Burgundian Wars. Historically a part of the County of Hainaut, it became French in 1659 as a result of the Treaty of the Pyrenees, and was fortified by Vauban, although it was captured by Prussia in 1815. Avesnes was heavily fortified, with fortifications that were continually modernised, from the 11th century up until 1867 when its fortifications, like those of other isolated bastions, were deemed to be redundant. In the 1870 some of the fortifications were demolished to allow easier access to the town. ==Population== ==Culture== Many of the buildings on the main streets in this town are made of dimension stone, like the 200 ft bell tower of the main church, St Nicholas, which dates from the 16th century. The Tour de France race cycled through town in its 1999 progression around France. The region of Avesnes-Sur-Helpe is known for its distinctive cheeses: the Maroilles cheese and also the \\"boule d'Avesnes\\", a local cone-shaped red cheese that is coated in paprika. The high school in the region is the Lyc√©e Jesse de Forest, named for an Avesnes native son who was responsible for the earliest settlement of the Dutch and Huguenots in what is now New York. ==Heraldry== ==See also== *Communes of the Nord department ==References== * INSEE commune file Category:Communes of Nord (French department) Category:Subprefectures in France ","title":"Avesnes-sur-Helpe"},{"id":"517824","text":"Gordonville is the name of several towns in the United States: *Gordonville, Alabama *Gordonville, Missouri *Gordonville, Pennsylvania *Gordonville, Texas ==See also== *Gordonsville (disambiguation) ","title":"Gordonville"},{"id":"517828","text":"Two ships of the United States Navy have been named USS Siboney, after the town of Siboney, Cuba, the site of American landings in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. * was a civilian ship requisitioned in World War I as a troopship and returned to the Ward Line (New York and Cuba Mail Steamship Company) after the war. * was an escort carrier in service from 1945 to 1956.

It generally consists of a box shape with a flat top and a ramp on two or more sides. A funbox may also include other elements that allow for more complicated skateboarding tricks.Skateboarding Skills: The Rider's Guide by Ben Powell (Firefly Books, 2008) Like other skatepark features, funboxes are used by skateboarders, inline-skaters and BMX-riders. ==Features== Table-top - The main characteristic of a funbox is the standard table-top; the flat top of the main structural box component. The table-top can vary in height and surface area. Ramps - To allow access to the table-top, a funbox will generally be surrounded (on two or more sides) by ramps or stairs to allow tricks or transitions on, off or over the table-top. Other elements - A funbox may also include a number of other elements including ledges, rails, spines, copings, angled ramps, wall sections to allow \\"wallrides\\" and improvised street furniture pieces.Street Skating: Grinds and Grabs by Jeff Savage (Capstone, 2004) A funbox with ramps on opposite sides may allow for the conduct of aerial tricks. As such, funboxes are commonly placed in line with the \\"outlet\\" of a larger ramp to allow for a build-up of speed. Typically, a funbox with ramps or transitions on all sides of the table will be placed in the middle of a park. ==Construction== Funboxes are generally constructed of concrete (as a permanent element in a skatepark) or wood (as a moveable or customizable element for street skateboarding). Some variations include steel frames and both concrete and wood constructions will often include steel copings or rails. Some funboxes will be constructed in sections to allow for further customization.Ramp Plans: Learn How to Build Vert Street Mini Launch and Bowls (2000 Edition) (High Speed Productions, 1999) [released by Thrasher magazine] The construction must resist dynamic structural load resulting from aerial tricks or jumps onto the funbox. ==References== Category:Skateboarding Category:Skateboarding equipment ","title":"Funbox"},{"id":"517835","text":"Claude Berrou (; born September 23, 1951 in Penmarch) is a French professor in electrical engineering at √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des T√©l√©communications de Bretagne, now IMT Atlantique. He is the sole inventor of a groundbreaking quasi-optimal error-correcting coding scheme called Turbo codes as evidenced by the sole inventorship credit given on the fundamental patent for turbo codes. The original patent filing for turbo codes issued in the US as US Patent 5,446,747. A 1993 paper entitled \\"Near Shannon Limit Error-correcting Coding and Decoding: Turbo-codes\\" published in the Proceedings of IEEE International Communications Conference was the first public disclosure of turbo codes. This 1993 paper listed three authors because it was formed from three separate submissions that were combined due to space constraints. The three authors listed on the 1993 paper are: Berrou, Glavieux, and Thitimajshima. Because the 1993 paper was the first public introduction of turbo codes (patents remain unpublished until issued), coinventorship credit for the discovery to turbo code is often erroneously given to Glavieux and/or Thitimajshima. While Berrou and Glavieux did go on to do supplemental work together, the original development of turbo codes was performed by Berrou alone. Berrou also codeveloped turbo equalization (see turbo equalizer.) Turbo equalization is also known as iterative reception or iterative detection. Turbo Codes have been used in all the major cellular communications standards since 3G and are currently part of the LTE (Long Term Evolution) cellular protocol. They are also used in the Inmarsat satellite communications protocol and well as the DVB-RCS and DVB-RCS2 communications protocols. Hard disk drives started using turbo equalization for their read channel in 2008. By 2012 all hard disk drives used turbo equalization and this remains the case to this day. Between mobile phones and hard disk drives, several billion devices have incorporated key technology developed by Claude Berrou. == Key research activities == His current research activities are now concentrated on the application and extension of the Turbo technology in various domains, including his research on Artificial thinking, because the Turbo-decoding has been recognized as a new instance of the very general principle of Belief propagation; one application of this principle has been invented for the decoding of Low-density parity-check codes (LDPC codes also known as Gallager codes, in honor of Robert G. Gallager, who developed the LDPC concept in his doctoral dissertation at MIT in 1960 as a theoretical model whose practical implementation was not widely developed until recently). The Turbo principle is generalized now by Claude Berrou and his lab team for the processing of various functions such as the demodulation, the detection or the equalization using a network of multiple convolution codes working in parallel with probabilistic feedback. Other subjects of interest include all their possible applications in the field of artificial intelligence, for example with a better understanding of natural biological thinking and memory for the implementation of such model using neural networks for the processing of pulsed signals with software and hardware methods with auto-selected and self- maintained combinations of activation cycles of adjacent neurons.La pens√©e artificielle (The Artificial Thinking), research project paper by Claude Berrou, ENST Bretagne (2008). == Publications == He is the author or coauthor of several books related to turbocodes and their encoding/decoding methods or implementation devices: * Codes et turbocodes (Codes and turbocodes) by Claude Berrou with Karine Amis Cavalec, Alain Glavieux, Matthieu Arzel, Michel Jezequel, Charlotte Langlais, Rapha√´l Le Bidan, Samir Saoudi, G√©rard Battail, Emmanuel Boutillon, Yannick Saouter, Emeric Maury, Christophe Laot, Sylvie Kerouedan, Fr√©d√©ric Guilloud, and Catherine Douillard.

Pudovkin's masterpieces are often contrasted with those of his contemporary Sergei Eisenstein, but whereas Eisenstein utilized montage to glorify the power of the masses, Pudovkin preferred to concentrate on the courage and resilience of individuals. He was granted the title of People's Artist of the USSR in 1948. ==Biography== Vsevolod Pudovkin was born in Penza into a Russian family, the third of six children. His father Illarion Epifanovich Pudovkin came from peasants of the Penza Governorate, the village of Shuksha and worked in several companies as a manager and a door-to- door salesman. Vsevolod's mother Elizaveta Alexandrovna Pudovkina (n√©e Shilkina) was a housewife.Vsevolod Pudovkin (1976). Collection of Works in Three Volumes. Volume 3. ‚Äî Moscow: Iskusstvo, p. 288-289, 322, 489Alexander Karaganov (1983). Vsevolod Pudovkin. ‚Äî Moscow: Iskusstvo, 272 pages, p. 3 A student of engineering at Moscow University, Pudovkin saw active duty during World War I, being captured by the Germans. During this time he studied foreign languages and did book illustrations. After the war, he abandoned his professional activity and joined the world of cinema, first as a screenwriter, actor and art director, and then as an assistant director to Lev Kuleshov. His first notable work was a comedy short Chess Fever (1925) co-directed with Nikolai Shpikovsky. Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca played a small part in it, with a number of other cameos presented. In 1926 he directed which will be considered one of the masterpieces of silent movies: Mother, where he developed several montage theories that would make him famous. Both movies featured Pudovkin's wife Anna Nikolaevna Zemtsova in supporting female parts (she left cinema shortly after). His first feature was followed by The End of St. Petersburg (1927), and Storm Over Asia (also known as The Heir of Genghis Khan), titles which compose a trilogy at the service of the bolshevik revolutionary policy. In 1928, with the advent of sound film, Pudovkin, Sergei Eisenstein and Grigori Aleksandrov signed the Manifest of Sound, in which the possibilities of sound are debated, and always understood as being in a state of tension and nonsynchronization with the image. This idea would be brought to bear in his next pictures: A Simple Case (1932) and The Deserter (1933), works that do not match the quality of earlier work. In 1935 he was awarded the Order of Lenin. After an interruption caused by health concerns, Pudovkin returned to movie making, this time with a number of historical epics: Victory (1938); Minin and Pozharsky (1939) and Suvorov (1941). The last two were often praised as some of the best movies based on Russian history, along with the works of Sergei Eisenstein. Pudovkin was awarded a Stalin Prize for both of them in 1941. During World War II he was evacuated to Kazakhstan where he directed several patriotic war movies. He also played a small part in the Ivan the Terrible movie (as God's fool). With the end of war he returned to Moscow and continued his work at the Mosfilm studio, making biographical and war movies. In 1947 he was awarded another Stalin Prize for his work on Admiral Nakhimov, and in 1950 ‚Äî his second Order of Lenin and a third Stalin Prize for Zhukovsky. His last work was The Return of Vasili Bortnikov (1953). Apart from directing, screenwriting and acting, Pudovkin was also an educator and a journalist, author of several books on film theory, professor at VGIK, president of the cinema section at VOKS (since 1944) and a member of the Soviet Peace Committee. Vsevolod Pudovkin died on 30 June 1953 in J≈´rmala, Latvian SSR (near Riga) after a heart attack. He was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery. One of the streets in Moscow is named after Pudovkin (see Pudovkin street). ==Filmography== { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" align=\\"center\\" -  Year  Original Title  English Title  Role  Notes -  1920  –í –¥–Ω–∏ –±–æ—Ä—å–±—ã  In the Days of Struggle   Actor -  rowspan=2  1921  –°–µ—Ä–ø –∏ –º–æ–ª–æ—Ç  Sickle and Hammer  Andrey  Screenwriter; assistant director -  –ì–æ–ª–æ–¥... –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥... –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥...

From humble beginnings, Helmsley moved up in property through natural salesmanship, a willingness to delegate, and shrewd acquisition policies that were ahead of their time. His second marriage to Leona Roberts (\\"Queen of Mean\\") led to charges of false accounting and tax evasion as well as a celebrated trial, where Harry was judged too frail to plead, but Leona was fined and jailed. ==Early career== Henry Helmsley was the son of Henry Helmsley, a wholesale dry goods buyer, and the former Minnie Brakmann. He was born in Manhattan and brought up in The Bronx, attending Evander Childs High School, where he did not graduate. The family could not afford a college education, but his grandfather got him a job as an office boy in a real estate firm, Dwight, Voorhis & Perry, where he showed a keen talent for the business and was made a partner. In 1938, he bought the firm, renaming it Dwight, Voorhis & Helmsley. In the early stages of his career, his portfolio consisted mainly of smaller properties in less-affluent parts of New York City, though it was extensive and highly profitable. The ornate facade of the Helmsley Building on Park Avenue in New York City ==Notable properties and companies== In 1954, Helmsley bought the Lincoln Building, a major office skyscraper on Forty-second Street. A year later, he bought a real estate management company owned by Leon Spear, and the firm became known as Helmsley- Spear. In 1961, he bought the Empire State Building‚Äîthen the tallest building in the world‚Äîagainst warnings that the maintenance costs would be too high. Other notable New York office properties that Helmsley owned during his career included the Helmsley Building (230 Park Avenue), the Graybar Building (420 Lexington Avenue), the Flatiron Building (175 Fifth Avenue), the Fisk Building (250 West 57th Street), the Toy Center (200 Fifth Avenue) and 1350 Broadway. He also invested in large residential properties including Park West Village on Manhattan's west side, Tudor City on the east side, and in Fresh Meadows in Queens and Parkchester in the Bronx. Industrial properties included the Starrett-Lehigh Building in Manhattan and Bush Terminal in the Bronx. During the 1970s and 1980s, Helmsley began investing in hotels. Among his holdings were the Helmsley Windsor Hotel (West 58th Street), the Park Lane Hotel (Central Park South) and the Helmsley Palace, which he built behind the Villard Houses on Madison Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets. In addition to Helmsley-Spear, which had 450 employees by 1980, he also owned Brown Harris Stevens, Inc., a residential brokerage firm. Helmsley bought Brown Harris Stevens in 1964. In addition to its high-end residential brokerage business, the company managed residential buildings, including some of the most prestigious co-ops on Park and Fifth Avenues and Central Park West. When Helmsley sold the business in 1995, the company managed 128 buildings. Helmsley became known as the most influential real estate magnate in the city. His success was attributed largely to a gift for salesmanship, a willingness to delegate authority, and a less-usual acquisition policy of long-term fixed- rate mortgages during a slump and cash purchases when interest rates were low. This policy has since become standard in real estate. ==Marriage to Leona== In 1938, he had married a widow, Eve Ella Sherpick Green. In 1971, he divorced her and the next year married Leona Roberts, vice-president of one of his many companies. She was a high-profile manager, dynamic but abrasive (\\"Queen of Mean\\"), and she demanded a luxurious lifestyle, quite unlike the modest private life he had been living until then. Basing themselves in a penthouse in the Helmsley-owned Park Lane Hotel on Central Park South, they moved into hotel construction and operation on a big scale, diversifying beyond New York for the first time, to many other big centres. Their portfolio included The Helmsley Middletowne Hotel, the New York Helmsley Hotel (also known as the New York Harley), The Helmsley Windsor Hotel, the St. Moritz (now the Ritz- Carlton), the Carlton House hotels, the Harley Hotel chain and The Helmsley Building in New York City. In 1980, Harry received The Hundred Year Association of New York's Gold Medal Award \\"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.\\" His crown jewel was New York's 50-story Helmsley Palace Hotel on Madison Avenue at Fiftieth Street. The hotel opened in 1980 to great fanfare and soon became known as the city's most elegant venue. However, it marked the beginning of financial and legal troubles that would dog the marriage until Harry's death. Partly due to Leona's extravagant plans and frequent demands for changes, the cost of the building skyrocketed, and it was proved that they had contracted some work out to their own subsidiaries at inflated prices. In 1988, they were also charged with major tax evasion based on false accounting. By this time, Harry was judged too frail to plead but Leona served 18 months in prison, in addition to being heavily fined. The mausoleum of Harry Helmsley ==Death== Helmsley died of pneumonia at age 87 at a hospital in Scottsdale, Arizona, and left all of his empire ($5.5 billion) to his wife, Leona. His remains were initially entombed at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York, but later moved to Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.Lombardi, Kate Stone, \\"COUNTY LINES; Why Leona Buried Harry Not Once, But Twice\\", The New York Times, April 23, 2006 ==In popular culture== Helmsley's marriage to Leona was dramatized in the 1990 TV movie Leona Helmsley: The Queen of Mean, which starred Lloyd Bridges as Harry and Suzanne Pleshette as Leona. Pleshette was nominated for an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for the portrayal. ==References== ==External links== * American National Biography Listing for Harry Helmsley * Category:1909 births Category:1997 deaths Category:American billionaires Category:American hoteliers Category:American real estate businesspeople Category:Businesspeople from New York City Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Infectious disease deaths in Arizona Category:People from the Bronx Category:Burials at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery ","title":"Harry Helmsley"},{"id":"517863","text":"The S√£o Francisco boardwalk S√£o Francisco is one of the 48 neighborhoods in which the Brazilian city of Niter√≥i is divided. As of 2000, its population was 9,654. Its name derives from the church consecrated to Saint Francis Xavier (in Portuguese: S√£o Francisco Xavier) and references to it can be found as early as the 17th century. The S√£o Francisco Ensenada, also known as \\"saco\\" de S√£o Francisco\\" (roughly translated as S√£o Francisco's \\"bag\\", on account of the Ensenada's shape), was an important source of fish for both the Indians and the Portuguese.

Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. ==Overview== The term Hexateuch came into scholarly use from the 1870s onwards mainly as the result of work carried out by Abraham Kuenen and Julius Wellhausen. Following the work of Eichhorn, de Wette, Graf, Kuenen, N√∂ldeke, Colenso and others, in his Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels Wellhausen proposed that Joshua represented part of the northern Yahwist source (c 950 BC), detached from JE document by the Deuteronomist (c 650-621) and incorporated into the Deuteronomic history, with the books of Judges, Kings, and Samuel. Reasons for this unity, in addition to the presumed presence of the other documentary traditions, are taken from comparisons of the thematic concerns that underlie the narrative surface of the texts. For instance, the Book of Joshua stresses the continuity of leadership from Moses to Joshua. Furthermore the theme of Joshua, the fulfillment of God's promise to lead the Israelites to the Promised Land, complements the thematic material of the Pentateuch, which had ended with the Israelites on the border of the Promised Land ready to enter. The thesis that Joshua completes the Torah in a Hexateuch may be contrasted with the view of scholars following the older rabbinic tradition, as expressed by the compilers of the Jewish Encyclopedia (compiled between 1901 and 1906), that the Pentateuch is a complete work in itself. The thesis may also be contrasted with the view put forward by Eduard Meyer (1855‚Äì1930) that there never was any Hexateuch per se, but that the Law, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings once formed one great historic work. == See also == *Pentateuch *Heptateuch: the Hexateuch, plus the Book of Judges *Octateuch: including the Book of Ruth *Documentary hypothesis *Martin Noth *Old English Hexateuch *Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses ==References== ==External links== *Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels (1878; 1882) Prolegomena to the History Of Israel.

Formerly an operative for SD-6, he defected from the organization, first to work for \\"The Man\\", and later to assume a leading position in The Covenant. Cole first appears in the season one episodes \\"The Box\\" (Parts I and II). He and a group of agents infiltrate the SD-6 office in Los Angeles and take the entire cell hostage with the exception of Sydney and Jack Bristow, who were in the parking garage of the Credit Dauphine building at the time. It is revealed that he is a former SD-6 agent who was tasked by Arvin Sloane to destroy a pipeline in Chechnya five years prior, but was captured and tortured by rebels. He is ultimately released and becomes an agent for the crime syndicate operated by \\"The Man,\\" later revealed to be Irina Derevko, and he tries to procure a vial of liquid from the vault of SD-6 in order to expose the ink of a document written by Milo Rambaldi. However, after valiant efforts by the Bristows and CIA agent Michael Vaughn, he is apprehended and taken into custody by the United States government. He next appears in the season three episode \\"After Six.\\" After Julian Sark and Lauren Reed kill the six leaders of the Covenant cells, they attempt to use this as leverage in order to ascend to more powerful positions within the terrorist organization. To the chagrin of Sark, Lauren went behind his back and alerted Cole of Sark's intentions. However, this was of value to Cole and the Covenant, because the CIA was currently looking for a document called The Doleac Agenda that specifies the most important information about the Covenant's operations, including the cell leaders' names. Thus Sark's actions, while a betrayal, were beneficial to the Covenant and Cole promoted Sark and Lauren as co-commanders of the North American cell of the Covenant. Cole also oversaw a demonstration of Sydney's apparent brainwashing as Julia Thorne. Cole's current whereabouts and how he escaped from CIA custody are unknown. ==Gordon Dean== Gordon Dean was portrayed by Tyrees Allen. Dean was the head of The Shed, a clandestine criminal organization similar to SD-6. As at SD-6, most of the operatives of the Shed believed they were working for a black ops division of the Central Intelligence Agency. Apparently only Dean and his associate Kelly Peyton knew the truth, that the Shed was actually a division of Prophet Five. Dean initially appeared in the first episode of season 5, claiming to be with the CIA's Office of Special Investigations. He claimed to be investigating Michael Vaughn as a double agent, however, APO quickly determined Dean was a rogue agent. He had faked his death two years earlier and had since then been living \\"off the grid.\\" When Shed operative Rachel Gibson learned the Shed's actual affiliation, she turned on it and at the behest of APO and Sydney stole the data from the Shed's servers. When Dean discovered what she was doing he destroyed the Shed, killing everyone except Peyton and Gibson. Following the destruction of the Shed, Dean and Peyton undertook a series of attempts to recover or kill Gibson, with no success. Dean was instrumental in securing the release of Arvin Sloane from federal custody and getting Sloane's security clearance reinstated so Sloane could work for Dean inside APO. He had an undetermined connection to Sloane prior to this. Eventually Dean was captured by Gibson and taken into APO custody. While in custody Sloane murdered him at the behest of Peyton who, with Dean's death, took control of his operations. ==Elena Derevko== Elena Derevko was played by S√¥nia Braga. Elena is the sister of Irina and Katya Derevko and was one of the KGB's foremost assassins, responsible for the murder of countless diplomats and politicians throughout Eastern Europe. She was described by her sister Irina as \\"volatile and quick-tempered\\". Considered the most ruthless of the Derevko sisters, Elena is the secret leader of The Covenant. She was first mentioned in the season three episode \\"Crossings\\" by Jack. She is not referenced again until the fourth season, when in \\"Welcome to Liberty Village\\" it is revealed that an unidentified Russian group is trying to find her. Thirty years before Season 4, Elena disappeared and could not be found, even by Irina and around a year before Season 4, Arvin Sloane and Jack Bristow had been investigating Elena's whereabouts until Jack received a message from an old associate that led him to one of Elena's safehouses in Warsaw. Inside was detailed information on the lives of Sydney Bristow and Nadia Santos, her nieces, with evidence suggesting she had them under surveillance for at least a decade. Soon Nadia's former caretaker Sophia Vargas arrived in Los Angeles claiming that her reason for coming to the United States was due to an attack by an unidentified group at her home in Lisbon, Portugal. They quickly assumed Elena was the responsible behind the attack, not realising that she was in fact \\"Sophia\\". Under the alias of \\"Sophia Vargas\\", Elena used her former connection to Nadia to stay with her and Sydney to monitor their work for the CIA. She also monitored Nadia's conversations through a necklace equipped with a microphone. She later hacked into Nadia's laptop and requested to move the Hydrosek, a deadly weapon, to an unsecured location away from APO. Elena and her associate Avian then stole the weapon before Nadia and Weiss could stop them, not realizing who the thief was. In order to complete her endgame, Elena, fully aware of the fact that he would at some point double-cross her, also ordered the creation of \\"Arvin Clone\\", a corporal in the U.S. Army named Ned Bolger, who was captured and brainwashed to believe that he was, in fact Arvin Sloane, committing numerous criminal acts in the process, such as setting Irina up to appear as if she had contracted an assassin to kill Sydney. Elena sent a team into the Department of Special Research to steal all the Rambaldi artifacts necessary to complete \\"Rambaldi's endgame\\". On the same night, she left Sydney and Nadia's house, saying that she had been informed by the Lisbon police that it was safe for her to return. Hours later, Hayden Chase entered the house and accused Nadia of working against the government and allowing the team to break into the DSR. It was at this point that Jack and Sloane began to realize that Sophia was Elena, which was backed by the microphone found in the necklace given to Nadia by Sophia. Sloane deduced that Elena would go to Lazlo Drake with the Rambaldi artifacts. Sydney and Sloane went to meet him, but he was already dead. Sydney found a hidden camera and rewound the feed to see Elena talking with Drake. Before she could see where they planned to take the Rambaldi artifacts, Sloane tranquillized her and left. He met up with Elena in her office in Prague and offered his services to help complete her task. Jack discovered through Katya Derevko that The Covenant was a major terrorist organization set up by Elena in order to secretly acquire Rambaldi artifacts. Dixon, Nadia and Sydney were sent on a mission to stop them. Dixon found Elena and Sloane, but Elena shot him before he could react. While in the hospital, Dixon told Sydney that he saw Irina Derevko before Elena shot him. It was discovered that Elena had used Project Helix to create a double of Irina, then through the use of \\"Arvin Clone\\" set up a hit on Sydney, sparking the events that led to the double's execution - to ultimately lead the intelligence/criminal world to believe that she was dead. The double was described as being an ardent follower of Elena Derevko, and fully aware of the fact that she was being set up to die. The real Irina, however, was imprisoned by Elena, and tortured for her knowledge of a Rambaldi prophecy known as \\"Il Diluvio\\", the Flood. She was kept for eighteenth months in Prague, but moved to a remote location in Guatemala - Tikal. Sydney, Jack and Nadia located her through Lucian Nisard, and saved her from Elena's guards. Elena and Sloane constructed a massive Mueller device over the Russian city of Sovogda which, in conjunction with the tainted water supply from The Orchid, infected the people of Sovogda and made them extremely aggressive. When Sloane learned that APO had sent a team into the city to stop them, he offered to head out with the team himself. While he was doing this, Elena began to transmit a subaudible frequency via the Russian mil-sat network to spread the infection worldwide. The second that the bombers were scheduled to destroy Sovogda, the frequency would be broadcast causing the effects of Sovogda to occur worldwide. One of Elena's men found Nadia walking around the streets and brought her to Elena, who told Nadia that she never wanted to hurt her. She said that she always thought of Nadia as her daughter, then offered her a place alongside her. She showed Nadia a map of the world with pinpoints all over it, saying \\"the flood has begun, just a few will survive.\\" Nadia refused to join her, saying that she would never kill Sydney as Rambaldi's prophecy had stated. Elena then injected Nadia with the tainted water, which infected her with the aim of forcing her to kill Sydney. Elena noticed Sloane on the monitor. He was back and carrying a supposedly unconscious Vaughn, but as soon as they arrived in the base they began to shoot Elena's men. They were joined by Jack and Irina. They got to Elena and Irina knocked her to the floor with her gun. Sloane put Elena in a chair and Jack and Vaughn went to the computers to stop the mil-sat network from uploading the frequency. However, they could not retract the transmission. Elena told them that she had planned the attack for five years; it would not be that simple to stop her. Sydney managed to get into the main circuit board, but found a blue and a white wire. Irina did not know which to cut, and she asked Elena. When she refused to answer, she told Jack to start torturing her. Before he could do so, Elena told him to stop, and said to cut the white wire. Irina immediately shot Elena on the head and told Sydney to cut the blue wire. ===Elena's Past with Nadia=== Sydney and Vaughn discover footage of a very young Nadia being tested with Rambaldi fluid in a Russian bunker. Katya Derevko tells them Nadia was born to Irina in a Soviet prison after Irina left Jack. Sydney was born in 1975 and Irina left in late 1981. This means Nadia has to have been born in 1982. The footage proves Nadia was in Soviet custody for at least the first few years of her life. Conservatively, based on the footage, she could have been in Soviet hands until at least 1985. Elena, as Sophia Vargas, tells Michael Vaughn the only time she met his father Bill was when he left Nadia in her care at the orphanage in Buenos Aires. However, Michael Vaughn locates Sophia's address in Lisbon through an encoded entry in a journal purported to have belonged to his father, which indicated Bill Vaughn had survived past 1979, when Irina Derevko was supposed to have killed him. Since this journal was revealed a forgery, there is no reason to believe information given by Elena supporting the authenticity of the journal was true. Nadia ran away from the orphanage in 1992. The footage is fairly dark but it is possible she was as young as 10 when she ran away. She's in a dormitory with other girls of about that age. She's recruited by Roberto Fox when she's 17 or 18, which would make the year 1999 or 2000. She dies in circa 2007. In this timeline, the only loose ends are how Nadia ended up at the orphanage in the first place and why the mercenary Roberts would tell Michael Vaughn his father was involved. Since the orphanage was headed up by Elena Derevko, the most obvious explanation is that Elena kidnapped her after she was taken from lrina and she simply lied to Vaughn about his father's involvement, and Roberts was paid to do the same. ==Katya Derevko== Yekaterina \\"Katya\\" Derevko, alias the Black Sparrow, was the second of the three Derevko sisters to be introduced. She was played by Isabella Rossellini. Katya first appeared during the third season, sent by Irina in response to Jack's request for help in extricating Sydney and Vaughn from a North Korean prison. Following the mission, Katya kisses Jack passionately. In the course of searching for The Passenger after her abduction in season 3, Sydney and Vaughn discover video files of Nadia as a small child in an abandoned Russian military bunker, formerly the center of Soviet Rambaldi research. Katya and several Russian guards confront them, but Katya turns on the guards, subduing them with tranquilizer darts, and the three of them travel to St. Petersburg. Katya fills them in on Nadia's background, claiming that Nadia was born to Irina in a Russian prison after Irina left Jack. Since Sydney was born in April 1975 and Irina left Jack in late 1981, Nadia must have been born in 1982. This timeline is irreconcilable with reports that Vaughn's father had rescued Nadia as a young girl, since he was killed by Irina in 1979, confirming the belief that Elena Derevko had fabricated the story of Bill Vaughn's involvement. Katya and Jack work together to trace Sloane's movements through bank activity, and Katya flirts outrageously with Jack. Jack initially rebuffs her advances but later kisses her deeply. After Nadia's rescue, Vaughn tracks down his wife, Lauren Reed. He has captured her, beaten her, and is about to kill her when Katya intervenes, stabbing Vaughn in the back and releasing Lauren. While engaged in reconnaissance of a Covenant operation in Palermo, Sydney encounters Katya again. Katya attempts to shoot her (thereby confirming to Sydney that Katya is allied with the Covenant), but Sydney had removed the bullets from Katya's gun. Sydney hits Katya with a tranquilizer dart and Katya is taken into federal custody. Nothing is seen of Katya until Nadia visits her in prison in season 4, seeking to learn more about the mother Nadia never knew. Katya eats some chocolate Nadia brought her, triggering a near-fatal allergic reaction to illustrate her desperation to meet with Sydney. Sydney visits Katya in the prison infirmary to warn her against continuing to see Nadia. Katya tells her that she never intended to harm Sydney in Palermo, and Irina never intended to harm Sydney either. Irina had tried to contact Katya, concerned someone was setting her up. Katya asks Sydney to retrieve the message from Irina, which is contained in a music box. Sydney retrieves the box and recovers the message, which leads her to bank records in the name of Arvin. Sydney informs Katya that the records exonerate Irina and implicate Sloane (it was later discovered that Sloane's imposter, a pawn of Elena Derevko, was behind it). After Elena's raid on the Department of Special Research and with Katya being the only Derevko he has access to, Jack visits her in prison seeking information on the whereabouts and operations of Elena. In exchange, he promises to do everything in his power to secure her release. Katya tells him Elena was the true power behind the Covenant and advises him that Elena's base of operations is in Prague, but only Irina knew Elena's full endgame and how to stop it. Whether Jack was successful in securing Katya's release is unknown, and no further information regarding her current status is extant. ==Anna Espinosa== Anna Espinosa was initially played by Gina Torres. Born in Cuba but raised in Russia, Anna was a Soviet spy at some point, until the collapse of the Soviet Union. She is a devout follower of Rambaldi, as evidenced by the eye tattoo on her hand, and as such is one of the many characters obsessed with carrying on the late prophet's work, though her appearances on the show are scant compared to the other zealots. In season one, Espinosa is a ruthless and persistent nemesis to Sydney while the latter goes on missions for SD-6. She worked for K-Directorate, a rival organization of SD-6, composed of former operatives from the Eastern bloc, and was the go-to officer for Wetworks and Active Measures, until The Man, aka Irina Derevko, took down the organization and seized control of its assets. Upon the fall of the organization, Anna staged her death and went freelance, selling her skills as an agent to the highest bidder. She is not seen again until the fourth season, under the employ of the Cadmus Revolutionary Front (an organization believed to be composed of former Covenant operatives until it is revealed the organization is still alive under Elena Derevko). She is tasked to steal a chemical bomb but instead eliminates CRF's leader upon retrieving it. She rescues Julian Sark and plans to sell the bomb, but Sark betrays her and she is captured by Sydney. She is thereupon taken into federal custody. She returned for the 100th episode of the series, entitled \\"There's Only One Sydney Bristow\\". Prophet Five, using its government contacts, was able to secure her release. She then kidnaps Will in an attempt to blackmail Sydney. She is able to obtain Page 47 of the Rambaldi prophecy, depicting the Chosen One, a woman bearing Sydney's likeness. At the end of the episode, possibly using Project Helix, the controlling elements of Prophet Five genetically transformed Espinosa into Sydney's double after the latter's DNA was sampled by Prophet Five. At this point Jennifer Garner took over the portrayal of the character. The first encounter APO personnel had with the transformed Anna occurred in Ghana in the episode \\"30 Seconds\\" and resulted in her killing freelance operative Ren√©e Rienne before escaping. In the following episode (\\"I See Dead People\\"), Anna is ordered to intercept the real Sydney, who is en route to contact Michael Vaughn. Anna tries to deceive Vaughn, but he realizes she is an imposter, though he does not know her true identity. They fight, but as Anna gains the upper hand, she is shot in the back and head by Sydney, who had just arrived at the scene. Sydney subsequently impersonates Anna within Prophet Five for a brief time, initially convincing Sloane she (Anna) had killed Sydney by shooting her in the back. Sloane conspired to kill Anna as he felt Sydney did not deserve to die that way, but subsequently realized Sydney was impersonating her, first by doubts as Sloane notices the passion behind how Sydney (impersonating Anna) talks to him and later confirmed when Sydney told Sloane \\"I don't die that easy\\" inside a prison cell after Sydney meets with The Rose. Apparently, Prophet Five considered Anna either disposable or too dangerous to their plans to keep alive, as they planned to kill her once she fulfilled her duties foreseen by Rambaldi as the Chosen One (namely retrieving an artifact from San Cielo). ==Thomas Grace== Thomas Grace was portrayed by Balthazar Getty. The character was introduced in the second episode of the fifth season. Thomas Grace is recruited into Authorized Personnel Only, a black-ops division of the CIA, in order to replace agent Michael Vaughn after Vaughn is supposedly killed (he also replaces Eric Weiss after Weiss transfers out of APO). This led to friction between Grace and Vaughn's partner and fianc√©e, Sydney. Grace also bonded with another new APO recruit, Rachel Gibson, and began training the novice agent to fight. Not much is known about the character's background, although his file, details unknown, caused many a person to halt and reconsider welcoming him into APO with open arms. In The Horizon, Marshall Flinkman discovers that Grace used to be married, though he initially believes it is a remnant from an undercover assignment. Grace reacts with anger at Marshall's nosiness. In S.O.S, Grace takes part in an APO mission to infiltrate CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia in order to locate Sydney, who has been kidnapped by Prophet Five. During the mission, he takes advantage of the opportunity to obtain information from the Witness Protection Program regarding the man who, it is revealed, murdered Grace's wife Amanda. Later, Grace tracks the man down, but instead of killing him, asks to be put in touch with someone called \\"The Cardinal.\\" His \\"off-book\\" mission does not go unnoticed, as Rachel discovers Grace's investigation. Grace, in response, lies to her and says he intended to kill the man, but was unable to do so once he saw that he had started a family of his own. In No Hard Feelings, Rachel discovers the truth: The Cardinal is the man who ordered the death of Grace's wife and the man he had pursued was the hit man assigned to do the job. The hit man agrees to tell Grace why his wife was targeted, in return for his vehicle which had been impounded by the government. Upon returning the vehicle to the hit man, he is told that Amanda was simply \\"in the wrong place at the wrong time\\" and that the intent was actually to kill Grace. The hit man then drives off in his vehicle, only to die when Grace detonates a bomb inside. The identity of \\"The Cardinal\\" and why he had targeted Grace for assassination is never revealed. In the penultimate episode of Alias, Grace is sent to defuse a bomb that Sark had placed onto a subway to destroy APO headquarters. Unable to defuse the bomb, he repeatedly sprays liquid nitrogen on it, which slows down the mechanism for a short period of time but does not disable it. He is instructed to leave when the timer gets to 60 seconds, but ultimately stays with the bomb beyond the one- minute threshold in order to keep it from going off. His last words are to Rachel Gibson, telling her that he wished they had more time because he would have asked her out. Starting to cry, Rachel responds that she would have said yes just as the bomb detonates, killing Grace. ==Assistant Director Kendall== Assistant Director Kendall was played by Terry O'Quinn. He first appeared in the first season as the head of an FBI tribunal brought in from Washington DC to interrogate Sydney after she is arrested following evidence linking her to a prophecy by 15th century prophet Milo Rambaldi which suggests she could be a national security risk to the United States. Kendall questions her on every aspect of her life, until she is broken out of FBI custody. Kendall then reappeared in the second episode of season two, assuming command of a joint FBI/CIA task force working to bring down criminal organization the Alliance and primarily, their SD-6 cell, though his reappearance coincided specifically with the surrender of Irina Derevko to the CIA. He immediately became a source of antagonism for the characters with his no-nonsense, by the book approach. The character effectively became a second season regular, appearing in almost every episode, although almost nothing was learned about him (to this day his first name remains a mystery) and he was mainly a source of exposition. Following the two year time jump between the end of season two and beginning of the third season, Kendall was replaced as head of the task force by Marcus Dixon, though later reappeared again midway through the season when he met secretly with Sydney and informed her of the truth: he was never an FBI Assistant Director as he claimed, and had in fact always been affiliated with the Department of Special Research (DSR). He ran their facility in Nevada, Project Black Hole, which held everything the US government had collected on Rambaldi. He informs Sydney about what happened during the two years she was missing, and how they overcame their past differences and formed a friendship. The episode is Kendall's last appearance in the series. ==Alexander Khasinau== Alexander Khasinau was played by Derrick O'Connor. Alexander Khasinau is second-in-command of a criminal organization headed by a mysterious figure known as \\"The Man.\\" Julian Sark, who undertakes a number of missions on behalf of this organization, reports to Khasinau, leading SD-6 to believe that Khasinau is \\"The Man.\\" Khasinau owns a nightclub in Paris which serves as a front for his criminal activities. Following a raid on SD-6 headquarters, led by McKenas Cole, who says his employer is \\"The Man\\", Arvin Sloane seeks a declaration of war by the Alliance of Twelve on Khasinau. In an attempt to secure the swing vote of SD-9 leader Edward Poole, Sloane assassinates fellow SD cell leader Jean Briault at his behest, after Poole shows Sloane evidence of Briault's complicity with Khasinau. When Poole still votes against war, Sloane realizes that Poole framed Briault and manipulated him into the assassination. Poole is the one actually in league with Khasinau. Sloane tells Sydney that following the disappearance of Sydney's mother, Irina Derevko, Sloane served on a commission that investigated her activities. He states that Khasinau had been Irina's superior at the KGB. In a later episode, videotape footage of Irina shows her stating that Khasinau actually recruited her. Khasinau, through his mole in the CIA, FBI agent Steven Haladki, learns that Sydney Bristow is a double agent for the CIA. He uses this knowledge to formulate a plan to expose SD-6 by feeding information to Sydney's reporter friend Will Tippin. When Tippin, at the urging of Jack, mentions \\"The Circumference,\\" Khasinau has Tippin come to Paris and has him interrogated under sodium pentathol. Tippin is rescued by Sydney, who is in Paris with Marcus Dixon to retrieve a Rambaldi document from Khasinau's office. Khasinau arranges for Tippin to be kidnapped by Sark from a CIA safehouse, transported to Taipei and tortured by an evil dentist for more information about the Circumference. Tippin knows nothing about it other than the name. Ironically, it turns out that Khasinau already had the Circumference and didn't realize it. It is the Rambaldi document that SD-6 had previously retrieved from his office. Jack trades the Circumference to Sark to secure Tippin's release. In the season 1 finale, Khasinau reveals to Sydney that he is not \\"The Man.\\" \\"The Man\\" is in fact Sydney's mother, Irina. It is unclear how widespread the knowledge that Khasinau is not the leader is within the organization. Khasinau is apparently able to inspire fanatical devotion among some members of the organization. Haladki, once exposed by Jack as a double agent, entreats Jack to join with Khasinau, saying Khasinau is \\"the future.\\" Khasinau is killed by Irina early in Season 2 in the course of a mission to retrieve \\"the Bible,\\" a book containing the protocols of Irina's criminal organization. ==Andrian Lazarey== Andrian Lazarey was played by Mark Bramhall. Andrian Lazarey was a Russian diplomat. He was the father of Julian Sark, a descendant of the Romanovs and a member of the Magnific Order of Rambaldi. He was first seen in a videotape in the season 3 premiere episode, the apparent victim of an assassination by Sydney. Sydney had been missing for almost two years, and the only record she had of that time was the tape. With Lazarey's apparent death, his fortune of $800,000,000 in gold bullion passed to Sark. Sark was in CIA custody, and a shadowy organization known as The Covenant sprang him in exchange for seizing that fortune. Lauren Reed, an agent of the National Security Council and the wife of Michael Vaughn, was assigned to learn the identity of Lazarey's murderer. As Sydney continued to search for clues to her missing two years, she deciphered a coded message that had been left in a penthouse in Rome, Italy. The message was a set of coordinates which led her and Jack to a box buried in the California desert. The box contained a severed hand marked with the Eye of Rambaldi. Tests determined that it belonged to Lazarey and the time since it was severed proved that Sydney did not kill Lazarey. In an attempt to recover her memories, Sydney submitted herself to a chemical procedure and received a number of cryptic visions. One repeating image was the name \\"St. Aidan\\" and the image of her friend Will Tippin, who was currently in the Witness Protection Program. (Conscious) Sydney contacted Will and learned that St. Aiden was the name of one of the contacts he'd cultivated during his time as a CIA analyst. Will contacted St. Aidan, who turned out to be Lazarey. Lazarey gave him information that led them to a Rambaldi artifact, a sample of Rambaldi's DNA. Lazarey was captured by the Covenant during that meeting and tortured by Sark for the information he had given Will and Sydney. (\\"Remnants\\") FBI Assistant Director Kendall finally filled Sydney in on her lost time. She had been captured by The Covenant and conditioned to be an assassin operating under the name Julia Thorne. Because of her Project Christmas conditioning, the Covenant was unsuccessful. Sydney operated within The Covenant as a double agent. She was tasked to find out from Lazarey the location of the Rambaldi cube containing the DNA sample and then kill him. Instead, Sydney and Lazarey faked his death and searched for the cube under the auspices of the CIA. Together they located the cube in the Fish River Gorge in Namibia. They recovered the cube from the vault in which it was housed but Lazarey became trapped, necessitating the severing of his hand by Sydney to free him. Per Lazarey's agreement with the CIA, he vanished. Sydney learned that the Covenant planned to combine the Rambaldi DNA sample with her eggs to create the \\"second coming\\" of Rambaldi. Horrified, she hid the DNA sample and had her memory wiped so that the Covenant could not use her to locate it. The CIA undertook a mission to recover the genetic material, although Sydney decided to destroy it instead. The CIA team recovered Lazarey from Covenant custody. He was transported to a hospital and while in transit asked Sydney if she knew about \\"The Passenger.\\" Before Lazarey could reveal any additional information about The Passenger, he was assassinated by Lauren, a double agent for the Covenant. (Full Disclosure) ==Dr. Zhang Lee== Dr. Zhang Lee was played by Ric Young. Lee is a torturer, always remaining eerily calm and distant from the pain he inflicts. He was always seen wearing a suit and glasses, which led to his being referred to by the nickname \\"Suit 'N' Glasses\\" before his name was finally revealed in the third season. Lee first appeared in the pilot episode, Truth Be Told. He tortured Sydney by extracting a molar, trying to find out who her employer was. Sydney was eventually able to escape after stabbing him with his own equipment. He returned in the first-season finale, Almost Thirty Years, this time to find out what Will Tippin knew about a Rambaldi artifact known as The Circumference. Lee used a truth serum that was known to cause paralysis in 1 in 5 recipients, after which he determined that Tippin knew nothing and could be released. Tippin subsequently turned the serum on Lee, screaming, \\"One in five, you little bitch!\\". While Tippin was not paralyzed as a result of receiving the serum, Lee was not so fortunate. He resurfaced in the season two episode A Higher Echelon, now in an electric wheelchair. His new victim was Marshall Flinkman, who he threatened with an epoxy that would expand, harden, and puncture his organs when ingested. Marshall seemed to cave under the threat and agreed to reconstruct a computer program for him. However, this was simply to buy time for Sydney to rescue him and Lee was left empty-handed again, though this time he got away with only being kicked out of his chair. In the third-season episode Legacy, Lee was discovered to have been in charge of the Soviet Union's Rambaldi research in the early 1980s, including overseeing experiments on Sydney's sister Nadia Santos. Whether he was a follower of Milo Rambaldi or he was simply following orders is unknown. Sydney and Michael Vaughn tracked him down and captured him. Now in a position of no power at all, his calm demeanor evaporated and he became a terrified, sobbing wreck. When he was unable to give any pertinent information, Vaughn poured a powerfully corrosive liquid over his unfeeling legs and then the rest of his body. Lee made no further appearances so his final fate is unknown. ==Milo Rambaldi== Milo Giacomo Rambaldi is a historical personage. The work of Rambaldi, often centuries ahead of its time and tied to prophecy, plays a central role in the show. According to Alias creator J.J. Abrams, in a feature on Rambaldi included on the season 5 DVD box set, the Mueller device and Milo Rambaldi were originally intended simply to be MacGuffins. Rambaldi's technological developments are sought after by numerous governments and rogue organizations in the series. Arvin Sloane is generally obsessed with obtaining Rambaldi's work and unlocking its secrets. There seems to be no limit to Rambaldi's genius; he was highly adept in automatism, life extension, protein engineering, mathematics, cryptography and cartography. Rambaldi is said to have predicted the digital Information Age. He invented a machine code language around 1489, cryptographic algorithms, and sketched the designs of a portable vocal communicator and a prototype that reflected the properties of a transistor. The character draws its inspiration from real-life historical figures including Leonardo da Vinci and Nostradamus. Rambaldi's artistic-looking manuscripts, written in code, are a direct reference to Leonardo's method of recording his work. The Rambaldi subplot, which dominated the first two seasons of the series and was greatly explored in the second half of the third season, was virtually nonexistent in the early episodes of season four. However, it continued to lurk in the background of the series and, as series creator J.J. Abrams promised, resurfaced in full later in the season. Rambaldi and his works continued to figure heavily through the end of the series. ===Fictional biography=== Rambaldi (1444‚Äì1496), an artist, alchemist, engineer, mystic, and renaissance man in the vein of Da Vinci, served as chief architect to Pope Alexander Sextus. Rambaldi was born in Parma, educated by Vespertine monks, and worked as a student of the arts until he was 12. During his travels to Rome when he was 18, he met Cardinal Rodericus and was retained privately as an architect, consultant and prophet when Rodericus of Borgia (Borja) became Pope in 1492. His writings and plans are written in multiple languages ranging from Italian and Demotic hybrids to elusive mixtures of symbols (pre-masonic cipher encryptions). Rambaldi also created the earliest known watermark which he used on all of his documents: a naked eye, visible only when viewed under black light, known as the eye of Rambaldi, which helped distinguish original works from forgeries many years later. His waterpapers were all handmade from a unique polymer fiber. Despite Borgia's benevolence, Rambaldi and his works never became famous due to Archdeacon Claudio Vespertini, who feared the revolutionary implications of the technologies defined in Rambaldi's belief system: Rambaldi believed that science would someday allow us to know God. Vespertini attempted to pursue and destroy everything he could find and keep the name of Rambaldi \\"invisible\\". When Alexander VI died in 1503, Vespertini ordered that the name Rambaldi be erased from all inscriptions between 1470 and 1496 and his workshop in Rome destroyed. Rambaldi himself was excommunicated for heresy and sentenced to death by flame. However, Rambaldi died in the winter of 1496, a lonely man without a known surviving heir. Not long after his death, a second workshop was discovered in San Lazzaro and was destroyed by the Vatican. Plans and sketches were sold and traded as if without value during a private auction. These plans have since been located, starting in the 15th century and continuing to recent years, around Italy, France, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Plans were also found in private collections and museum warehouses. During the Third Reich, documents interpreting his designs and teachings were highly sought-after. It was during this time that the nickname Nostravinci arose among auctioneering circles. The design directive for many of these drawings remains unclear to this day and has inspired some impressive forgeries, even prime examples of digital piracy. However the eye of Rambaldi was proven to be the only accurate method to identify genuine artifacts. ===Known Rambaldi artifacts=== * Mueller device - Designed by Rambaldi and built by Oskar Mueller. Known effects include increasing the aggression of certain bees and emitting a sub-sonic frequency which combined with chemical contaminants causes heightened aggression in humans. Five Mueller devices are known to have been built. One small-scale device was seized by Sydney and handed over to Sloane. Its status is unknown as the CIA found no Rambaldi artifacts when it raided SD-6. One large-scale device was destroyed by Sydney in Taipei. \\"Arvin Clone\\" had completed one small-scale device, the status of which is unknown, and one large-scale device located in his Santiago compound, which was seized and/or destroyed by APO. There were also incomplete components of at least one more device in the compound, also presumably seized and/or destroyed by APO. Finally, Elena Derevko constructed an enormous Mueller device in Sovogda, Russia, which Sydney destroyed. * Notebook - Recovered from San Lazzaro. Not seen on-screen; an analysis by SD-6 indicates that the notebook contains rudimentary schematics for a cellular phone. * Sketches - Two sketches, each of which contains half of a binary code. The second sketch is destroyed by acid in Berlin. When the codes are combined with a compression scheme, they reveal the location of the Sol D'Oro. * Sol D'Oro (Golden Sun) - A yellow disk constructed of synthetic polymers, made to resemble stained glass. * Clock - Commissioned and designed by Rambaldi and built by Giovanni Donato (the only man Rambaldi ever collaborated with). When combined with the Golden Sun disk, the clock reveals a star chart identifying the location of Rambaldi's journal. * Rambaldi's journal - Contains instructions on how to assemble Rambaldi's designs. Page 47 was written in invisible ink and contains a prophecy and a drawing identifying Sydney as the \\"Chosen One\\". Page 94 included a listing of \\"apocalyptic dates and times\\". * Ampule - Filled with a \\"Rambaldi liquid\\" used to make the text of Page 47 and the Circumference visible. * Code key - Inscribed on the frame of a portrait of Pope Alexander VI painted by Rambaldi, housed in The Vatican. Used to decode the prophecy on page 47. * The Circumference - A page of text describing the construction and application of the Mueller device. Like Page 47, it was written in invisible ink. It was obtained from the CIA for Irina Derevko in exchange for Will Tippin. It is next seen in the possession of \\"Arvin Clone\\". * Music box - Played a sequence that when each note was translated to its corresponding frequency, revealed an equation for zero-point energy. Destroyed by Sydney after recording the equation to prevent it from falling into the hands of SD-6. * Flower - Found in an egg-shaped container, it was apparently 400‚Äì600 years old, Rambaldi's proof of eternal life. * Firebomb - A neutron bomb designed by Rambaldi, it delivered micropulses that disintegrated organic matter but left inorganic matter unharmed. * Cut-out manuscript page - A manuscript page with a section cut out of the center. Sloane recovers the missing piece from inside a 15th-century statue of an arhat. * Study of the Human Heart - Recovered by Jack and Irina. The CIA intended to use this manuscript and Irina to flush Sloane out, but Irina double-crossed Jack, stole the manuscript and turned it over to Sloane in exchange for extracting her from CIA custody. Included the DNA \\"fingerprint\\" of Proteo di Regno, which also served as a code key for page 94 of the Rambaldi journal. * Di Regno heart - Found inside Proteo di Regno's body, apparently keeping him alive. Used to power Il Dire. * Pages - loose pages seen in the possession of the man in Nepal who gives Sloane The Restoration. * Il Dire (The Telling) - A machine made of 47 Rambaldi artifacts, it wrote the word eirene (\\"peace\\" in Greek) along with the DNA sequence of The Passenger. * Medication - derived from a formula found in Rambaldi's journal and used on Allison Doren. It helped her heal from the extensive wounds she received at Sydney's hands and may have imparted lasting rapid regenerative abilities. Not seen on-screen. * Keys - A dozen keys collected by Andrian Lazarey (although one may have been collected by Sydney in the animated episode included on the season 3 DVD set). Used to open the vault which housed the Cube holding Rambaldi's DNA. * Cube - Housed a live sample of Rambaldi's DNA. Collected by Sydney and Lazarey and later concealed by Sydney, which prompted her to erase her memory. The Cube would eventually be retrieved by Sydney for the CIA and was then stolen by The Covenant, who planned to fuse the DNA with Sydney's eggs to engineer Rambaldi's second coming. Destroyed by Sydney. * Kaleidoscope - This artifact required three discs. Once the discs were inserted into the kaleidoscope, they formed a map of an underwater formation in the Sea of Japan, where four additional discs were found. * Discs - four discs recovered from the Sea of Japan that were required to open the \\"Irina\\" box. * \\"Irina\\" box - A box with the name Irina inscribed on it. It was rumored to contain \\"the Passenger\\", which the CIA believed to be a bioweapon. Supposedly it had not been opened since Rambaldi's time but apparently Sloane had found it open, because he hid the di Regno heart inside it. * The Restoration - A manuscript which references \\"The Passenger\\" and the Hourglass. Contains the formula for \\"Rambaldi fluid\\". * Code key - Used to decode The Restoration. Not seen on- screen. Lauren Reed stole a false code key created by the CIA. * Hourglass - Contained a fluid that powered the battery for the EEG machine. * EEG machine - A device that reveals the identity of \\"The Passenger\\" by sketching her brainwaves. * The Passenger - First believed to be a bioweapon, but was actually a person with a \\"direct conduit\\" to Milo Rambaldi and the only one to know the exact location of the Sphere of Life. The Passenger is Nadia Santos, daughter of Arvin Sloane and Irina Derevko and half-sister of Sydney Bristow. * \\"Rambaldi fluid\\" - A chemical containing \\"protein strains\\" which, when injected into Nadia Santos (The Passenger), made her a \\"direct conduit to Rambaldi.\\" This allowed her to experience visions and through muscle memory transcribe a complex algebraic equation for longitude and latitude, the location of the Sphere of Life. * Sphere of Life - A vessel that supposedly housed Rambaldi's consciousness. When \\"the Passenger\\" came into contact with it, she saw terrifying flashes of the future. * The Vespertine Papers - Texts, rumored to have been destroyed during World War II, which refer to properties of the Rambaldi orchid. Not seen on-screen. Pages obtained from the Department of Special Research (which may or may not have been genuine Rambaldi pages) were placed in an auction as The Vespertine Papers to flush out \\"Arvin Clone\\". * Orchid - Paphiopedilum khan, a rare lady slipper orchid brought to Italy from China in 1269. Recovered by \\"Arvin Clone\\" from the Monte Inferno monastery, it is the source of a chemical contaminant that (when combined with other substances seeded in various water supplies by Sloane) encourages human qualities like empathy and harmonic coexistence; in conjunction with the Mueller device, it causes heightened aggression in humans. * Vade Mecum - A Rambaldi manuscript, translated by Lazlo Drake. Described by Sloane as \\"a template describing how Rambaldi's creations were to be assembled in order to bring forth his final prophecy\\". Not shown on-screen. * Il Diluvio (The Flood) - A manuscript that described Rambaldi's vision of a moment when the world would be cleansed and everything would begin anew. Not seen on-screen; Irina states that she destroyed it. * The Profeta Cinque (Fifth Prophet) - A manuscript written in apparently unbreakable code that speaks of advanced genetics. * Horizon - A small orb which, when placed on the stone altar in Rambaldi's tomb, forms a levitating sphere which generates a red fluid which has the power to convey immortality. * Amulet - Recovered from \\"The Rose\\", it is considered Rambaldi's greatest gift and also his greatest curse. A defiance to the natural order and the end of nature itself. The Amulet apparently contains a map to Rambaldi's tomb, which is revealed by sunlight shining through it while in a cavern on Mt. Subasio. * Rambaldi's Tomb - Contains what appears to be the coffin of Rambaldi and a stone altar, which works in conjunction with \\"The Horizon\\". === Symbol === The symbol, , generally referred to as the \\"eye of Rambaldi,\\" is the symbol of The Magnific Order of Rambaldi. In the episode Time Will Tell, a direct descendant of Giovanni Donato (who may, in fact, have been Donato himself) describes the Order as \\"Rambaldi's most trusted followers, entrusted with safeguarding his creations. Sadly, like most things that once were pure, criminals now use this symbol to infiltrate the Order.\\" Some followers of Rambaldi have the mark tattooed on their hands, including Anna Espinosa. The glyph is also said by Irina Derevko to represent the struggle between \\"The Chosen One\\" and \\"The Passenger\\", whom Irina believes to be her two daughters. (See Rambaldi's prophecies below) The circle in the center of the design is said to be the object around which they will do great battle. The Rambaldi Eye () appears in one frame of the Alias title sequence (seasons 1-3) after all the letters in the word Alias appear. In season one and three, it flashes as ALIAS is spelled out and Victor Garber's credit appears. In season two, it appears on ALIAS when \\"With Lena Olin\\" appears. Season four doesn't have a Rambaldi sign, but it appears in season five when Balthazar Getty appears. ===Rambaldi's prophecies=== One of Rambaldi's prophecies is central to the Alias story arc. Written on the forty- seventh page of one of his manuscripts, it reads: :This woman here depicted will possess unseen marks, signs that she will be the one to bring forth my works: bind them with fury, a burning anger. Unless prevented, at vulgar cost, this woman will render the greatest power unto utter desolation. This woman, without pretense, will have had her effect, never having seen the beauty of my sky behind Mt. Subasio. Perhaps a single glance would have quelled her fire. The woman has been speculated to be Sydney, as included with the prophecy is a drawing that strongly resembles her. Rambaldi also mentioned three physical anomalies in the prophecy which Sydney also has. Sydney tried to disprove that the prophecy refers to her by climbing Mt. Subasio and see the sky. In the season two finale, Sydney's mother, Irina Derevko, reveals that Sydney is actually Rambaldi's Chosen One, and not Irina as Sydney wanted to believe. During Season Three, an organization known as The Covenant tried to use a Rambaldi artifact known as \\"The Cube\\", which contained a live sample of Rambaldi's DNA to fulfill the first part of the prophecy. This woman here depicted will possess unseen marks, signs that she will be the one to bring forth my works: bind them with fury, a burning anger. The Covenant planned to fuse Rambaldi's DNA with Sydney's eggs to engineer Rambaldi's second coming. Sydney prevented this by destroying the lab where the procedure was underway. When FBI Assistant Director Kendall tells Sydney the truth about the two years she was missing, he mentions that she's a celebrity among the Department of Special Research as she was the one to collect the most part of Rambaldi's works, which could also be what the first part of the prophecy meant. During Season Three (Episode 20), another prophecy was revealed which had been told to Michael Vaughn. It says that the \\"Chosen One\\", the woman referred to on Page 47, and \\"the Passenger\\", Sydney's half-sister Nadia Santos, would fight and kill each other in battle. Irina Derevko recites a similar prophecy at the finale of season 4 that Rambaldi wrote: :When blood-red horses wander the streets and angels fall from the sky, the Chosen One and the Passenger will clash . . . and only one will survive. When Elena Derevko put in motion her scheme to destroy civilization using the contaminated water in conjunction with a giant Mueller device, the team spotted a horse that under the light of the device appeared blood red (which prompted Irina to recite the prophecy); Nadia passed a statue of an angel which had fallen from a building right before she was captured and later becomes infected with the contaminated water. As predicted by Rambaldi, \\"The Chosen One\\" and \\"The Passenger\\" clashed over the Mueller device, and Sydney would have been killed if not for Arvin Sloane's intervention when he was forced to shoot Nadia when she began strangling Sydney. Sydney then destroyed the Mueller device and Nadia is left in a coma. In Season Five, it is revealed that page 47 holds a secret message, which is briefly shown when Nadia after being cured tries to burn the page to prevent her father from finding it, which as predicted in the prophecy, results in Nadia's death. Arvin Sloane eventually translates the message which reads: :The circle will be complete when the Chosen One finds The Rose in San Chielo. Prophet Five, using its government contacts, was able to secure Anna Espinosa's release and later was able to genetically transform Espinosa into Sydney's double after the latter's DNA was sampled by Prophet Five. Sydney discovers Anna's impersonation and kills her, then begins impersonating Anna within Prophet Five. Sydney is sent to Italy where she is approached by Sark at a betting parlor. Believing Sydney to be Anna, he explains that the former San Chielo monastery is now the La Fossa prison. After faking a robbery, Sark and Sydney surrender to the police and are taken to La Fossa. Sark fakes an illness and is taken to the infirmary, where he fights off the guards and accesses the security system to open the door to Sydney's cell. Sydney finds the basement, where an old man says that he has been waiting for her for a very long time. He indicates that he knows she's the real Sydney and quotes the message from page 47 and says that he is \\"The Rose\\". He then shows Sydney a wall where a drawing of Sydney was painted, similar to the one on page 47 and gives her an amulet before declaring ominously that it is only a matter of time \\"until the stars fall from the sky, until the end of light\\". In the finale of Season Five, it is revealed that Sydney had misinterpreted the part of the prophecy that refers to \\"the beauty of my sky\\". Arvin Sloan shoots the ice under Sydney to prevent her (and the audience) of seeing a specific pattern on the wall inside Mt. Subasio when the rising sunlight seeps into the cavern and filters through the amulet that Sydney recovered from the Rose. Later while facing her mother, Sydney discovers that Irina had sent a virus to all the defence satellites forcing them to plunging to Earth in what appears stars falling from the sky and eventually the end of light comes indicating the end of the series. ===Rambaldi's endgame=== As revealed in the final three episodes of season four, the first part of Rambaldi's endgame was the Mueller Device (which could be used to change human nature to hatred or peace, depending on the desire of the possessor, as wanted). The second part of the endgame was The Horizon (immortality), as revealed at the end of season five. Together, they would result in the possessor living forever and, with the help of the Mueller Device, changing the world the way they see fit for all eternity. However, this was averted when all known Mueller Devices were destroyed and Sloane, the only known beneficiary of The Horizon, was trapped in Rambaldi's own tomb by an explosion, left to exist but never be free for all eternity. ==Emily Sloane== Emily Sloane was portrayed by Amy Irving. Emily Sloane was married to SD-6 head Arvin Sloane for more than 30 years. Little is known of her life outside of her marriage to Arvin. She had worked for the State Department for several years but whether this was before or during her marriage is unknown. She was an avid gardener. She and Arvin had one child, Jacquelyn, who died in infancy. Her grief was so great that she asked Arvin never to mention their child again. When Irina Derevko, Sydney's mother, faked her death when Sydney was six, Sydney's father, Jack, was taken into federal custody. He named Arvin and Emily as Sydney's temporary guardians. Why Sydney would later state in multiple episodes she did not meet Arvin or Emily until after she had started working for SD-6 is unknown. Sydney stated she considered Emily her real mother. During season 1, Emily is near death from lymphoma. Sydney visits her in an SD-6 hospital, where Emily reveals she knows Arvin doesn't really work for a bank and she knows of the existence of SD-6 (although she apparently believes it is affiliated with the CIA). Under security protocols, Sydney is required to report her to SD-6 Security Section but does not. SD-6 finds her out anyway and Arvin is ordered to execute her. He pleads for a reprieve on the grounds her cancer will soon kill her anyway and his request is granted. Emily's cancer goes into total remission and Arvin is again ordered to kill her. Instead, over the end of season 1 and the beginning of season 2, he hatches an elaborate scheme to fake her death and spirits her away to an isolated island. There, he confesses to her the true nature of SD-6. Initially horrified, Emily's love for Arvin leads her to forgive him and they remain together. With the downfall of SD-6 and the Alliance, Sloane (now an internationally wanted terrorist) tells Emily they're \\"free\\" and leads her to believe he has finally left behind his deceptions. Emily and Arvin relocate to a villa in Tuscany, but because of the possibility, they have been compromised Sloane relocates them again. Emily learns Irina, whom she knew as Laura Bristow and thought was dead, is still alive and working with her husband. Arvin tells Emily everything he's done is to assure she remains cancer-free forever. Distraught, Emily goes to the American consulate in Florence, announces she is Sloane's wife and demands to speak to Sydney. Sydney makes contact with Emily, who tells her she won't be the excuse for Arvin's crimes. She volunteers to help bring Arvin in but demands a guarantee Arvin will not be sentenced to death. The CIA makes the deal, and Emily returns to Tuscany wearing a wire. Unbeknownst to her, Arvin is making a deal to sell all of his assets, contacts and Rambaldi artifacts to Irina. At the last moment, after an emotional talk with Arvin, Emily switches sides again. She reveals the wire to Arvin and then disconnects it, and they attempt to escape from the CIA. Marcus Dixon, aiming for Sloane, accidentally shoots and kills Emily instead. Emily's final appearance in the series is in a flashback in the season 4 episode In Dreams..., which is when the existence of Jacquelyn is revealed. ==Notable guest stars== * Edward Atterton - Dr. Danny Hecht (season 1) * Jonathan Banks - Frederick Brandon (season 2) * Raymond J.

The parish had a population of 5,794 at the 2011 census. ==History== Nailsworth in ancient times was a settlement at the confluence of the Avening Valley and the Woodchester Valley, on the Nailsworth Stream. Among many notable historic medieval buildings in the area are Beverston Castle and Owlpen Manor. In the modern era, Nailsworth was a small mill town and centre for brewing. It was connected directly to the UK national rail network between 1867 and 1947, as the terminus of the Stonehouse and Nailsworth Railway. ==Amenities== These days Nailsworth is visited in the summer by walkers. It holds a farmers' market every fourth Saturday in the month. Local events such as the market and the Nailsworth Festival are still announced by a town crier.Community site. Retrieved 4 February 2019. Over the past decade the small town centre has been reinvigorated.20 pagetitle=The-Town Community site. Retrieved 4 February 2019. Besides numerous restaurants and cafes, it now contains a number of shops, including bakers, a delicatessen with a fishmonger, a hardware store, butchers, craft shops, bookshops, art galleries and a gardening shop. Nailsworth is a Fairtrade Town and twinned with the French town of L√®ves, with which it enjoys an exchange visit in alternate years. ==St George's Church== The entrance to St George's Church Built on the higher ground at the centre of town, St George's was consecrated in November 1900. Before 1895, the Church of England had provided for Nailsworth through several neighbouring parishes.Anglican Nailsworth. Retrieved 4 February 2019. The new church, which today can seat 500, was designed in the Early English style by M. H. Medland of Gloucester. A lack of funds, however, meant that the church originally consisted only of a nave, aisles and south porch, without a chancel or tower. The large entrance was originally designed as a tower, but the elevated ground was considered too unstable to support the weight, resulting in the unusual porch. The clock tower was constructed on the steep grass bank by the church, known as the clock on stilts, before finding its final resting place some yards away, by the present-day Nailsworth roundabout. At that time it was hidden behind a shop that sold the hard-worked local mill wool. Those walking up the steps from Mortimer Gardens can still see two of what remains of the stilts which used to hold the clock. The chancel, Lady Chapel and vestries, dedicated to the memory of those who died in World War I, were added in 1939. A church tower was never added. In 1980 a large extension to the vestries was accomplished, turning them into a parish room. The church has no churchyard. Three of the stained-glass windows in the south aisle, depicting St Luke, St Paul and St Barnabas, are by Charles Eamer Kempe. Three others depict St Richard of Chichester, St George and St Martin of Tours. The other window is by Herbert Bryans and shows Anna the Prophetess (Luke 2:36‚Äì38) The East window was designed by Peter Strong and was installed in 1977. On the west wall is a mural painted by Sir Oliver Heywood in 1985, showing community life in the town. ==Christ Church and Tabernacle Church== Egypt Mill Hotel The Baptist chapel at Shortwood was rebuilt in 1837. In spite of the emigration of over 80 members to Adelaide between 1838 and 1840, the adult congregation was at least 1,000 in 1851. In 1864 a dispute over a new minister led to the secession of some members, who built their own chapel, opened in 1868, on Bristol Road; this was known as the Nailsworth Tabernacle Church. In 1910 the community rejoined the original Baptist church. In 1967 the Shortwood congregation united with the Forest Green Congregationalists to form a new church called Christ Church, Nailsworth. Services alternated for a few years with the Lower Forest Green Chapel, but the chapel on Newmarket Road, after modernisation, became the permanent place of worship in 1972. In that year Christ Church became a member of the new United Reformed Church, although retaining its links with the Baptist Union. It had a membership of 147 in 1973.British History Online, accessed July 16 2008 ==Governance== An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward mainly covers Nailsworth but also stretches south to Horsley. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 6,614. ===Twinned=== Nailsworth is twinned with L√®ves, France. ==Sport and recreation== Forest Green Rovers is the premier football club in Nailsworth and plays in the EFL League Two at The New Lawn stadium in Forest Green, after winning the 2017 National League Play-off Final. In doing so, it made Nailsworth the smallest settlement ever to host an English Football League team.

At the time, London costermongers (street traders) were in the habit of wearing trousers decorated at the seams with pearl buttons that had been found by market traders. In the late 1870s, Croft adapted this to create a pearly suit to draw attention to himself and aid his fund-raising activities. In 1911 an organised pearly society was formed in Finchley, north London. Croft's funeral in January 1930 was attended by 400 followers and received national media coverage. In 1934 a memorial, referring to him as \\"The original Pearly King\\", was unveiled in St Pancras Cemetery, and in a speech to mark the occasion he was said to have raised ¬£5,000 for those suffering in London's hospitals. ==Pearly organisations== The pearlies are now divided into several active groups. Croft's founding organisation is called the Original London Pearly Kings and Queens Association. It was reformed in 1975 and holds the majority of the original pearly titles which are City of London, Westminster, Victoria, Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Shoreditch, Islington, Dalston and Hoxton. Other groups have also been established over the years. The oldest is the Pearly Guild, which began in 1902. Modern additions include the London Pearly Kings and Queens Society, which started in 2001 and the Pearly Kings and Queens Guild. Despite the rivalries, each group is associated with a church in central London and is committed to raising money for London-based charities. A parade of real-life Pearly Kings and Queens was featured at the 2012 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony. ==References== History of the Pearlies The Pearly Families - The Hitchen Family - Pearly King City of London ==External links== * www.thepearlies.co.uk The Original Pearly Kings and Queens Association *www.pearlies.org.uk Pearlies of Kings Cross & St.Pancras *www.pearlysociety.co.uk The London Pearly Kings and Queens Society *www.pearlykingsandqueens.com Pearly Kings and Queens Guild *Henry Croft, Pearly King and other Pearly photos on flickr Category:Culture in London Category:Charities based in London Category:Working-class culture in the United Kingdom ","title":"Pearly Kings and Queens"},{"id":"517923","text":"Michelle Malkin (; n√©e Maglalang; born October 20, 1970) is an American conservative blogger, political commentator, author and businesswoman.

Since 2007, she has concentrated on her writing, blogging, and public speaking, although she still appears on television occasionally, especially with Sean Hannity and formerly with Greta Van Susteren on Fox News and Fox & Friends once a week. Malkin had been a contributor to CRTV, but left the network following its merger with TheBlaze in December 2018 and joined competitor Newsmax TV. Malkin also founded the website Twitchy, a Twitter content curation site. A day after the death of journalist Cokie Roberts, Malkin claimed that Cokie was \\"One of the first Guilty Culprits of Fake News\\". Brian Stelter quickly said, during the panel discussion, \\"You're attacking her today. I just want to be clear: the body isn't even cold yet.\\" ===Books=== Malkin has written a total of seven books. Her first book, Invasion: How America Still Welcomes Terrorists, Criminals, and Other Foreign Menaces (2002)Regnery Publishing, 2002, was a New York Times bestseller. In 2004, she wrote In Defense of Internment: The Case for 'Racial Profiling' in World War II and the War on Terror, defending the U.S. government's internment of 112,000 Japanese Americans in prison camps during World War II, and arguing that the same procedures could be used on Arab- and Muslim-Americans today. The book engendered harsh criticism from several Asian American civil rights organizations. The Historians' Committee for Fairness, an organization of scholars and professional researchers, condemned the book for not having undergone peer review and argued that its central thesis is false.Historians' Committee for Fairness. \\"Open Letter to Michelle Malkin\\" History News Network, August 31, 2004.

A 2007 memo from the National Republican Senatorial Committee described Malkin as one of the five \\"best-read national conservative bloggers\\",Budoff, Carrie. \\"GOP issues rules to avoid Macaca moments\\" , The Politico, June 13, 2007 and as of 2012 Technorati had ranked MichelleMalkin.com in its \\"Top 100 blogs of all types\\". In 2011, the people search company PeekYou claimed that Malkin had the largest digital footprint of any political blogger. Malkin accused hip hop artist Akon of degrading women in a HotAir YouTube video in May 2007. Following this, Akon's record label, Universal Music Group (UMG), issued a DMCA takedown notice removing the video. UMG retracted the notice after the Electronic Frontier Foundation joined Malkin in contesting the removal as a misuse of copyright law. MichelleMalkin.com was revamped and moved to a larger server on WordPress in June 2007.Malkin, Michelle. \\"Welcome to the new michellemalkin.com!\\",\\"MichelleMalkin.com\\", June 19, 2007. Malkin has also been a contributor to anti-immigration website VDARE. ===Jamil Hussein=== Malkin was among the first of several bloggers who questioned the credibility and even the existence of Iraqi police Captain \\"Jamil Hussein\\" who had been used as a source by the Associated Press in over 60 stories about the Iraq war. The controversy started in November 2006 when the AP reported that six Iraqis had been burned alive as they left a mosque and that four mosques had been destroyed, citing Hussein as one of its sources. In January 2007, Malkin visited Baghdad, and stated, \\"the Iraqi Ministry of Interior says disputed Associated Press source Jamil Hussein does exist. At least one story he told the AP just doesn't check out: The Sunni mosques that as Hussein claimed and AP reported as 'destroyed,' 'torched' and 'burned and blown up' are all still standing. So the credibility of every AP story relying on Jamil Hussein remains dubious.\\"Malkin, Michelle. \\"Fact-checking the AP and Jamil Hussein\\", MichelleMalkin.com, January 21, 2007. Malkin has since issued a correction for her denial of Hussein's existence, \\"I relayed information from multiple sources‚ÄîCPATT, Centcom, and two other military sources on the ground in Iraq‚Äîthat the Associated Press's disputed source, Jamil Hussein, could not be found.\\" [...] \\"I regret the error,\\" but still contested AP claims of destroyed mosques and civilians burned alive. ===Students Against War controversy=== In April 2006, Students Against War (SAW), a campus group at University of California, Santa Cruz, staged a protest against the presence of military recruiters on campus, and sent out a press release containing contact details (names, phone numbers and e-mail addresses) of three student leaders for use by reporters. Malkin included these contact details in a blog column entitled \\"Seditious Santa Cruz vs. America\\". Malkin claimed the contact information was originally taken from SAW's own website, but that later SAW had removed it and had \\"wiped\\" the \\"cached version\\". The students asked Malkin to remove the contact details from her blog, but Malkin reposted them several times writing in her blog: \\"I am leaving it up. If you are contacting them, I do not condone death threats or foul language. As for SAW, my message is this: You are responsible for your individual actions. Other individuals are responsible for theirs. Grow up and take responsibility.\\" SAW remarked: \\"Due to the continued irresponsible actions of some bloggers, members of the group have received numerous death threats and anti-Semitic comments through phone calls and emails.\\" Students Against The War. \\"Far-Right Threats Fail to Distract from Santa Cruz Protest Successes\\", April 19, 2006, A blog war ensued. Malkin claimed that she received hostile e-mails, then her private home address, phone number, photos of her neighborhood and maps to her house were published on several websites. The Santa Cruz Sentinel reported receiving an email from Malkin saying that this forced her to remove one of her children from school and move her family. Another controversy involving private addresses began on July 1, 2006, when Malkin and other bloggers commented on a New York Times Travel section article that had featured the town where Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld owned summer homes. The article included a picture of Rumsfeld's long tree-lined driveway that showed a birdhouse and small portion of the housefront. Malkin declared that this story was part of \\"a concerted, organized effort to dig up and publicize the private home information of prominent conservatives in the media and blogosphere to intimidate them.\\" The photos of Rumsfeld's house were taken with Rumsfeld's permission. ==ViewsImmigration=== Although herself the child of immigrant parents and citizens of the Philippines, Malkin opposes birthright citizenship to U.S.-born children of foreign tourists, temporary foreign workers, and undocumented immigrants. She claims this undermines the integrity of citizenship and national security, and argues that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, \\"originally intended to ensure the citizenship rights of newly freed slaves and their families after the Civil War, has evolved into a magnet for alien lawbreakers and a shield for terrorist infiltrators and enemy combatants\\".Malkin, Michelle. \\"What makes an American?\\", Jewish World Review, July 4, 2003. Retrieved July 18, 2009. This is in direct conflict with her own experience as Malkin automatically became a citizen under the same Fourteenth Amendment when she was born in Pennsylvania to parents who were Philippine citizens. Her parents, a physician and a teacher, were here on an employer- sponsored visa. Malkin also opposes sanctuary cities, in which local authorities limit cooperation with national immigration agencies, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).Malkin, Michelle. \\"Sanctuary Nation or Sovereign Nation: It‚Äôs your choice\\" , \\"MichelleMalkin.com\\", August 15, 2007.

In 2019, Malkin gave a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) condemning politicians, including the \\"ghost\\" of recently deceased Senator John McCain, for failing to enact stricter immigration regulation. ===Unemployment benefits=== During an appearance as a news analyst on the roundtable segment of ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos on August 2, 2009, she explained why she opposed another 13-week extension of unemployment benefits: \\"If you put enough government cheese in front of people they are going to just keep eating it and kicking the can down the road... people will just delay getting a job until the three weeks before the benefits run out.\\" ===Women's issues=== In a February 2012 column, Malkin called the \\"War on Women\\" a false narrative, arguing rather that \\"It's the progressive left in this country that has viciously and systematically slimed female conservatives for their beliefs.\\" === Daniel Holtzclaw === Malkin took a special interest in the conviction of Daniel Holtzclaw, whom she advocates as innocent. She has dedicated a significant amount of time and effort to his case, authoring multiple videos and articles on the various issues in his case. ===Legalization of cannabis=== Malkin is a proponent of legalizing the medical use of cannabis, dating back to 1998 when she argued in favor of the passage of Washington State's Initiative 692. She also criticized the war on drugs as a \\"dismal, costly, inefficient failure\\" in a 1997 column titled \\"Liberty Is Biggest Loser In Nation's War On Drugs\\". In a 2014 interview Malkin said she was \\"grateful\\" for the passage of Colorado's Amendment 64 (legalizing recreational use), as it allowed her ailing mother-in-law to easily obtain cannabis. === Support for Holocaust deniers === In 2020, Malkin faced criticism for speaking at a conference hosted by far-right former YouTuber Nick Fuentes and Patrick Casey, head of the neo-Nazi organization known as the American Identity Movement (formerly Identity Evropa). At the conference, Malkin said it was \\"not anti-semitic\\" to question \\"whatever the precise number of people is who perished in World War II.\\" Malkin was dropped by the conservative YAF organization for her support of Fuentes, who has also denied the Holocaust. ==Personal life== While in college at Oberlin, she began dating Jesse Malkin.Kelley, Debbie (September 9, 2019). \\"Michelle Malkin, the Conservative Pundit of El Paso County, Isn't Going Silent\\".

They are one of the easternmost ranges in Virginia (along with the geologically associated Bull Run Mountains and Catoctin Mountain) and the viewshed for the Blue Ridge Mountains through Nelson and Albemarle Counties. The range bisects Nelson, Albemarle, and Orange counties. A portion of the Southwest Mountains in Albemarle County has been designated a Rural Historic District by the National Park Service, though none of the range is designated as state or national parkland. Mineral resources of soapstone and vermiculite continue to be mined here. ==Geology== The Southwest Mountains are underlain by a belt of Catoctin greenstone, which forms the eastern edge of the Blue Ridge anticlinorium. The Catoctin Greenstone belt extends north into Maryland and also supports the Bull Run and Catoctin Mountains. The basalt flows which were metamorphosed to greenstone were deposited during the latest Precambrian age and first uplifted during Grenville Orogeny then again during the Alleghenian Orogeny, in which they were also transported westward to their present location.Frye, Keith.

The town of Needham, Massachusetts, was named after Needham Market. ==History== It initially grew around the wool combing industry, until the onset of the plague, which swept the town from 1663 to 1665. To prevent the spread of the disease, the town was chained at either end, which succeeded in its task but at the cost of two- thirds of the populace. The town did not recover for nearly two hundred years, with the canalisation of the River Gipping in the late 18th Century and the introduction of the railway. Modern Needham Market contains two road names that are linked to the plague. Chainhouse Road, named after the chains that ran across the East end of the town. The Causeway, is a modern variation of 'the corpseway' so called because of the route that plague victims were transported out of town, to neighbouring Barking church for interment. ==Notable buildings== Notable buildings in the town include: * The 15th- century parish church, the church of St. John the Baptist, originally a chapel of ease for the parish of Barking (with a unique double-hammerbeam roof). - Which is currently searching for funding for its unique wooden beamed roof. *The mediaeval Limes Hotel *The Stuart era school. *Hawks Mill * The Victorian railway station, built in 1849. * no.12 High Street.

The town is on the route of the Dunwich Dynamo annual cycle ride. Needham Lake (a former gravel pit) provides leisure facilities and a wildlife habitat. ==Transport== The East Anglia Main Line railway runs through the town, with Needham Market railway station providing trains to Ipswich and Cambridge. The A14 (although then the A45) once ran directly through Needham Market, but a bypass was built in the 1970s. This has left the town with good road links to the surrounding area, but with less traffic than before. ==Notable people== Notable people from Needham include: * Joseph Priestley (1733 ‚Äì 1804), dissenter, who discovered oxygen. * Dykes Alexander (1763 ‚Äì 1849), Quaker businessman and minister. * George Ewart Evans (1909 ‚Äì 1988), author * June Brown (born 1927), actress, who played Dot Cotton in EastEnders * Ros Scott (born 1957), Liberal Democrat peer, a former district and county councillor for the town, chose it for her title. ==References== ==External links== *Needham Market Town Council Category:Towns in Suffolk Category:Market towns in Suffolk Category:Civil parishes in Suffolk Category:Mid Suffolk District ","title":"Needham Market"},{"id":"517931","text":"Se√°n Fortune (1954 ‚Äì 13 March 1999) was a Catholic priest from Ireland, and engaged in child molestation, who allegedly used his position to gain access to his victims.

The current fortress has never been attacked and has remained in continuous use as a garrison. The fortification is based on a star design; it remains virtually unaltered and nowadays is open to visitors with exhibits and facsimiles showing the fort's use at different periods, while still serving as an army barracks. ==The first Fort George== The first Fort George was built in 1727 in Inverness; it was a large fortress capable of housing 400 troops on a hill beside the River Ness, on the site of (and incorporating portions of) the medieval castle which had been rebuilt as a citadel by Oliver Cromwell but later abandoned.

Work began in 1748, with Colonel Skinner in charge, and the Adam brothers, John, Robert and later James, acting as contractors, overseeing around 1,000 soldiers who provided labour and defended the site against attack. By 1757 the main defences were in place, and Fort George was finally completed in 1769. The original budget was ¬£92,673 19s 1d, but the final cost was more than ¬£200,000, a vast figure at the time. ==Fortifications== The fortifications form an example of defence in depth. The main walls are stone-faced, in plan faceted and angled with projecting bastions and redoubts so that every wall face is covered by fire from guns sited on top of other walls. The walls are many yards wide and grassed over, on top of barrel-vaulted casemates which form underground bunkers designed to protect the entire garrison from artillery fire. The approach to the fortress from the landward side is across a wide area of loose shingle which creates a protective barrier. Sloping grassy banks designed to absorb artillery shells all but hide the fort from view. The entrance is reached via a ravelin, a free-standing defensive structure incorporating a guardhouse and completely exposed to fire from the main fort, then by a raised wooden walkway, complete with drawbridge, bridging across a wide ditch set between heavily defended bastions. The ditch forms a wide killing ground openly exposed to gunfire from these walls. ==Operational use== Following the Childers Reforms, the 72nd (Highland) Regiment of Foot and the 78th (Highlanders) Regiment of Foot amalgamated to form the Seaforth Highlanders with its depot in the barracks in 1881. In 1961 the regiment amalgamated with the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders to form the Queen's Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Camerons): the new regiment formed its depot at Fort George at that time. The barracks became the home of the Black Watch, 3rd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland in 2007. In November 2016 the Ministry of Defence announced that the site would close in 2032, with Defence Minister Sir Michael Fallon commenting that it was no longer needed because the Highland rebellions are over. ==Visitor access== The barracks are still in use as a military establishment, but much of the site is open to the public (entrance charge). Historic Environment Scotland use part of one of the barracks to display reconstructions of life in the early days of the fort, and the Grand Magazine displays the Seafield Collection of Arms as well as forming a stage for actors recreating the lives and stories of soldiers in the 18th century. The site received 71,906 visitors during 2018. ===Highlanders' Museum (Queen's Own Highlanders Collection)=== The former Lieutenant Governors‚Äô House is home to the Highlanders' Museum, the official regimental museum of the Queen's Own Highlanders and Lovat Scouts. The exhibits include uniforms, weapons, medals, First World War memorial plaques known as \\"death pennies\\", photographs, paintings, memorabilia and regimental regalia. Displays include the history of the regiments, their links to the clans, the Highland charge, Sergeant Alexander Edwards and other notable regimental members, and the regiments' activities in different conflicts. The regimental Chapel is also open to visitors, and features many regimental colours and memorials. ==Gallery== Image:Fort George - main entrance.jpgA ravelin defends the main entrance to the fort.

Lubumbashi is the mining capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, acting as a hub for many of the country's biggest mining companies. The copper-mining city serves as the capital of the relatively prosperous Haut-Katanga Province and is near the border with Zambia. Population estimates vary widely but average around 1.5 million. == History √âlisabethville under Belgian rule=== The Belgian government established the modern-day government in the city of √âlisabethville (sometimes Elizabethville, both in French, or Elisabethstad in Dutch) in 1910, named in honour of their queen Elisabeth, wife to king Albert I. Britannica, Lubumbashi, britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019 By that time, the government had taken over the colony from King Leopold II, and renamed it as the Belgian Congo. This site was chosen by Vice-Governor-General Emile Wangerm√©e because of its proximity to the copper mine of Etoile du Congo and the copper ore smelting oven installed by Union Mini√®re du Haut Katanga on the nearby Lubumbashi river. The Comit√© Sp√©cial du Katanga (CSK), a semi-private concessionary company set up in 1906, had its headquarters in Elisabethville throughout the colonial era. It enjoyed major privileges, mainly in terms of land and mining concessions, in the Katanga province. The city prospered with the development of a regional copper mining industry.Brion, R. and J.-L. Moreau (2006), De la mine √† Mars, La gen√®se d'Umicore, Tielt : Lannoo. Huge investments in the 1920s, both in the mining industry and in transport infrastructure (railline Elisabethville-Port Francqui and Elisabethville- Dilolo), developed the Katanga province into one of the world's major copper ore producers. The population of the city grew apace from approx. 30,000 in 1930, to 50,000 in 1943 and 180,000 in 1957. It was the second city of the Belgian Congo, after L√©opoldville. The Belgian Quarter in Lubumbashi As was customary in sub-Saharan colonies, the city centre of Elisabethville was reserved for the white (European) population. This consisted mainly of Belgian nationals, but the city also attracted important British and Italian communities, as well as Jewish Greeks. Congolese were allowed in the white city only during the day, except for the house servants (\\"boys\\") who often lived in shanty dwellings (\\"boyeries\\") located in the backyards of the European city houses. Many men in the black population were labour immigrants from neighbouring regions in the Belgian Congo (Northern Katanga, Maniema, Kasa√Ø), from Belgian Rwanda and Burundi, and from British Northern Rhodesia (Zambia).Fetter, Bruce (1976), The Creation of Elisabethville, 1910‚Äì1940, Stanford: Hoover Institution Press. The black population lived initially in a so-called cit√© indig√®ne called quartier Albert (now: Kamalondo), south of the city centre and separated from the white city by a 700-metres-wide neutral zone. With population growth, new indigenous quarters were created. These still form the main suburbs of present-day Lubumbashi: Kenia, Katuba, Ruashi. The work and businesses related to the mines made Elisabethville the most prosperous region of the Congo during the final decade of Belgian rule. In 1954 there were 8,000 black home owners in the city while thousands more were skilled workers. It was estimated that black Africans living in Elisabethville had a higher standard of living than anywhere else on the continent at that time.John Gunther,Inside Africa, Hamish Hamilton Ltd. London, 1955, page 640 Lubumbashi: 1920s Palace of Justice Miners in √âlisabethville conducted a strike in December 1941 to protest the increasingly severe forced-labor regime that the Belgians imposed on the population because of the \\"war efforts\\".Dibwe dia Mwembu, Donatien (2001), Histoire des conditions de vie des travailleurs de l'Union Mini√®re du Haut-Katanga et G√©camines, 1910‚Äì1999, Lubumbashi : Presses Universitaires de Lubumbashi. A rally in the Union Mini√®re football stadium got out of hand. Police opened fire and numerous protesters were killed. In early 1944, the city was again in the grip of severe tensions and fear of violent protests, following a mutiny of the Force Publique (army) in Luluabourg.Rubens, Antoine (1945), Dettes de guerre, Lubumbashi: L'essor du Congo. Starting in 1933, the Belgian colonial authorities experimented with a limited form of self-governance by establishing the cit√© indig√®ne of Elisabethville as a so-called \\"centre extra-coutumier\\" (a centre not subject to customary law). It was administered by an indigenous council and presided over by an indigenous chief. But, due to constant interference from the Belgian authorities, the experiment soon proved a failure.Gr√©visse, F. (1951), Le Centre Extra-Coutumier d‚ÄôElisabethville, Elisabethville-Bruxelles: CEPSI- Institut Royal Colonial Belge. The first indigenous chief ‚Äì Albert Kabongo ‚Äì appointed in 1937, was dismissed in 1943 and not replaced. In 1957 Elisabethville was established as a fully autonomous city; it held the first free municipal elections in which the Congolese could vote. The people of √âlisabethville gave a vast majority to the nationalist Alliance des Bakongo, which demanded immediate independence from Belgium. Elisabethville functioned as the administrative capital of the Katanga province. It was also an important commercial and industrial centre, and a centre of education and health services. The Benedictine Order and missionary Order of Salesians offered a wide range of educational facilities to Europeans and Congolese alike, including vocational training (Kafubu). The Belgians established the University of √âlisabethville in 1954‚Äì1955 (now the University of Lubumbashi). Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral Lubumbashi in 2011 === Lubumbashi from 1960 === √âlisabethville served as the capital and centre of the secessionist independent state of Katanga during the 1960‚Äì1963 Congolese civil war. Moise Tshombe proclaimed Katangan independence in July 1960. Congolese leaders arrested him and charged him with treason in April 1961; however, he agreed to dismiss his foreign advisers and military forces in exchange for his release. Tshombe returned to √âlisabethville but repudiated these assurances and began to fight anew. United Nations troops opposed Katangan forces and took control of the city in December 1961 under a strong mandate. Roger Trinquier, well known for his published works on counter-insurgency warfare, served as a French military advisor to President Tshombe until international pressure, led by Belgium, caused his recall to France. Mobutu Sese Seko ultimately assumed power of the Congo, which he renamed Za√Øre. He renamed √âlisabethville as \\"Lubumbashi\\" in 1966 and in 1972 renamed Katanga as \\"Shaba.\\" In May 1990, the university campus of Lubumbashi was the scene of a brutal killing of students by Mobutu's security forces. In 1991‚Äì92 ethnic tensions between the Luba from Katanga and the Luba from Kasa√Ø, resident in the city, led to violent confrontations and the forced removal from the city of the latter. Congo entered another genocidal civil war in the late 1990s. The Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo rebels captured Lubumbashi in April 1997. Rebel leader Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila spoke from Lubumbashi to declare himself president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 17 May 1997 after Mobutu Sese Seko fled Kinshasa. When Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila decided to appoint a transitional parliament, in 1999, he decided to install the Parliament in Lubumbashi, in order to consolidate the fragile unity of the country. The parliament was installed in the building of the National Assembly of secessionist Katanga (the former city theatre), which had its capital in this city as well, in the 1960s. Lubumbashi was therefore the Legislative capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 1999 to 2003, when all the country's central institutions were brought back to Kinshasa. On 7 September 2010 a large prison break happened in Lubumbashi after gunmen attacked a prison on the outskirts of the city. 960 prisoners managed to escape, including the Mai-Mai leader G√©d√©on Kyungu Mutanga. On 23 March 2013 a militia group of 100 fighters attacked Lubumbashi and seized a United Nations compound, which was surrounded by Congolese soldiers and members of the president's Republican Guard. == Geography == :See also: Lubumbashi lies at around above sea level. The high altitude serves to cool the climate, which would otherwise be very hot. The Kafue River rises along the Zambian border near the city and meanders through north-central Zambia to the Zambezi River, cutting a long, deep panhandle into the country. ===Climate=== Lubumbashi has a dry-winter humid subtropical climate (Cwa, according to the K√∂ppen climate classification), with warm rainy summers and pleasant, dry winters, with most rainfall occurring during summer and early autumn. Annual average rainfall is 1,238 mm (48.75 inches). {style=\\"width:100%;text-align:center;line- height:1.2em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\\" class=\\" mw- collapsible\\" - !Colspan=14Maximum UV index for Lubumbashi - !Month !Jan !Feb !Mar !Apr !May !Jun !Jul !Aug !Sep !Oct !Nov !Dec !Year - !Average Ultraviolet index 6b49c8;color:#000000;\\"11+ 6b49c8;color:#000000;\\"11+ 6b49c8;color:#000000;\\"11+ 6b49c8;color:#000000;\\"11+ d8001d;color:#FFFFFF;\\"10 d8001d;color:#FFFFFF;\\"9 d8001d;color:#FFFFFF;\\"9 6b49c8;color:#000000;\\"11 6b49c8;color:#000000;\\"11+ 6b49c8;color:#000000;\\"11+ 6b49c8;color:#000000;\\"11+ 6b49c8;color:#000000;\\"11+ d8001d;color:#FFFFFF;border-left-width:medium\\"10.8 - !Colspan=14 f8f9fa;font-weight:normal;font- size:95%;\\"Source: weather2travel.com } == Demography  Language(s) === French is the official language, but the main spoken lingua franca in Lubumbashi is Kiswahili. The dialect of Kiswahili spoken all down the east side of Congo (including the provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu, Maniema, Katanga and Oriental, Western Kasai and Eastern Kasai) and almost all the way across to the Katangan border with Angola is called Kingwana. As many people have moved into Lubumbashi for employment from rural areas, they have brought many other local languages including Kiluba, Chokwe, Bemba and Kisanga. Kiswahili has been the chief language shared by most people. === Religious expression === Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lubumbashi (Catholic Church), Kimbanguist Church, Baptist Community of Congo (Baptist World Alliance), Baptist Community of the Congo River (Baptist World Alliance), Assemblies of God, Assemblies of God, Province of the Anglican Church of the Congo (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Community in Congo (World Communion of Reformed Churches). J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, ‚Äò‚ÄòReligions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices‚Äô‚Äô, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 777 On April 5, 2020, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced plans to construct a temple in Lubumbashi, its second temple in the country. https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/new-temples- april-2020-general-conference There are also Muslim mosques. == Economy == Lubumbashi serves as an important commercial and national industrial centre. Manufactures include textiles, food products and beverages, printing, bricks, and copper smelting. The city is home to the Simba brewery, producing the famous Tembo beer. The city hosts the headquarters of one of the country's largest banks, Trust Merchant Bank. The airline Korongo Airlines, a joint- venture between Brussels Airlines and the Belgian multinational Groupe George Forrest International, also maintains its head office in Lubumbashi. The area also has a daily newspaper. Storefronts in Lubumbashi ===Mining=== Lubumbashi, the mining capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is a base for many of the country's biggest mining companies. The Democratic Republic of Congo produces \\"more than 3 percent of the world's copper and half its cobalt, most of which comes from Katanga.\\" == Transport == Lubumbashi International Airport ===Road=== The city is crossed by Transafican Highway 9 (TAH 9), which connects it to the cities of Lusaka and Kolwezi. ===Rail=== Lubumbashi is the center of the railway lines from Cape to Cairo Railway, which serves as a link with the cities of Ndola, Ilebo, Kindu and Sakania. In Tenke, the city connects with Kolwezi, through the Benguela railway. ===Air=== Lubumbashi is home to the modern Lubumbashi International Airport. The city serves as a distribution centre for such minerals as copper, cobalt, zinc, tin, and coal. == Education == University of Lubumbashi The largest institution of higher education is the University of Lubumbashi, founded in 1955, with also the teaching institutions Protestant University of Lubumbashi and the Graduate Institute of Health Sciences. The Belgian international school √âcole Priv√©e Belge de Lubumbashi and the French international school √âtablissement scolaire fran√ßais Blaise-Pascal are in the city. == Urban infrastructure Parks=== Muyambo Kyasa popularized the concept of parks. Muyambo Park opened in 2010. Located about 15 km from Lubumbashi, it is a large garden where children can play games, and adults relax. Other parks (or farms) include Mikembo and Futuka (once a reserve, now closed) on Kasenga Road in the city's outskirts. ===Zoo=== The zoo of Lubumbashi is one of the most visited tourist attractions. It was created during the colonial period, and is considered the nicest zoo in the country. During the years of war, it deteriorated but it has been rehabilitated by AZLU, a non-profit organization. By 2007, great animals had been acquired for the zoo. AZLU is keeping the zoo ‚Äúfor education purposes, and the protection of the natural heritage of the country,‚Äù as it can be read on signs. Today, it has almost been restocked with lions, tigers, monkeys, apes, pelicans, wart hogs, crocodiles, snakes, turtles, monitor lizards, eagles, parrots, ostriches, gazelles, etc. Apart from animals, the zoo features a restaurant, a veterinary center, and a termite museum. == Culture == Attractions in the city include a botanical garden, a zoo, and the regional archaeological and ethnological National Museum of Lubumbashi. Every two years, the Biennale of Lubumbashi is held across the city, showcasing works by artists from the region. In an interview in Ocula Magazine in 2019, the Biennale's artistic director, Sandrine Colard explained, 'The Congo is a country that is perpetually in the future. All of these different periods coalescing in one city is something I wanted to address.' ===Art=== Bogumi≈Ç Jewsiewicki says that contemporary Lubumbashi art making is weak, especially when compared to the Kinshasan. He writes, > ‚ÄúNo Lubumbashi popular painter has had an international career like that of > the Kinshasa artist Ch√©ri Samba, and there are in fact a number of artists > and musicians in Kinshasa whom the whirlwind of international success has > whisked farther from local audiences than any artist in Lubumbashi, and not > only in Lubumbashi but in the surrounding province of Katanga.‚Äù Brassinne, > J. and Kestergat, J. (1991). Qui a tu√© Patrice Lumumba? Paris : Duculot. P > 141. . He names painters like Pilipili, Mwenze, Angali, Nkulu wa Nkulu, Maka, Tshimbumba, Dekab, and others. ===Cinema=== Cin√© B√©tamax, formerly ‚ÄúCin√© Palace‚Äù and ‚ÄúCin√© Eden‚Äù,Jewsiewicki, B. (1999). A Congo Chronicle: Patrice Lumumba in Urban Art. New York: The Museum for African Art. P 13. are the only modern movie theaters in the city. They generally show popular recent Hollywood productions as well as NC-17 films. However, they also show movies about Congolese and African recent history like Mister Bob, Sniper: Reloaded, SEAL Team 8: Behind Enemy Lines, and Tears of the Sun. Before films, they both showed Congolese and international music videos, and US wrestling. Cin√© B√©tamax primarily addresses the young adults of Lubumbashi. Children are exposed to huge NC-17 posters, but seldom get in. The communication department of the University of Lubumbashi has collaborated with the movie theater to show students‚Äô films. Cin√© B√©tamax in particular also screens great football matches, and local singers‚Äô concerts and Christian meetings are regularly held here. All over the city, especially in crowded neighborhoods, are spread small rooms in which children are exposed to violent movies from morning to night. Nigeria's Nollywood films are also, as in many other parts of the DRC and Africa, popular among the residents. These films are often sold on VCD and DVD platforms. ===Music=== The popular music from Kinshasa is much appreciated and played in Lubumbashi. Jean-Bosco Mwenda is likely the most famous Katangese musician. Many of his songs have become classical, and are endlessly remixed by new young artists. Modern Lubumbashi singers fall into two groups: those who play Soukous, such as Jo Kizi and K√©pi Prince, and those who play international urban music, such as Ced Koncept, Tshumani, M-Joe, RJ Kanyera, Oxyg√®ne, Agresivo, Nelson Tshi, and Da Costa on the other. Most artists are influenced by successful Dj Spilulu's productions, Kinshasa singers Fally Ipupa, Ferre Gola and World Music. Lubumbashi music is characterized by the use of many languages (Swahili, Lingala, Tshiluba, French and some English) in the lyrics. It is rare to hear songs composed in only one language. This code switching and mixing expresses the cosmopolitan character of the city, but some critics think it weakens the lyrics, which seem to be particularly made for teenagers anyway. Serge Manseba and Karibyona are humorist-singers featured by G'Sparks. ===French cultural influence=== The ‚ÄúInstitut Fran√ßais‚Äù (formally known as ‚ÄúCentre Culturel Fran√ßais‚Äù), located in the heart of the city, contributes a great deal to the cultural and artistic life of Lubumbashi. Students and researchers spend time in its library; it shows European and other French-language films; produces plays and other shows in its theater; and features local singers‚Äô records for sale on display at the entrance. ===Radio Okapi's cultural participation=== Radio Okapi's Lubumbashi presenters participate each Saturday evening in ‚Äúm√©tissage,‚Äù the cultural program of the radio. The whole country is informed of the cultural activities in the city. == Media National channel (RTNC/Katanga)=== RTNC (Congolese National Radio and Television) has a provincial station located in Lubumbashi district at the junction of Lubilanshi and Sandoa. It has been very influential from the 1960s to the mid-1990s, at the end of the one-party system, and before the information technology revolution. ===Independent channels=== Zenith Radio, the first independent radio station in the city, started broadcasting in 1996; since then numerous radio and television stations have been established. They can be classified in three groups: religious channels (Zenith, RTIV, Cannal de Vie, RNS, etc.), commercial channels (RTA, Mwangaza, Nyota, RTLJ, Mala√Øka, Kyondo, etc.), and mixed ones like Wantanshi Radio and Television. == Sports Football=== Football is the most popular sport in Lubumbashi. The city is home to football clubs of the top national level such as FC Saint Eloi Lupopo, CS Don Bosco and TP Mazembe. TP Mazembe is the most successful club in national competitions and the most successful Congolese club in international football achieving 5 Africa's Champions League and reaching a FIFA Club World Cup final. The Chairman of Mazembe is the former governor of the province of Katanga Mo√Øse Katumbi Chapwe. Until 1960, Congolese football was segregated between whites- only and blacks-only leagues and competitions. In 1911 the whites-only Ligue de Football du Katanga was founded in Elisabethville, organising in 1925 the first official local championship called the B. Smith Cup. The Katanga tournament was won by teams from Lubumbashi every recorded season except 2005. Simultaneously three blacks-only regional tournaments were played in the country. In 1950, the 'black' Elisabethville Football Association (FASI, F√©d√©rations et Associations Sportives Indig√®nes) had over 30 affiliated clubs competing in four leagues divided over 3 divisions. Both black and white tournaments in Lubumbashi and the country were played simultaneously until 1960, when they were unified. Since then the traditionally black clubs have dominated both local and national football. The 'black' Ligue de Football du Elisabethville, now renamed the Ligue de Football du Lubumbashi, is the city's football tournament, organized since 1960 by the city's federation EFLU. FC Saint-Eloi Lupopo won the EFLU league 25 times in all up to 2003 being the most successful club in the seasons for which records are known (some are not known). ===Basketball=== Basketball players Myck Kabongo and Bismack Biyombo are from Lubumbashi.

Once an important port for shipping grain and a coal mining town, it is still a small fishing port making use of traditional coble boats. == Name == Newbiggin derives its name from the Old English nƒ´we (new) + Middle English bigging (building, house),Anthony David Mills, A Dictionary of British Place-Names (Oxford, 2003) and may refer to an extension of the early settlement and parish of Woodhorn. === Early history === The church was for centuries a chapel only, with a tower surmounted by a spire which was originally used as a beacon. In the 14th century, Newbiggin was a very important maritime centre, called upon to support Edward III in his campaigns against the Scots. In the Middle Ages, Newbiggin was a major port for the shipping of grain, third in importance after London and Hull. Henry III granted a charter for a weekly market on Monday and an annual fair; in 1337, as a borough of note, it sent bailiffs to a council on matters of state, convened by the Bishop of Lincoln, the Earl of Warwick and other noblemen. === 1800 ‚Äì present === In 1805, two boats, with nineteen men, were lost in a storm off Newbiggin, after which ¬£1,700 was donated by fundraising in the Newcastle region to relieve the bereaved families. As early as 1828, Newbiggin was a popular beach resort, with facilities to cater for visitors. The town had five public houses, one of which had a spa-like array of bathing facilities, several shops and lodging houses. The village featured a shore, which, being a fine smooth beach about a mile in length, was well suited for bathing, and, by 1848, was much frequented in warmer seasons. Several well-built guesthouses took hold. The bay gave good anchorage for small vessels, but even then was very little used, except for the numerous boats belonging to the fishery, in which most of the inhabitants were employed. The plentiful fish caught were herring, cod, ling, haddock, salmon, trout, turbot, halibut, soles, lobsters and crabs, not only for the supply of the neighbouring markets but the region; and buildings for the curing of herrings. == Governance == Newbiggin-by-the- Sea has a town council. Under the Local Government Act 1972 Newbiggin-by-the- Sea became part of the local government district of Wansbeck in 1974. The local government district was abolished in 2009, with its responsibilities transferred to the Northumberland County Council unitary authority. Newbiggin- by-the-Sea is in the UK Parliamentary constituency of Wansbeck, which since the 2010 General Election has been represented at Westminster by Ian Lavery MP. Wansbeck is one of Northumberland's four Parliamentary constituencies. The former local government district of Wansbeck and the Parliamentary constituency of Wansbeck both derive their names from the River Wansbeck which flows into the North Sea near Newbiggin-by-the-Sea. == Economy == Fishing has always been associated with Newbiggin, although later many inhabitants were employed in coal mining. By the Victorian era, Newbiggin was Northumberland's favourite seaside town, attracting hundreds of visitors every day in the summer months. In 1869, there were 142 cobles (fishing boats) in Newbiggin-by- the-Sea. Newbiggin Colliery was sunk in 1908. The colliery closed in 1967, but at its peak in 1940, 1,400 men were employed there. The former Newbiggin Colliery Band is now the Jayess Newbiggin Brass Band, named for its president and former member, cornet legend James Shepherd. To date, there are 72 active companies based in Newbiggin.https://suite.endole.co.uk/explorer/?id=0DE618985 == Landmarks == The 13th century Parish Church of St Bartholomew, Newbiggin- by-the-SeaThe town was at the end of the first telegraph cable from Scandinavia in 1868, and was laid from Jutland, Denmark.

A ¬£10,000,000 renovation to rebuild and improve Newbiggin's rapidly eroding beach involved importing 500,000 tonnes of sand from Skegness, delivered by the trailing suction hopper dredger (TSHD) Oranje and deposited on the beach through a pipe approximately in diameter. A new offshore breakwater was installed to accompany the matching breakwater on the opposite side of the bay. Also installed is a brass statue by sculptor Sean Henry named Couple, anchored in the centre of the bay.

The chancel, the east and western bays of arcades and the west tower are all 13th century, while the spire dates to the 14th century. The Church of St Mary the Virgin, Woodhorn (commonly known as 'Woodhorn Church') is the oldest building in Wansbeck, with parts dating back to the 11th century, but has not functioned as a church since 1973.

In its final years, the fair was set out in the following format: starting at the beginning of the shopping area of Front Street, up to the Cresswell Arms public house flowing into Church Point car park and continuing along the seafront promenade. The lifeboat house and boatyard became the music venue. A stage replaced the boats and the lifeboat house opened its doors, serving food and afternoon tea. Appearances were made by Slade, Leo Sayer and TV show Gladiators star Michael Van Wijk. Starting in 2010, the annual Old Ship Music Festival is attempting to bring back a summer event to the village. It invites bands from the region and worldwide to play, as well as local comedians, and raises money for charity with the help of local businesses. In 2010 it raised ¬£700 for Help for Heroes, where in 2011, the chosen charity was the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, and raised ¬£1,100. == Notable people == John Braine was working at the library in Newbiggin (1954‚Äì56) when he wrote his best-selling novel Room at the Top. == References == == External links == *Visit Newbiggin - The Official Visitor website for Newbiggin-by-the-Sea *Newbiggin Photos *Newbiggin Town Council Category:Seaside resorts in England Category:Towns in Northumberland Category:Populated coastal places in Northumberland Category:Civil parishes in Northumberland ","title":"Newbiggin-by-the-Sea"},{"id":"517949","text":"Newbiggin may refer to several places in England: ;in Cumbria * Newbiggin, Ainstable, in the Eden district * Newbiggin, Copeland, a location * Newbiggin, Hutton Roof, in the parish of Hutton Roof * Newbiggin, Dacre, in Eden district, west of Penrith * Newbiggin, Temple Sowerby, in Eden district, east of Penrith * Newbiggin, Furness, in South Lakeland district * Newbiggin-on- Lune, in Eden district, near Kirkby Stephen ;in Derbyshire *Newbiggin, a former name of Biggin (Dovedale and Parwich Ward) ;in County Durham * Newbiggin, Lanchester * Newbiggin, Teesdale ;in North Yorkshire * Newbiggin, Askrigg, on the north side of Wensleydale * Newbiggin, North Yorkshire, on the south side of Wensleydale ;in Northumberland * Newbiggin-by-the-Sea ==See also== *Newbigging (disambiguation) ","title":"Newbiggin"},{"id":"517951","text":"Brown sugar crystals Brown sugar is a sucrose sugar product with a distinctive brown color due to the presence of molasses. It is either an unrefined or partially refined soft sugar consisting of sugar crystals with some residual molasses content (natural brown sugar), or it is produced by the addition of molasses to refined white sugar (commercial brown sugar). The Codex Alimentarius requires brown sugar to contain at least 88% of sucrose plus invert sugar.The Codex Alimentarius Commission. (2009; 2010). Codex Alimentarius ‚Äì 212.1 Scope and Description. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Commercial brown sugar contains from 3.5% molasses (light brown sugar) to 6.5% molasses (dark brown sugar) based on total volume. Based on total weight, regular commercial brown sugar contains up to 10% molasses. The product is naturally moist from the hygroscopic nature of the molasses and is often labelled as \\"soft.\\" The product may undergo processing to give a product that flows better for industrial handling. The addition of dyes or other chemicals may be permitted in some areas or for industrial products. Particle size is variable but generally less than granulated white sugar. Products for industrial use (e.g., the industrial production of cakes) may be based on caster sugar which has crystals of approximately 0.35 mm. ==Production== Brown sugar is often produced by adding sugarcane molasses to completely refined white sugar crystals to more carefully control the ratio of molasses to sugar crystals and to reduce manufacturing costs. Brown sugar prepared in this manner is often much coarser than its unrefined equivalent and its molasses may be easily separated from the crystals by simply washing to reveal the underlying white sugar crystals; in contrast, with unrefined brown sugar, washing will reveal underlying crystals which are off-white due to the inclusion of molasses. The molasses usually used for food is obtained from sugar cane, because the flavor is generally preferred over beet sugar molasses, although in some areas, especially in Belgium and the Netherlands, sugar beet molasses is used. The white sugar used can be from either beet or cane, as the chemical composition, nutritional value, color, and taste of fully refined white sugar is for practical purposes the same, no matter from what plant it originates. Even with less-than-perfect refining, the small differences in color, odor, and taste of the white sugar will be masked by the molasses. ==History== In the late 19th century, the newly consolidated refined white sugar industry, which did not have full control over brown sugar production, mounted a smear campaign against brown sugar, reproducing microscopic photographs of harmless but repulsive-looking microbes living in brown sugar. The effort was so successful that by 1900, a best-selling cookbook warned that brown sugar was of inferior quality and was susceptible to infestation by \\"a minute insect\\".Levenstein, Harvey. Revolution at the Table Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003. 32‚Äì33 This campaign of disinformation was also felt in other sectors using raw or brown sugar such as brewing; ==Natural brown sugar== Brown sugar examples: Muscovado (top), dark brown (left), light brown (right) unclarified Whole cane sugar, clarified Natural brown sugar, raw sugar or whole cane sugar are sugars that retain a small to large amount of the molasses from the mother liquor (the partially evaporated sugar cane juice). Based upon weight, brown cane sugar when fully refined yields up to 70% white sugar, the degree depending on how much molasses remained in the sugar crystals, which in turn is dependent upon whether the brown sugar was centrifuged or not. As there is more molasses in natural brown sugar, it contains minor nutritional value and mineral content. Some natural brown sugars have particular names and characteristics, and are sold as turbinado, demerara or raw sugar if they have been centrifuged to a large degree. Brown sugars that have been only mildly centrifuged or unrefined (non-centrifuged) retain a much higher degree of molasses and are called various names across the globe according to their country of origin: e.g. panela, rapadura, jaggery, muscovado, piloncillo, etc. Although brown sugar has been touted as having health benefits ranging from soothing menstrual cramps to serving as an anti-aging skin treatment, there is no nutritional basis to support brown sugar as a healthier alternative to refined sugars despite the negligible amounts of minerals in brown sugar not found in white sugar. Turbinado, demerara and \\"raw\\" sugars are made from crystallized, partially evaporated sugar cane juice and spun in a centrifuge to remove almost all of the molasses. The sugar crystals are large and golden-coloured. This sugar can be sold as is or sent to the refinery to produce white sugar. Muscovado, panela, piloncillo, chancaca, jaggery and other natural dark brown sugars have been minimally centrifuged or not at all. Typically these sugars are made in smaller factories or \\"cottage industries\\" in developing nations, where they are produced with traditional practices that do not make use of industrialized vacuum evaporators or centrifuges. They are commonly boiled in open pans upon wood-fired stoves until the sugar cane juice reaches approximately 30% of the former volume and sucrose crystallization begins. They are then poured into molds to solidify or onto cooling pans where they are beaten or worked vigorously to produce a granulated brown sugar. In some countries, such as Mauritius or the Philippines, a natural brown sugar called muscovado is produced by partially centrifuging the evaporated and crystallizing cane juice to create a sugar-crystal rich mush, which is allowed to drain under gravity to produce varying degrees of molasses content in the final product. This process approximates a slightly modernized practice introduced in the 19th century to generate a better quality of natural brown sugar.Larkin, W. (1993) Sugar and the Origins of Modern Philippine Society, pp 55‚Äì58. Orr, W. (1844) The Magazine of Domestic Economy, Volume 5. pp 107Jaffe, W. (2014) Non centrifugal cane sugar (NCS) (panela, jaggery, gur, muscovado) process technology and the need of its innovation, A similar Japanese version of uncentrifuged natural cane sugar is called kokuto ( kokut≈ç). This is a regional specialty of Okinawa and is often sold in the form of large lumps. It is sometimes used to make shochu. Okinawan brown sugar is sometimes referred to as 'black sugar' for its darker colour compared to other types of unrefined sugar, although when broken up into smaller pieces its colour becomes lighter. Kokuto is commonly used as a flavouring for drinks and desserts, but can also be eaten raw as it has a taste similar to caramel. The sugar is also thought to be rich in nutrients removed during the refinement process of other sugars, such as potassium and iron. ==Culinary considerations== Brown sugar adds flavor to desserts and baked goods. It can be substituted for maple sugar, and maple sugar can be substituted for it in recipes. Brown sugar caramelizes much more readily than refined sugar, and this effect can be used to make glazes and gravies brown while cooking. For domestic purposes one can create the exact equivalent of brown sugar by mixing white sugar with molasses. Suitable proportions are about one tablespoon of molasses to each cup of sugar (one- sixteenth of the total volume). Molasses comprises 10% of brown sugar's total weight, which is about one ninth of the white sugar weight. Due to varying qualities and colors of molasses products, for lighter or darker sugar, reduce or increase its proportion according to taste. In following a modern recipe that specifies \\"brown sugar\\", one usually may assume that the intended meaning is light brown sugar, but which one prefers is largely a matter of taste. Even in recipes such as cakes, where the moisture content might be critical, the amount of water involved is too small to matter. More importantly, adding dark brown sugar or molasses will impart a stronger flavor, with more of a suggestion of caramel. Brown sugar that has hardened can be made soft again by adding a new source of moisture for the molasses, or by heating and remelting the molasses. Storing brown sugar in a freezer will prevent moisture from escaping and molasses from crystallizing, allowing for a much longer shelf life. ==Nutritional value== One hundred grams of brown sugar contains 377 Calories (nutrition table), as opposed to 387 Calories in white sugar (link to nutrition table). However, brown sugar packs more densely than white sugar due to the smaller crystal size and may have more calories when measured by volume. Any minerals present in brown sugar come from the molasses added to the white sugar. In a 100-gram reference amount, brown sugar contains 15% of the Daily Value for iron, with no other vitamins or minerals in significant content (table). ==See also== * Caramelization * Peen tong ‚Äì a Chinese brown sugar and candy *Sugar Industry ==References== Category:Sugar ja:ÈªíÁ†ÇÁ≥ñ ","title":"Brown sugar"},{"id":"517952","text":"Gorman may refer to: == People == * Gorman (surname) and list of people with the surname == Places in the United States== * Gorman, California * Gorman, Maryland * Gorman, North Carolina * Gorman, South Dakota * Gorman, Texas * Gorman Township, Otter Tail County, Minnesota == Other == * Bishop Gorman High School, private high school in Las Vegas, Nevada affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church * Gorman, an Australian fashion label founded by Lisa Gorman * Siebe Gorman, British commercial diving equipment company == See also == * Are You Dave Gorman?, British television show featuring Dave Gorman * Wilson‚ÄìGorman Tariff Act, or the Revenue Act, 1894, reduced U.S. tariff rates from the 1890 McKinley tariff * Justice Gorman (disambiguation) * O'Gorman, a surname ","title":"Gorman"},{"id":"517953","text":"Richard Terfry (born March 4, 1972), better known by his stage name Buck 65, is a Canadian alternative hip hop artist. Underpinned by an extensive background in abstract hip hop, his more recent music has extensively incorporated blues, country, rock, folk and avant-garde influences. Terfry is also a radio host, hosting the weekday Drive show on CBC Music since September 2, 2008. In addition, he once hosted a weekday program on CBC Radio 3's web radio station. ==HistoryEarly career and influences=== Terfry was born in 1972 and raised in Mount Uniacke, Nova Scotia, a rural community 40 km north of Halifax. Terfry was initially interested in pursuing a career in professional baseball, and at age 16, was scouted by the New York Yankees; however, his dream was ended following a shoulder injury. He was first exposed to rap music in the mid-1980s while listening to CBC Stereo's late night show Brave New Waves, and then by listening to Halifax campus community radio station CKDU. CKDU then broadcast at only 33 watts, and he had to climb a tree in his yard to hear the station's hip hop show on his radio. Fascinated by hip hop, the young Terfry taught himself how to rap, DJ, and, later, to produce records. In 1990, Terfry self-produced his first song, \\"The Rhyme Has To Be Good\\", which later received airplay on the Halifax college radio station. His musical influences include MC Shan, David Lynch, Gitche Manitou and Kool Keith. Using the moniker DJ Critical, he later hosted a hip-hop show on CKDU called The Bassment (later renamed The Treatment Program when he assumed the stage name Jesus Murphy), which aired for several years. This period overlapped with many of his non-major-label releases. ===Stage names=== Buck 65 has used a number of other stage names including Johnny Rockwell, Stinkin' Rich, Haslam, and Uncle Climax. These pseudonyms typically represent different characters in his raps (as in Uncle Climax, Johnny Rockwell and Stinkin' Rich) or different aspects of Buck's creativity (as noted above, DJ Critical was his DJ name on CKDU). He explains the origin of his main performance name as follows: \\"I was born with the name Richard Terfry. Where I come from, it's common when a boy is named after his father, for the father to refer to the son as 'Buck'. I don't know where that comes from or when it started. It might be a 'out-in-the-country' thing. Growing up I knew lots of sons who were referred to as 'Buck'. Sometimes even if they weren't juniors. So the joke became, I was one of 65 (a number picked randomly) 'Bucks' in my town.\\" However, when appearing on Andy Kershaw's radio show in the UK on August 8, 2004, he gave a totally different explanation: some of his earliest public performances were with an older blues musician who used to joke that Terfry's regularity at showing up made him as reliable as a 1965 Buick. The nickname Buick 65 stuck until it was misprinted on a publicity poster as 'Buck 65' which he then adopted as his stage name. Buck 65 has recorded an EP under the name of Dirk Thornton alongside Irishman DJ Flip, it was scheduled for release early 2007 but the date was not set. The first release under Dirk Thornton was a 7-inch vinyl single with the tracks \\"Yesterday's News\\" and \\"Catwalk.\\" ===Early releases=== In 1993, he released his first cassette of rap tunes while performing under the alias Stinkin' Rich on the Halifax label No Records. The five song cassette was titled Chin Music, which was a reference to his interest in baseball. The release brought Stinkin' Rich to the attention of members of Halifax alternative rock band Sloan. Sloan signed him to their independent record label Murderecords\\"Exclaim!: Halifax Hip-Hop Anticipates the Big Bang\\". HipHopCanada, May 1, 2000 and released a 7-inch single and a full length cassette called Game Tight, again featuring a reference to baseball. As Stinkin' Rich, he also appeared on numerous songs by Halifax hip hop band Hip Club Groove.\\"Stinkin' Rich is in yer face: As rock \`n' roll shuffles toward middle age, hip hop has grabbed the cool corner of the street\\". Halifax Daily News, April 30, 1995. After a brief break, Terfry returned reconstituted as Buck 65, releasing Weirdo Magnet (on Metaforensics) and Language Arts in 1996, followed by Vertex in 1997 (both on Four Ways to Rock/Metaforensics), and the 12\\" single The Wildlife (on Hand'Solo Records) in 1998. He recorded \\"Sebutonedef\\" (released in 1996 by Funtrip Records) as a collaboration with fellow Halifax artist Sixtoo. Other releases by the duo, known as Sebutones, are Psoriasis and 50/50 Where It Counts. While still far from mainstream success, he received several odd jobs in Canada's entertainment industry, including making soundtrack music and providing narration for a TV commercial for NBA apparel, and song lyrics for the popular children's program Sesame Street. Man Overboard, originally released on Anticon in 2001, was a significant turning point in his career. The record, and the entire Anticon collective (of which Sixtoo was also a part), were considered hallmarks of a new avant-garde movement in underground hip hop. It was at this time that Buck met Cincinnati DJ Mr. Dibbs, who inducted him into the 1200 Hobos, a loosely knit hip-hop collective named for their proficiency in manipulating the Technics 1200 turntable. Also in 2001, Buck performed at the Snow Jam festival in 2001,\\"Live: Snow Jam Halifax Citadel Hill Halifax, NS\\".. Chart Attack, September 19, 2001, Review by: Ryan O'Connor and later that year, he released his next studio album, Synesthesia, on Endemik Records; the album was re-released the next year with a significantly different track listing on Warner Music Canada. ===Major label releases=== Buck 65 at Storsj√∂yran in Sweden in 2007 In 2002, Buck 65 signed a record deal with Warner Music Canada, which subsequently released much of his back catalogue, including Weirdo Magnet, Language Arts, Vertex, Man Overboard, and Synesthesia. During this time, he released two albums for the label, the first being Square in 2002, which was nominated for a Juno Award in 2003 for Alternative Album of the Year and Album Design of the Year. In 2003, Buck 65 released Talkin' Honky Blues, which saw a major stylistic shift in his music, incorporating elements of country music, folk, bluegrass, and electronica, amongst other musical styles; it later won the 2004 Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year.\\"CARAS Scores A Hit With 2004 Juno Awards\\". Soul Shine. 2004-04-05 After a deal was signed with V2 Records in the United States, This Right Here Is Buck 65 was released in early 2005. The album is a compilation of previously released songs, re-recordings, and B-sides that was marketed as an introduction to his work for U.S. audiences. However, after V2 chose not to release his next effort, Secret House Against the World, the deal was amicably dissolved. Secret House Against the World was released in 2005 by Warner Music Canada, and saw Buck further experimenting with varying musical styles. Buck 65 gained additional recognition in 2006 when he appeared at the national Juno Awards with Pamela Anderson. ===Dirty Work, Situation and Dirtbike=== In late 2006, Buck 65 released a 5-song digital EP called Dirty Work. It was released over a month-long campaign, adding one song per week for free download via his website. Buck 65 released the album Situation on October 30, 2007 on Strange Famous Records in the United States and Warner Music Group worldwide. The album is a concept album based around the year 1957, and is a return to a more \\"pure\\" hip hop sound than the previous blues, country and avant-garde influences in Secret House Against the World. It was produced by fellow Halifax DJ Skratch Bastid, aimed at making a \\"classic hip-hop record that pulses with joy and clarity of purpose\\". The album appeared on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart for one week at number 31. He was a host of CBC Radio 3's web radio in 2006 and 2007, and accepted daily hosting duties on CBC Radio 2's Radio 2 Drive beginning fall 2008. He played with Symphony Nova Scotia in the Rebecca Cohn Auditorium on April 18, 2008. In late 2008, Buck 65 released three one-track albums for free download. The three Dirtbike albums featured guest production and verses by Cadence Weapon, Emily Wells, D-Styles, Skratch Bastid, Serafina Steer, Jorun, Moka Only, Mia Clarke of Electrelane, Doseone among others. Dirtbike 1/3 signified a return to Buck 65's pre-Talkin' Honky Blues hip hop roots that was expected in Situation; in Buck 65's own words \\"it's a lot like the original versions of Vertex and Man Overboard.\\" In 2009, Buck 65 contributed \\"Blood Pt. 2\\" to the AIDS benefit album, Dark Was the Night, produced by the Red Hot Organization. It is a remix of Sufjan Stevens' take on the song \\"You Are the Blood\\", originally by Castanets. Buck 65 formed Bike for Three! with Belgian producer Greetings from Tuskan (born Jo√´lle Phuong Minh L√™). Their debut album, More Heart Than Brains, was released on Anticon on May 26, 2009. The album features \\"sharp lyrical details and storytelling\\" by Buck 65, combined with Phuong Minh L√™'s production creating a \\"exquisite, shimmering landscape that rarely plays by the rules.\\" ===20 Odd Years and Neverlove=== On February 1, 2011, Buck 65 released 20 Odd Years, named in honor of his twentieth anniversary in the music industry. The album continued the tradition of combining several different musical styles, and featured many different guest collaborators. The album was preceded by a series of four EPs, released digitally and on 7\\" vinyl: 20 Odd Years, Vol. 1: Avant (released June 8, 2010); 20 Odd Years, Vol. 2: Distance (July 12, 2010); 20 Odd Years, Vol. 3: Albuquerque (August 10, 2010); and 20 Odd Years, Vol. 4: Cenotaph (September 14, 2010). The latter EP was withdrawn from availability, presumably due to copyright issues involving Buck's sampling of the Bronski Beat single, \\"Smalltown Boy.\\" The album primarily featured songs from these EPs, including a cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Who By Fire\\", as well as two previously unreleased songs. Buck 65 later released an additional EP in the series titled 20 Odd Years Vol. 4: Ostranenie (November 21, 2011). Buck 65 released Neverlove on September 30, 2014. The album was inspired by his divorce from his ex-wife. One day before its release, he also released the more lighthearted, and previously unannounced, album Laundromat Boogie through producer Jorun Bombay's Bandcamp page. Prior to the release of Neverlove, a music video for the album track \\"Super Pretty Naughty\\" was to be premiered by Entertainment Tonight, but according to Buck 65 on his website, \\"...when they saw the video and heard the song, they banned it from their show for what they deemed to be objectionable visual and lyrical content.\\" ===Ongoing Hiatus=== Buck 65 played two shows with Symphony Nova Scotia on Oct 2nd and 3rd, 2015 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. This is thought to be one of his final appearances performing under the moniker Buck 65. Rich Terfry aka Buck 65 was scheduled to play a DJ set at the CBC Music Festival in Toronto on May 28, 2016. Due to last minute technical difficulties, he was unable to perform as scheduled. The only known Buck 65 performance since Oct 3rd, 2015 took place on July 10, 2018 at a tribute concert for the late Anticon Records co-founder Brendon Whitney aka Alias. Barring the aforementioned performance in July 2018, Buck 65 has been on indefinite musical hiatus since October 2015. Rich Terfry aka Buck 65 currently hosts the CBC Drive program Monday through Friday from 3:30pm to 7pm EST on CBC Music Radio. ==Selected discography== Buck 65 :* Game Tight (1994) :* Year Zero (1996) :* Weirdo Magnet (1996) :* Language Arts (1996) :* Vertex (1997) :* Man Overboard (2001) :* Synesthesia (2001) :* Square (2002) :* Talkin' Honky Blues (2003) :* Secret House Against the World (2005) :* Strong Arm (2006) :* Situation (2007) :* Dirtbike 1-3 (2008) :* 20 Odd Years (2011) :* Laundromat Boogie (2014) :* Neverlove (2014) :* Dirtbike 4 (2015) Bike for Three!

He is the founder and CEO of Strange Famous Records. == Early life and education == Francis was born in Miami, Florida, but grew up in Providence, Rhode Island. He is an only child and grew up for most of his childhood with his mother and step father after his parents divorced when he was young. He lived in different parts of Rhode Island including North Smithfield and Woonsocket, Rhode Island. His mom worked as a bartender and his stepfather worked as a locksmith. Francis began writing and recording original lyrics at age 8, being inspired by acts such as Run DMC and Public Enemy. According to Artistdirect, Francis began sneaking out of his parents' house at age 12 to participate in rap battles. Francis received a degree in communications from Dean College in Franklin, Massachusetts and a degree in journalism from the University of Rhode Island. ==Career== In 1996, he recorded his first official demo tape, and by 1998 he had a radio show on WRIU called True School Session. Francis won the Superbowl MC Battle in Boston in 1999, beating Esoteric. Francis won the Scribble Jam emcee battle in 2000, beating Blueprint. In 2001, the song \\"Makeshift Patriot,\\" recorded on October 11, 2001, became an Internet hit for its critique of American media during, and immediately following a month after the September 11 attacks. Francis considers Makeshift Patriot to be the song that really made things come together for him. It was on the 2002 mix tape, The Known Unsoldier ‚Äì Sick Of Waging War... and was widely circulated for free. He released the critically acclaimed first solo album Personal Journals in 2002. The record, Hope, his only album with Joe Beats released under the name Non-Prophets, was named after the state of Rhode Island's motto or slogan of hope, so was meant to be very Rhode Island-centric. Francis broke music genre barriers by getting signed to Epitaph Records, making himself the first hip hop artist to sign with the punk rock label. He subsequently released three albums with Epitaph Records; A Healthy Distrust, Human the Death Dance and Life. Francis has described A Healthy Distrust as being a political record, which reflected his mistrust of government and big business with a focus on socio-political matters. In May 2007, a video of \\"Got Up This Morning\\" off of Human the Death Dance was released. It featured vocals by Jolie Holland and beats produced by Buck 65. Cameos in the video were B. Dolan, Brother Ali, Buck 65, Divinci from Solillaquists of Sound, Holland, Slug, and Tom Inhaler from Francis' band and Strange Famous Records Life was a career shift into a different style direction, focusing on spoken word and indie rock. The record featured contributions and collaborations with Califone, Chris Walla, Jason Lytle, and Mark Linkous. Francis made a guest appearance on Bad Religion's The Empire Strikes First on the track \\"Let Them Eat War\\". In 2014, Francis released Copper Gone after a four year break from touring. The album was named after the phenomenon Francis saw in his neighborhood where abandoned buildings would have their copper pipes stripped to be sold, and then tagged as \\"Copper Gone\\" to let others know that there was no copper left to steal. Francis says that he has been releasing mixed tapes consistently since 1999, and will continue to release the Sick of mixed tapes series on an ongoing basis. Francis had toured extensively. He has performed shows with Atmosphere, Brother Ali, and Eyedea & Abilities. == Epic Beard Men == Francis has collaborated with B. Dolan on a duo for Season 1, an EP released in 2018 under the name Epic Beard Men. The full-length follow-up album is scheduled to be released in March 2019.\\". == Strange Famous Records == Francis is the founder and CEO of the independent hip hop record label Strange Famous Records. The label first began in 1996 as a way for him to release his previously unreleased songs in the late 1990s. It has since evolved into an official enterprise with an expanding roster of like-minded artists. He released several Sick Of mixtapes available on his website. == Social activism == Francis worked with fellow rapper B. Dolan who had the idea to start an organization and website named KnowMore.org aka KnowMore: The People's Corporation Watch Project which focused on connecting consumers with social responsibility information about corporations and responsible consumerism. Francis went to South Africa to work on solutions to AIDS in South Africa, especially in regards to children. As part of that effort he was part of a documentary on HIV in South Africa. == Other work == Francis is also part of the contemporary spoken word movement. His relationship with the Providence poetry slam community (he was on their 1998, 1999 and 2002 national poetry slam teams) led to it being called \\"The House that Sage Francis Built.\\" From 2000 to 2002, he also DJ-ed for the NYC-Urbana poetry slam, a weekly slam series held at the legendary punk rock venue CBGB. ==DiscographyStudio albums=== * 1998: Voice Mail Bomb Threat with Art Official Intelligence * 2002: Personal Journals * 2003: Hope (with Joe Beats, as Non-Prophets) * 2005: A Healthy Distrust * 2007: Human the Death Dance * 2010: Life * 2014: Copper Gone * 2018: Season 1 (with B.

She is an American woman with a Russian-Canadian family background who works as a spy for the CIA. Sydney is depicted in the series as being strong both physically and emotionally. She deals with some significant trauma over the years: the death of her fianc√©, the death of her best friend, the realization that her mother was a former KGB spy, the estrangement of many of her friends and the constant activity and changes that she must endure from being a spy on a regular basis. Sydney is highly skilled in Krav Maga and is a polyglot, speaking English, Russian, German, Greek, Dutch, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Swedish, Romanian, Hungarian, Hebrew, Uzbek, Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Indonesian, Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Vietnamese, Polish, Serbian, Czech, Ukrainian, and Bulgarian in various episodes. Throughout the series her code names are Bluebird, Freelancer, Mountaineer, and Phoenix. ==Character biography== Sydney Bristow was born April 17, 1975. For the first six years of her life she lived with both of her parents, Jack and Laura Bristow (real name Irina Derevko). However, her father's work with the CIA kept him away from home much of the time. Sydney and her family were living in rural Maryland until Jack was transferred to Los Angeles when Sydney was two. In 1981 her mother, who was also an undercover agent for the KGB, faked her own death to prevent being apprehended by the FBI. Afterwards Jack was taken into custody for some time, because it was believed that he also was part of a larger conspiracy. Jack named Arvin Sloane as Sydney's temporary guardian and Sydney went to live with Sloane and his wife Emily, for a time (Note that this is a retcon as it was previously established that Sydney did not meet Arvin or Emily until Sydney had already started working for SD-6. Sydney herself had stated that she had large memory gaps from around the time of her mother's death and can only remember that her father began drinking heavily and became more of an absentee father, leaving Sydney to be raised by nannies. Later it is revealed that the memory gaps are due to Jack, who after finally having been cleared, tested Project Christmas on Sydney, so that she would never be recruited by the KGB, and like all the candidates tested, the training ended with Sydney's memory erased.) When Sydney was 19 years old and a freshman in college, a man approached her and told her that he worked with US intelligence and that they wanted to interview her because she fit a profile. She declined at first but then decided to join them. After meeting with an organization she believed was the Central Intelligence Agency, she signed \\"dozens of non- disclosure agreements\\" and was offered a job. They had Sydney take a job as an office assistant on the twentieth floor of Credit Dauphine, a corporate bank in downtown Los Angeles. She assumed that the bank was somehow affiliated with the CIA. When she told her father about her job after about a month, he ordered her to quit because as a double agent within SD-6, he knew the bank was a front. Sydney angrily refused to quit and this led to the beginning of a several-year estrangement in their relationship. Eventually she was told that she was ready for the transition, which involved eight months of training. It was during the training that Sydney first heard the term SD-6. At this time, she believed that SD-6 was affiliated with the CIA, that it was a black ops division of the CIA, funded by the CIA's black budget. They led her to believe that SD-6 was one of these divisions and that that was why they did not operate through Langley, Virginia. The transition ended when they made reference to SD-6 headquarters. They told her they would take her there. What she did not realize was that the headquarters was in the same building. Her role within SD-6 was desk work, at first, but she advanced quickly. Within the first year, she was assigned to reconnaissance missions. Sydney was told that the objective of SD-6 was \\"the retrieval and study of intelligence, both military and industrial, throughout the world that is critical to the superiority and survival of the United States of America.\\" Seven years after joining SD-6, Sydney discovered that SD-6 was actually a branch of the Alliance of Twelve, an international organized crime group involved in the trade of intelligence and weapons, and was an enemy of the United States. ==StorylinesSeason 1=== Sydney was engaged to be married to her boyfriend Danny Hecht, but he was killed by SD-6 after Sydney told him that she worked for the CIA. Shortly there after, she was informed of what SD-6 was by her mostly estranged father, who worked in the highest levels of SD-6. Sydney went to the real CIA with her knowledge of SD-6, and was recruited by the CIA into working as a double agent to bring down SD-6. Her handler, Agent Michael Vaughn, and who is her ongoing love interest on the show, gives her missions from the CIA. She soon learns that her own father is a double agent as well. During her time at SD-6, Sydney performed missions with Marcus Dixon, who sometimes became suspicious that Sydney was a double agent. Dixon was still under the impression that SD-6 was part of the U.S. Government. Sydney had to balance all these new revelations with keeping all these secrets from her friends, notably Will Tippin and Francie Calfo. During this season, the head of SD-6, Arvin Sloane, was obsessed with Milo Rambaldi, a man from the 15th century who was able to create brilliant devices that were far ahead of their time. Sydney worked on a number of missions to retrieve or modify these Rambaldi devices to prevent them from falling into the hands of SD-6. During the season finale, on one such mission to destroy such a device, Sydney is captured and discovers that the organization that SD-6 has been pursuing is being run by Irina Derevko, Sydney's mother and a former KGB spy. ===Season 2=== During season 2, Sydney continues to act as a double agent inside SD-6 and also performs direct missions for the CIA. Irina Derevko turns herself in to the CIA and provides valuable information to help bring down SD-6. Midway through the season, the CIA finally has enough information to bring down the entire Alliance organization and the assault on SD-6 headquarters, led by Sydney and Vaughn. The organization comes tumbling down, but Sloane gets away and is now working covertly with Julian Sark. Following the fall of SD-6, Sydney decides she wants to leave the CIA but finds herself unable to do so knowing that Sloane is still free. Sydney also has to work to make amends with Dixon, who is bitter that Sydney knew SD-6 was not part of the U.S. Government and didn't tell him, although they are eventually able to patch things up and Dixon begins to work with the CIA. During this time, Sydney's friend and roommate Francie has secretly been replaced by an agent of Sloane and Sark's, Allison Doren. Sydney eventually figures out that \\"Francie\\" is not who she says she is and the two engage in a battle which destroys the entire apartment. Sydney shoots Allison three times, apparently killing her, but Sydney is also severely wounded and passes out. When Sydney wakes up, she is in Hong Kong and comes to find out that two years have passed without her knowledge. Season 2 saw a fundamental change in Sydney's character, allegedly introduced in order to give the show more action. In the first season, Sydney almost never kills, preferring fisticuffs and tranquilizer guns to deadly blows and real bullets. Starting this season, she behaves more like a stereotypical spy, usually killing enemies and rarely using tranq guns. Although there were some minor incidents prior, the episode \\"Phase One\\" is generally considered to mark the arrival of this new version of Sydney. While some fans have criticized this change in Sydney's character, others have suggested that it might have been influenced by the arrival of her mother. During season 2 Sydney also begins to dress and act more sexually to achieve her goals. ===Season 3=== Sydney now has to deal with the pain of not knowing what has happened for the previous two years of her life, but also the fact that Vaughn is now married to another woman, National Security Council liaison Lauren Reed. Sydney tries to manipulate the CIA to stay in the loop of the organization (they don't trust her because of her absence). Sydney learns that an organization known as The Covenant seems to be involved with her disappearance. In the meantime, Sydney continues to perform missions for the CIA, while working with her father to find out more about her past. Eventually Sydney learns through FBI Assistant Director Kendall (who is actually the director of the Department of Special Research) that she worked in the employ of the Covenant as a supposedly brainwashed assassin, although she was able to resist their attempts to manipulate her due to her experiences with Project Christmas and report to the CIA during this time. Eventually, she wiped her own memories to conceal information and perhaps also because of the horrifying realization that the Covenant had extracted her eggs in order to fulfill one of Rambaldi's prophecies. She was also greatly disturbed that she chose to kill an unarmed man in cold blood rather than risk losing her cover as a brainwashed assassin. Sydney and Vaughn continue to suppress their feelings for each other in light of Vaughn's relationship with Lauren. However, it is discovered that Lauren is actually an agent working for the Covenant, although both Sydney and Vaughn are, at first, unaware of this fact. The CIA learns that there is a mole in the Los Angeles office. Jack is assigned to find the mole and soon starts to suspect Lauren. Jack confronts Lauren's father, Senator Reed, but he dismisses it. Meanwhile Vaughn decides to separate from Lauren. Lauren tells Sark and Sark explains that the last time Vaughn strayed from a relationship because of Sydney he quickly reconnected when his then- girlfriend Alice Williams' father died. Sark orders Lauren to kill her father. Lauren cannot go through with it but her mother bursts in and finishes the job. They frame Senator Reed for being the mole. Vaughn quickly recommits to Lauren, breaking Sydney's heart. On a mission to meet a Covenant asset, Sydney sees Lauren. When she tells Vaughn he dismisses it. Sydney talks to Jack and then Jack talks to Vaughn telling him the signs that his wife is betraying him. When Vaughn becomes suspicious he looks in Lauren's suitcase and discovers evidence that she does work for the Covenant. Vaughn tells Jack and Sydney and he is ordered by Dixon to pretend that he is unaware of Lauren's betrayal. Lauren soon finds out that she has been played by Vaughn and she and Sark kidnap him. After torturing him and failing to get any information they leave him for dead. Weiss finds Vaughn and he is taken to the hospital. Sydney soon discovers that the Passenger is Nadia Santos, her half-sister by the way of an affair between Irina and Sloane. After a rescue mission, Sydney's sister is taken by Sloane so he can get the formula that was stored in her brain by Rambaldi (actually her unique nervous system can replay the graphical hand movements encoded in the Rambaldi Fluid-protein strands that cause unconscious, movements like handwriting). Sydney rescues her again, but Nadia later elects to accompany Sloane in search of the Rambaldi artifact known as The Sphere of Life. Lauren enters the CIA office disguised as Sydney and steals information. Sark is captured and interviewed by Vaughn. Sark gives up Lauren and Vaughn resolves to kill her. Vaughn tracks her down and brings her to an empty warehouse. As Lauren dangles from the ceiling, Vaughn states that he loves Sydney more than he hates Lauren thus he will not kill Lauren. He does, however, plan to douse her in hydrochloric acid, rendering her unrecognizable. Sydney's aunt, the ambiguous Katya Derevko, stabs him in the back. When Sydney learns about Vaughn, she goes after Lauren herself. Vaughn goes after her and arrives just in time to save Sydney from Lauren. As Vaughn and Sydney kiss, Lauren tries to make one last shot. Vaughn sees this and shoots her dead. Before Lauren dies she tells Sydney that there is a safe deposit box in Wittenburg that has information about her. Sydney goes to the box and finds secret CIA documents about her. Jack gets there and tells her that she was never supposed to find them. ===Season 4=== Several months after her discovery, Sydney is once again estranged from her father, having discovered (through the secret documents) that he had killed Irina Derevko. Following a botched mission in Shanghai, she receives a dressing down at a performance review, is demoted, and is subsequently dismissed from the CIA. In truth, Sydney has been recruited into APO (Authorized Personnel Only), a new black ops division of the CIA patterned after SD-6. Much to her dismay, this new agency is headed by Sloane, who oversees a handpicked team which includes Sydney, Jack Bristow, Vaughn, and Dixon. During APO's first mission, Marshall is also recruited, as is her half-sister, Nadia. Her former colleague, Eric Weiss, thinks that Sydney is working for a bank - the same cover she had used when working for SD-6. During the course of APO's first mission, to bring down a terrorist and assassin-for-hire, she learns the man was actually hired to kill her - by Irina. Jack subsequently killed Irina to protect his daughter. Meanwhile, Sydney rekindles her romance with Vaughn. Later, it is revealed that Irina is not actually dead - Jack killed a genetic double in an elaborate deception orchestrated by Irina's evil sister, Elena, who recruits Sloane in activating a huge Mueller device invented by Rambaldi, which has the potential to destroy the world. Irina is rescued from Elena's clutches and reunited with her family - including Nadia, who she hasn't seen for years - and together they fly to Russia to stop Elena's plans. Around this time, after some twists and turns and ups and downs in their relationship, Vaughn finally proposes marriage prior to the mission to go after Elena. Sydney doesn't answer just yet. Finally, when she is about to destroy the Mueller device, Sydney goes back to Vaughn and gives him an affirmative reply. During the mission in Russia, it is revealed that Sloane was able to infiltrate the drinking water of the city through his charity, and all who had drunk this water and were exposed to the Mueller device were genetically altered and became excessively violent. When Nadia is captured by Elena, she is injected with the infected water and consequently attempts to kill Sydney. The season ends on a cliffhanger when Vaughn reveals to Sydney that his real name is not Michael Vaughn, and depending on who is asked, he might be a \\"bad guy\\". At that moment, their car is T-boned by an unknown assailant. ===Season 5=== Sydney and Vaughn survive the car crash, but Vaughn is taken by their assailants. He manages to escape and tells Sydney that his real name is Andr√© Michaux. He also tells her that he's been working for several years to uncover the activities of a mysterious organization known as Prophet Five. His father before him had also worked to gather intel on Prophet Five. Shortly thereafter, Sydney learns she is pregnant and Vaughn is shot and apparently killed by a rogue agent posing as a CIA officer. Four months later, Sydney makes contact with Ren√©e Rienne, an assassin on the CIA's most wanted list, who had been working with Vaughn, and whose father had worked with Vaughn's father, to bring down Prophet Five. Sydney finds a kindred spirit in Rachel Gibson, a young, wide-eyed, inexperienced agent rescued from \\"The Shed\\", a covert criminal organization that, much like SD-6, operates under the alias of a CIA black-ops division. Gibson, like Sydney years earlier, had been duped into believing she was working for the CIA. Now a member of APO, Gibson is learning the ways of being a field agent, with Sydney her designated handler, just as Michael had worked with her. With Nadia still comatose in the hospital, Gibson has moved into Sydney's home. Sydney has also put at least some demons of the past behind her. Now fully reconciled with her father, she has also expressed some forgiveness of Sloane, to the point of writing a letter of recommendation for Sloane's release hearing. Sydney continues to go on missions when her condition allows, often using the pregnancy as part of her disguises. However, in the episode \\"Solo\\", she came to realize that these days might be fast coming to a (temporary) end when she is not allowed to go on a mission due to her condition. Three weeks before her due date, Sydney is captured by Prophet Five in order to force her (via a form of drug-induced hypnosis) to remember details of a giant SD-6 flowchart that she had been shown by Michael Vaughn during one of their first meetings. Encouraged by her mental recreation of Michael Vaughn, she is able to resist the hypnosis and provide false information to her kidnappers (who, unbeknownst to Sydney, include Irina). Sydney discovers that she has been stranded aboard a freighter at sea where she attempts to elude Prophet Five and one of their associates, Kelly Peyton. During this incident, she discovers that her family doctor is actually a Prophet Five agent, and suffers a complication with her pregnancy that (to her later surprise) is corrected by Prophet Five and the baby is saved. After being extracted by APO, Sydney is reunited with her mother and together with her and Jack they travel to Vancouver in order to obtain a mysterious object called \\"The Horizon\\" which Prophet Five believed Sydney possessed. During this mission, which is complicated by the discovery that Irina works for Prophet Five and a subsequent attack by Peyton, Sydney goes into labor and ‚Äî with the aid of Irina and Jack ‚Äî gives birth to a baby girl, named Isabelle. Irina subsequently disappears with The Horizon. After the birth of Isabelle, it is revealed that Vaughn didn't die. After his shooting, Jack helped him fake his death and hide in Bhutan. About a month after giving birth, Sydney returns to duty when Anna Espinosa is recruited by Peyton to kidnap Will Tippin. Espinosa implants an explosive in Tippin's head and demands that page 47 of Rambaldi's manuscript be turned over to her in return for the disarming code. Sydney and Will battle Anna but lose page 47, and in the process Anna uses an unknown chemical agent to collect genetic material from Sydney. Anna goes through the genetic doubling process and becomes Sydney's duplicate. After Anna kills Ren√©e Rienne while she is on a mission with APO, a chip bearing Michael Vaughn's real name (Andr√© Michaux) is discovered implanted in her body. The chip bears what appears to be a corrupted code. Sydney heads to Nepal to meet with Vaughn but is intercepted by an agent of Prophet Five while Anna keeps Sydney's rendezvous with Vaughn. Anna and Vaughn discover that Vaughn has the other half of the code on a chip implanted in his body and after deciphering the code he and Anna head to Germany. They discover a bunker containing all of Vaughn's father's research on Prophet Five. Vaughn reveals that he knows Anna is not Sydney and they fight. Anna gains the upper hand until Sydney shoots her in the head, killing her. Sydney goes undercover as Anna to infiltrate Prophet Five and meets up with Peyton. Sydney, still undercover as Anna, meets Sloane and learns that she is to seek a rose from an ancient Italian monastery. She meets up with Julian Sark in Italy and he gets them arrested to infiltrate the prison that stands where the monastery once did. Sydney discovers an elderly man who identifies himself as The Rose. The Rose gives Sydney an amulet and tells her she can't stop Prophet Five from carrying out its plans. While Peyton extracts Sark from the prison, Sloane attempts to kill Sydney, still believing she is Anna. Sydney survives the attempt but Sloane escapes with the amulet. Sydney and Vaughn return to Los Angeles, where Vaughn meets his daughter for the first time. Their happiness is short-lived, however, as Sydney gets a call from Sloane, who has figured out that she is still alive. Sydney finally travels to Sydney, Australia as part of an APO mission to get intel on the twelve leaders of Prophet Five. She successfully captures intel on three of the twelve and returns to Los Angeles. Shortly thereafter, Marshall and Rachel are abducted by Peyton and Sark respectively and Sydney encounters Sloane, who convinces her to get Marshall to help him locate a certain cavern. Marshall is able to pass a message to Sydney, who, working with Marshall's wife Carrie, is able to locate Marshall and Rachel and mount a rescue. Marshall and Rachel advise the team that Sloane is seeking a cave in Italy and Sydney deduces that Sloane is headed for Mount Subasio. She and Vaughn travel there and Sydney descends into the cave. There she encounters Sloane again, with the amulet she recovered earlier. Sloane fires several rounds into the floor of the cave at Sydney's feet, causing the floor to give way. Vaughn rescues Sydney and performs CPR on her. The team next tracks Sloane to Mongolia and the tomb of Milo Rambaldi. There Sydney encounters Sloane yet again as he implements his endgame by placing the Horizon on an altar, thus creating a red, hovering ball-shaped fluid similar to that created by the Mueller device. Sydney disrupts Sloane's plans by grabbing the Horizon from the altar, causing the ball to collapse in a torrent of red liquid. Sark leads Jack and Vaughn into the tomb after capturing them, and Sloane shoots Jack in the chest to force Sydney and Vaughn to leave. Seeing her father severely wounded, Sydney grabs a gun and eventually shoots Sloane several times, who crashes into the puddle of Rambaldi-fluid. With Sloane seemingly dead, Sydney tries to stay with her bleeding father, but he begs her to leave him and to stop Irina. Sydney reluctantly obeys and departs for Hong Kong for a final confrontation with Irina. Jack drags himself back into the tomb and confronts Sloane, who has become immortal because of the fluid. Sloane offers to heal Jack, but Jack tells Sloane that he has caused so much pain for Sydney over the years that he will not allow him to do it again and reveals a bomb that he strapped to his body and detonates it, killing himself. The explosion causes a cave in and Sloane is trapped in there forever. In Hong Kong, Sydney and Irina clash a final time, with Sydney seeking to stop Irina from using the Horizon to gain immortality. In the course of the fight, Irina ends up atop a glass skylight, the Horizon just inches away from her. With the glass cracking under Irina's weight, Sydney pleads with her to take her hand. Irina refuses and attempts to grab the Horizon. The glass breaks completely, causing Irina to fall to her death. The series ends a few years into the future. Sydney and Vaughn are married and semi-retired and are now living in a beachside house on an obviously very far off island. Dixon comes to visit and is greeted by Vaughn and Sydney, who is holding their second child who is named Jack after Sydney's father. Isabelle has found the blocks for Project Christmas and assembles them in no time, but dismantles it after Sydney calls for her and she joins her family outside. As everyone walks down the beach, the screen cuts to black with the message: THANK YOU FOR FIVE INCREDIBLE YEARS. ==Casting== Before landing the lead role in Alias, Garner auditioned five times for a guest appearance in J. J. Abrams's Felicity. When Abrams created Alias, he wanted Garner to portray Sydney. \\"There was something about her that I just thought was really special. I always thought she had something in her personality that was funnier and sexier and smarter and more mischievous than anything I'd seen her do. And when I wrote Sydney, I wanted to show that,\\" he said. Melissa George, who went on to play Lauren Reed on the show, was also considered for the role of Sydney. Garner took private martial arts lessons for one month during the audition process. She did many of the physical stunts herself throughout the series. Her first stunt double was Dana Hee, who was later replaced by Shauna Duggins. ==Reception== As of 2004, Sydney was named one of the 10 best current characters by Zap2it. In June 2010, she was ranked No. 42 on Entertainment Weekly's \\"100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years\\". UGO.com ranked her the 20th Top TV Character out of 50. Sydney was listed AOL TV's \\"100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters\\", ranking at No. 27. and AfterEllen.com's Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. Bristow also appeared in Maxim list of the Hottest Nerd Crushes. She was also included in Total Sci- Fi Onlines list of The 25 Women Who Shook Sci-Fi. TV Guide named her one of TV's Toughest Ladies. Her relationship with Michael Vaughn was featured in TV Guides list of the best TV couples of all time. Garner also received critical acclaim for her performance. She won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Drama out of four consecutive nominations, as well as four EmmyJennifer Garner Emmy Nominated nominations for her lead performance. She was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series in 2004 and she won the award in 2005. In August 2003, the actual CIA enlisted Jennifer Garner to appear in a recruitment video, which would be shown at fairs and college campuses. A CIA officer said: \\"Jennifer and the character of Sydney Bristow both reflect a lot of the qualities we look for in new career field officers.\\" ==References== Category:Alias (TV series) characters Category:Fictional Central Intelligence Agency personnel Category:Fictional American secret agents Category:Television characters introduced in 2001 Category:American female characters in television ","title":"Sydney Bristow"},{"id":"517988","text":"In physics and physical chemistry, time-resolved spectroscopy is the study of dynamic processes in materials or chemical compounds by means of spectroscopic techniques. Most often, processes are studied after the illumination of a material occurs, but in principle, the technique can be applied to any process that leads to a change in properties of a material. With the help of pulsed lasers, it is possible to study processes that occur on time scales as short as 10‚àí16 seconds. ==Transient-absorption spectroscopy== Transient-absorption spectroscopy (TAS), also known as flash photolysis, is an extension of absorption spectroscopy. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, an example of non-linear spectroscopy, measures changes in the absorbance/transmittance in the sample. Here, the absorbance at a particular wavelength or range of wavelengths of a sample is measured as a function of time after excitation by a flash of light. In a typical experiment, both the light for excitation ('pump') and the light for measuring the absorbance ('probe') are generated by a pulsed laser. If the process under study is slow, then the time resolution can be obtained with a continuous (i.e., not pulsed) probe beam and repeated conventional spectrophotometric techniques. Time- resolved absorption spectroscopy relies on our ability to resolve two physical actions in real time. The shorter the detection time, the better the resolution. This leads to the idea that femtosecond laser based spectroscopy offers better resolution than nano-second laser based spectroscopy. In a typical experimental set up, a pump pulse excites the sample and later, a delayed probe pulse strikes the sample. In order to maintain the maximum spectral distribution, two pulses are derived from the same source. The impact of the probe pulse on the sample is recorded and analyzed with wavelength/ time to study the dynamics of the excited state. Absorbance (after pump)-Absorbance (before pump)= Œî Absorbance Œî Absorbance records any change in the absorption spectrum as a function of time and wavelength. As a matter of fact, it reflects ground state bleaching (-ŒîA), further excitation of the excited electrons to higher excited states(+ŒîA), stimulated emission(-ŒîA) or product absorption(+ŒîA). Bleaching of ground state refers to depletion of the ground state carriers to excited states. Stimulated emission follows the fluorescence spectrum of the molecule and is Stokes shifted relative to and often still overlaps with the bleach signal. This is a lasing effect (coherent emission) of the excited dye molecules under the strong probe light. This emission signal cannot be distinguished from the absorption signal and often gives false negative Œî absorbance peaks in the final spectra that can be decoupled via approximations. Product absorption refers to any absorption changes caused due to formation of intermediate reaction products. TA measurements can also be used to predict non emissive states and dark states unlike time resolved photoluminescence. Transient absorption can be measured as a function of wavelength or time. The TA curve along wavelength provides information regarding evolution/decay of various intermediate species involved in chemical reaction at different wavelengths. The transient absorption decay curve against time contains information regarding the number of decay processes involved at a given wavelength, how fast or slow the decay processes are. It can provide evidences with respect to inter-system crossing, intermediate unstable electronic states, trap states, surface states etc. ===Conditions=== TA measurements are highly sensitive to laser repetition rate, pulse duration, emission wavelength, polarization, intensity, sample chemistry, solvents, concentration and temperature. The excitation density (no. of photons per unit area per second) must be kept low otherwise sample annihilation, saturation and orientational saturation may come into play. ===Application=== Transient absorption spectroscopy helps study the mechanistic and kinetic details of chemical processes occurring on the time scales of few picoseconds to femto-seconds. These chemical events are initiated by an ultrafast laser pulse and are further probed by a probe pulse. With the help of TA measurements, one can look into non-radiative relaxation of higher electronic states (~femtoseconds), vibrational relaxations (~picoseconds) and radiative relaxation of excited singlet state (occurs typically on nanoseconds time scale). Transient absorption spectroscopy can be used to trace the intermediate states in a photo-chemical reaction; energy, charge or electron transfer process; conformational changes, thermal relaxation, fluorescence or phosphorescence processes, optical gain spectroscopy of semiconductor laser materials. etc. With the availability of UV-Vis-NIR ultrafast lasers, one can selectively excite a portion of any large molecule to desired excited states to study the specific molecular dynamics. Transient absorption spectroscopy has become an important tool for characterizing various electronic states and energy transfer processes in nanoparticles, to locate trap states and further helps in characterizing the efficient passivation strategies.C. Burda and M. A. El-Sayed, Pure Appl. Chem., 2000, Vol. 72, No. 1-2, pp. 165-17. ==Other multiple-pulse techniques== Transient spectroscopy as discussed above is a technique that involves two pulses. There are many more techniques that employ two or more pulses, such as: * Photon echoes. * Four-wave mixing (involves three laser pulses) The interpretation of experimental data from these techniques is usually much more complicated than in transient-absorption spectroscopy. Nuclear magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance are often implemented with multiple- pulse techniques, though with radio waves and micro waves instead of visible light. ==Time-resolved infrared spectroscopy== Time-resolved infrared (TRIR) spectroscopy also employs a two-pulse, \\"pump-probe\\" methodology. The pump pulse is typically in the UV region and is often generated by a high-powered Nd:YAG laser, whereas the probe beam is in the infrared region. This technique currently operates down to the picosecond time regime and surpasses transient absorption and emission spectroscopy by providing structural information on the excited-state kinetics of both dark and emissive states. ==Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy== Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy is an extension of fluorescence spectroscopy. Here, the fluorescence of a sample is monitored as a function of time after excitation by a flash of light. The time resolution can be obtained in a number of ways, depending on the required sensitivity and time resolution: * With fast-detection electronics (nanoseconds and slower) * With Time Correlated Single Photon Counting, TCSPC (picoseconds and slower) * With a streak camera (picoseconds and slower) * With intensified CCD (ICCD) cameras (down to 200 picoseconds and slower) * With optical gating (femtoseconds-nanoseconds) - a short laser pulse acts as a gate for the detection of fluorescence light; only fluorescence light that arrives at the detector at the same time as the gate pulse is detected. This technique has the best time resolution, but the efficiency is rather low. An extension of this optical gating technique is to use a \\"Kerr gate\\", which allows the scattered Raman signal to be collected before the (slower) fluorescence signal overwhelms it. This technique can greatly improve the signal:noise ratio of Raman spectra. This technique uses convolution integral to calculate a lifetime from a fluorescence decay. ==Time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and 2PPE== Time-resolved photoemission spectroscopyA. Stolow, A. E. Bragg, and D. M. Neumark, Femtosecond time- resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, Chem Rev, 104 (2004) 1719 and two-photon photoelectron spectroscopy (2PPE) are important extensions to photoemission spectroscopy. These methods employ a pump-probe setup. In most cases the pump and probe are both generated by a pulsed laser and in the UV region. The pump excites the atom or molecule of interest, and the probe ionizes it. The electrons or positive ions resulting from this event are then detected. As the time delay between the pump and the probe are changed, the change in the energy (and sometimes emission direction) of the photo-products is observed. In some cases multiple photons of a lower energy are used as the ionizing probe. ==See also== * Time-resolved mass spectrometry * Ultrafast laser spectroscopy ==References== ","title":"Time-resolved spectroscopy"},{"id":"517993","text":"Harold Carlyle Liscombe (May 17, 1915 ‚Äì February 23, 2004) was a Canadian ice hockey player.

He was the last surviving member of Red Wings 1943 Stanley Cup team. ==Playing career== Liscombe was a key member of the 1943 Stanley Cup champions. After scoring 42 points during the regular season, he tied a league record with 14 points in the playoffs. He scored the last goal of the 1943 Stanley Cup Final. After co- leading the NHL across two playoff seasons with 26 points (12 points in 1942 and 14 points in 1943), Liscombe scored a career-high 73 points in 50 games during the 1943-44 regular season (fourth-best in the league scoring race). Liscombe shares the team record for most goals in a playoff game and most points in a game. Liscombe was also a star in the American Hockey League, notably becoming the first back-to-back winner of the Les Cunningham Award as the league's Most Valuable Player. In 1949, Liscombe helped the Providence Reds win the Calder Cup.

Today, the shortened version is \\"decal\\". ==Origins== Advertisement for the decalcomania process in the 1870 New York City directory Decalcomania was invented in England about 1750 and imported into the United States at least as early as 1865. Its invention has been attributed to Simon Fran√ßois Ravenet, an engraver from France who later moved to England and perfected the process, which he called \\"\\" (derived from French , \\"tracing paper\\"). The first known use of the French term , in Mary Elizabeth Braddon's Eleanor's Victory (1863), was followed by the English decalcomania in an 1865 trade show catalog (The Tenth Exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association); it was popularized during the ceramic transfer craze of the mid-1870s. By around 1875 decalcomania designs printed in colored glazes were being applied to porcelain, an extension of transfer printing, which had been developed in England since the late 18th century. The decalcomania was applied over an already glazed surface and re- fired. The process began to be mechanized from the turn of the 20th century. ==Artists== The surrealist Oscar Dom√≠nguez referred to his work as \\"decalcomania with no preconceived object\\". He took up the technique in 1936, using gouache spread thinly on a sheet of paper or other surface (glass has been used), which is then pressed onto another surface such as a canvas. Dominguez used black gouache, though colours later made their appearance. German artist Max Ernst also practised decalcomania, as did Hans Bellmer and Remedios Varo. French surrealist Yves Tanguy used the technique in his 1936 works Paysage I and Paysage II, which were included in the Guggenheim Museum's exhibition \\"Surrealism: Two Private Eyes\\" (4 June ‚Äì 12 September 1999, New York). ==Versions== In the 1950s and early 1960s, King Features Syndicate marketed a set of decalcomanias bearing full-color pictures of characters from its comic strips, including Flash Gordon, the Katzenjammer Kids, and Dagwood Bumstead. Intended for young children who might have difficulty pronouncing or reading the word \\"decalcomanias\\", these transfers were marketed as \\"Cockamamies\\", a deliberate mispronunciation. The term \\"cockamamy\\" or \\"cockamamie\\" has entered the English language with various slang meanings, usually denoting something that is wacky, strange or unusual. However, the expression \\"cockamamie\\" is attested by 1946 and reportedly as early as the 1920s. ===Fractals=== The production of decalcomanias has not been confined to art. At Yale University fingerpaint decalcomanias have been analysed for their tendency, when the process is repeated several times on the same paper, to generate fractals. ==See also== *Decal *Surrealist techniques *The philosophical concept of the rhizome. ==References== ==Further reading== * \\"Decalcomania\\", Harper's Bazaar, 4 April 1868. ==External links== *Industrial Transfers and the Art of Decalcomania *History of Decals Category:Surrealist techniques Category:Pottery ","title":"Decalcomania"},{"id":"518001","text":" USS Sargo (SS-188), the lead ship of her class of submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sargo. Her keel was laid on 12 May 1937 by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 6 June 1938 sponsored by Mrs. Catherine V. Nimitz, wife of Captain Chester W. Nimitz, and commissioned on 7 February 1939, Lieutenant E. E. Yeomans in command. ==Sargo batteries== Sargo was the first vessel equipped with a new lead-acid battery designed by the Bureau of Steam Engineering (BuEng) to resist battle damage, based on a suggestion by her commissioning commanding officer, Lieutenant E. E. Yeomans.Friedman, p. 265 It quickly became known as the \\"Sargo battery\\". Instead of a single hard rubber case, it had two concentric hard rubber cases with a layer of soft rubber between them. This was to prevent sulfuric acid leakage in the event one case cracked during depth-charging. Leaking sulfuric acid would be capable of corroding steel, burning the skin of crew members it came into contact with, and if mixed with any seawater in the bilges would generate poisonous chlorine gas.The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia, Sargo-class article This remained the standard battery design until replaced with Sargo II and GUPPY batteries in submarines upgraded under the Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program after World War II. Each battery's capacity was slightly increased by installing 126 cells instead of 120; this also raised the nominal voltage from 250 volts to 270 volts, which has been standard in US usage ever since, including the backup batteries of nuclear submarines. ==Pre-war service== After shakedown along the eastern seaboard of South America, Sargo departed Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in July 1939 for duty with the Pacific Fleet. Transiting the Panama Canal, she arrived at San Diego, California, in mid-August. She operated in the eastern and mid-Pacific for the next two years, including a practice 40-day war patrol between Midway Island and the Marshall Islands in the fall of 1941. She departed Pearl Harbor on 23 October 1941, arrived in Manila on 10 November, and was there when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December. ==War patrols under Tyrell D. Jacobs== The next day (under the command of torpedo specialist Lieutenant Commander Tyrell D. Jacobs, Class of 1927),He was one of a handful of \\"Gun Club\\" members to try and fix the numerous problems of the notorious Mark 14 torpedo, following bitter personal experience. Blair, Clay, Jr. Silent Victory (Lippincott, 1975), p.140 & 902. the submarine got underway for her first war patrol, which took her along the coast of French Indochina and to the Netherlands East Indies. Off the major Japanese base at Cam Ranh Bay, ULTRA directed her to three cruisers on 14 December, which Sargo was unable to gain position to attack when they appeared as scheduled.Blair, p.139-40. Expecting a convoy, she went in closer, and that night detected a freighter, firing one torpedo; it prematured eighteen seconds later. Confidence in the Mark VI torpedo exploder shaken, she switched to contact pistol afterward.Blair, p.140. On 24 December, she found two freighters, firing two torpedoes at one, one at the other, from about , scoring no hits. Temporarily losing depth control, she broached, and the target turned away; Sargo fired two stern tubes at , with no more success. The next day, she sighted a pair of merchantmen, but was unable to gain firing position. Some time afterward, she came on two more merchantmen and fired two stern torpedoes at the rearmost of them, from closer yet, ; both again missed. By now frustrated, after eight torpedoes with zero results, when two additional merchantmen came in view an hour later, Sargo took extra pains to get it right, pursuing for fifty-seven minutesBlair, p.141. and making certain TDC bearings matched perfectly before firing two torpedoes at each ship, at an average of 1000 yards; all missed. After her skipper discovered the torpedoes were running too deep, and correcting the problem,Blair, p.141. Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd) would wait months to do the same. Sargo detected a target at dusk on 26 December losing, then regaining, contact, and running ahead, so be able to get good position. Then weather intervened, and the ships escaped. A few days afterward, a big, slow tanker gave Sargo another opportunity, and again, the approach was meticulous, firing one torpedo at a close . It missed. In exasperation, Sargo signaled headquarters, questioning the Mark 14's reliability on an open radio circuit.Jacobs' courage here is exemplary, recalling Ned Beach's a generation later in relation to -class' terrible \\"pancake\\" diesels. It could have gotten him court martialled for insubordination, and he knew it, not to mention being detected by the Japanese. On his return, he was upbraided by his commanding officer, Admiral John Wilkes. Blair, p.169. On 20 January 1942, she assisted in the rescue of the crew of S-36 after she ran aground on Taku Reef in the Makassar Strait. Sargo remained surfaced, relaying distress messages to friendly aircraft and surface ships. After the rescue by the Dutch merchant ship Siberote, Sargo headed for Java, and arrived at Soerabaja on 25 January. Here, she offloaded all her reload torpedoes (keeping only those in her tubes)Blair, p.174. and three-inch ammunition, and took on one million rounds of .30-caliber ammunition desperately needed by Allied forces in the Philippines. She sortied 5 February, avoiding the usual traffic lanes, and arrived in Polloc Harbor nine days later. After delivering her vital cargo to Mindanao, she returned to Soerabaja with 24 Boeing B-17 specialists from Clark Field on board. Sailing from Soerabaja on 25 February, she headed for Australia and was one day out of Fremantle when she was attacked by an Australian plane which mistook her for a Japanese submarine.Blair, p.185. This sort of mistake would become depressingly common during the war. For instance, Blair, pp.210 and 285, just in the first half of 1942. Although a near miss by a bomb caused minor damage, Sargo arrived safely at Fremantle on 5 March with 31 passengers from Java.The Australian bombing would be the last straw for Jacobs, who went to shore duty at BuOrd. Blair, p.185. ==War patrols under Richard V. Gregory== During March, amid the panic over potential Japanese invasion of Australia, Sargo (now commanded by Richard V. Gregory, Class of 1932)This made him the youngest officer so far to command a fleet boat. Blair, pp.185, 192, 285, & 906. was detailed to guard Darwin's approaches.Blair, p.192. Nothing materialized. On 8 June, Sargo put to sea for her fourth patrol, conducted in the Gulf of Siam off Malaya. She attacked only one target, a small tanker, with only three torpedoes, but failed to score, then returned to Australia on 2 August. The fifth war patrol, from 27 August to 25 October, was in the Celebes Sea and South China Sea. In a submerged attack off Vietnam, French Indochina, on 25 September, she fired two torpedoes at the 4,472-ton cargo ship Teibo Maru. When these did not sink the target, three more were fired; all missed, including one circular, which exploded off her stern, presaging another deadly failing of the Mark 14. Sargo then surfaced and finished off the crippled freighter with gunfire.When Sargo returned, Gregory was removed. Blair, p.286. ==War patrols under Edward S. Carmick== Sargo moored at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, 28 April 1943. Raised metal \\"188\\" is seen in faint relief on port bow. White outlines mark recent alterations On 29 November, she departed Brisbane and conducted her sixth patrol (now commanded by Edward S. Carmick, Class of 1930)Blair, p.921. en route to Hawaii. On the last day of 1942, she made a submerged attack on an enemy tanker off Tingmon Island, firing a spread of four torpedoes. Heavy explosions were heard, accompanied by grinding noises usually associated with a ship breaking up. JANAC did not confirm the sinking. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 21 January 1943 and proceeded to San Francisco Bay for a three-month overhaul in the Mare Island Navy Yard. Returning to Hawaii on 10 May, she departed on 27 May for her seventh patrol which took her to the Truk-Guam-Saipan shipping lanes. On 13 June, she intercepted a three- ship convoy, escorted by a subchaser. That night, she made a submerged attack, sinking the passenger-cargo ship Konan Maru southeast of Palau. The next day, she fired torpedoes at another of the cargo ships but could not learn the results of her attack, since she was forced to dive to escape the subchaser's depth charges. Sargo arrived at Midway Island on 9 July, where she was credited with one ship sunk for 6,600 tons (reduced postwar to 5,200).Blair, p.931. She departed Midway on 1 August for her eighth war patrol, again at Truk and in the Mariana Islands. She made no contacts and returned to Pearl Harbor on 15 September for refit.Not unexpectedly, Carmick was relieved. Blair, p.939. ==War patrols under Philip W. Garnett and post-war fate== On her ninth war patrol (now commanded by Philip W. Garnett, Class of 1933),Blair, p.939. 15 October to 9 December, Sargo operated off Formosa and in the Philippine Sea. On 9 November, she torpedoed the cargo ship, Tago Maru, southeast of Formosa, and finished off the stricken ship with gunfire. Steaming north, she torpedoed and sank the passenger ship, Kosei Maru two days later east of Okinawa. Afterwards, she picked up a Japanese soldier, clinging to floating debris, survivor of another sinking. Sargo returned to Pearl Harbor on 9 December 1943, credited with two ships for 15,900 tons; postwar, it was 6,400. Sargo‚Äôs tenth patrol, 26 January to 12 March 1944, was conducted north of the Palau Islands. Despite ULTRA alerting her, she failed to be in position to intercept Admiral Koga when he appeared.Blair, p.570-1. Still, she made four attacks and fired all her torpedoes.Blair, p.571. She sank the transports Nichiro Maru (6,500 tons) on 17 February and Uchide Maru (5,300 tons) on 29 February; this time, the wartime credit, one ship of 7,000 tons, remarkably, increased.Blair, p.942. After refit in Pearl Harbor, the veteran submarine departed on her eleventh war patrol on 7 April, along the southern coasts of Ky≈´sh≈´, Shikoku, and Honsh≈´. On 26 April, she torpedoed and sank the cargo ship Wazan Maru in Kii Suido, approaching Osaka Bay. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 May and steamed east to the west coast of the United States for a major overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard. Returning to Hawaii in September, Sargo got underway for her 12th patrol on 13 October and operated off the Bonin Islands and Ryukyu Islands. Two trawlers were damaged by Sargo‚Äôs three-inch (76 mm) deck gun and machine guns. On arrival at Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands, on 7 December 1944, she was assigned to training submarine crews until 13 January 1945, when she proceeded to Eniwetok Atoll. There she acted as a target for ASW training. As the war ended, she returned via Hawaii to the United States, arriving at Mare Island on 27 August. Decommissioned on 22 June 1946, she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 19 July 1946. Her hulk was sold for scrap on 19 May 1947 to the Learner Company of California. Sargo was awarded eight battle stars for her service in World War II and received the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation. == Notes == == References == * * Blair, Clay, Jr. Silent Victory.

Her keel was laid down on 9 September 1937 by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 29 October 1938 sponsored by Mrs. Lillian Spear, wife of Lawrence Y. Spear, president of Electric Boat Company. The boat was commissioned on 17 July 1939 with Lieutenant C.E. Tolman, Jr., in command. ==Pre-World War II Service== Spearfish conducted sea trials off New London, Connecticut, and then held her shakedown cruise in the Guantanamo Bay area from 21 August to 3 October. She was overhauled at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine from 1 November 1939 to 2 February 1940. On 10 February, she set sail for the West Coast. After training operations in the San Diego, California, training area from 6 March to 1 April, the submarine sailed to Pearl Harbor. ==First and Second War Patrols== Spearfish operated between Hawaii and the West Coast until 23 October 1941 when she departed Pearl Harbor and headed for Manila. She conducted training operations there from 8 November until the outbreak of war on 8 December (7 December east of the International Date Line), when she began her first war patrol. This mission took her into the South China Sea, near Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay, French Indochina, and off Tarakan and Balikpapan, Borneo. On 20 December, Spearfish encountered a Japanese submarine and made a submerged attack. She fired four torpedoes but all missed the target. She put into Surabaja, Java, on 29 January 1942 for refitting. On 7 February, she began her second war patrol. Spearfish patrolled in the Java Sea and Flores Sea and made unsuccessful torpedo attacks on two cruiser task forces. On 2 March, she put into Tjilatjap, Java, and took on board 12 members of the staff of the commander of the submarines of the Asiatic Fleet, for transportation to Australia. The patrol ended at Fremantle, Australia. ==Third through Sixth War Patrols== Her third war patrol, from 27 March to 20 May, took her to the Sulu Sea and the Lingayen Gulf. On 17 April, she sank an enemy cargo ship of approximately 4,000 tons, and, on 25 April, she sank Toba Maru, a 6,995-ton freighter. On the night of 3 May, the submarine slipped into Manila Bay and picked up 27 passengers from Corregidor to be evacuated to Fremantle. She was the last American submarine to visit that beleaguered fortress before it surrendered. Navy nurse and Legion of Merit recipient Ann A. Bernatitus was among the 27 rescued by Spearfish. From 26 June to 17 August, she scouted the South China Sea for enemy shipping and, from 8 September to 11 November, searched the west coast of Luzon where she damaged two freighters. Spearfish sailed from Brisbane on 2 December 1942 and patrolled in the New Britain-New Ireland area for over a month before entering Pearl Harbor on 25 January 1943. From Oahu, she was directed to Mare Island for a major overhaul which lasted from 3 February to 19 May. ==Seventh, Eighth and Ninth War Patrols== Spearfish returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 May and began her seventh war patrol from there on 5 June. She cruised the Truk Island area, made a photographic reconnaissance of Eniwetok Atoll, and then patrolled in the vicinity of Marcus Island. After refitting at Midway Island from 1 August to 25 August, Spearfish searched Japanese home waters south of Bungo Suido for shipping. On the night of 10 September and 11 September, she made a submerged torpedo attack on a convoy of seven freighters escorted by one destroyer and two torpedo boats. The submarine fired torpedoes at four ships and damaged two. Spearfish was depth charged throughout the day but finally eluded the escorts. On the night of 17 September and 18 September, she attacked another convoy of seven ships with their escorts, sinking two and damaging one. Upon concluding this patrol, the ship sailed to Pearl Harbor for refitting. From 7 November to 19 December, Spearfish performed photographic reconnaissance of Jaluit, Wotje, and Kwajalein, Marshall Islands, to aid the forthcoming invasion of those islands. On 5 December and 6 December, she acted as lifeguard submarine for air strikes on Kwajalein and Wotje. ==Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth War Patrols== Bricker Crew (B-29) Z-1 \\"Pee Wee\\" 1944.

Forrest, CPL William F. Frank, CPL Stephen J. Darienzo, SSG Richard J. Grinstead, CPL John C. Estes Spearfish‚Äôs tenth war patrol was made south of Formosa from 17 January to 29 February 1944. On 30 January, she made two torpedo attacks on a convoy of three merchantmen and two escorts. She sank an escort and the passenger-cargo ship, Tomashima Maru. On 10 February, her attack on a convoy of four ships and their escorts damaged a freighter and sank a transport. The next day, she damaged another freighter in an 11-ship convoy. On 12 February, she crippled another freighter. Spearfish sailed on her eleventh war patrol from Pearl Harbor, 31 March, for the East China Sea and the area north of Nansei Shoto. On 5 May, she sank a freighter; and, the following day, she sank the cargo ship, Toyoura Maru. When the submarine returned to Pearl Harbor on 27 May, she was routed to the West Coast for a major overhaul. After spending the period from 6 June to 3 October at the Mare Island Navy Yard, the ship returned to Pearl Harbor on 10 October and held training exercises for a month. Reconnaissance photo of Iwo Jima, taken from USS Spearfish. Spearfish‚Äôs last war patrol took place from 12 November 1944 to 24 January 1945. On the first part of the patrol, she made photographic reconnaissance surveys of Iwo Jima and of Minami Jima. The submarine spent the second part in the Nanp≈ç Islands area on lifeguard duties and offensive patrols. On 19 December 1944, she rescued seven survivors (CPT Linden O. Bricker, 2LT Kenneth R. Chidester, 2LT Jay L. Meikle, 2LT Clifford B. Smith, SGT Edmund G. Smith, CPL Stephen J. Darienzo, and SSG Richard J. Grinstead) from a ditched B-29 Superfortress, Z-1 \\"Pee Wee.\\" Four airmen were killed during the ditching (2LT Jack O. Mueller, CPL Emory A. Forrest, CPL William F. Frank, and CPL John C. Estes). This marked the first submarine rescue of downed B-29 airmen in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II. On 11 January 1945, Spearfish's guns sank a sampan. She took three Japanese on board as prisoners, but one died several days later. LCDR C.C. Cole, commanding officer of the Spearfish, noted in the ships' log at Tanapag Harbor, Saipan on 13 January that he returned the seven airmen to their quarters under jubilant escort from their squadron.National Archives. \\"USS Spearfish Twelfth War Patrol Report.\\" (1945). ==Fate== When she returned to Pearl Harbor on 24 January, Spearfish was used as a training ship until 18 August. On 19 August, she got underway for the West Coast and arrived at Mare Island on 27 August. On 7 September, a Board of Inspection and Survey recommended that she be decommissioned immediately and possibly scrapped. It was decided to retain her in an inactive status for experimental explosive tests. The tests were cancelled, and Spearfish was decommissioned at Mare Island on 22 June 1946. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 19 July 1946; sold to the Lerner Company of Oakland, California; and scrapped in October 1947. Spearfish received ten battle stars for World War II service. The Spearfish is the subject of an episode of the syndicated television anthology series, The Silent Service, which aired during the 1957-1958 season. == References == * ==External links== *Kill record: USS Spearfish *Photo gallery at navsource.org Category:Sargo-class submarines Category:World War II submarines of the United States Category:Ships built in Groton, Connecticut Category:1938 ships ","title":"USS Spearfish (SS-190)"},{"id":"518003","text":" USS Searaven (SS-196), a , was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sea raven, a sculpin of the northern Atlantic coast of America. Her keel was laid down on 9 August 1938 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 21 June 1939 sponsored by Mrs. Julianna B. Cole, wife of Cyrus W. Cole, Commandant of the Portsmouth Navy Yard ; and commissioned on 2 October 1939, with Lieutenant Thomas G. Reamy in command. ==World War II== In the two years preceding the United States's entry into World War II, Searaven operated in Philippine waters conducting training and maneuvers. At the outbreak of war between the United States and the Japanese Empire, the submarine was at the Cavite Navy Yard in Manila Bay. During her first two war patrols in December 1941 and the spring of 1942, she ran supplies to the American and Filipino troops besieged on the Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor Island. In a night action in the Molucca Strait on 3 February 1942, Searaven engaged a Japanese destroyer with Mark 14 torpedoes. Two official sources conflict, regarding the results of this engagement. If confirmed it would have been Searavens first kill of the war. Searaven conducted her third war patrol in the vicinity of Timor Island of the Netherlands East Indies, from 2 April to 25 April 1942. On 18 April, she rescued 32 Royal Australian Air Force men from enemy-held Timor, an act for which two of her officers were awarded the Navy Cross. Five days later, fire broke out in her main power cubicle, immobilizing Searaven completely. assisted her into port in Australia. Searavens fourth war patrol was a quiet one and returning from her fifth patrol, she claimed 23,400 tons sunk and 6,853 damaged. This tally, however, went unconfirmed. She ended her fifth patrol on 24 November 1942 at Fremantle, Australia, where she underwent refit. On 18 December, she got underway from Fremantle, bound for the Banda Sea, Ceram Sea, and the Palau Islands. In the Banda Sea, she welcomed the New Year by loosing a spread of three torpedoes at the minelayer . Again, the sinking claimed by Searaven went unconfirmed. Two weeks later, on 14 January 1943, the submarine pumped four torpedoes into the freighter Siraha Maru and collected her first confirmed victory. On 10 February, she sailed into Pearl Harbor and, two days later, she set out for overhaul at Mare Island, California. She completed overhaul on 7 May 1943 and returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 May. On 7 June, Searaven departed from Pearl Harbor for her seventh patrol, this time in the Mariana Islands area. During this patrol, she reconnoitered Marcus Island, but encountered no enemy shipping. She put into Midway Island on 29 July for refit. Her eighth war patrol began at Midway on 23 August 1943. She plied the waters off the northeastern coast of Honsh≈´, Japan, but found no enemy ship worth a torpedo. After a month and one-half at sea, the submarine made Pearl Harbor on 6 October. A month later, she stood out for her ninth patrol. She patrolled the Eastern Caroline Islands and, for a three-day period, operated with a coordinated attack group (\\"wolfpack\\") of submarines which was used as part of the defensive screen for the Gilbert Islands operation. On 25 November, she got her second confirmed kill, sending the 10,052-ton tanker to the bottom with four torpedoes. She sailed back into Pearl Harbor on 6 December. Searavens tenth war patrol, from 17 January to 3 March 1944, was occupied by photo reconnaissance of Eniwetok Atoll and lifeguard duty for the air strikes on the Marshall Islands, Mariana Islands, and Truk. She rescued three airmen, but put into Midway on 3 March with no additional sinkings to her credit. On 26 March, Searaven embarked upon her 11th war patrol. Her assigned area was the southern islands of the Nanp≈ç Islands, the Bonin Islands. She made two attacks during this patrol, claimed two more sinkings, but was officially credited with none. After a complete overhaul at Pearl Harbor, Searaven set course for the Kuril Islands area. Twelve enemy vessels were sunk during this patrol. On 21 September 1944, in a night surface attack, the submarine torpedoed and sank an unescorted Japanese freighter, Rizan Maru, which had dropped behind her convoy. On the night of 25 September, Searaven engaged two trawlers, four large sampans, and four 50-ton sampans. Searaven passed down the column of eight sampans and two trawlers, abeam, engaging from one to three at a time at practically point blank range. Those that did not sink on the first pass were given another dose of the same treatment until all were destroyed. On 1 November 1944, Searaven sailed on her final war patrol as part of a coordinated attack group which also included the submarines , , and . Operating in the South China Sea, east of Hainan Island, the submarine closed out her combat career by sinking one Heinan Maru-class transport and an Omurosan Maru-type oiler. With combat ended, Searaven was assigned target and training duties for the remainder of the war. ==Post-War== Searaven was one of the target ships in the 1946 atomic bomb test, Operation Crossroads, at Bikini Atoll. She escaped the tests with negligible damage. The submarine was decommissioned on 11 December 1946, sunk as a target on 11 September 1948, and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 21 October 1948. ==Awards== Searaven earned ten battle stars for her World War II service. ==References== * Category:Sargo-class submarines Category:World War II submarines of the United States Category:Ships built in Kittery, Maine Category:1939 ships Category:Ships involved in Operation Crossroads Category:Ships sunk as targets Category:Maritime incidents in 1946 Category:Maritime incidents in 1948 ","title":"USS Searaven (SS-196)"},{"id":"518006","text":"Legitimacy, from the Latin legitimare meaning \\"to make lawful\\", may refer to: * Legitimacy (criminal law) * Legitimacy (family law) ** Legitimacy law in England and Wales, legitimacy (family law) in England and Wales * Legitimacy (political) == See also == * Bastard (law of England and Wales) * Illegitimacy in fiction * Legit (disambiguation) * Legitimate (professional wrestling) * Legitimate expectation * Legitimate peripheral participation * Legitimate theater * Legitimation * Legitime * Nomen illegitimum in botany is a valid published name that contravenes the international articles * Sources of law ","title":"Legitimacy"},{"id":"518008","text":"A gilded wooden figurine of a deer from the Pazyryk burials, 5th century BC Deer have significant roles in the mythology of various peoples located all over the world, such as object of worship, the incarnation of deities, the object of heroic quests and deeds, or as magical disguise or enchantment/curse for princesses and princes in many folk and fairy tales.

Sometimes, it represents a disguise a prince dons to escape or to achieve a goal, e.g., What the Rose did to the Cypress (Persian fairy tale). A deer also appears as a helper, such as in Italian fairy tale The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird, as a foster mother to the exposed twin children; or in Portuguese folktale The Hind of the Golden Apple, as a talking animal who gifts the hero with the titular golden apple. It also may appear as a disguised adversary (an ogre, a sorcerer), e.g., in The Enchanted Doe (Italian literary fairy tale), or as a malevolent seductress, e.g., in Indian fairy tale The Son of Seven Queens, collected by Joseph Jacobs.Jacobs, Joseph. Indian Fairy Tales. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. 1892. pp. 115-126. The deer also appears as a character in Animal fables, e.g., The Deer without a Heart (Indian fable) and The Stag at the Pool (attributed to Aesop). Another cervine animal, the stag, appears in an etiological tale from Brazil (Why the Tiger and the Stag hate each other).Eells, Elsie Spicer. Fairy Tales from Brazil: How and why Tales from Brazilian Folk-lore. Dodd, Mead & Company. 1917. pp. 61-69. ==Buddhism== In one of the Jataka tales, Buddha has reincarnated into the form of a deer. This story has many incarnations and names itself: such as \\"The Story of Ruru Deer\\", \\"The Golden Deer\\", and the Chinese cartoon \\"A Deer of Nine Colors\\". The story originated in India around the 4th century BCE. The narrative hails the merits of compassion, empathy, and karma. ==Celtic== Antlered figure from the Gundestrup Cauldron, interior plate A The Insular Celts have stories involving supernatural deer, deer who are associated with a spiritual figure, and spirits or deities who may take the form of deer. In some Scottish and Irish tales deer are seen as \\"fairy cattle\\" and are herded and milked by a tutelary, benevolent, otherworldly woman (such as a bean s√¨dhe or in other cases the goddess Flidais), who can shapeshift into the form of a red or white deer.J. G. McKay, \\"The Deer-Cult and the Deer-Goddess Cult of the Ancient Caledonians\\"Folklore 43.2 (June 1932), pp. 144‚Äì174; McKay (p. 149) points out that the usual term for a giantess, ban-fhuamhair, a cannibal ogress, is never applied to the \\"Old Woman\\" In the West Highlands, this woman of the otherworld selects the individual deer who will be slain in the next day's hunt.J.F. Campbell of Isalay, Popular Tales of the West Highlands, ii, no. 27, noted by McKay 1932:150. In Ireland, The Cailleach Bh√©ara (\\"The Old Woman of Beare\\"), who lives on an island off the coast of County Cork, takes the form of a deer to avoid capture, and herds her deer down by the shore. The Beare peninsula is also associated with the islands in the western sea that are the lands of the dead.\\"The Chase of Ben Gulbin\\" (McKay1932:151). Other Celtic mythological figures such as Ois√≠n and Sadhbh also have connections to deer. Cernunnos is a mythological figure in Continental Celtic mythology, and possibly one of the figures depicted on the Gundestrup cauldron. He has stag antlers on the top of his head. His role in the religion and mythology is unclear, as there are no particular stories about him. ==European folklore== Medieval works of fiction sometimes contain the existence of a white deer or stag as a supernatural ou mystical being in the chivalry quest (\\"The Hunt for the White Stag\\" motif, such as in the lai of GuigemarBROOK, LESLIE C. \\"GUIGEMAR AND THE WHITE HIND.\\" Medium √Üvum 56, no. 1 (1987): 94-101. doi:10.2307/43629066.)Illingworth, R.

University of Georgia Press, 2000. www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt46n65j.6. Detail of Saint Giles and the Hind, c. 1500, by the Master of Saint Gilles Saint Giles, a Catholic saint especially revered in the south of France, is reported to have lived for many years as a hermit in the forest near N√Æmes, where in the greatest solitude he spent many years, his sole companion being a deer, or hind, who in some stories sustained him on her milk. In art, he is often depicted together with that hind. Deer figure in the founding legend of Le Puy-en-Velay, where a Christian church replaced a megalithic dolmen said to have healing powers. A local tradition had rededicated the curative virtue of the sacred site to Mary, who cured ailments by contact with the standing stone. When the founding bishop Vosy climbed the hill, he found that it was snow-covered in July; in the snowfall, the tracks of a deer around the dolmen outlined the foundations of the future church. St Hubertus / St Eustace in a 13th-century English manuscript (Biblioteca Marciana) Saint Hubertus (or \\"Hubert\\") is a Christian saint, the patron saint of hunters, mathematicians, opticians and metalworkers, and used to be invoked to cure rabies. The legend of St Hubertus concerned an apparition of a stag with the crucifix between its horns, effecting the worldly and aristocratic Hubert's conversion to a saintly life. In the story of Saint Hubertus, on Good Friday morning, when the faithful were crowding the churches, Hubertus sallied forth to the chase. As he was pursuing a magnificent stag the animal turned and, as the pious legend narrates, he was astounded at perceiving a crucifix standing between its antlers, which occasioned the change of heart that led him to a saintly life. The story of the hart appears first in one of the later legendary hagiographies (Bibliotheca hagiographica Latina, nos. 3994‚Äì4002) and has been appropriated from the earlier legend of Saint Eustace (Placidus). Later in the 6th century, the Bishop Saint Gregory of Tours wrote his chronicles about the Merovingian rulers. Historia Francorum contains the legend of King Clovis I, who prayed to Christ in one of his campaigns so he could find a place to cross the river Vienne. Considered as a divine sign, a huge deer appeared and showed where the army could pass. In the 14th century, probably keeping some relation with Saint Eustace's legend, the deer again appears in Christian legend. The Chronicon Pictum contains a story where the later King Saint Ladislaus I of Hungary and his brother the King G√©za I of Hungary were hunting in a forest, and a deer with numerous candles on his antlers appeared to them. Saint Ladislaus told his brother that it wasn't a deer but an angel of God, and his antlers were wings; the candles were shining feathers. He also stated his intent to build a cathedral in honor of the Holy Virgin in the place where the deer appeared.Gyurcs√°k, J., P√≥t√≥ J. (edit). (2004). K√©pes Kr√≥nika. Hungary: Osiris. ==Germanic== An Anglo-Saxon royal scepter found at the Sutton Hoo burial site in England features a depiction of an upright, antlered stag. In the Old English language poem Beowulf, much of the first portion of the story focuses on events surrounding a great mead hall called Heorot, meaning \\"Hall of the Hart\\". In the Poetic Edda poem Gr√≠mnism√°l the four stags of Yggdrasil are described as feeding on the world tree, Yggdrasil, and the poem further relates that the stag Eik√æyrnir lives on top of Valhalla. In the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, the god Freyr is having once killed Beli with an antler. In √ûi√∞rekssaga, Sigurd is presented as having been nursed by a doe. Andy Orchard proposes a connection between the hart Eik√æyrnir atop Valhalla, the hart imagery associated with Heorot, and the Sutton Hoo scepter.Orchard (1997:82 and 92). Sam Newton identifies both the Sutton Hoo whetstone and the hall Heorot as early English symbols of kingship.Newton, Sam.The Origins of Beowulf p.31 Rudolf Simek says that \\"it is not completely clear what role the stag played in Germanic religion\\" and theorizes that \\"the stag cult probably stood in some sort of connexion to Odin's endowment of the dignity of kings.\\"Simek (2007:70). ==Greek== Diana of Versailles Heracles, Telephus and the doe (Louvre Museum) In Greek mythology, the deer is particularly associated with Artemis in her role as virginal huntress. Actaeon, after witnessing the nude figure of Artemis bathing in a pool, was transformed by Artemis into a stag that his own hounds tore to pieces. Callimachus, in his archly knowledgeable \\"Hymn III to Artemis\\", mentions the deer that drew the chariot of Artemis: :in golden armor and belt, you yoked a golden chariot, bridled deer in gold. One of the Labors of Heracles was to capture the Cerynian Hind sacred to Artemis and deliver it briefly to his patron, then rededicate it to Artemis. As a hind bearing antlers was unknown in Greece, the story suggests a reindeer, which, unlike other deer, can be harnessed and whose females bear antlers. The myth relates to Hyperborea, a northern land that would be a natural habitat for reindeer. Heracles' son Telephus was exposed as an infant on the slopes of Tegea but nurtured by a doe. ==Hinduism== Magical Deer in Ramayana In Hindu mythology, the Aitareya Upanishad tells us that the goddess Saraswati takes the form of a red deer called Rohit. Saraswati is the goddess of learning, so learned men use deer skin as clothing and mats to sit upon. A golden deer plays an important role in the epic Ramayana. While in exile in the forest, Rama's wife Sita sees a golden deer and asks Rama and Lakshmana to get it for her. The deer is actually a rakshasa called Maricha in disguise. Maricha takes this form to lure Rama and Lakshmana away from Sita so his nephew Ravana can kidnap her. In the Hindu epic mahabharata, the rishi Kindama dons the disguise of a male deer. ==Hittite== The stag was revered alongside the bull at Alaca H√∂y√ºk and continued in the Hittite mythology as the protective deity whose name is recorded as dKAL. Other Hittite gods were often depicted standing on the backs of stags, such as Kurunta or fellow Anatolian (Luwian) deity Runtiya. ==Huichol== For the Huichol people of Mexico,Barbara G. Myerhoff, \\"The Deer-Maize-Peyote Symbol Complex among the Huichol Indians of Mexico\\" Anthropological Quarterly 43.2 (April 1970), pp. 64‚Äì78. the \\"magical deer\\" represents both the power of maize to sustain the body and of the peyote cactus to feed and enlighten the spirit. Animals such as the eagle, jaguar, serpent and deer are of great importance to the Mexican indigenous cultures. For each group, however, one of these animals is of special significance and confers some of its qualities to the tribe. For the Huichol it is the deer that holds this intimate role. The character of the Huichol tends to be light, flexible and humorous. They have avoided open warfare, neither fighting against the Spanish nor Mexican governments, but holding to their own traditions. The Huichol hunt and sacrifice deer in their ceremonies. They make offerings to the Deer of the Maize to care for their crops, and to the Deer of the Peyote to bring them spiritual guidance and artistic inspiration. ==Hungarian== In Hungarian mythology, Hunor and Magor, the founders of the Magyar peoples, chased a white stag in a hunt. The stag lead them into unknown land that they named Scythia. Hunor and Magor populated Scythia with their descendants the Huns and the Magyars. To this day, an important emblem in Hungary is a many-antlered stag with its head turned back over its shoulder. ==Islam== Turkic peoples that converted to Islam brought with them from the Eurasian Steppe their beliefs and cults involving horns, deer, antlers, hides, etc. In the Ottoman Empire, and more specifically in western Asia Minor and Thrace the deer cult seems to have been widespread and much alive, no doubt as a result of the meeting and mixing of Turkic with local traditions. A famous case is the 13th century holy man Geyikl√º Baba, ‚ÄòFather Deer‚Äô, who lived with his deer in the mountain forests of Bursa and gave hind‚Äôs milk to a colleague (compare with Saint Giles) . Material in the Ottoman sources is not scarce but it is rather dispersed and very brief, denying us a clear picture of the rites involved.Laban Kaptein, Eindtijd en Antichrist, p. 32ff. Leiden 1997. ; Laban Kaptein (ed.), Ahmed Bican Yazƒ±cƒ±oƒülu, D√ºrr-i Mekn√ªn. Kritische Edition mit Kommentar, ¬ß¬ß 7.53; 14.136‚Äì14.140. Asch 2007. ==Judaism== The Tribe Naftali bore a Stag on its tribal banner, and was poetically described as a Hind in the Blessing of Jacob. In Jewish mythology ‚Äì as discussed in the Talmud (◊ó◊ï◊ú◊ô◊ü ◊†◊ò ◊¢\\"◊ë) ‚Äì exists a giant kind of stag by the name \\"Keresh\\". He is said to live in a mythical forest called \\"Bei Ilai\\". ==Kurdish== The deer symbol also appears in the ancient kurdish legends. Kurdish people still believe in that if they kill a deer it brings them bad luck. They think about this animal as a saint who belongs to God. They use it also as a national symbol. Nowadays Kurdistan Regional Government forbids hunting and killing Deer. ==Native American== In Native American mythology, there is the tale of the Deer Woman, a legendary creature associated with love and fertility. ==Occultism== The spirit Furfur in The Goetia is depicted as a hart or winged hart. ==Romanian== In 1914, Hungarian composer B√©la Bart√≥k collected two Hungarian (Sz√©kely) colinde in Transylvania. The story is of a father who has taught his nine sons only how to hunt, so they know nothing of work and spend all of their time in the forest. One day while hunting a large and beautiful stag, they cross a haunted bridge and are themselves transformed into stags. The distressed father takes his rifle and goes out in search of his missing sons. Finding a group of fine stags gathered around a spring, he drops to one knee and takes aim. The largest stag (eldest son) pleads with his father not to shoot. The father, recognizing his favorite son in the stag, begs his children to come home. The stag then replies that they can never come home: their antlers cannot pass through doorways and they can no longer drink from cups, only cool mountain springs. Bart√≥k prepared a Hungarian libretto, and in 1930 set the tale to music in his Cantata Profana. It was first performed in London in 1934, in an English translation. ==Scythian== The Scythians had some reverence for the stag, which is one of the most common motifs in Scythian art. Possibly the swift animal was believed to speed the spirits of the dead on their way, which perhaps explains the curious antlered headdresses found on horses buried at Pazyryk (illustration at the top of this article). ==Slavic and Uralic== In Slavic fairytales, Golden-horned deer is a large deer with golden antlers. Golden or silver deer/elk was a popular folk character at the Urals in the 18th century. There were tales about the mythical creature called Silver Deer, also known as the elk Golden Horns and the goat Silver Hoof. ==Shinto== Sacred deer in Nara Park , a garden of the Kasuga shrine, Japan Deer are considered messengers to the gods in Shinto, especially Kasuga Shrine in Nara Prefecture where a white deer had arrived from Kashima Shrine as its divine messenger. It has become a symbol of the city of Nara. Deer in Itsukushima Shrine, located in Miyajima, Hiroshima, are also sacred as divine messengers. In various parts of Northeast Japan, a deer dance called \\"Shishi-odori\\" has been traditionally performed as an annual shinto ritual.Shishi-Odori ( Deer Dance ) ( Throughout Iwate ) A Trip to Iwate ==Manufactured mythology== Quintus Sertorius, while a general in Lusitania, had a tame white stag which he had raised nearly from birth. Playing on the superstitions of the local tribes, he told them that it had been given to him by the goddess Diana; by attributing all his intelligence reports to the animal, he convinced the locals that it had the gift of prophecy. (See Plutarch's life of Sertorius and Pliny the Elder's chapter on stags [N.H., VIII.50]) The naming of Sir Francis Drake's ship the \\"Golden Hind\\" is sometimes given a mythological origin. However, Drake actually renamed his flagship in mid-voyage in 1577 to flatter his patron Sir Christopher Hatton, whose armorial bearings included the crest \\"a hind Or.\\" In heraldry, a \\"hind\\" is a doe. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, as well as the rest of Santa Claus's reindeer, originated as fictional but have become an integral part of Western festive legend. ==Notes== ==References== * Orchard, Andy (1997).

He can't leave the store or he will become one permanently (he can only go outside onto the building's roof or, in very rare episodes, when traveling by magic). Because he has not been alive for very long, he knows little about many everyday objects (at least in earlier seasons). However, he is often shown to be a fast learner, a deep thinker, and a source of ideas. He is also a very talented dancer, which he at some point demonstrates in nearly every episode. Though he wishes that he was not bound by the rules of the spell that keeps him alive, he puts his friends' needs first. * Jodie (Nerene Virgin): The store's display designer. Portrayed as a sweet, level-headed woman, who has no social life outside of the store, she functions as a mentor and teacher to Jeff, who is relatively new to the world. He often works as her assistant in setting up the displays. Although she has no established authority, she usually takes a leadership role among the characters. Her words are often comforting to others, and she is always ready to help her friends with their problems. * Sam Crenshaw (puppet, Bob Dermer): The store's security guard. Born in 1919, he is the oldest of the four main characters. He is a generally laid-back individual, as the years have worn him down. He often fails to notice or realize certain things around him at first, though when he does, he is known to get hysterical about it. He doesn't seem particularly bright and is sometimes clumsy, but he means well and is capable in his job. He is a retired sailor and a veteran of the Boer Wars, and his signature song is \\"Singin' Yo Hee Ho\\". He's a widower and also has a pet cat named Penelope that Muffy is afraid of. * Muffy Mouse (puppet, Nina Keogh): A mouse who speaks in rhyme and lives in the store all the time. Young, childlike and more mischievous than the other characters, she likes to ride her scooter, plays the piano, enjoys playing tricks on people, and is obsessed with eating snacks (especially cheese). She is usually the first one to get upset or frustrated over a situation. As a mouse, she is afraid of cats and hates it when people mention them. === Other main characters === * TXL Series 4 (Robyn Hayle): The store‚Äôs computer system. Sam operates it from the security room. It appears to have a feminine persona. Despite being a machine, it is suggested that it is capable of human emotions. * Mrs. Pennypacker (puppet, Cheryl Wagner): An employee who runs the stock room at night. She is an elderly lady who shows her age in terms of physical appearance more than Sam does, but often appears more enthusiastic and full of energy than him. Her motto is \\"I know where everything goes\\" and the others sometimes call upon her knowledge of the store's layout to find obscure or special items. * Mort (puppet, Bob Stutt): Muffy‚Äôs cousin from the farm. His country lifestyle tends to contrast with her city life. He, like her, speaks in rhyme, and often comes to visit. * Waldo the Magnificent (Barrie Baldaro): The magician who originally brought Jeff to life. A rather wise but somewhat inept man, the spells he casts with his wand often go awry, and it may take multiple tries to get it right. A running gag is his tendency to call Sam by the wrong name. * The Mime Lady (Nikki Tilroe): A mime character seen in quiz segments of the show. Tilroe also provided voices for several other characters. == Premise == In the children's department of a major department store, each night when Jodie arrives for work, she carries a mannequin (Jeff) upstairs, where Muffy says the magic words \\"hocus pocus alimagocus!\\" This brings him to life. Many early episodes focused on a tangible object as a subject, such as hats or costumes, with the show revolving around teaching about it. Later episodes dealt with more complicated ones, such as the episode \\"Wishes\\" dealing with sacrificing one thing for another, or \\"Phil's Visit\\", which dealt with alcoholism. Short films, often less than a minute long, were often inserted as breaks in the episode's main plot, narrated by Robyn Hayle (the same actress who provided the voice of TXL). These included Mime Lady segments, animated quizzes designed to test a child's observation, narrated storybooks, and popular nursery rhymes (which an unseen Muffy would introduce with \\"And now I'd like to introduce a nursery rhyme by Mother Goose\\"). Many episodes featured one or more one-time visitors to the store. Some would cause problems for the characters, while others would befriend them and help solve their problems. These visitors included the characters' friends or family, people coming to the store to do their jobs, people brought there by magic (\\"Treasure Hunts\\", \\"The Queen of Hearts\\"), bizarre, non-human characters (\\"Space\\", \\"Sam and the Robot\\"), and real-life celebrities (\\"Opera\\", \\"Trash\\"). Magic was important to many episodes, and the characters sometimes would have an adventure that involved it. == References == == External links == * * Various episodes to view at the TVO Archive * Today's Special at SITE123 * Today's Special at Facebook Category:1980s Canadian children's television series Category:1980s Nickelodeon original programming Category:1981 Canadian television series debuts Category:1987 Canadian television series endings Category:Canadian television shows featuring puppetry Category:Canadian television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:Department stores in fiction Category:Nick Jr. original programming Category:Television series produced in Toronto Category:Television series set in shops Category:Treehouse TV original programming Category:TVOntario original programming ","title":"Today's Special"},{"id":"518021","text":"A television director is in charge of the activities involved in making a television program or section of a program. They are generally responsible for decisions about the editorial content and creative style of a program, and ensuring the producer's vision is delivered. Their duties may include originating program ideas, finding contributors, writing scripts, planning 'shoots', ensuring safety, leading the crew on location, directing contributors and presenters, and working with an editor to assemble the final product. The work of a television director can vary widely depending on the nature of the program, the practices of the production company, whether the program content is factual or drama, and whether it is live or recorded. == Types of television director Factual television director=== Factual or documentary TV directors may take any number of roles in the television production process, or combine several roles in one. === Entertainment television director === In a television show composed of individual episodes, the television director's role may differ from a film director's in that he or she will usually work only on some television episodes instead of being the auteur of the entire production. In an episodic television production, the major creative control will likely reside with the television producer(s) of the show. However, the director has input, whether it be how, if and why something can or cannot be done. ===Drama television director=== In a dramatic arts production, the television director's role can be similar to a film director's, including giving cues to actors and directing the camera placement and movement. === Live television director === Primarily, the live director is responsible for \\"calling\\" the broadcast, supervising the placement of professional video cameras (camera blocking), lighting equipment, microphones, props, graphics and the overall pacing and feel of the production. Other than quickly calling out commands, the television director is also expected to maintain order among the staff in the control room, on the set, and elsewhere. A news studio might have multiple cameras and few camera movements. In a sports broadcast, the director might have 20 or 30 cameras and must continuously tell each of the camera operators what to focus on. While the director is responsible for specific shots and other production elements, the producer (typically seated behind the director in the second row of chairs in the control room) coordinates the \\"big picture\\", including commercial breaks and the running length of the show. ==See also== *Screenwriter *Showrunner *Television program creator *Television producer *Film director ==External links== * Television Director at The Museum of Broadcast Communications == References == BBC Academy: profile of a Producer/Director Category:Broadcasting occupations Category:Directors Category:Television terminology ","title":"Television director"},{"id":"518028","text":"Ishka is a fictional character from the science fiction television series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (DS9). A female Ferengi, she is the mother of Quark (Armin Shimerman) and Rom (Max Grod√©nchik). Ishka appears in five canon episodes of DS9, and also features in seven licensed-but-non-canon Star Trek novels. Conceptualized as a feminist character, Ishka was played by Andrea Martin once and Cecily Adams four times. Both actresses suffered under a lot of makeup, prostheses, and costuming. Adams loved the character, and was stunned by the positive fan reaction to Ishka. ==Conception== Ishka was conceived as a Ferengi \\"women's libber\\" that Robert Hewitt Wolfe described as transcending the stereotypical protester. Ishka did not want to end the Ferengi profit-making way of life, but wanted Ferengi females to be able to take part in it. It was immediately after Ishka's introduction in \\"Family Business\\" the idea of bringing her together with Grand Nagus Zek came about. Ren√© Auberjonois (Odo) even anticipated the pairing in an interview with Starlog for their January 1996 issue. ==Casting== Andrea Martin (2008) Director David Livingston recalled that they had a difficult time finding somebody to play Ishka; at one point, he even made the unpopular suggestion that Wallace Shawn (Grand Nagus Zek) appear in drag as Quark and Rom's mother. Andrea Martin was cast at the suggestion of episode director Ren√© Auberjonois (Odo), who felt the actress could manage the right balance of comedy and good acting that was missing from the applicants he had seen thus far. Showrunner Ira Steven Behr agreed with Auberjonois on the casting, later saying he loved her on Second City Television. Martin was offered the role without even having to audition. Ira Behr, Robert Hewitt Wolfe, and David Livingston all had good things to say about the casting of Martin as Ishka. Cecily Adams (undated) When, at the last minute, Martin could not return for \\"Ferengi Love Songs\\", the show held auditions for the role and saw \\"a lot of people\\". Prior to auditioning, Cecily Adams was only peripherally familiar with the Star Trek universe, having only seen a few Next Generation and Voyager episodes. Adams was friends with actress Kitty Swink, and auditioned with the help of Swink's husband Armin Shimerman (Quark); Shimerman loaned her a tape of Martin's episode‚Äî\\"Family Business\\"‚Äîfrom which she learned \\"how broad the character was.\\" Adams attributed her successful audition to the many similarities between her and Martin: not only did Martin's costumes fit without need for alteration, but so did the prosthetic faceplate. Described as a \\"natural mimic\\" by the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion, Behr said that Adams \\"just did Moogie.\\" Even though she had the character down pat, Adams would later admit to having trouble with the Star Trek vernacular. Ishka was a radical departure for Adams: she'd never played an alien before, usually being cast as secretaries in shows such as Simon and Simon and Murphy Brown. ==Makeup and costuming== Martin's Ishka in \\"Family Business\\" Before Andrea Martin accepted the role, director Ren√© Auberjonois (Odo) confided in her that working under the Ferengi prosthetics would be the hardest acting she'd ever done if she'd never worked under such makeup before. Auberjonois speculated that she took the role anyway because he'd been so frank with her. Martin's makeup for Ishka took three hours every day. Ishka, being older, required extra development of the makeup prostheses. Makeup designer Michael Westmore explained that they \\"made a thin skin that went over one of [their] stock Ferengi heads . They [they] made a new face for her, wrinkled, and did the backs of her hands.\\" The script for \\"Family Business\\" also complicated the makeup process because it called for Ishka to be nude in several scenes; therefore, makeup needed to be developed for parts of Ferengi never before seen. One take over Ishka's shoulder had to be reshot because the producers felt that Martin's \\"supple skin\\" didn't match the character; Westmore and crew \\"took Kleenex, wrinkled it up and rubberized it, and covered her back and shoulders\\", a process Martin didn't care for, saying, \\"Boy, if you hadn't warned me about this, I would be out the door.\\" Adams' Ishka in \\"Profit and Lace\\" Having never before worn prostheses, Cecily Adams found the Ishka makeup \\"rather daunting\\" and described the three to four hour application process before moving on to costuming. Originally the producers drew lines on Adams' hands to make them appear older, but later decided they did not look old enough and used prosthetic gloves. Once all was said and done, only the palms of Adams' hands and her upper lip were visible. After begging and pleading with the DS9 staff to see the dailies, Adams realized how much she needed to over-express to have her facial expressions translate through the makeup. When she came back to DS9 for season six's \\"The Magnificent Ferengi\\", Adams agreed on the condition she receive her own custom faceplate. Adams praised the other DS9 actors who suffered through similar makeup ordeals saying, \\"I think it's astonishing that they were all in good cheer, and to be in the makeup all the time is really something.\\" Because Ishka is flouting Ferengi law by wearing clothes, it was decided that she would overdo it, and so Adams was encumbered with \\"baubles and bangles and beads\\" that made so much noise on set that Adams estimated she had to dub half her lines. For \\"Profit and Lace\\", where Ishka was to leave the Ferengi homeworld of Ferenginar for the first time, Adams was dressed in a \\"Spandex suit from [her] wrists to the tip of [her] toes\\". Further, because Ishka was old, the staff padded Adams' costume with , including fake breasts that Adams guessed weighed ; after watching the dailies, both Adams and Behr agreed that the breasts needed to be reduced as they were too distracting. Adams would later thank both director Ren√© Auberjonois and co-star Armin Shimerman for helping her realize that overacting was the name of the game when working under such prostheses. ==Character history== In \\"Family Business\\", Ishka is introduced as a Ferengi widow who receives a monthly stipend from her elder son, Quark (Armin Shimerman). Per Ferengi law, she is forbidden from making profit or wearing clothing, yet she has begun doing both and is found out by the Ferengi Commerce Authority (FCA; an agency essentially equivalent to the United States' Internal Revenue Service). The FCA charges Quark with his mother's misdeeds, about which she is unrepentant, feeling that women should have the same rights and privileges as men. After much arguing with Quark, Iskha agrees to sign a confession and forfeit her earnings for her son's sake, though she confides in Rom (Max Grod√©nchik) that she only gave up a third of what she had hidden away. Season five's \\"Ferengi Love Songs\\" reveals the romantic relationship between Ishka and Grand Nagus Zek, the leader of the Ferengi Alliance. When Quark is unable to extract nepotistic assistance from the Grand Nagus, he colludes with Liquidator Brunt (Jeffrey Combs) to break up the couple. Quark soon realizes however that Ishka is the real power behind the throne, giving Zek financial advice and suggestions that keep the Ferengi economy afloat. Quark confesses his part, and helps reunite Ishka and Zek. In \\"The Magnificent Ferengi\\" (season six), Ishka is kidnapped by the Dominion. While in captivity at the hands of the Vorta Yelgrun (Iggy Pop), Ishka offers financial advice and tries to empathize with her captor about family. In the same season, \\"Profit and Lace\\" finds Ishka leaving the Ferengi homeworld of Ferenginar for the first time to travel to Deep Space Nine in the company of Grand Nagus Zek. She has convinced Zek to amend the Ferengi Bill of Opportunities to allow women to wear clothing, and the result was economic turmoil across the Ferengi Alliance. When Ishka suffers a heart attack, Quark undergoes sex reassignment surgery to take her place at Zek's side and win back the support of an influential Ferengi commissioner. Doctor Bashir (Alexander Siddig) is able to successfully perform a heart transplantation for Ishka, and she is up and about by the end of the episode. In the penultimate episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, \\"The Dogs of War\\", Quark discovers that Ishka has influenced Grand Nagus Zek to the point where the Ferengi leader has promoted labor rights, enforced environmental protection, and outlawed monopolies. ===Non-canon appearances=== Ishka also appears in several officially-licensed, non-canon, Star Trek novels, e-books, and short stories: Star Trek: The Next Generation * Doors into Chaos by Robert Greenberger (2001) Star Trek: Terok Nor * Dawn of the Eagles by S. D. Perry & Britta Dennison (2008) Star Trek: Deep Space Nine * Ferenginar: Satisfaction Is Not Guaranteed by Keith DeCandido (2010) * Lust's Latinum Lost (and Found) by Terry J. Erdmann & Paula M.

Block (2017) Star Trek: Mirror Universe The Ishka of the Mirror Universe is wealthy, owns Terran slaves, and provided a safe harbor for the 'mirror-versions' of B'Elanna Torres and Crell Moset (from the Star Trek: Voyager episode \\"Nothing Human\\"). She appeared in the 2009 Star Trek: Mirror Universe story, \\"Bitter Fruit\\" by Susan Wright. ==Portrayal== Crediting Andrea Martin with her broad and confident initial portrayal of Ishka, Adams commented on how easy it was to play a character so well delineated. Adams also infused Ishka with some of the stories Shimerman told of his own mother. In an interview with Star Trek: The Magazine, Adams said of Ishka: \\"I love and adore her. How can you not? She just doesn't care what anybody thinks; she's so committed to what she thinks is right, and everyone else be damned. But she has a heart of gold, and she's very strong. To be a female as strong as she was, in the kind of world she came from, was wonderful, I think.\\" Lauding the character, Adams says that it's Ishka's backbone that helps her grow as an actress and as a person. Prior to November 2000, Adams appeared at several Star Trek conventions with her \\"Ferengi family\\" and relished meeting fans who expressed how much they love the character of Ishka. ==References== ==External links== * Ishka at StarTrek.com Category:Ferengi Category:Television characters introduced in 1995 Category:Fictional females Category:Fictional feminists and women's rights activists Category:Fictional unemployed people Category:Star Trek: Deep Space Nine characters ","title":"Ishka"},{"id":"518033","text":"Sir Harold Mario Mitchell Acton, (5 July 1904 ‚Äì 27 February 1994) was a British writer, scholar, and aesthete who was a prominent member of the Bright Young Things. He wrote fiction, biography, and autobiography. During his stay in China, he studied Chinese language, traditional drama, and poetry, some of which he translated. He was born near Florence, Italy, to a prominent Anglo- Italian family. At Eton College, he was a founding member of the Eton Arts Society before going up to Oxford to read Modern Greats at Christ Church. He co-founded the avant garde magazine The Oxford Broom and mixed with many intellectual and literary figures of the age, including Evelyn Waugh, who based the character of Anthony Blanche in Brideshead Revisited partly on him. Between the wars, Acton lived in Paris, London, and Florence, proving most successful as an historian, his magnum opus being a 3-volume study of the Medicis and the Bourbons. After serving as an RAF liaison officer in the Mediterranean, he returned to Florence, restoring his childhood home, Villa La Pietra, to its earlier glory. Acton was knighted in 1974 and died in Florence, leaving La Pietra to New York University. == Early years Background=== Villa La Pietra Acton was born to a prominent Anglo-Italian-American family of baronets, later raised to the peerage as Barons Acton of Aldenham at Villa La Pietra, his parents' house one mile outside the walls of Florence, Italy. He claimed that his great-great-grandfather was Commodore Sir John Acton, 6th Baronet (1736‚Äì1811), who married his niece, Mary Anne Acton, and who was prime minister of Naples under Ferdinand IV and grandfather of the Roman Catholic historian Lord Acton. This relationship has been disproven; Harold Acton in fact descends from Sir John Acton's brother, General Joseph Edward Acton (1737‚Äì1830).Burke's Peerage and Baronetage, 1999, 106th edition, ed. Charles Mosley, vol. 1, p. 28 Both of these brothers served in Italy, and are from the Shropshire family of Actons. His father was the successful art collector and dealer Arthur Acton (1873‚Äì1953), the illegitimate son of Eugene Arthur Roger Acton (1836‚Äì1895), counsellor to the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce.Armorial Families: A Directory of Gentlemen of Coat Armour, A.

His mother, Hortense Lenore Mitchell (1871‚Äì1962), was the heiress of John J. Mitchell, a president of the Illinois Trust and Savings Bank, an appointed member of the Federal Advisory Council,, and a trustee of the Art Institute of Chicago (1908‚Äì1909).ARTIC, 1908, \\"Catalog of the Twenty-First Annual Exhibition of Oil Paintings and Sculpture by American Artists, October 20 to November 29, 1908,\\" p. iii, Chicago, IL, USA:The Art Institute of Chicago, see , accessed 11 July 2015. Arthur Acton met Hortense in Chicago while helping to design the Italianate features of the bank's new building in 1896, and the Mitchell fortune allowed Arthur Acton to buy the remarkable Villa La Pietra on the hills of Florence, where Harold Acton lived for much of his life.Martin Green, 2008 [1977], Children of the Sun: A Narrative of \\"decadence\\" in England After 1918, pp. 1‚Äì8, 94‚Äì117, 220, 393‚Äì395, 425f, Mount Jackson, VA, USA: Axios Press, , see or , _or_ Martin Green, 1977, ibid., pp. 118‚Äì125, London, LND, GBN: Constable, , see , both accessed 11 July 2015.Charlotte Eagar, 2011, \\"The house of secrets and lies,\\" The Sunday Times (magazine, online), 3 July 2011, see , accessed 11 July 2015.

In 1913, his parents sent him to Wixenford Preparatory School near Reading in southern England,Evelyn Waugh, 1983, The Essays, Articles and Reviews of Evelyn Waugh, Donat Gallagher, Ed., London, LND, GBN: Methuen Limited, , see , accessed 11 July 2015. \\"Page numbers given inline.\\" where Kenneth Clark was a fellow-pupil. By 1916 submarine attacks on shipping had made the journey to England unsafe and so Harold and his brother were sent in September to Chateau de Lancy, an international school near Geneva. In the autumn of 1917, he went to a 'crammers' at Ashlawn in Kent to be prepared for Eton, which he entered on 1 May 1918. Among his contemporaries at Eton were Eric Blair (the writer George Orwell), Cyril Connolly, Robert Byron, Alec Douglas-Home, Ian Fleming, Brian Howard, Oliver Messel, Anthony Powell, Steven Runciman, and Henry Yorke (the novelist Henry Green). In his final years at school, Acton became a founding member of the Eton Arts Society, and eleven of his poems appeared in The Eton Candle, edited by his friend Brian Howard. ===Oxford years=== In October 1923, Acton went up to Oxford to read Modern Greats at Christ Church. It was from the balcony of his rooms in Meadow Buildings that he declaimed passages from The Waste Land through a megaphone (an episode recounted in Brideshead Revisited, through the character Anthony Blanche). While at Oxford, he co- founded the avant garde magazine The Oxford Broom, and published his first book of poems, Aquarium (1923). Acton was regarded as a leading figure of his day and would often receive more attention in memoirs of the period than men who were much more successful in later life; for example, the Welsh playwright Emlyn Williams described this encounter with Acton in his autobiography George (1961): Williams also described Acton's review of The Picture of Dorian Gray in the Oxford student newspaper Cherwell: \\"a charming boy's book, we would suggest a cheap edition to fit comfortably into the pocket of a school blazer\\"; and summarised Acton's modernist approach to literature: \\"But if one finds the words, my dears, there is beauty in a black-pudding.\\" Railway Club at Oxford, conceived by John Sutro, dominated by Harold Acton.

Acton is reputed to have inspired, at least in part, the character of \\"Anthony Blanche\\" in Waugh's novel Brideshead Revisited (1945). In a letter to Lord Baldwin, Waugh wrote, \\"There is an aesthetic bugger who sometimes turns up in my novels under various names ‚Äì that was 2/3 Brian [Howard] and 1/3 Harold Acton. People think it was all Harold, who is a much sweeter and saner man [than Howard].\\" Waugh also wrote, \\"The characters in my novels often wrongly identified with Harold Acton were to a great extent drawn from Brian Howard\\". ===General strike and after=== In 1926 Acton acted as a special constable during the general strike, apolitical as he was, and took his degree. In October he took an apartment in Paris, at 29 Quai de Bourbon, and had his portrait painted by Pavel Tchelitcheff.Harold Acton, Memoirs of an Aesthete, 1948. Moving between Paris and London in the next few years, Acton sought to find his voice as a writer. In 1927 he began work on a novel, and a third book of poems, Five Saints and an Appendix, came out early the following year. This was followed by a prose fable, Cornelian, in March. In July Acton acted as Best Man at the wedding of Evelyn Waugh to the Honourable Evelyn Gardner. Waugh's Decline and Fall bore a dedication to Acton 'in Homage and Affection', but when Acton's own novel ‚Äì disastrously entitled Humdrum ‚Äì appeared in October 1928, it was slated in comparison with Decline and Fall by critics such as Cyril Connolly. In the later 1920s Harold frequented the London salon of Lady Cunard, where at various times he encountered Ezra Pound, Joseph Duveen and the Irish novelist George Moore. On visits to Florence he cemented his friendship with Norman Douglas, who wrote an introduction to Acton's translation of a lubricious 18th-century memoir of Giangastone de' Medici, The Last of the Medici, privately printed in Florence in 1930 as part of the Lungarno Series. A fourth collection of poems, This Chaos, was published in Paris by Acton's friend Nancy Cunard, though the Giangastone translation pointed in a more promising direction. History was indeed to prove far more congenial to Acton than poetry. His The Last Medici (not to be confused with the earlier book of similar title) was published by Faber in 1932, the first of a series of distinguished contributions to Italian historical studies.Andrew Gumbel, 1996, \\"Shadow of the Last Aesthete,\\" The Independent (online), 14 April 1996, see , accessed 11 July 2015. [Subtitle: \\"In his Tuscan palazzo, Sir Harold Acton created what he hoped would be an enduring idyll.

He took up residence in Peking, as Beijing was then known, which he found congenial. He studied Chinese language, traditional drama, and poetry. Between his arrival in 1932 and 1939 he published respected translations of Peach Blossom Fan and Modern Chinese Poetry (1936), both in collaboration with Ch'en Shih-hsiang (Èô≥‰∏ñÈ©§),John C.

Arlington. His novel Peonies and Ponies (1941) is a sharp portrait of expatriate life. He translated Glue and Lacquer (1941), selected from the 17th century writer Feng Menglong's Tales to Rouse the World, with a preface by Arthur Waley, the leading scholar-translator and member of the Bloomsbury Group. The Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, but Acton did not leave until 1939, when he returned to England and joined the Royal Air Force as a liaison officer. He served in India and what was then Ceylon, and then after the Liberation in Paris. When the war was over, he returned to Florence. La Pietra had been occupied by German soldiers, but he expeditiously restored it to its proper glory.Sir Harold Acton Is Dead At 89; Prototypic Esthete Of The 1920s John Darnton, New York Times 1 March 1994 == Literary works == Acton's non-historical works include four volumes of poetry, three novels, two novellas, two volumes of short stories, two volumes of autobiography and a memoir of his friend Nancy Mitford, who was his exact contemporary. His historical works include The Last Medici, a study of the later Medici Grand Dukes, and two large volumes on the House of Bourbon, rulers of the Kingdom of Naples in the 18th and earlier 19th century, which together may be said to constitute his magnum opus. ==Awards and honours== Acton was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1965 and knighted in 1974.Crown Office, 1974, \\"State Intelligence, Honours and Awards‚Ä¶ Harold Mario Mitchell Acton, Esquire, C.B.E.,\\" London Gazette (online, 21 February 1974), Issue 46214, p. 2311, see , accessed 11 July 2015. The British Institute in Florence, an important centre for Anglo-Florentine cultural life since 1917, renamed its collections the Harold Acton Library. == Personal life== Acton was Catholic;Joseph Pearce, 2006, \\"Literary Converts: Spiritual Inspiration in an Age of Unbelief,\\" San Francisco, CA, USA: Ignatius Press, , see , accessed 11 July 2015. David Kubiak, Memories of an Aesthete Modern Age Vol 51 Nos 3-4 (Summer-Fall 2009) his cultural and historical commitment to the Church remained unchanged throughout his life. Acton's name was first on a petition submitted to Rome in 1971 by British cultural √©lite, requesting that the traditional Latin rite of the Mass not be abrogated in England. His mother, the heiress Hortense Lenore Mitchell, a dominating personality in his life who lived on until the age of 90, did not make life easy for him but he still remained the devoted and admiring son. Acton was a prominent member of the Bright Young Things in 1920s London. After Acton's death, in reply to a magazine article that speculated both about the probable suicide of Acton's brother and about Acton's homosexuality, author A. N. Wilson remarked, \\"To call him homosexual would be to misunderstand the whole essence of his being\\" and that \\"He was more asexual than anything else\\". The article, by American writer David Plante, described Acton's time at Oxford as a \\"virile aesthete-dandy,\\" but noted that while in China during the 1930s Acton's predilection for boys led to a classified government document describing him as a \\"scandalous debauchee,\\" and prevented the possibility of his serving in the intelligence services there, when war broke out. Plante also described the young men whom Acton welcomed to La Pietra, including Alexander Zielcke, a German photographer and artist who was Acton's lover for the last twenty-five years of his life.Andrew Gumbel, Shadow of the Last Aesthete Independent 13 April 1996 Cimitero Evangelico Agli Allori When Acton died he left Villa La Pietra to New York University. In leaving his family's property and collection to New York University, Acton expressed his desire that the estate be used as a meeting place for students, faculty, and guests who might study, teach, write and do research, and as a centre for international programs. Following his death, DNA testing confirmed the existence of a half-sister born out of wedlock, whose heirs have gone to court to challenge Acton's $500 million bequest to New York University. Acton was buried beside his parents and brother in the Roman Catholic section of the Cimitero Evangelico degli Allori in the southern suburb of Florence, Galluzzo (Italy). ==Publications== *Aquarium, London, Duckworth, 1923 *An Indian Ass, London, Duckworth, 1925. *Five Saints and an Appendix, London, Holden, 1927. *Cornelian, London, The Westminster Press, 1928. *Humdrum, London, The Westminster Press, 1928. *The Last of the Medici, Florence, G.

He was honoured for his pioneering work on prevention of Rh disease of the newborn, and also for his work on the genetics of the Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). ==Biography== Cyril Clarke was born on 22 August 1907 in Leicester, England and received his school education at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys, Leicester and at the independent Oundle School near Peterborough. His interest in butterflies and moths began at school. His studied natural science at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, graduating in 1929, and then medicine at Guy's Hospital, London, graduating in 1932. During the Second World War he worked as a medical specialist in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. After the war Clarke worked as a registrar at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and then as Consultant Physician at the United Liverpool Hospitals. In 1963 he was appointed Director of the Nuffield Unit of Medical Genetics based at the University of Liverpool and two years later was made Professor of Medicine. He held these posts until his retirement in 1972. In retirement he served as President of the Royal College of Physicians (1972‚Äì1977) Clarke helped to develop the technique of giving Rh- negative women inter-muscular injections of anti-RhD antibodies during pregnancy to prevent Rh disease in their newborn babies. This was one of the major advances in preventive medicine in the second half of the 20th century. Clarke answered an advert in an insect magazine for swallowtail butterfly pupae that had been placed by Philip Sheppard. They met and began working together in their common interest of lepidoptery. From 1959 they started running a moth trap in Caldy Common near West Kirby, Wirral, England. They studied the peppered moth, the scarlet tiger moth and swallowtail butterfly. They published papers on the genetics of Lepidoptera and also on Rh disease. Clarke continued research in his retirement and in 1988 he rediscovered a scarlet tiger moth colony on the Wirral Way, West Kirby, that had been started in 1961 by Philip Sheppard. The colony was useful for study of the genetics of changes in populations. He married Frieda (or F√©o) in 1934. Lady Clarke died in 1998. Cyril Clarke died in 2000. They had three sons, one of whom is a consultant neurologist. == Career and awards == * Second World War - Medic in Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve * 1947 to 1958 - Part-time Clinical Lecturer at Liverpool University, England. * 1958 to 1965 - Reader at Liverpool University, England. * 1965 to 1972 - Professor of Medicine at Liverpool University, England.

December 1796 - 16 March 1878) was a notable English undertaker. Formerly obese, he is also known for being the first to popularise a weight loss diet based on limiting the intake of carbohydrates, especially those of a starchy or sugary nature. He undertook his dietary changes at the suggestion of Soho Square physician Dr William Harvey, who in turn had learned of this type of diet, but in the context of diabetes management, from attending lectures in Paris by Claude Bernard. ==Professional career== In the early 19th century, the family business of William Banting of St. James‚Äôs Street, London, was among the most eminent companies of funeral directors in Britain. As funeral directors to the Royal Household itself, the Banting family conducted the funerals of King George III in 1820, King George IV in 1830, the Duke of Gloucester in 1834, the Duke of Wellington in 1852, Prince Albert in 1861, Prince Leopold in 1884, Queen Victoria in 1901, and King Edward VII in 1910. The royal undertaking warrant for the Banting family eventually ended in 1928 with the retirement of William Westbrook Banting. ==Weight loss dietLetter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public=== In 1863, Banting wrote a booklet called Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public which contained the particular plan for the diet he followed. It was written as an open letter in the form of a personal testimonial. Banting accounted all of his unsuccessful fasts, diets, spa and exercise regimens in his past. His previously unsuccessful attempts had been on the advice of various medical experts. He then described the dietary change which finally had worked for him, following the advice of another medical expert. \\"My kind and valued medical adviser is not a doctor for obesity, but stands on the pinnacle of fame in the treatment of another malady, which, as he well knows, is frequently induced by [corpulence].\\" (p24) His own diet was four meals per day, consisting of meat, greens, fruits, and dry wine. The emphasis was on avoiding sugar, saccharine matter, starch, beer, milk and butter. Banting‚Äôs pamphlet was popular for years to come, and would be used as a model for modern diets. Initially, he published the booklet at his personal expense. The self-published edition was so popular that he determined to sell it to the general public. The third and later editions were published by Harrison, London. Banting's booklet remains in print as of 2007, and is still available on-line. ==\\"Banting\\" as a verb== The popularity of the pamphlet mentioned above was such that the questions \\"Do you bant?\\" or \\"Are you banting?\\", still occasionally in use today, refer to his method, and sometimes even to dieting in general. In Swedish, \\"banta\\" is still the main verb for \\"being on a diet\\". Scientist Tim Noakes popularised Banting in South Africa when he named his high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet after Banting. ==Legacy== Gary Taubes' study of carbohydrates, Good Calories, Bad Calories, begins with a prologue entitled \\"A brief history of Banting\\" and discusses Banting at some length. Discussions of low-carbohydrate diets often begin with a discussion of Banting. ==Personal life== Banting was a distant relative of Sir Frederick Banting, the co- discoverer of insulin. Banting is buried alongside his wife and daughter at Brompton Cemetery, London, England. ==See also== ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * Banting Foundation *The History of

","title":"Mill Creek"},{"id":"518060","text":"The Temple of Elemental Evil is an adventure module for the fantasy role- playing game Dungeons & Dragons, set in the game's World of Greyhawk campaign setting. The module was published by TSR, Inc. in 1985 for the first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules. It was written by Gary Gygax and Frank Mentzer, and is an expansion of an earlier Gygax module, The Village of Hommlet (TSR, 1979). The Temple of Elemental Evil is also the title of a related 2001 Thomas M. Reid novel and an Atari computer game, and the term is used by fans of the setting to refer to the fictional Temple itself. The Temple of Elemental Evil was ranked the 4th greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game. ==Plot summary== In the module T1 The Village of Hommlet, the player characters must defeat the raiders in a nearby fort, and thereafter Hommlet can be used as a base for the party's subsequent adventures. The adventure begins in the eponymous village of Hommlet, situated near the site of a past battle against evil forces operating from the Temple. The adventurers travel through Hommlet and are drawn into a web of conspiracy and deception. The module is recommended for first-level characters, who begin the adventure \\"weary, weak, and practically void of money\\". They travel to a town that is supposed to be a great place to earn fortunes, defeat enemy creatures, but also to lose one's life. While the town initially appears warm and hospitable, the characters soon learn that many of its inhabitants are powerful spies for minions of evil. The T1 adventure stands alone, but also forms the first part of T1‚Äì4. In The Temple of Elemental Evil, the characters start off at low level, and after establishing themselves in Hommlet, they gradually work their way through the immense dungeons beneath the Temple, thereby gaining experience. T1 culminates in a ruined moathouse where agents secretly plan to re-enter the Temple and free the demoness Zuggtmoy, imprisoned therein. The Village of Hommlet module has been described as a beginner's scenario, which starts in the village, and leads to a nearby dungeon, while The Temple of Elemental Evil continues the adventure. (preview) In the next section, T2, the adventurers move on to the nearby village of Nulb to confront several nefarious opponents, including agents from the Temple. Based on the outcome of these encounters, the player characters can then enter the Temple itself to interact with its many denizens and test their mettle against Zuggtmoy herself. ===History of the temple=== The temple referenced in the module's title is an unholy structure located in the central Flanaess not far from the city-state of Verbobonc. In 566 CY, forces of evil from Dyvers or the Wild Coast constructed a small chapel outside the nearby village of Nulb. The chapel was quickly built into a stone temple from which bandits and evil humanoids began to operate with increasing frequency. In 569 CY, a combined force was sent to destroy the Temple and put an end to the marauding. This allied army clashed with a horde of evil men and humanoids, including orcs, ogres and gnolls, at the Battle of Emridy Meadows. Men-at-arms from Furyondy and Veluna united with dwarves from the Lortmils, gnomes from the Kron Hills, and an army of elven archers to face the threat of the Horde of Elemental Evil, consisting largely of savage humanoids such as orcs, ogres, and gnolls. The arrival of the elves from the shadows of the Gnarley Forest turned the tide of battle, trapping the savage humanoids against a bend in the Velverdyva where they were routed and slaughtered. At some point in this battle, Serten, cleric of Saint Cuthbert and member of the Citadel of Eight, was slain. The Citadel was notable for its absence at this pivotal moment in the history of the Flanaess, and their failure to take part in the Battle of Emridy Meadows contributed to the group's decline and eventual disbandment. After dispersing the Horde of Elemental Evil, the allied forces laid siege to the Temple of Elemental Evil itself, defeating it within a fortnight. Spellcasters loyal to the goodly army cooperated on a spell of sealing that bound the demoness Zuggtmoy (a major instigator in the Horde of Elemental Evil) to some of the deepest chambers in the castle's dungeons. The site itself remained, however, and over the following decade rumors of evil presence there persisted. The Viscount of Verbobonc and the Archcleric of Veluna became increasingly concerned, and cooperated to build a small castle outside the Village of Hommlet to guard against the possibility of the Temple rising again. For the next five years, Hommlet gained in wealth thanks to adventurers who came to the area seeking out remnants of evil to slay. Things quieted down for another four years as the area returned to peace and normalcy, but in 578 CY evil began to stir again, with groups of bandits riding the roads. In 579 CY, the events in the T1‚Äì4 module occur. Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil is set 12 years later, in 591 CY. ==Publication history== The adventure module The Village of Hommlet was a 24-page booklet designed by Gary Gygax, and published by TSR in 1979. The original printing featured an outer folder and a two-color cover; the book was reprinted in 1981 with a color cover. The Temple of Elemental Evil was originally intended to bear the module code T2 and serve as a true sequel to The Village of Hommlet. Gygax began writing T2 soon after the publication of T1, but often stopped to work on other products, such as The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth (Gygax 1981). The T2 version was never completed, and no module bearing the codes T3 or T4 was ever independently published. Instead, the material for the sequel was combined in 1985 with the original T1 storyline and published as an integrated adventure bearing the module code T1-4. The original printings of T1 featured monochrome cover art by David A. Trampier, who also contributed interior art along with David C. Sutherland III. The 1981 and subsequent printings of T1 featured a new color cover painting by Jeff Dee surrounded by a lime green border. The expanded T1-4 book from 1985 features cover art by Keith Parkinson and interior art by Jeff Butler, Clyde Caldwell, Jeff Easley, Larry Elmore, Parkinson, and Trampier. T1-4 The Temple of Elemental Evil was written by Gary Gygax with Frank Mentzer, and published by TSR in 1985, incorporating T1 The Village of Hommlet. The module was a 128-page book with a 16-page map booklet, and featured a cover by Keith Parkinson and interior illustrations by Jeff Butler, Clyde Caldwell, Jeff Easley, Larry Elmore, and Dave Trampier. The module includes descriptions of two towns, the Temple itself, and four large dungeon levels. Although initially written as a stand-alone series, T1-4 was made to dovetail into A1-4 Scourge of the Slave Lords when these two campaigns were revised in 1986 as supermodules. The combined campaign then culminates with the GDQ series, incorporating modules G1-G3 Against the Giants; D1-D3, which introduced D&D; fans to drow elves for the first time; and finally Q1, Queen of the Demonweb Pits, in which the heroes fight against the spider demon Lolth herself. These last adventures were also combined and republished as a supermodule bearing the code GDQ1-7, Queen of the Spiders. In 2001, Wizards of the Coast published a novel by Thomas M. Reid also bearing the title The Temple of Elemental Evil.Reid, Thomas M. The Temple of Elemental Evil (Wizards of the Coast, 2001) Wizards of the Coast also published a sequel to the T1-4 adventure in 2001, the 3rd Edition module Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil. Wizards of the Coast published a remake of The Village of Hommlet adventure for Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition and released it through the RPGA. The original TSR product code for module T1 (bluetone and full color cover) is 9026. ==Reception== Kirby T. Griffis reviewed The Village of Hommlet in 1981, in The Space Gamer #35. Griffis found it a very playable module, noting that the module could be very fun if run by a good DM. Griffis commented: \\"Players 'get into' their roles, the thieves stealing from the revellers at the inn, the fighters getting drunk under the table.\\" He also found the map to be well- keyed, and noted that important buildings have floor plans mapped out. Commenting on the imbalance of power, he noted that \\"some of the evil spies are entirely too powerful for the party to tackle, and the local high level good characters are hardly ever interested in aiding the adventurers.\\" Overall, Griffis found The Village of Hommlet to be a very good introductory adventure, and recommended it as an introduction to D&D.; ==Legacy== The Temple of Elemental Evil was ranked the 4th greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game. Dungeon Master for Dummies listed The Temple of Elemental Evil as one of the ten best classic adventures, calling it \\"the grandfather of all huge dungeon crawls\\". Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book Heroic Worlds, says of The Temple of Elemental Evil, \\"If you like huge classic dungeon crawls, this is probably the best of the lot.\\" == Computer games == In 2003 a computer game, The Temple of Elemental Evil, based on the original T1-4 module was released. It was developed by Troika Games and published by Atari. It remains the only D&D; related computer game set in the original Greyhawk setting.Cain, Tim. The Temple of Elemental Evil. New York: Atari, 2003 In an update to the game, Dungeons & Dragons Online has made an in-game version of the adventure. In the same month that DDO's update went live, the online D&D; game Neverwinter also released an in-game version of the Temple of Elemental Evil. == References == ==Further reading== *Cook, Monte.
