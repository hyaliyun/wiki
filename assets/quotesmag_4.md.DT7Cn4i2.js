Located adjacent to Frederiksberg Palace, a former royal summer residence, it was originally built as stables, kitchen facilities and residential quarters for lackeys. It is a three-winged complex of low yellow buildings with red tile roofs and white windows and cornices. It has been in use by the Royal Danish Military Academy that now occupies Frederiksberg Palace since 1868. The buildings are listed on the Danish Registry of Protected Buildings and Places. A new riding hall was built on the central courtyard of the complex in the late 19th century and has now been converted into an auditorium. It is not listed. ==History== Rendering for the stables Lakajgården seen from Frederiksberg Palace on a drawing by H. G. F. Holm from c. 1823 picknick lawn on a drawing by P. C. Klæstrup, 1868 Frederiksberg Palace was completed on a local hilltop in 1703. Lakajgården was built on an adjacent site lower down on a hill to provide residential quarters for lackeys as well as new kitchen facilities and stables. The kitchen had originally been located in the basement of the palace, but moving it to a separate building reduced the risk of fires. The Lakajgården site was dug down into the hill to provide level ground for the construction, and a tunnel was constructed between the complex and the palace. The stables had room for 64 horses and the wagon house had room for four carriages. Lakajgården was built on lower ground just east of the palace in the 1720s to a design by Johan Conrad Ernst. The complex was dug into the hill to keep it from spoiling the views to and from the palace. Lakajgården was taken over by the Royal Danish Military Academy along with the palace in 1868. The kitchen wing was converted to a laboratory. Two thirds of the Stables Wing was converted into a drill house in 1870. The rest of the stables remained in use as stables for horses until 1974. ==Architecture== The eastern end of the north wing seen from Roskildevej Lakajården is a three-winged complex surrounding a courtyard that is open to the south facing Roskildevej. All three wings have yellow finishing on the exterior walls, hipped or half-hipped red tile roofs, and white windows and cornices. The west wing is the former kitchen and is therefore also known as the Kitchen Wing or Laboratory Wing. It is one storey, built from brick and has a hipped roof. A small, slightly lower appendix projects from the east side of the building at each end. These are the remains of an extension which originally ran in the full length of the building but where the central part was removed in 1870. The eastern end of the north wing seen from Roskildevej The long north wing is the former stables. The building has black-painted, exposed timber framing, but the timber framing has partly been removed on the two gables. The roof is half hipped at its eastern end and is hipped at its western end. The surviving part of the stables is located in the eastern end of the building. Its interior contains wooden columns with faux marbling. The eastern Residential Wing The east wing is built in brick and has a half hipped tile roof. It is built in two storeys to the west and three storeys to the east as a result of the sloping terrain. The roof is half hipped. The ground floor was originally used as a carriage house with room for four carriages while the low upper floor contained a corridor with 27 rooms for lackeys and other personnel. The upper floor was heightened when the building was converted to exclusively residential quarters at the beginning of the 19th century. The two gates in the western facade were also removed at this point. The tunnel that links the Lakajgården site with the palace is barrel vaulted and has white-washed walls. It was renovated in 2012 after suffering from moisture problems for years. ==Today== The former riding hall that was converted into an auditorium in 2007-09 The Laboratory Wing is now used as a fitness center. The western end of the Stables Wing is now used as a gym hall while the stables in the eastern end of the building remain intact but are no longer used for stabling of horses. The attic, formerly used for storing horse feed, has been converted into locker rooms. The Residential Wing (Lackey Building) contains six apartments. A gardens is located on the east side of the building. The former Riding Hall was adapted for use as an auditorium and conference centre by E+N Arkitektur in 2007-09. The conversion received a diploma from Frederiksberg Municipality in 2009. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Royal Danish Military Academy Category:Listed buildings and structures in Frederiksberg Municipality ","title":"Lakajgården"},{"id":"56099855","text":"David Grieco (born 19 September 1951) is an Italian director, screenwriter and former actor. ==Biography== Grandson of Ruggero Grieco, one of the founders of the Italian Communist Party, Grieco began his movie career as an actor and worked with directors such as Franco Zeffirelli and his two mentors Pier Paolo Pasolini and Bernardo Bertolucci.

Among his original works are Así es mi tierra, Mujeres Latinas, Amiga and Más allá del Corazón, songs that among others have allowed him to reach international stages and to be currently one of the most important figures of Honduran music. == Biography == Javier Monthiel was born on April 11, 1967 in Ocotepeque, son of Antonio Leiva and Tereza de Jesús Ramirez. Javier inherited his musical aptitude from his father, who was a Honduran saxophonist and musician by profession. However, Javier did not meet his father until he was twelve years old and never spent much time with him. More influential in his life was his stepfather Valentín Pérez, a railway worker, whom Javier credits with having taught him honesty, humility and the value of hard work. Javier began to sing at the school, initially at Soledad Fernández Cruz and then at the Dionisio de Herrera institute in San Pedro Sula, where in 1984 he won the Summer Song Festival championship in Tela, Atlántida in 1984. After Javier finished school in 1985, he worked at the national telecommunications company, Hondutel. During this time he performed at the amateur level and matured as a composer. In 1990, Javier Monthiel also entered the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras, where he obtained a degree in Business administration in 1998. In 1990 he also launched his professional career with the release of his first album produced in the Republic of El Salvador. This album included two original works, Tus Ojos Son and Culpables Rápido. These songs quickly became known within the romantic genre in Honduras. Recognized in Honduras by 1992, Javier Monthiel signed an artistic contract with a soft drink bottling company to perform in a series of concerts together with other artists from Latin America. During this tour, Javier shared the stage acting alternately with the puertorriqueño Chayanne in soccer stadiums in Honduras and Guatemala. After these successful performances, Javier Monthiel opened the concerts of the Mexican Yuri, the Argentinian Enanitos Verdes and Soda Stereo and the Venezuelan Ricardo Montaner among others. He subsequently alternated concerts with other international artists and opened presentations at important artistic and cultural events in Honduras, such as beauty pageants and the OTI Festival. In 1995 Javier Monthiel began presentations that would propel him to become one of the best-known artists in the country. That year he was invited to sing the Honduran National Anthem at the opening of the World Cup competitions in San Pedro Sula. This was followed by presentations at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, the Miami Orange Bowl at Miami, the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium at Washington DC, Estadio Revolución (now Estadio Rommel Fernández) in the city of Panama and Estadio Cuscatlán in El Salvador among others. Then, a year later, he was called to sing the National Anthem of Honduras for games of the Honduran national team when it played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. Today Javier Monthiel has 15 album productions, a wide variety of video musical clips produced in national and international stages, and a whole range of promotional material of international quality. These are representative of the discography and videography of this Central American artist, and documentaries in which he has participated. == Recognitions and awards == {  - ! Year !!

Kōchi is the main city of the prefecture with over 40% of its population. As of April 1, 2016, the city has an estimated population of 332,059 and a population density of 1,100 persons per km2. The total area is 309.22 km2. A symbol of the city is its most famous dish, katsuo tataki, made by lightly searing and seasoning bonito. ==Geography and climate== Downtown Kōchi, Japan Katsura Hama The area of Kōchi has three distinct geographic sections. The major settled part of the city lies at the head of Urado Bay, in a narrow alluvial plain crossed by several rivers, notably the Kagami River and Kokubu River. The plain is bounded by mountains to the north and a range of hills to the south and west. The northern mountains form the least densely populated part of the city, with the only settlement being along narrow river valleys. The highest point in Kōchi is Kuishi-yama at . To the south of the city centre, Urado Bay cuts through the hills to its outlet into the Pacific Ocean. The land surrounding the bay and a small strip of the coastline form the third part of the city. This area, although hillier and less dense than the plain, is nevertheless a major location of housing and port-related industry. Kōchi has a very wet humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), receiving twice as much rainfall as Shikoku's other chief cities Matsuyama and Takamatsu. It is also the most typhoon-prone of Japan's major cities owing to its location directly exposed to the open Pacific Ocean from which the storms enter the country, and has twice received over of rainfall in a day from a typhoon. ==History== Kōchi Castle The river plain now containing the city centre was originally settled as a castle town around the seat of the lords of Tosa Province, Kōchi Castle. The castle site was chosen by Lord Yamauchi Kazutoyo in 1601. The city takes its name from that of the castle. As the centre of administration for the province, and the prefecture which succeeded it, the town rapidly grew to become the largest settlement of the region. During the time of the Meiji Restoration, Kōchi became famous as a centre of pro-imperial ideology, and later for incubating democratic and human rights movements. The city was incorporated on April 1, 1889. Tram service began in the city on May 2, 1904, and the city was connected to the national rail network on November 12, 1951. On April 1, 1998, the city was designated as the first core city on Shikoku. On January 1, 2005, the villages of Kagami and Tosayama, both from Tosa District were merged into Kōchi. On January 1, 2008, the town of Haruno (from Agawa District) was also merged into Kōchi. WWII air raid Kōchi was selected as a target by the United States' XXI Bomber Command because of the city's status as a prefectural capital, and the fact that it was a center for industry and commercial trade. On July 3, 1945 at 6:22 PM (JST) 129 Aircraft took off to bomb Kōchi. 1060 tons of incendiary bombs were dropped on Kōchi, destroying 48% of the built up areas of the city. ==Government== The administrative functions of the city of Kōchi are directed by an elected mayor and 42-member assembly. The current mayor (since 2003) is Seiya Okazaki. ==Education== Kōchi is home to two universities, Kōchi University (national) and University of Kochi (prefectural), and four junior colleges. The city directly administers Kōchi Commercial High School, and 15 other high schools are located within the city boundaries. ==Events== Yosakoi Kōchi's most famous festival is the Yosakoi which is held in August. Teams of dancers dance to traditional and modern songs at various places around Kōchi. The total number of dancers is in the thousands. ==Transport== Kōchi Station The most visible form of transport within Kōchi is the tram service run by Tosaden Kōtsū. Its three lines with historic cars service the major north–south and east–west axes of the city. The city also has an extensive bus network. Kōchi is located on the JR Shikoku's Dosan Line connecting it to northern Shikoku, and via interchanges with the Tosa Kuroshio Railway to the eastern and western parts of Kōchi Prefecture. JR's central station in Kōchi is Kōchi Station. Kochi Expwy Kōchi is also serviced by the Kōchi interchange of the Kōchi Expressway which connects to the national expressway system. Kōchi Ryōma Airport in nearby Nankoku serves Kōchi. ==Tourism== Obiyamachi in downtown Kōchi City Harimaya-bashi Kōchi Castle still exists in its pre- restoration form, and is one of the main tourist attractions. Other places of interest in the city centre are the shopping arcade, the regular Sunday street markets which are close to a kilometre in length, and , a bridge that featured in a famous Kōchi song about the forbidden love of a Buddhist priest. The mountain holds a public park with views of the city, and is home to stop 31 on the Shikoku Pilgrimage, Chikurin-ji, as well as the Makino Botanical Garden. Temples 30 (Zenrakuji) and 33 (Sekkeiji) are also in the city. The Shinto Shrine Tosa jinja is located to the west.Kōchi Prefectural Museum of History, map; retrieved 2011-08-09 Off Museum Road (Kenritsu Bijutsukandori) is The Museum of Art, Kōchi, where the main collection is composed of expressionistic works related to Kōchi.

It depicts the 1828 death of statesman Manuel Dorrego, played by Rosich. It is considered to be a lost film. ==Production== The director Mario Gallo, an Italian who had arrived in Argentina in 1905, began shooting the country's first fiction films in 1908. The traditional account, endorsed by film researcher and historian Pablo C. Ducrós Hicken, is that El fusilamiento de Dorrego was released on 24 May 1908. Other researchers date its filming two years later, which would make 1909's La Revolución de Mayo the first. Filming took place on the terrace of the Teatro Nuevo and in the Palermo Woods of Buenos Aires. ==Legacy== Some scholars see in Gallo's film work the influence of , which since 1908 had been France's first approach to cinema as art, moving it away from the mere spectacle of the fairground. This had its first expression in The Assassination of the Duke of Guise, a film that also had the distinction of being the first to feature original music. Pablo C. Ducrós Hicken, who viewed El fusilamiento de Dorrego in the 1920s, compared it favorably with contemporary Pathé films, and described it as \\"well composed\\".

This resulted in numerous criminal, civil, regulatory and disciplinary proceedings in both Canada and the US. After Livent sought bankruptcy protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act in November 1998, it was subsequently placed into receivership in September 1999, with Ernst & Young being appointed as receiver and manager.ONSC, par. 16-17 In November 2001, a special receiver was appointed by the court with respect to any potential legal action against Deloitte, Livent's former auditor, and such action was commenced in February 2002, alleging that \\"Deloitte owed a duty to ensure that Livent’s financial statements were reported in accordance with its own accounting policies and generally accepted accounting principles,\\"ONSC, par. 20 which, if followed, would have revealed the extent of fraudulent activity that had been occurring within the company.ONSC, par. 22 It was further alleged that \\"[i]ts alleged negligent issuance of unqualified opinions, in turn, deprived the honest directors and shareholders of the opportunity to put a stop to the fraud, and the losses eventually caused to the company by the fraud, at an earlier date.\\"ONSC, par. 23 ==The courts below== At trial At the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Deloitte was held to have been negligent, and Gans J awarded damages totalling $84,750,000 to Livent. In so doing, he observed that the standard of care is based on the profession's generally accepted auditing standards, and that the current state of Canadian jurisprudence concerning an auditor's duty can be expressed as follows:ONSC, par. 59-62 :* \\"he must come to it with an inquiring mind ... suspecting that someone may have made a mistake somewhere and that a check must be made to ensure that there has been none.\\"Fomento (Sterling Area) Ltd v Selsdon Fountain Pen Co Ltd, [1958] 1 All ER 11, at 23 :* \\"it might be said that the modern procedures call for more sophistication and higher standards on the part of those who perform the work [and] it would seem that due skill and care calls for a more searching and critical approach today on matters of stock and provision for bad and doubtful debts than it did fifty years ago, and to some extent even ten years ago.\\"Pacific Acceptance Corporation v Forsyth, (1970) 92 WN (NSW) 92, at 74 :* \\"where an auditor who is following or attempting to follow GAAS has an opportunity to acquire or is exposed to knowledge or information which might affect his opinion but he fails to recognize and act on that information ... [s]uch an omission cannot, in my view, always be excused even if the auditor is following GAAS.\\"Revelstoke Credit Union v Miller, [1984] 2 WWR 297, at 303-304 In that regard, liability was assessed as follows: :* On a balance of probabilities, any breach of the standard of care in audits prior to 1996 did not cause any damage to Livent;ONSC, par. 106-107 :* The 1996 audit procedures did not conform to GAAS, but the negligence did not cause any compensable harm;ONSC, par. 170-173 :* Issues arising in the 1997 audit, together with issues arising from additional work related to assurance for a press release and comfort letter relating to financing efforts in mid-year, were so significant that Deloitte should have resigned as auditor and reported their findings to Livent's audit committee as well as to the securities regulators, or, alternatively, they should have refused to issue an auditor's report for that year;ONSC, par. 241-242 :* The doctrines of corporate identification and ex turpi causa non oritur actio were not available as a defence by DeloitteONSC, par. 261-273 :* Deloitte's negligence was the proximate cause of the damages in question, in line with recent English jurisprudence :* Contributory negligence was not available for reducing any damages in questionONSC, par. 327-343 :* Deepening insolvency, while much discussed in academic literature, did not assist in reducing damagesONSC, par. 344-352 On appeal Both parties appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. Deloitte appealed with respect to the issues of corporate identification, ex turpi causa and proximate liability, while Livent's cross-appeal submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to hold Deloitte liable for negligence in respect of the 1996 audit and also in reducing the award of damages by 25 per cent. The appeal and cross-appeal were both dismissed. In a 3-0 ruling, Blair JA held that: :* even if the factors identified in Canadian Dredge are satisfied, enquiries must be made by the Court as to whether applying attribution for the purposes of ex turpi causa is consistent with the contract or relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, and whether doing so is necessary to preserve the integrity of the justice system;ONCA, par. 158 :* the trial judge did not err in determining that the cause of action belonged to Livent, and no question of indeterminate liability arose;ONCA, par. 174-178 :* while auditors have a general duty to ensure that financial statements present \\"a fair and accurate picture\\" and to provide shareholders with the information necessary to help them in their oversight of management, auditors of publicly-traded corporations are also obliged to ensure that their reports help \\"to foster fair and efficient capital markets by protecting investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, and to maintain public confidence in those markets.\\"ONCA, par. 184-188 :* Deloitte was only responsible for those losses that were reasonably foreseeable as a result of its negligenceONCA, par. 372 :* the trial judge did not err in determining Deloitte's causation of negligence,ONCA, par. 378-380 nor was his approach in error in assessing the quantum of damagesONCA, par. 380 or as to not apply the doctrine of contributory negligenceONCA, par. 398 :* as to the cross-appeal, while auditors may be exposed to liability in the absence of fraud, the trial judge did not err in his approachONCA, par. 410-414 ==At the Supreme Court of Canada== In a 4-3 ruling, the appeal was allowed in part, and Livent was awarded for costs throughout. For the majority, Gascon and Brown JJ held that the framework established in Anns v Merton LBC and Cooper v Hobart served to identify whether a duty of care existed, and that the Court's previous decision in Hercules Managements Ltd had already established where liability may exist in the context of a statutory audit. Accordingly, Deloitte was liable for negligence only with respect to Livent's 1997 audit, and damages were reduced from $84,750,000 to $40,425,000. A several-stage analysis is required in order to properly determine whether liability arises: :* While Hercules stands for the general proposition that an auditor may owe its client a duty of care in relation to a particular undertaking, it is the Anns/Cooper framework that identifies a principled basis for imposing liability.SCC, par. 22 :* In Stage 1, foreseeability alone is not enough to establish a prima facie duty of care - it is also necessary to establish proximity;SCC, par. 23 therefore, in the prima facie duty of care analysis: ::* proximity entails asking whether the parties are in such a \\"close and direct\\" relationship that it would be \\"just and fair having regard to that relationship to impose a duty of care in law\\"SCC, par. 25 ::* reasonable foreseeability entails asking whether an injury to the plaintiff was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s negligenceSCC, par. 32 :* In Stage 2, where a prima facie duty of care is recognized on the basis of proximity and reasonable foreseeability, the question then becomes whether there are \\"residual policy considerations\\" outside the relationship of the parties that may negate the imposition of a duty of careSCC, par. 37 ::* In that regard, indeterminate liability is liability of a specific character, not of a specific amount, and it is only a residual policy considerationSCC, par. 43-45 Applied to the case at hand, Deloitte’s undertakings in relation to soliciting investment, and the 1997 Audit, gave rise to proximate relationships,SCC, par. 47 but the increase in Livent’s liquidation deficit which arose from its reliance on the Press Release and Comfort Letter connected with the first undertaking was not a reasonably foreseeable injury.SCC, par. 55 However, the injury that arose to Livent from the negligent handling of the 1997 audit was reasonably foreseeable, and there was no basis in distinguishing this case from the facts that arose in Hercules.SCC, par. 62, 64 In response to McLachlin CJ's assertion that, while the above framework for analysis was conceptually correct, residual policy considerations would have also defeated Livent's claim in this case,SCC, par. 167, 175-176 the majority declared: :* The character of indeterminacy has temporal, claimant and value aspects, none of which arise here.SCC, par. 62, 68 :* A remoteness analysisproposed at SCC, par. 173 does not apply, as the duty analysis is concerned with the type of injury that is reasonably foreseeable as flowing from the defendant’s conduct, whereas the remoteness analysis is concerned with the reasonable foreseeability of the actual injury suffered by the plaintiff.SCC, par. 78 However, Livent's loss was reasonably foreseeable.SCC, par. 79 :* The \\"SAAMCO principle\\" does not apply in the present case, as \\"the shareholders’ capacity to oversee the conduct of Livent’s business was entirely dependent upon the statutory audit preceding that oversight.\\"SCC, par. 86-93 While Canadian Dredge remains authoritative as to the application of the doctrine of corporate identification, its principles provide a sufficient basis to find that the actions of a directing mind be attributed to a corporation, not a necessary one, and, where its application would render meaningless the very purpose for which a duty of care was recognized, such application will rarely be in the public interest.SCC, par. 104 As to the question of contributory negligence, the Negligence Act in Ontario requires that a plaintiff’s fault be factored into the apportionment of damages. However, corporate identification is a prerequisite to the plaintiff, Livent, being at fault. Therefore, the Act only makes contribution by a negligent plaintiff mandatory; it does not make attribution of negligence to a plaintiff mandatory.SCC, par. 106-109 ==Impact== As the SCC held in Hercules, \\"if an action is to be brought [against an auditor] in respect of such losses, it must be brought either by the corporation itself (through management) or by way of a derivative action.\\"SCC, par. 18, quoting Hercules at par. 59 The case was notable in that it was initiated by Livent's bondholders, who were not in a position to sue directly but did finance the special receiver (acting on behalf of the corporation), whose litigation will enable them to receive a large part of the award. The win proves that this indirect route can succeed, but it will most likely benefit creditors more than shareholders. While Hercules expressed concern about the effect of indeterminate liability upon an auditor's duty of care, Livent found that it was not of sufficient concern, as well as declaring that auditors are no longer insulated from liability on the basis of policy concerns. The SCC also observed that \\"the liability that could attach to one year’s negligent audit could not extend beyond the following year’s audit,\\"SCC, par. 69 which has been observed to be a significant finding in limiting potential liability. The SCC's holding that a proximate relationship will preclude indeterminate liability in any event, in the context of a statutory audit, has been observed to be a key development in Canadian jurisprudence. Such jurisprudence was already developing, and at least one other ruling, in similar circumstances and with similar effect, was already made in a summary judgment in Ontario, even before the SCC handed down its judgment., discussing There are still uncertainties as to the extent to which the decision will affect the dynamics and details of the audit process. The Capital Markets Institute of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto hosted a panel in January 2018 to assess the implications of the decision for auditor responsibility, governance and Canadian public corporations. It is quite likely that audit firms will face greater insurance premiums as a result of their now-higher risk exposure, which will thus result in debate as to how that risk should be allocated (with likely cascading down into higher audit fees to be charged to all clients). Jurisprudence in this matter is mixed within the various members of the British Commonwealth. The Commercial Court of England and Wales stated in January 2019 that it did \\"not consider the Livent decision to be of any real assistance in identifying the scope of the duty of an auditor under English law, or as to the circumstances in which legal causation will be established. It appears from a consideration of the majority judgment that the approach to scope of duty in Canadian law is not identical to that in English law as it stands today, nor does there appear to have been any detailed analysis of the correlation or otherwise between the auditors' negligence and the particular losses claimed, which also involves a consideration of what reliance there was (on which the majority and the Chief Justice differed as to the existence of any such reliance).\\" ==Further reading== * * ==Notes and references== Notes Cited cases References Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:Canadian corporate case law Category:Canadian tort case law Category:2017 in Canadian case law ","title":"Deloitte &amp; Touche v Livent Inc (Receiver of)"},{"id":"56100072","text":"Roberto Danova (born Giacinto Bettoni; 27 August 1937) is best known as a music composer, arranger and producer, achieving record chart success - particularly in Ireland, the UK, Europe, South Africa and Australasia. ==Producing, arranging and composing== During the 1970s 1980s and 1990s Danova produced, arranged, or had compositions covered by many popular performers, including Joe Dolan (with whom he made a key contribution in the mid-1970s), Johnny Logan (whose career was overseen in the late 1970s by Danova and Louis Walsh), Mungo Jerry, Tom Jones, Demis Roussos, Engelbert Humperdinck, and Showaddywaddy, Since the mid-1980s Danova has developed an instrumental project General Lafayette, a series of albums and singles featuring some of his own compositions through the sound of the trumpet.

He was the eldest surviving son of Hendrick van Rensselaer (1667–1740), director of the Eastern patent of the Rensselaerswyck manor, and Catharina Van Brugh (1665–1730), daughter of merchant Johannes Pieterse Van Brugh (1624–1697).

He also owned a house in the city of Albany tracts of land outside the manor. During the later part of the 18th century, the Lower Manor was encroached on by New Englanders with Massachusetts titles to Van Rensselaer's lands. He fought a prolonged legal battle with the Massachusetts title owners in the courts, which reportedly \\"took its toll on the aging manor lord.\\" During this time, he called on the Sheriff of Albany to evict the people, which eventually led to bloodshed.

The Cardinal were led by eighth- year head coach David Shaw. They played their home games at Stanford Stadium and were members of the North Division of the Pac-12 Conference. Stanford, coming off a 9–5 season and an appearance in the Pac-12 Championship Game in 2017, began the year ranked 13th in the preseason AP Poll. They won their first four games of the year, including wins over No. 17 USC and No. 20 Oregon, and rose to 7th in the polls. The Cardinal then lost four of their next five games, compiling losses to Notre Dame, Utah, Washington State, and Washington. After closing out the regular season with three straight wins, Stanford was third in the Pac-12 North with a conference record of 6–3. They were invited to the Sun Bowl, where they defeated ACC runner-up Pittsburgh to end the year at 9–4 overall. Stanford's offense was led by junior quarterback K. J. Costello, who led the Pac-12 Conference in passer rating and finished in second in passing yards and touchdowns. Wide receiver J. J. Arcega-Whiteside finished with 1,059 receiving yards and a Pac-12-leading 14 receiving touchdowns. Offensive tackle Walker Little was named first-team all- conference. On defense, cornerback Paulson Adebo led the team with four interceptions and 17 passes defended, and was also named first-team all- conference. ==Previous season== The Cardinal finished the 2017 season 9–5, 7–2 in Pac-12 play to win a share of the North Division title with Washington. Due to their head-to-head win over Washington, they represented the North Division in the Pac-12 Championship Game where they lost to USC.

Preparations had already begun and souvenirs were on sale when he abdicated on 11 December 1936. To keep everything from going to waste, it was decided to hold the coronation of his brother and successor George VI on the same date. ==Accession== In January 1936, King George V died and his eldest son, Edward VIII, succeeded him as king. He was unmarried at that time, but the American socialite, Wallis Simpson, had accompanied him on numerous social occasions in years leading up to 1936; she was married to the shipping executive Ernest Aldrich Simpson and had previously been divorced. The relationship had not yet been reported in the British press. ==Preparation== Planning The Coronation Committee had been delayed when it met for the first time on 24 June 1936; Ramsay MacDonald, the Lord President of the Council, met with the Duke of Norfolk to discuss the proceedings; MacDonald would chair the Coronation Committee as a whole, and the Duke would chair the Executive Committee. While Edward VIII was away, cruising on the Nahlin with Wallis Simpson, his brother, Albert, Duke of York (the future George VI) sat in his place on the committees. Edward VIII had initially been reluctant to have a coronation at all (asking the Archbishop of Canterbury whether it could be dispensed with), but conceded that a shorter service would be acceptable; his desire for a lower-key event led to the planned abandonment of the royal procession through London the following day, the thanks-giving service at St Paul's Cathedral and the dinner with London dignitaries.Strong, Coronation, 2005, pp. 421-422 Archbishop of Canterbury Although the Executive Committee was at the direction of the Earl Marshal, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Lang, was also a driving force behind the preparations for the coronation and many of the decisions in respect to the order of service were made by or with him. Owing to his office, he was a member of both the Executive Committee and the Coronation Committee, which dealt with the detail and, as such, he attended all of the rehearsals. He tended to take a leading role in the planning process, becoming a key mediator when queries arose, and dealing with questions over how the service should be broadcast by the media.Beaken, Cosmo Lang: Archbishop in War and Crisis, 2012, pp. 132–133 ==Abdication== The King's desire to marry an allegedly unsuitable woman was the public reason for a constitutional crisis that led to his abdication from the throne on 11 December 1936. While plans for the coronation went ahead, this time for a different monarch, thousands of businesses, both large and small, were stuck with hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of pounds' worth of souvenirs and other memorabilia with Edward's face or monogram on them. ==Disposing of memorabilia== Coins All coinage with the portrait of Edward VIII was supposed to be destroyed Due to the brevity of his reign, both proof and circulation strikes of Edward VIII coinage are extremely rare, and highly desired by numismatists. While silver coinage was not supposed to be issued until just before the coronation was to take place, the new brass three-penny bit was already being made for introduction early in January 1937, and the entire stock was melted down. The same was done for other coins in Commonwealth realms, although rumours of a Canadian dollar surviving have made the rounds. Less than a dozen Edward VIII proof sets are believed to have survived. A few gold sovereigns were released, and the Royal Mint has a collection of pattern designs for Edward's coinage.A Sovereign becomes the most expensive British coin EVER! Four British possessions, British West Africa, British East Africa, Fiji and New Guinea minted a total of seven low denomination coins with his name (but not image). Three Indian states, Jodhpur, Jaipur and Kutch, each produced a coin with his name in the local scripts.King Edward VIII: His Place in Numismatics British Brass 3d coin Prior to its introduction, twelve coins were sent out to vending machine manufacturers to calibrate their machines. They were never returned to the mint, six are held in private hands and are worth thousands of pounds. The other six are still missing. An example was put up for at auction in 2013, at an asking price of £30,000.  Postage stamps   United Kingdom  As soon as the beginning of the reign in January 1936, the British Post Office were preparing two issues after the four definitive stamp series that was considered as an \\"Accession issue\\". Therefore, works at the Post Office and Harrison & Sons were done for a \\"Coronation issue\\" previewed for the 12 May 1937 and a final \\"Definitive issue\\".A.J. Kirk, King Edward VIII, The Great Britain Philatelic Society, 1974, page 1. Essays for the former were made with the King wearing different military uniforms, such as the Bertram Park's pictures of Edward VIII wearing the uniforms of the Welsh Guards and Seaforth Highlanders.Reproduced in A.J. Kirk, King Edward VIII, The Great Britain Philatelic Society, 1974, page 2. In March 1936, the King accepted the idea of larger stamps picturing his effigy and castles. However, the abdication ceased all designing efforts despite essays having been made.A.J. Kirk, King Edward VIII, The Great Britain Philatelic Society, 1974, pages 7-8.  Australia  The 2 pence red stamp project of Australia used a photograph of the King in uniform. The sole ornaments were the denomination into an oval in the bottom right corner and the red \\"POSTAGE\\" bar at the bottom. Printing of this stamp began in September 1936 at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's printing branch. All operations were stopped with the abdication.Lord Vestey and John Michael, Unissued Edward VIII Stamps of Australia (from display to the Society on 11 June 2009, The London Philatelist #1367, Royal Philatelic Society London, July–August 2009, pages 202-3. Despite the destruction of the stock and all material needed for the printing, a six x 2-pence red stamp signed corner block is in the hand of a British collector. On 29 September 1936, William Vanneck, 5th Baron Huntingfield, Governor of Victoria, visited the plant and was invited to sign and date one of the finished sheets. In the name of the Commonwealth Bank, printer John Ash offered the sheet to the Governor in October, but had to claim it back on 16 December. The sheet was given back the next day, but the six-stamp corner block bearing the signature was missing. The Governor had already sent it to someone in England and could not retrieve it. The stamps still exist and have sold for hundreds of thousands at auction.Unissued Australia King Edward VIII sells for $123,600 at Phoenix Auctions sale  Canada  In Canada, the official destruction of Edward VIII stamp dies and proofs happened on 25 and 27 January 1937; some essays were kept in the archives and the two plaster casts were saved by coin engraver Emmanuel Hahn and a postal officer.Paul J.

Essentially, the function of the belt is to prevent the cities, towns and villages in the large Greater Manchester and Merseyside conurbations from merging. It is managed by local planning authorities on guidance from central government. ==Geography== Land area taken up by the belt is 247,650 hectares, 1.9% of the total land area of England (2010). The main coverage of the belt is within northern Cheshire and southern Lancashire, with the Merseyside and Greater Manchester urban areas completely surrounded, and a small section extending into Derbyshire. The belt area surrounding Macclesfield is close to the Stoke-on-Trent belt, which is considered to be independent of the North West belt. The North West belt is contiguous with the South and West Yorkshire Green Belt along the Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire county boundary. The High Peak towns of Derbyshire, Glossop, New Mills, Hadfield, Charlesworth and Whaley Bridge are all enveloped. Small portions of separated green belt are dotted around the Blackpool urban area, helping to keep the settlements of Lytham St Annes, Poulton-le-Fylde, Warton/Freckleton and Kirkham separated.

The British Royal Navy captured her in 1793 and sold her in 1794, without apparently ever actually having taken her into service. Mercantile interests purchased her and initially named her Prince, but then renamed her Princess. She became a whaler until a French privateer captured her in 1796 during Princesss first whaling voyage. ==French Navy (1781-1793)== The eight Coquette-class corvettes were built to a design by Joseph-Marie-Blaise Coulomb. Blonde had a refit in 1783, when she was not coppered but had four 4-pounders added to her armament. In May and June 1782, she was under the command of Chevalier de Sparre, escorting the French 4000-man expeditionary force of the Invasion of Minorca (1781) from Mahon to Algesiras. On 12 June 1786, she departed Brest with the training fleet (escadre d'évolution) under Captain de Rivière, bound for Cherbourg. Twelve days later she took part in a naval review before Louis XVI. On 27 October 1787 she departed Brest under Captain de Chavagnac, bound for the Windward Islands station. Between 21 April and 8 October 1790 Blonde was under the command of Major de vaissseau Rafélis de Broves.Fonds Marine, p.22. In May 1790 she was at Saint-Domingue. She then sailed to Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and the Terre-Neuve station. She arrived at Saint Pierre and Miquelon on 4 July 1790. That month a mutiny broke out on board. On 27 October 1790 she departed Saint-Pierre and returned to Brest. There she was put in the reserve. From 11 January to 4 February 1793 Blonde was stationed at Brest and Lorient under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Deslandes. Then from 5 February she was under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Guérin de l'Epiney.Fonds Marine, p.56. ==British Royal Navy (1793-1794)== On 27 November 1793, the ships of a squadron under the command of Captain Thomas Pasley of captured Blonde off Ushant. At the time of her capture Blonde was armed with 28 guns and had a crew of 210 men under the command of Citizen Guerin. A subsequent prize money notice listed the vessels that shared in the proceeds as Bellerophon, , , , and . Some reports attribute the actual capture to Phaeton and Latona. The Royal Navy classed Blonde as a sixth-rate frigate. However, there are no records that suggest that the Royal Navy commissioned Blonde or that she saw any service. ==Merchant man and whaler (1794-1796)== On 23 April 1794 Thomas Wilkinson wrote to the British East India Company (EIC) offering the ship Prince, late Blonde, of 640 tons on behalf of her owners. He described her as undergoing a complete refit at Plymouth. He offered to bring sugar from Bengal at £26 5s per ton for sugar in boxes, and £24 5s for sugar in bags. He further specified that if the EIC would be willing to take her up at Plymouth her owners would reduce her rates by 10s the ton.Proceedings... (1795), pp.835-6. The EIC appears not to have taken up Prince, which also does not appear in any subsequent records. However, Princess, J. Hopper, master, and Wilkinson, owner, enters Lloyd's Register in 1795 with J. Hopper, master, Wilkinson, owner, and trade as London–South Seas Fishery, that is whaling. The entry gives Princesss origins as Brest, and her year of launch as 1786. She had received copper sheathing in 1795.Lloyd's Register (1795), Seq. №P454. Captain James Hopper acquired a letter of marque on 13 February 1795. He sailed for the fisheries on 31 March.British Southern Whale Fishery Database – voyages: Princess. Initially Princess was whaling off Brazil. During 1796 the French privateer Modeste, Captain Claude Deschiens, captured Princess while she was at anchor in Delagoa Bay.

It will be the home of Nashville SC, a Major League Soccer expansion franchise which began play in 2020 at its temporary home in Nissan Stadium. Lawsuits to prevent its construction filed by supporters of the historic Tennessee State Fair were dismissed by Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle in 2017 and 2019, but overturned by Appellate Judge J. Steven Stafford in July 2019 and litigation continues as of March 2020. ==Construction== In December 2016, the construction was expected to cost $275 million. Billionaire businessman John Ingram was expected to pay \\"$25 million up front and $9 million a year over 30 years to help retire Metro's annual $13 million debt for the $225 bond issuance.\\" Additionally, the Nashville Fairgrounds would be renovated for an additional $40 million. As part of the public-private partnership, Mayor Megan Barry vowed to give \\"10 acres of city-owned fairgrounds land for a mix-use development next to the stadium\\" to the developers, including Ingram. The Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County approved $25 million in 2018, and an additional $5 million was approved directly by Mayor David Briley's office \\"from a 2017 contingency fund\\" without the council's approval in February 2019, for a total of $37.6 million. The stadium is expected to be part of a re-development project at the fairgrounds site that is to also include a relocated Expo event space, new mixed-use retail and residential buildings and an upgraded Fairgrounds Speedway capable of hosting NASCAR events. By February 2019, its construction had been delayed and its budget had increased. The original builder, Ely Concrete, abandoned the project and they were replaced by TRC Construction Services. By August 2019, the construction was expected to cost \\"between $325 million and $345 million\\", or \\"between $50 million and $70 million more than initial estimates,\\" to be covered by billionaire Ingram and other investors, not taxpayers. As of July 2019, an exposition center was under construction for the State Fair. By August 23, the fair was expected to be held on September 6-15 \\"in the old fairgrounds space.\\" A resolution to stop the demolition of buildings and make way for the stadium was introduced by council member Steve Glover on August 2, but it was voted down on August 21. Nashville SC was originally supposed to start playing in the stadium in 2020, but by 2019 it had been delayed to 2022. It is expected to be \\"the largest stadium built for soccer in North America\\" according to The Tennessean. On March 29, 2019, Trevecca Nazarene University announced that in addition to the launching of its football program in 2021, it also announced that the team will be playing home games at the stadium in 2022. Revised stadium deal and construction On February 13, 2020, the agreements of the stadium deal were amended in order to allow for construction to begin on the site. This amended deal, an agreement reached by Nashville mayor John Cooper and the club's lead owner, John R. Ingram, stated that the team will fund 100 percent of the stadium's construction costs on the Fairgrounds site. This will be accomplished through lease payments on the stadium, cash investments, and revenue collected from the attendees of events at the stadium. In addition to the aforementioned agreement from the team, Nashville SC also committed to paying for the infrastructure in the immediate area around the stadium, estimated to cost $19 million. The team will pay $35 million in lease payments. Altogether, the team has agreed to a total of $54 million in additional payments. In addition to the aforementioned monetary agreements of the deal, the team and the city finally came to an agreement on the parcel of land titled 8C. Parcel 8C is about 2.4 acres in size and is located between the site of the future stadium and the Fairgrounds Speedway. This parcel of land is what prohibited a deal from being reached prior to February 13, 2020. Mayor Cooper wanted the team to give up this piece of land and in a response to a letter from John Ingram, Cooper described parcel 8C saying, \\"The public space that links two 30,000-seat stadiums has the potential to become one of the most important in Nashville. Careful design and execution is essential to make the site work for two large public venues - supporting circulation, security, staging and access.\\" Ultimately, the deal reached between the city and the team on February 13 stated that the piece of land will be made into a mixed-use open plaza that will allow space for future Fairgrounds and Speedway activities and uses. On March 16, 2020, demolition on the fairgrounds site began. On April 9, 2020, Ian Ayre published an open letter to fans stating that the demolition on the site is “progressing steadily and in a timely fashion.\\" Ayre also stated that team had completed construction documents and that the expected completion date for the stadium is mid-May 2022. ==Lawsuits== In November 2017, Metro Nashville was sued by a group called Save Our Fairgrounds on the basis that the construction could disrupt the Tennessee State Fair, the Nashville Flea Market, and Fairgrounds Speedway racing activities. The lawsuit was dismissed by Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle in December 2017. The dismissal was overturned by Appellate Judge J. Steven Stafford in July 2019 to address the \\"duties of the Fair Board and their ability to collect taxes on fairground activities.\\" In January 2019, a second lawsuit was filed by Tennessee State Fair Association (TSFA), chaired by Republican Congressman John Rose, against the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County. According to The Tennessean, the suit contended that the construction of the stadium failed to \\"leave sufficient space and structures for the state fair, which is a protected use in the Metro Charter.\\" The suit was dismissed by the same judge, Ellen Hobbs Lyle, a few days later. The TSFA planned to take the case to the Tennessee Supreme Court, but on February 19, 2019 they decided to settle out of court and hope for a meeting with the Metropolitan Council. ==Design== The stadium is being designed by Populous, a firm in Kansas City that had also designed venues for other MLS clubs. It will seat 30,000 people, making it the largest soccer-specific stadium in North America, and include six lounges and \\"two dozen\\" box suites. A dedicated entry gate for the supporters group will be located on the north side. ==ReferencesExternal links== Stadium Site via Nashville SC Category:Buildings and structures in Nashville, Tennessee Category:Nashville SC Category:Proposed stadiums in the United States Category:Soccer venues in Tennessee Category:Major League Soccer stadiums Category:Ingram family ","title":"Nashville Fairgrounds Stadium"},{"id":"56100364","text":"Jan Baikowski (1590–1651) was a Roman Catholic prelate who served as Titular Bishop of Aenus (1626–1651) and Auxiliary Bishop of Poznań (1626–1651).

As Lullatone's Shawn James Seymour explained, \\"We just chose sounds for each set that we thought would work well together to make a song with a few random dudes thrown it to give it some spice!\\" ==Release and reception== Before its official release, Patatap was featured at the Monarch bar in San Francisco in 2012 and Gray Area's Creative Code program in 2013.

The inscription is from the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism. It is notable for its dedicatory verse to Durga, and including the symbol for Om in Gupta era. The inscription states that king Anantavarman is dedicating a goddess Katyayani (Durga- Mahishasuramardini) statue to the cave. The statue was missing when the caves came to the attention of archaeologists in the late 18th-century. ==History== The Gopika Cave, also called Gopi ka Kubha is one of three caves found in the Nagarjuni Hill cluster near the Barabar Caves in Bihar. The other two are Vapiyaka Cave and Vadathika Cave, also called Vapiya ka Kubha and Vadathi ka Kubha respectively. These are near the Lomas Rishi Cave, the earliest known cave excavated in 3rd century BCE and gifted by Ashoka to the Ajivikas monks. The Nangarjuni Caves were excavated in 214 BCE from a granite hill by the grandson of Ashoka. They are about north of Gaya. According to Arthur Basham, the motifs carved in these groups of caves as well as inscriptions help establish that the Nagarjuni and Barabar Hill caves are from the 3rd century BCE. The original inhabitants of these were the Ajivikas, a non-Buddhist Indian religion that later became extinct. They abandoned the caves at some point. Then the Buddhists used these caves because there are the Bodhimula and Klesa-kantara inscriptions found here. Centuries later, a Hindu king named Anantavarman, of Maukhari dynasty, dedicated Hindu murti (images) of Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism in three of these caves in the 5th or 6th century. To mark the consecration, he left inscriptions in Sanskrit. These inscriptions are in then prevalent Gupta script and these have survived.;For more on Maukhari dating, see: Maukhari dynasty, Encyclopaedia Britannica After the 14th-century, the area was occupied by Muslims, as a number of tombs are nearby. The Gopika Cave, literally \\"milkmaid's cave\\", is the largest of the three caves in the Nagarjuni hill. It is found on the southern side of the hill, with an entrance facing south. The other two caves (the Vadathika and Vapiyaka caves) are on the northern side of the same hill. The cave is approached by a flight of steps also carved in stone. When Alexander Cunningham visited the cave in the 1860s, he wrote, \\"the cave was concealed partly by a tree and by an Idgah wall\\" built by Muslims. The cave is about long by broad, with semi-circular ends. It has one entrance. Over the entrance is an inscription by the grandson of Ashoka, Dasaratha Maurya, dedicating the cave to the Ajivika ascetics, which dates the cave to the end of the 3rd- century BCE. This smaller inscription, as translated by James Prinsep starts with \\"The Gopi's Cave, an abode....\\", which gives the cave its name. The Gopika Cave inscription of Anantavarman, inside the entrance corridor on the left handside, was first noticed in 1785 by J. H. Harrington, then reported to scholars in the 1788 issue of Asiatic Researches, Volume 1. Harrington stated that Muslims were living near these caves. He speculated that these once were \\"religious temples\\" because he saw three defaced images in them. The inscription, in Late Brahmi, was copied by Harrington and first deciphered in 1785 by Charles Wilkins, who published an essentially correct translation. Wilkins seems to have relied essentially on the similarities with later Brahmic scripts, such as the script of the Pala period and early forms of Devanagari. Wilkins also correctly identified the inscription to be related to Hinduism. Another translation was published by Kamalakanta Vidyalankar with James Prinsep in 1837. John Fleet published another revised translation in 1888. ==Description== The inscription (left half). Entrance corridor of the Gopika cave, with the Gopika Cave Inscription of Anantavarman on the polished granite wall to the right. The inscription is carved on the wall inside the entrance corridor, and is about by in surface. It has ten lines in Gupta script, with letters approximately tall. It is one of the earliest Indian inscriptions that uses full matras (horizontal bar above each letter). The inscription is well preserved except for the name of village gifted by the king for the maintenance of the Durga temple. The missing part is in the 10th line which seems intentionally damaged by someone. Inscription, edited by Fleet > 1\\\\.

Diploleis mayri is less frequent on rose shrubs than D. rosae. ==Description== Its galls show in their external morphology resemblance to the mossy rose gall or robin's pincushion (Diplolepis rosae), but the surface of the gall is less covered and the emergences on it are more spine-like. It may appear together with D. rosae on the same host plant. Galls of D. mayri are multilocular and its chambers have thicker walls than found in D. rosae. ==Predators, parasitoids and inquilines== In the winter time galls of D. mayri are often opened by predators just as are the galls of D. rosae. These predators may be birds as in the case of other Cynipidae galls: for D. rosae the lesser spotted woodpecker (Picoides minor), for Andricus spp. and Neuroterus spp. the great tit (Parus major). In its galls occurs the same parasitoid assemblage as known for D. rosae. The most abundant parasitoids of both galls are Orthopelma mediator, Torymus bedeguaris, Glyphomerus stigma and Pteromalus bedeguaris. One inquiline species, Periclistus brandtii also occurs in both galls. Caenacis inflexa is exclusively the parasitoid of this inquiline. Other species as Torymus rubi, Eupelmus urozonus, Eupelmus vesicularis, Eurytoma rosae can be the parasitoids of both gall inducers and the inquiline. ==References== Category:Cynipidae Category:Gall-inducing insects ","title":"Diplolepis mayri"},{"id":"56100741","text":"Stanislavs Ladusãns (, 22 August 1912 – 25 July 1993) was a Latvian-Brazilian professor of philosophy, a member of the Brazilian Academy of Philosophy, and a Jesuit priest who arrived in Brazil on 17 February 1947.

In 1970, he founded the Brazilian Society of Catholic Philosophers and later the Center for Philosophical Research in São Paulo. From 1953 onwards, Ladusãns took over the direction of the Library of the Center for Higher Studies of the Society of Jesus, specializing in Philosophy and Theology. Already with a post-doctorate degree, Ladusãns was not able to return to Latvia because of the Soviet occupation. He hid his identity from the security organs, since, at the time, Latvians were forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union. His ideas emerge from the thirteenth century and synthesize Thomism from the standpoint of modern philosophy and phenomenology. He was also a scholar of the Prussian philosopher Immanuel Kant, to whom he devoted his doctoral thesis.

During a scientific research on the situation of Brazilian philosophical thought, he came into contact with Mário's philosophy with whom he began to have frequent personal contacts.

It is the theme song of the CX television series Yuzurenai Yoru, starring Kudo herself. \\"Gekijō\\" was written by Miyuki Nakajima specifically for the drama; after reading the script, Kudo immediately thought of Nakajima for the soundtrack and sought to have her write the theme song. Nakajima's lyrics invoke the series' title, which loosely translates to \\"Unyielding Night\\". ==Background and composition== \\"Gekijō\\" marks the first collaboration between Kudo and Nakajima since \\"Dōkoku\\", and the first song Nakajima has written for Kudo on which she is credited for both the lyrics and the music. It is composed in the key of G minor and set to a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Kudo's vocals span from G3 to C5. Nakajima produced the song with her long-time collaborator Ichizō Seo. Lyrically, the song deals with the theme of infidelity. Nakajima writes about a protagonist having to face adversity in love because her lover is romantically committed to someone else. The narrator laments having to cause others pain and ponders where succumbing to passion will lead her. Nakajima received acclaim for the sorrowful and typically Japanese tone of her lyrics and melody. Kudo's vocal performance was praised for its firmness. ==Cover versions== In 1997, Nakajima covered the song in concert while touring for the album Paradise Cafe. In 2014, Momoiro Clover Z performed the song with Kudo on the CX variety show Shin Dōmoto Kyōdai. That same year, Tomomi Kahara performed \\"Gekijō\\" in duet with Kudo on the CX music show Atashi no Ongaku. In 2017, Tomokazu Seki recorded a cover of the song for the tribute album, Shizuka Kudo Tribute. ==Chart performance== \\"Gekijō\\" debuted at number ten on the Oricon Singles Chart with 68,000 copies sold in its first week, becoming Kudo's first single to break the top 10 since \\"Ice Rain\\". It slid to number twelve on its second week, selling 52,000 copies. It spent the following five weeks in the top 20 before dropping to number 25 on its tenth charting week. The single charted for a total of 15 weeks. With only its first two weeks counting towards the year-end tally, \\"Gekijō\\" did not place in the top 100 for 1996. However, with sales exceeding 303,000 copies, the single ranked at number 99 on the year-end Oricon Singles Chart for 1997. ==Track listingCharts== center;\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" Chart (1996–97) !scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Weekly Singles (Oricon)  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"10 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Monthly Singles (Oricon)  center;\\"15 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Yearly Singles (Oricon)  center;\\"99 } ==Certification== - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan (RIAJ)  Platinum  424,000 - ==References== Category:1996 songs Category:1996 singles Category:Songs written by Miyuki Nakajima Category:Japanese television drama theme songs Category:Television theme songs Category:Shizuka Kudo songs Category:Pony Canyon singles ","title":"Gekijō"},{"id":"56100891","text":"A Homecoming King is a ceremonial role in student homecoming rallies.

After the victory, scattered incidents of looting and shootings occurred throughout Chicago, with two teenagers being injured by stray bullets at a victory rally. 115 people were arrested. == 1992 == The most serious and widespread championship rioting occurred on June 14, 1992 after the Bulls defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the 1992 NBA Finals. Rioting occurred throughout city, starting with people pouring out of bars on Division Street and destroying two taxicabs and dancing in the streets. The most serious violence occurred in the impoverished neighborhoods on the city's South and West Sides. Over 200 civilians and 95 police officers were injured, 61 police vehicles were damaged, over 1,000 arrests made and 347 stores were looted, mostly along Madison Street. No one was killed during the rioting, but a liquor store clerk was severely burnt when looters set fire to the store.  Racial aspects  The Los Angeles riots occurred just over a month prior to the Championship riot, resulting in 63 deaths. The riots sparked unrest elsewhere in the country, such as Las Vegas, but Chicago avoided major demonstrations in the immediate aftermath. After the mass looting that occurred in Chicago's predominately black South and West side ghettos, newspaper speculated if Korean-owned stores were specifically targeted by black looters, as had been the case in Los Angeles. However, this was not the case as stores owned by all races of people were looted indiscriminately. 98% of people arrested for felony burglary during the riot were black, while only 69% of those arrested for burglary in 1992 in Chicago were black. Additionally, there was a heavy police presence in Chicago's downtown area, where mostly non-black fans celebrated, but not as many arrests. == 1993 == The Bulls defeated the Phoenix Suns on June 20, 1993, securing their third consecutive championship. Gunfire and looting began almost instantly after the victory, mostly concentrated along State Street on the city's south side, with gang members randomly firing guns into the air in celebration. 682 people were arrested, dozens of stores were looted and several police officers were wounded by projectiles and gunfire. While looting was not as widespread as it was during 1992, several people were killed during the 1993 riot. A fifteen- year-old boy was shot and killed at the Theodore K. Lawless Gardens Apartments minutes after the Bulls won the championship. Twelve-year old Michael Lowery was struck by a stray bullet while sitting in front of his house and later died. 26-year-old Rosalind Slaughter was also killed by a stray bullet. 25-year-old Henry McFadden was shot to death after stepping outside his home and eighteen-year-old Julio Castillo was dragged from his car and shot to death at an intersection where several other motorists were assaulted. The murders of Lowery and Slaughter were never solved. == 1996 == 38 stores were looted or broken into and 650 people were arrested after the Bulls defeated the Seattle SuperSonics to win the 1996 NBA championship on June 16, 1996. The city of Chicago had spent over $3 million in preparation for violence if the Bulls won. Despite the preparations, a teenager was stomped to death for wearing a Los Angeles Lakers jacket. He had been attacked so severely that the Swoosh logo from a Nike shoe was imprinted on his forehead. == 1997 == Prior to the Bulls winning the 1997 NBA Finals, Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley ordered 6,000 police officers and 200 to 300 National Guardsmen on the streets in preparation for possible violence if the Bulls won. When the Bulls did defeat the Utah Jazz on June 13, 1997 several stores were looted and three people died, including a 32-year-old man who was killed by stray gunfire after another man fired shots at teenagers who had thrown rocks at his truck.

She moved to the Bay Area as a young parent in 1976. Her recognizable figures are highly expressive, and serve as visual extensions of her critical and allegorical narratives. Israel has published writing from 2000–present and musical compositions since 2013. == Personal life== Israel and her husband, scientist and composer Ted King (Philadelphia, PA 1945-2001) met in the mid 70's, in San Francisco. They lived with their two daughters in the Mission district, Noe Valley, and the heart of their community was the Castro. In 1996 they moved across the Bay to the Vulcan Foundry Studios, a labyrinthine warehouse complex in Oakland, California. During the year 2001 Israel suffered two personal tragedies as first her mother, and then her husband died from cancer. Israel took a step back from making art during this time, but eventually returned with sculptures that are deeply reflective, and even richer with layered narrative. Israel met her partner Bill Lassell (1965-2009, Lafayette, CA) through the Vulcan community, where they organized art, writing and community events together before falling in love and beginning an eight-year creative partnership. Lassell was a documentary filmmaker with a degree in sociology, a video camera and a keen intellect; he filmed at Archie Bray in Montana, Boise State in Idaho, College of Marin, Mendocino College, Sonoma Art Center, Richmond Art Center and many more, as the couple traveled the invitational lecture circuit. For Israel, Bill Lassell's sudden, unexpected death, though peaceful, was a devastating blow. Through grief and recovery, she was sustained by attending music rehearsal in the warehouse, and in 2011 she began playing and composing on keyboards. ==Education == Israel graduated from a high school in the small village of Wappingers Falls, New York where she was awarded the Regents Honors Scholarship to Pratt Art Institute in New York City in 1972. In 1980, the artist completed the paramedic/EMT program at San Francisco General Hospital, and became one of the first three women paramedics in the City and County of San Francisco. A few years later, from 1983–1987, Israel attended San Francisco State University earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Art & Chemistry, and then returned in 1997 to acquire her Master of Fine Arts degree in 2000. While there, she studied with (among others) Stephen de Staebler, Joe Hawley, Candace Crockett, Paul Pratchenko, David Kuraoka, Paula Levine and Kathleen Hanna. == Teaching career == In the early 1970s, Israel began teaching art and ceramics, created a ceramic arts program at the Cleveland Friends School, in Cleveland, Ohio, and taught there from 1973–1974. After moving to San Francisco in 1976, she worked with the Rainbow Collective Childcare Group, teaching art to children at Honey Sandwich. In Fall 2000, Israel served as a one-term full-time Sculpture and Ceramics teacher at California State University, Bakersfield. From 2002- 2018, she taught Ceramics and Sculpture at Laney_College, where she also served as Art Department co- Chair; Israel taught Art History and Ceramic Sculpture at Merritt College from 2003–2018. Israel received a Distinguished faculty Service Award for her teaching as an adjunct Professor of Art at the Contra Costa Colleges from 2002–2006. == Fellowships, residencies, and collectives == After graduating from SF State University, Israel joined the Ruby's Clay Studio Collective in San Francisco from 1987–90. In 1990 she was accepted as artist in residence at the Doelger Art Center, by Daly City from 1990–95. There she hsd a 1800-ft studio, allowing her to push the direction and possibilities for her clay sculpture. The artist received critical attention and support in awards, grants, and exhibitions: a Virginia Groot Foundation Award, 1989; a show with the Korean Embassy Art Program in Los Angeles,1996; the 7th Sculptor On Campus, CSU Bakersfield, 1994, and Resident Artist at Serramonte Del Rey High School, Fall 1994. Israel is the only artist from the US to receive the prestigious International Fletcher Challenge Premier Award.

The mission was proposed in 2017 to NASA's New Frontiers program mission 4, and on 20 December 2017 it was one of two finalists selected for further concept development. On 27 June 2019, the other finalist, the Dragonfly mission, was chosen instead. Had it been selected in June 2019, it would have launched between 2024 and 2025, with a capsule delivering a sample back to Earth in 2038. The Principal Investigator is Steve Squyres of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. CAESAR would be managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Curation of the returned sample would take place at NASA's Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Directorate, based at Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. The CAESAR team chose comet 67P over other cometary targets in part because the data collected by the Rosetta mission, which studied the comet from 2014 to 2016, allows the spacecraft to be designed to the conditions there, increasing the mission's chance of success. The Rosetta mission also provides a vast geologic context for this mission's sample-return analysis. ==Overview== The Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko as seen by Rosetta in 2015; CAESAR proposed target. The two New Frontiers program Mission 4 finalists, announced on 20 December 2017, were Dragonfly to Titan, and CAESAR. Comet 67P was previously explored by the European Space Agency's Rosetta probe and its lander Philae during 2014-2016 to determine its origin and history. Squyres explained that knowing the existing conditions at the comet allows them to design systems that would dramatically improve the chances for success. The CAESAR and Dragonfly missions received funding each through the end of 2018 to further develop and mature their concepts. NASA selected the Dragonfly mission on 27 June 2019 to build and launch in 2026. Background A comet sample-return mission was one of the goals in a list of options for a New Frontiers mission in both the 2003 and the 2011 Planetary Science Decadal Survey, which were guiding surveys among those in the scientific community of what and where NASA should prioritize. Another comet mission proposal, Comet Hopper, was one of three Discovery Program finalists that received in May 2011 to develop a detailed concept study; however, it was not selected. NASA has launched several missions to comets in the late 1990s and 2000s; these missions include Deep Space 1 (launched 1998), Stardust (launched 1999), CONTOUR (launched 2002 but failed after launch), and Deep Impact (launched 2005), as well as some participation on the Rosetta mission. Astrobiology CAESAR objectives were to understand the formation of the Solar System and how these components came together to form planets and give rise to life. Some researchers have hypothesized that Earth may have been seeded with organic compounds early in its development by tholin-rich comets, providing the raw material necessary for life to emerge. Tholins were detected by the Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. ==Spacecraft== The spacecraft would be built by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems and it would inherit technology used by the successful Dawn mission. Navigation, sample site selection, and sample documentation are enabled by the camera suite, provided by Malin Space Science Systems. This camera suite consists of six cameras of varying fields of view and focal ranges: narrow angle camera (NAC), medium angle camera (MAC), touch-and-go camera (TAGCAM), two navigation cameras (NAVCAMs), and a sample container camera (CANCAM). The robotic arm (TAG) and the Sample Acquisition System would be provided by Honeybee Robotics. The sample return capsule and heatshield are provided by the Japanese space agency JAXA. Propulsion The NASA's Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT) operation in a vacuum chamber. The propulsion system on CAESAR would be NASA's Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT), a type of solar electric propulsion. It would employ three NEXT thrusters, with one used as a spare. The propellant is xenon. ==Sample return== The spacecraft would not land on the comet, but would momentarily contact the surface with its TAG (Touch-And- Go) robotic arm, as will be done by OSIRIS-REx on an asteroid, including raising the solar arrays into a Y-shaped configuration to minimize the chance of dust accumulation during contact and provide more ground clearance. The sampler mechanism on the arm would produce a burst of nitrogen gas to blow regolith particles into the sampler head located at the end of the arm. CAESAR would collect between of regolith from the comet. The maximum pebble size would be . The system has enough compressed nitrogen gas for three samplings. The system would separate the volatiles from the solid substances into separate containers and preserve the samples cold for the return trip. The spacecraft would head back to Earth and drop off the sample in a capsule, which would re-enter Earth's atmosphere and parachute down to the surface in 2038. The sample-return capsule (SRC) would be provided by JAXA and its design is based upon the SRC flown on the Hayabusa and Hayabusa2 spacecraft. The capsule would parachute down at the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR), and it would be transported to NASA's Johnson Space Center for curation and analyses at the laboratory called Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Directorate (ARES). A small portion of the sample will also be curated at Japan's Extraterrestrial Sample Curation Center. Most of the sample (≥75% of the total) would be preserved for analysis by future generations of scientists. ==See also== * * ==References== Category:Missions to comets Category:New Frontiers program proposals Category:Origin of life Category:Proposed NASA space probes Category:Proposed astrobiology space missions Category:Sample return missions ","title":"CAESAR (spacecraft)"},{"id":"56101365","text":"The Australian Department of Jobs and Small Business was a department of the Government of Australia charged with the responsibility for employment, job services and the labour market, workplace relations, small business, and deregulation.

The bloc includes several parties and movements. The organization was formed in 2014, in the first six months after the proclamation of independence of the Donetsk People's Republic from Ukraine. Satisfying the requirements of the CEC, this party became one of two (along with the party \\"Donetsk Republic\\") admitted to participation in the general elections in the Donetsk People's Republic on November 2, 2014. After registration, the party joined in campaigning in the streets with voters, and also on the Internet. The party is a supporter for the Independence of the historical and cultural region of Novorossiya from Ukraine. Ekaterina Gubareva was set to head the election list of Free Donbass for the elections of the People's Soviet of the Donetsk People's Republic of 11 November 2018 but on 29 September 2018 she was excluded from this list after she was held in custody by unknown people.

Bridget's father had been a supplier of illicit alcohol in Tamborambora Ford, on the Abercrombie River. His lawless career started when his brother was arrested for horse stealing. Larry was determined to make an attempt to rescue his brother. He got posse of desperate men, and set an ambush against the police who were conveying his brother to the Bigga lock-up. Only two mounted constables had been sent in charge of the prisoner, and they put up a fight. Cummings shot at a constable, who refused to obey the order to ' Bail up!' Instead of hitting the officer, however, the shot struck his brother which killed him. Cummins was eventually caught, tried, found guilty of manslaughter, and sentenced to life in Berrima gaol. He escaped and made his way back to his old haunts in the vicinity of Mudgee, Crookwell, Binda, and other towns. Linking up with Fred Lowry and John Foley, Cummins robbed the Mudgee mail coach in July 1863. There was rumored to be 5,700 pounds on the coach. He also attempted a robbery of Webb’s store at Mutton Falls. Here he was reported to have been slightly wounded in the face.

It is named after the book Ngā Uruora: The Groves of Life - Ecology & History in a New Zealand Landscape by ecologist Geoff Park. The main aims of Ngā Ururoa are protecting and restoring the Kapiti Coast's unique kohekohe forest, re-establishing forests through planting programmes, and undertaking pest and weed control. == Area == Ngā Uruora covers 292 hectares of coastal escarpment between Paekakariki and Pukerua Bay. The land is owned by KiwiRail, and the QE II National Trust has a licence to undertake conservation projects. Ngā Uruora has an agreement with the QE II National Trust to undertake planting, weed and pest control on the escarpment. The Paekakariki-Pukerua Bay escarpment is located within the Cook Strait Ecological District. The dominant native vegetation is Coprosma propinqua, Ozothamnus leptophyllus and Olearia solandri, with scattered kanuka-karaka-kohekohe forest remnants. == Biology == There are three biologically-significant sites on the escarpment: # Site No. 2u: An area at the north end noted for exposed coastal vegetation and Coprosma propinqua, ngaio, karaka, and kawakawa shrubland. It is one of the few remaining regional examples of coastal cliff shrubland and could develop into a coastal forest if left undisturbed. # Site No. 2v: This is the major kohekohe, mahoe, and karaka shrubland remnant. It is a regionally representative example of coastal cliff vegetation. # Site No. 2t: The general escarpment, including coastal cliff pohuehue shrubland, plus pasture grassland and scattered karaka-kohekohe forest remnants. Four species of native lizards have been identified on the escarpment as part of the Kāpiti Biodiversity Project: raukawa gecko (Woodworthia maculatus), northern grass skink (Oligosoma aff. polychroma), copper skink (Oligosoma aeneum), and the at-risk brown skink (Oligosoma zelandicum). Since 2017 weed clearance, habitat restoration, and rock-pile building has been undertaken to improve lizard habitat. The native bird species present include New Zealand kingfisher (Todiramphus sanctus vagans), pied shag (Phalacrocorax varius varius), grey warbler (Gerygone igata), North Island fantail (Rhipidura fuliginosa placabilis), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis lateralis), harrier (Circus approximans), kereru (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae), korimako (Anthornis melanura melanura), and New Zealand pipit (Anthus novaeseelandiae novaeseelandiae). Pipit are considered at at- risk species in New Zealand, and pied shags are nationally vulnerable. == History of project == Ngā Ururoa was set up in 1997 by Fergus Wheeler. It was nominated for an award for \\"weedbusting excellence\\" by Weedbusters in 2012, and won the Wellington Community Trust Regional Heritage & Environment award in 2013. Ngā Uruora volunteer Peter Kentish of Paraparaumu won a Kapiti Coast Civic Award in 2017 for his work. The Paekakariki-Pukerua Bay escarpment is home to the 10 km Escarpment Track; costing $1.4 million, this is the most expensive section of the entire national walkway network known as the Te Araroa Trail. Ngā Uruora was integral in getting the Escarpment Track established, as they had been using tracks through the area since 1997. Ngā Uruora is a member of The Kāpiti Coast Biodiversity Project that received $294,000 by the Ministry for the Environment in 2015. They hope to create a virtually predator-free 16.5 square kilometre \\"mainland island\\" in Kapiti. Ngā Uruora has a particular focus on restoring habitat for lizards and has an agreement with Department of Conservation (New Zealand) to carry out a lizard protection trial. At the beginning of 2017 Ngā Uruora installed a community webcam at the top of Paekakariki Hill Road overlooking the Kapiti Coast In 2018 Ngā Uruora was one of the recipients of funding from the Radio New Zealand programme known as Critter of the Week Ngā Uruora's conservation work with lizards featured on the Radio New Zealand Summer series programme in 2019 == References  External links == * Ngā Uruora discussed on RNZ Country Life 8 July 2011 Category:1997 establishments in New Zealand Category:Conservation projects in New Zealand Category:Paekakariki ","title":"Ngā Uruora - Kāpiti Project"},{"id":"56101520","text":"Mansudae Television () is an educational television station in North Korea.

In July 2015, Mansudae Television closed its on-air broadcasting- The exact reasons for the closure of the channel's broadcasting are unknown, however, two versions were considered in the Newstopia online edition (South Korea): According to the first, this step could be taken by the North Korean authorities to restrict the access of Pyongyang residents to foreign content broadcast on the channel. According to the second (reported by the Free Asia radio station), in the editorial board there was an incident with unfiltered content, shown on air on the channel.

The message of South Korean news agency Yonhap from May 18, 2016 reported that access to the television channel was proposed to be carried out through cable networks. In August 2016, the channel was included in the distribution via the Manbang IPTV system on the 2nd button of the \\"Aircast\\" section. In March 2018 Daily NK reported about the proposal of the DPRK government to organize the broadcasting of Mansudae Television on the principle of a paid subscription; however, according to the Daily NK, it was not established that the project is supposed to be carried out using traditional cable TV or Manbang IPTV.

Those sketches eventually made their way to YouTube and the FunnyOrDie website where they received more notability. Rob Huebel and Owen Burke, who created those original sketches, later decided to expand upon them with a full series. Huebel has commented that the show was loosely inspired by his fascination with 1980s projects like Stand by Me where kids could go off into the wilderness in search of an adventure, in addition to moments from Huebel’s own childhood when he and childhood friends would “find Penthouse magazines in these weird forts of teenagers.” Development On June 22, 2017, it was announced that YouTube had given the production a series order for a first season consisting of eight episodes. Executive producers were set to include Rob Huebel, Owen Burke, Nick Jasenovec, and Jonathan Stern. Production companies producing the series include Abominable Pictures and Funny or Die. Casting Alongside the series order announcement, it was confirmed that Rob Huebel would star in the series and that it would feature guest appearances from Adam Scott, Judy Greer, Terry Crews, Craig Robinson, and John Cho, among others. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:2017 American television series debuts Category:2017 American television series endings Category:2010s American drama television series Category:English-language television shows Category:YouTube Premium original series ","title":"Do You Want to See a Dead Body?"},{"id":"56101869","text":"Australians (also known as Michael Willesee's Australians) is a thirteen part anthology documentary drama series which screened on the Seven Network in 1988.http://www.australiantelevision.net/michael-willesees-australians/ == See also == * List of Australian television series ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Australians at the Australian Television Information Archive Category:1988 Australian television series debuts Category:Australian Broadcasting Corporation original programming ","title":"Australians (TV series)"},{"id":"56101879","text":"The Floris Grain Elevator, located off U.S. Route 64 in Floris, Oklahoma, was built in 1900 or 1926.

In 2019 he was awarded a United States Artists Fellow in Music and also the recipient of a 2019 Grants to Artists award in Music from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts. In 2015 he received a Joyce Foundation award. A South Florida native, born to Ecuadorian immigrants and based in Brooklyn, Roberto Carlos Lange’s upbringing provides essential elements to his songwriting, including his consistently bilingual—English and Spanish—lyrics. Exploring the expressivity within intense states of being, Latinx identity, and pluralistic sensibilities, his music as Helado Negro is an engrossing statement achieved through lyrically personal and political avant-pop music. Since Helado Negro’s 2009 debut album Awe Owe, Lange has cultivated an untraditional approach to songcraft that places his voice on an adventurous musical impulse without shying away from familiar pop appreciation, through multiple projects under various aliases. Helado Negro released his 2019 album This Is How You Smile through RVNG Intl., a Brooklyn-based music institution. This Is How You Smile received an 8.5 rating and Best New Music from Pitchfork. ==Early life== The son of Ecuadorean immigrants, Helado Negro (Roberto Carlos Lange) was born in South Florida in 1980. He grew up in Lauderhill and Davie. As a high school student during the early 1990s, Roberto Carlos Lange would stay up late watching \\"Liquid Television\\" on MTV. Intrigued by the experimental videos and animation he saw there, he \\"was fascinated by the mystery of how they were made, and was curious as to how to make them.\\" In 1999 he enrolled at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) in Savannah, Georgia, to study Computer Art and Sound Design. His sound studies focused on installation, performance and experimental art. During his time at SCAD, he participated in experimental sound and art shows, and he began to develop his musical work by purchasing an MPC sampler to create music. He graduated in 2003 with a B.F.A. in Computer Art from SCAD. ==Discography== Helado released his first full-length album in 2009 titled Awe Owe. In 2010, Helado released an EP titled Pasajero. Helado released his second full-length album in 2011 titled Canta Lechuza. In 2012, Helado released the first of a three part EP, titled Island Universe Story - One. Helado released his third full-length album in 2013 titled Invisible Life. Helado released the second Island Universe Story EP in 2013. In 2014, Helado released his fourth full-length album titled Double Youth. The third EP in Helado's three-part Island Universe Story series was released in 2014. In 2015, Helado released the single \\"Young, Latin and Proud\\" along with an animated-visual and lyric video. Lange describes the song as “It was as if I was singing my 6-year-old self a lullaby... It’s about feeling a sense of pride and self-confidence, understanding that you’re born into something and it’s alright to feel good about it. Stereotypes and contradictions are built into identity and I think those are a strong current in both Latino and black identity in the U.S. today.\\" In 2016, Helado released his fifth full-length album titled Private Energy. In this record, Helado exposes his vulnerabilities, stating \\"There’s so much that is special [and] fragile about us... We’re vulnerable and scared to share with people. I’m just sharing my own vulnerable shit. The hardest part is talking to somebody else about it. I’m the worst person to sum things up with words but the best [way] to sum it up is with music, you know?” In 2019 he released his sixth studio album titled This Is How You Smile. \\"Roberto Carlos Lange’s sixth and best album as Helado Negro deepens and expands upon the imagistic nature of his lyrics and cosmic synth-folk. It is a sublime, masterful piece of music.\\" ==Visual and sound art== In 2007 Lange collaborated with visual artist David Ellis to create \\"Trash Talk\\" for a Christian Marclay curated show at the ICA Philly. Sonic trash bags created by David Ellis rattled and bumped like a percussion team, put together out of garbage bags, cans, bottles, cardboard, plastic, paper, aluminum, tin, foam, wire, hardware, and electronics. The sequence was composed in collaboration with Roberto Lange. Together they collaborated on works that featured at Zoo Art Fair, NADA Art Fair, and Roebling Hall. Some pf these pieces included : \\"All Purpose Primer\\" (2007), \\"Trash Talk (2007), \\"Hell's Angel (2008), and \\"Liberty\\". The duo's collaborations extended into video as well, with Lange contributing the sonic score to several of Ellis's visual motion paintings; these pieces were created on-site including a commission by the clothing retailer Theory to create new works of art. Lange would sample and manipulate sound as it was being generated acoustically from Ellis's movements and incidental sounds while painting. In 2009, Lange scored the collaborative work by Blu and Ellis called \\"combo\\". In 2011, Lange contributed a site-specific sound sculpture called \\"HVAC Music Box\\", for the \\"Sequence of Waves\\" group show at Saint Cecilia's Convent in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The HVAC Music Box is a piece that uses the idea of an HVAC unit as a resonator to circulate the sound of music boxes that are activated by viewers. The composition in the music box is an original piece that is on a continuous loop that is only advanced by turning the knobs. This is a manual kinetic sculpture. The sculpture was made for a site-specific group show called Sequence of Waves that was installed at the St. Cecilia Convent in Greenpoint, NY for one day only. Also in 2011, Lange was commissioned by Flux Projects to create a week-long site-specific installation that involved sound in a public space. The piece he created was called \\"Sounding Up There\\". == Notable events == In July 2017, Helado performed an NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert. It is posted on the NPR Music YouTube channel, which has over 3 million subscribers. He performed four songs: \\"Transmission Listen\\", \\"Young, Latin and Proud\\", \\"Run Around\\" and \\"It's My Brown Skin\\", accompanied by a 5-piece band consisting of drums, two saxophones, violin, synthesizer, with Helado singing and playing guitar. ==Discography== Studio albums *Awe Owe (2009, Asthmatic Kitty) *Canta Lechuza (2011, Asthmatic Kitty) *Invisible Life (2013, Asthmatic Kitty) *Double Youth (2014, Asthmatic Kitty) *Private Energy (2016, Asthmatic Kitty) *Private Energy Expanded Edition (2017, RVNGIntl) *This Is How You Smile (2019, RVNGIntl) *Live at KCRW (2019 RVNGIntl) EPs *Pasajero (2010 Self Released) *Island Universe Story - One (2012, Asthmatic Kitty) *Island Universe Story - Two (2013, Asthmatic Kitty) *Island Universe Story - Three (2014, Asthmatic Kitty) *Island Universe Story - Four (2018, RVNGIntl) ==References== Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:American musicians Category:American people of Ecuadorian descent Category:Musicians from Miami Category:Musicians from Florida ","title":"Helado Negro"},{"id":"56101919","text":"Cameron McHarg is a Los Angeles based director, actor, and creator and host of the Triumph & Disaster podcast. ==Early life and career== McHarg was born and raised in Everett, Washington.

In 2016, it was selected by the Radiotopia network as the winner of its Podquest competition, and subsequently released its first season between June and October 2017. It is the first podcast to be created entirely inside a prison. On November 21, 2018, California governor Jerry Brown commuted Earlonne Woods' sentence, citing Ear Hustle as a significant contributor to his reformation as an American citizen. ==Background== In March 2016, the Public Radio Exchange's Radiotopia network put out a call for new podcast ideas via an initiative called Podquest, with funding from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. It received 1,537 entries from 53 countries. After two rounds of judging, Ear Hustle was selected as the winner and added to the Radiotopia network. Its first season began on June 14, 2017, and ended with its tenth episode on October 25, 2017. The second season began on March 14, 2018 and ended on June 20, 2018. Season 3 began on September 12, 2018, and ended on December 12, 2018. Season 4 began on June 5, 2019 and starred new co-host Rahsaan \\"New York\\" Thomas. The show is produced by Earlonne Woods, Antwan Williams, and Nigel Poor. Woods and Williams were inmates at San Quentin State Prison for the first three seasons of the show. Woods was serving a 31-years-to-life sentence for attempted 2nd degree robbery due to a three-strikes law before having his sentence commuted in 2018. Williams was serving a 15-year sentence for armed robbery with a gun enhancement. Poor is a visual artist in the San Francisco Bay area who volunteers at the prison. Woods and Poor cohost the show while Williams does the show's sound design, working in San Quentin's media lab to record music and effects, including foley work. Prior to Ear Hustle, Poor ran a photography class at the prison during which one of her students proposed making a documentary. Due to the complex and time-consuming bureaucratic challenges associated with unusual prison activities, she decided that audio would be easier to manage than video. The show was still challenging to create, in part because none of the three producers had a background in audio production, but also because of prison administration red tape. The prison also went on lockdown during production, halting work and requiring additional administrative steps to both create and release the audio. Ear Hustle is the first podcast to be created entirely inside a prison. On November 21, 2018, producer Earlonne Woods's sentence was commuted by California governor Jerry Brown. His commutation includes reference to Earlonne's work on the podcast. Rahsaan \\"New York\\" Thomas was announced as the new co-host starting in Season 4. ==Synopsis== The term \\"ear hustle\\" is prison slang for eavesdropping. The show features interviews with inmates who share their stories and opinions on topics like cellmates, solitary confinement, race, morality, pets, religion, gangs, and family. Woods said that the show chose the topic of cellmates for its first episode to ensure the show was relatable, since most people can relate to having a bad roommate. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Poor said the show is \\"about everyday life inside a prison. How do you survive? How do you deal with family, love, depression, having children, finding meaning in life? It addresses important issues about being human and how prisoners can be contributing citizens.\\" The series is not overtly political, but Poor emphasizes the way the show can have a humanizing effect, making listeners care about the men they hear on the show and wonder why one of the hosts might serve a life sentence for attempted robbery. ==Episodes== Season 1 (2017) { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - style=\\"color:white\\" ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  # ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  Title ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  Length (minutes:seconds) ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  Original release date } Season 2 (2018) { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - style=\\"color:white\\" ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  # ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  Title ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  Length (minutes:seconds) ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  Original release date } Season 3 (2018) { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - style=\\"color:white\\" ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  # ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  Title ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  Length (minutes:seconds) ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  Original release date } Season 4 (2019) { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - style=\\"color:white\\" ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  # ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  Title ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  Length (minutes:seconds) ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  Original release date } Season 5 (2020) { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - style=\\"color:white\\" ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  # ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  Title ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  Length (minutes:seconds) ! style=\\"background-color: #A62821;\\"  Original release date } ==Reception== In a Rolling Stone article about the show, Tana Ganeva called it \\"a fascinating, harrowing and also deeply entertaining look into life on the inside that runs the full gamut of emotions.\\" She also praised its originality, \\"[using] prisoners' storytelling skills to show what it's like to spend decades behind bars.\\" The show's unique lens and intimate first-person storytelling is noted in most reviews. In an op/ed for the Los Angeles Times, Lexi Mainland wrote \\"The runaway hit “Ear Hustle” ... never takes a broad look at criminal justice policy or employs Voice of God narration. It instead offers the even more illuminating dialogue of individual prisoners.\\" The New Yorkers Sarah Larson said the show \\"might be the best new podcast I’ve heard this year\\" and described it as being \\"about the creativity required to live a satisfying life --or even a sane life--in prison, and is itself a product of that creativity.\\" In particular, she praised Williams' \\"evocative, pitch-perfect sound design\\". Multiple reviewers noted how funny the show can be, despite often dealing with serious topics, and how uncommon it is to find humor in media taking place in real life prison settings. Vulture Nicholas Quah noted a particular story a prisoner told about a frog in episode three: \\"a moment of levity in a setting often described in the worst of terms, a productive kind of conversation between the specificities of a person and the overpowering context of his incarceration. That, in a nutshell, is the juxtaposition that defines Ear Hustle.\\" Quah contrasts standard prison narratives told entirely from an outsider's point of view with the interplay of insider and outsider perspectives provided by the hosts of Ear Hustle, with stories primarily told through Woods' and Williams' words and perspectives, and Poor in an active role adding \\"key narrative housekeeping\\". Galen Beebe's review for The Atlantic called it a \\"brilliant series\\" which \\"return[s] some of the humanity that the carceral system removes and provide[s] a link between inmates and outsiders.\\" The podcast was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in 2020, and although the podcast was a finalist it didn't ultimately receive the award. ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Ear Hustle on iTunes *Ear Hustle on Spotify *Ear Hustle on Twitter Category:San Quentin State Prison Category:2017 podcast debuts Category:Radiotopia Category:Audio podcasts Category:Crime podcasts ","title":"Ear Hustle"},{"id":"56102024","text":"The Trece Martires–Indang Road (also known as Trece–Indang Road) is a two-to- four lane, major highway in Cavite, Philippines.

It was released as a single through Pony Canyon on Valentine's Day 1997. The song was featured on TV commercials for Ginza Jewelry Maki's exclusive jewelry brand Rhapsoamo. ==Background== The unit name Little Kiss was inspired by the names of bands popular at the time, including Every Little Thing and My Little Lover, from which the word \\"little\\" is lifted. The song was written by Yasushi Akimoto and Tsugutoshi Gotō, the latter of which produced Kudo's first eight albums. It is Kudo's first collaboration with Akimoto since he wrote the B-side to \\"Daite Kuretara Ii no ni\\". ==Live performances== Ishibashi and Kudo performed the song on the EX music show Music Station. Their performance is remembered most notably for their reenactment of the kissing scene from the song's music video. Their passage on the show attracted intense media attention and given the intimate nature of their act, dating rumors started circulating. In addition to performing the song on various music shows during its promotional cycle, Ishibashi was a special guest on Kudo's 1997 Dress Concert Tour, where the pair sung the song together. Unmarried at the time, Kudo performed the song with her husband-to- be, Takuya Kimura, when she appeared on the CX variety show, SMAP×SMAP. ==Chart performance== The single debuted at number three on the Oricon Singles Chart with 143,000 copies in its first week, marking Kudo's second consecutive top ten entry.

The lake is inside of the caldera of an active volcano, Mount Batur, located along the Ring of Fire of volcanic activity. == Geography == Lake Batur lies south-east of the active Mount Batur volcano, inside the older Batur caldera.  Bathymetry  The deepest point in the lake is around 88 meters. == Watershed ==  Inflow from agriculture  The Batur caldera is an important agricultural area, with cultivation of a wide range of produce. The irrigation water flows back into the lake after it has been pumped up, bringing with it nutrients to the lake body.  Inflow from hot springs  In the village of Toya Bungkah, there are several hot springs related to the volcanic activity of the Mount Batur volcano. These have been developed for tourism purposes. The water from these hot springs flow into the lake. == Aquaculture == The Batur lake have been in recent years, farmed for fish. The Nile tilapia was the dominant species in the lake when a study was undertaken in 2011. The local name for the fish is Ikan Mujair.  Fish death  On the morning of 19 June 2011, greenish-white spots emerged on the surface of the lake. These spots later merged, stretching from Toya Bungkah to Buahan. In conjunction with the colour changes, thousands of dead fish floated to the surface. The cause of the fish death was believed to be related to the high diurnal-temperature difference during the onset of the dry season. As a result of the temperature difference, mixing of the water happened due to currents developed, which in turn mixed up the decomposing sediments, bringing toxic gases to the surface. By late 21 June 2011, the water colour was back to normal. == References == Category:Landforms of Bali Batur Category:Bangli Regency ","title":"Lake Batur"},{"id":"56102078","text":"The 2010 Pacific Netball series was held in Raratonga, Cook Islands between 3-5 June 2010. ==Results== Table { class= style=\\"text- align:center\\" !width=220 !width=20P !width=20W !width=20D !width=20L !width=20PTS -  left;\\"  33006 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  32014 -  left;\\"  31022 -  left;\\"  30020 } \\\\---- \\\\---- ==Final standings== { class= style=text-align:left - !width=35Place !width=185Nation - Gold style=text-align:left - Silver style=text- align:left - Bronze style=text-align:left - style=text-align:left 4 } ==See also== * Pacific Netball Series ==References== * PNG Netball Results & Tournaments since 1991.

In 1683, he was post replaced by a Board of Victualling Commissioners that was subordinate yet autonomous to the Navy Board. The Victualling Board took over a number of functions, including medical services, from the Transport Board when it was abolished in 1817. When the Victualling Board itself was also discharged from its duties in the Admiralty reforms of 1832, victualling became the responsibility of the Board of Admiralty under a new Comptroller of Victualling and Transport Services, under the superintendence of the Fourth Naval Lord. In 1862 the provision transport services passed to a newly created Transport Department and in 1869 the office of Comptroller of Victualling and his department was ended. Its former role was then divided between a new Contract and Purchase Department, that would managed by the Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty, their department became responsible for purchasing, following this re-organisation process a Superintendent of Victualling was created in 1870 until 1878 when it was renamed the Director of Victualling his department managed the store-keeping and supply functions of Navy Victuals for the Royal Navy. In 1961 the department was amalgamated within the Naval Stores Department but remained autonomous until 1964.

Specifically, polyglucan's are a structural polysaccharide. The basic polyglucan unit consists of a long linear chain of several hundred to many thousands D-glucose monomers attached with a type of covalent bond called, glycosidic bonds. The point of attachment is O-glycosidic bonds, where a glycosidic oxygen links the glycoside to the reducing end sugar. Polyglucans naturally occur in the cell walls of bacteria. Bacteria produce this polysaccharide in a cluster near the bacteria's cells. Polyglucan's are a source of beta-glucans. Structurally, beta 1.3-glucans are complex glucose homopolymers binding together in a beta-1,3 configuration. ==Types== The following are beta glucans {  - ! Beta -  chrysolaminarin, β-1,3-glucan curdlan, β-1,3-glucan lichenin, β-1,3- and β-1,4-glucan oat beta-glucan, β-1,3- and β-1,4-glucan zymosan, β-1,3-glucan laminarin, β-1,3- and β-1,6-glucan } ==Function== Polyglucans are utilized as a carbon source for microbial fermentation. Although polyglucan production has so far been promoted by nutrient limitation, it must be further enhanced to accommodate market demand. The combined strategies of cultivation design and genetic engineering are used for polyglucan productivity for bioethanol production. Polyglucans are also involved in another sector of the energy industry, acting as biopolymers to increase oil recovery. The polysaccharide is attached to the bacteria cells and then mixed in an alkali solution such as sodium hydroxide to become soluble. After which, it is then pumped into the injection well. The reason it needs to be a fluid is so you can pump the polysaccharides into the reservoir, but then the polysaccharide needs to gel/solidify/precipitate in situ upon addition of another chemical in order to plug up the pore. The biopolymer is then combined and injected with water until it fills up at least 30% of the empty pores. Next, there is an injection of an acid solution or CO2 forming HCO3. This neutralizes the solution and allows for the precipitation of the biopolymer, polyglucans, inside the high- permeability zones. Evidence shows that the application of this polyglucan can reduce the permeability of approximately 80% of the high-permeability zones. Oil companies are able to benefit from the decreased permeability because oil tends to flow in areas with the highest permeability. They can also serve as dietary supplements. ==Synthesis== Photosynthetic microorganisms, such as cyanobacteria and microalgae, are currently used for their polyglucan production. Since these organisms have high-photosynthetic activity and whole- year cultivation without utilization of arable land. The cultivation is done by modifying the nutrient supply and replacing the growth medium of the cyanobacteria and green microalgae since the control and manipulation of polyglucan metabolism necessitates the elucidation of the polyglucan production mechanism. These activities promote the growth of polyglucans from these organisms. ==Clinical significance== The immune-modulation action of polyglucans has been known for over 40 years, after experiments showed that they stimulated the activation of macrophages through the activation of the complement system. The detection of the (1,3)-β-D-glucan in blood is also used as a means of identifying invasive or disseminated fungal infections. Although, a positive test does not render a diagnosis, and a negative test does not rule out infection. This test can aid in the detection of Aspergillus, Candida, and Pneumocystis jirovecii. == References == Category:Polysaccharides ","title":"Polyglucan"},{"id":"56102171","text":"Prasophyllum regium, commonly known as the king leek orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia.

In 1998, he joined the Secret Intelligence Service and became an MI6 spy. ==Early life== Dean was born in Saudi Arabia. By the age of 12, he had memorised the Quran and become a Hafiz. Following the death of his mother he sought solace in Sayyid Qutb's In the Shade of the Koran. He was part of an Islamic Awareness circle at Omar Bin Abdulaziz Mosque in Khobar, where one of the instructors was Yusef al-Ayeri. In 1989, his eldest brother Moheddin went to fight in Afghanistan for three months. At 15, he travelled to Bosnia to participate in the Bosnian War with a friend from the circle Khaled Ali Hajj who had returned from fighting in Afghanistan. In Bosnia, Dean was part of the Bosnian mujahideen Brigade who massacred over 200 prisoners by decapitation following the Battle for Vozuća. He witnessed his friend Khaled saw off the head of a prisoner with a serrated hunting knife. Just before the end of the war he was recruited by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed who suggested that he go to Afghanistan and give him a contact in Peshawar, Pakistan. ==Al-Qaeda== Following Bosnia, Dean was invited to Kandahar to swear allegiance to Osama bin Laden and join al-Qaeda. In Afghanistan, he trained al-Qaeda recruits in the basics of Islamic theology, history and the essentials of religious practice. He was worried by the 1998 United States embassy bombings and asked Abdullah al-Mohaja for the religious justification. He was pointed to a 13th- century Fatwa by Ibn Taymiyyah. He researched the Fatwa which was about the Mongol invasion and their use of human shields when besieging cities; it was clear to him that this was no justification for killing civilian bystanders. He believes the concept of Jihad is changed by al-Qaeda. The target of Jihad in al-Qaeda is starting world war opposed to the West. ==Spying== Dean decided to leave al-Qaeda, going to Qatar on the pretext of his health with the intention to disappear. He was captured on arrival in Qatar by Qatari Intelligence, who gave him a choice of intelligence agency and he chose to work with MI6. MI6 then spent seven months debriefing him, after which he agreed to go back to Afghanistan as a spy. Dean then spied on al-Qaeda for 8 years prior to being exposed by Washington. During this time, he travelled between Afghanistan and London on behalf of al-Qaeda allowing him to report to MI6. While in the UK, he acted as al-Qaeda's representative and had to be careful to preach and recruit within UK law. Dean's cover was blown by a US writer who using CIA sources disclosed his identity with details that could only be sourced to him in a book. ==Later career== After being exposed, Dean started a career as a speaker and security consultant. Dean is the author of two books: * The Eternal Bridge Over the River Innocence: A novel about the story of what happens to young bright and decent Muslims who come under radical influence. * Nine Lives: My Time As Mi6's Top Spy Inside al-Qaeda: biography of his life as a spy inside al-Qaeda ==ReferencesExternal links== *Al-Qaida senior leader grants rare TV interview *The Eternal Bridge Over the River Innocence reviews Category:Al-Qaeda founders Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Saudi Arabian expatriates in Afghanistan Category:Saudi Arabian spies ","title":"Aimen Dean"},{"id":"56102234","text":"Julio Eduardo Cid Lagos (born January 11, 1983) is a Chilean former footballer who last played for Persipon Pontianak of the Liga Indonesia Premier Division. ==Career== Balestier Khalsa Plying his trade with Balestier Khalsa of the Singapore S.League in 2009, Eduardo suffered an injury while playing for them, forcing him to miss some matches including a 1-4 defeat to Gombak United.

He was suffect consul for the nundinium May to August 89 with Marcus Peducaeus Saenianus as his colleague.Paul Gallivan, \\"The Fasti for A. D. 70-96\\", Classical Quarterly, 31 (1981), pp. 191, 217 Despite his social rank, Blaesus is a shadowy figure about whom scholars have made numerous sumises. The only fact of Blaesus' life that is certain is that he was a member of the Arval Brethren from at least as early as the year 78 to 91, when a gap in the records begins; when the records of the Arval Brethren resume in the year 101, he is no longer present. This has led some experts to conclude Blaesus died between the years 91 and 101.Edward Champlin, \\"Hadrian's Heir\\", Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 21 (1976), p. 85 Ronald Syme, noting the difficulty of polyonymous names, proposed identifying Blaesus with another consular senator, Sallustius Lucullus, the date of whose consulate is not known.Syme, Tacitus (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1958), p. 648 According to Suetonius, Lucullus was executed by the emperor Domitian for allowing a new type of lance to be named after him.Suetonius, Lives of the Twelve Caesars: Domitian 10.3 Syme further suggests that Sallustius Blaesus had a second gentilicum, \\"Velleius\\", allowing him to be identified with one Velleius Blaesus, the subject of a letter Pliny the Younger wrote to his friend Calvisius: Pliny's letter tells how Blaesus, a rich but dying ex-consul, was targeted by a legacy hunter, another senator named Marcus Aquilius Regulus.Pliny, Epistulae, II.20.7f Both Statius and Martial also refer to a recently deceased Blaesus, the friend of their wealthy patron Atedius Melior.Statius, Silvae II.1. 189-207; Martial VIII.38 Edward Champlin supports Syme's identification by pointing to an inscription from Ephesus that mentions a \\"[.] Velleius P.? f. Tro.[...] L. Sertorius [... Ped]anius Fuscus Sa[linat]or Sallus[ti]us Bla[esus .] Julius Agricola [...] Caesonius\\", leading Champlin to suggest that \\"a new figure can emerge, the composite of three shadowy consulars who died in the latter years of the reign of Domitian, viz. P. Velleius P.f. Tro. Lucullus Sallustius Blaesus, cos. suff. 89.\\"Champlin, \\"Hadrian's Heir\\", p. 86 However, P. Conole and Brian Jones point out since the records of the Arval Brethren \\"record his [Blaesus'] presence in Rome during every year of the first half of Domitian's reign for which complete minutes have survived, it is difficult to see how he could have managed to gain sufficient provincial experience in praetorian posts to merit appointment to Britain, an Imperial consular province.\\"Conole and Jones, \\"Sallustius Lucullus\\", Latomus, 42 (1983), p. 629 So while it is still possible Sallustius Blaesus is identical with the Velleius Blaesus of Pliny's anecdote, his identity with the poorly-documented governor of Britain is less likely. == References == Category:1st-century Romans Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Blaesus ","title":"Publius Sallustius Blaesus"},{"id":"56102393","text":"Fritz Zeuner (1921-1982) was an East German politician, who was Chairman of the Peasants Mutual Aid Association from 1979 to 1982.

It prohibits the removal, relocation, or renaming of a memorial that is, or is located on, public property without permission (a waiver). Permission requires a two-thirds vote of approval from the 29 member board of the Tennessee Historical Commission, 24 of whose members are appointed by the Governor and the remainder ex-officio. The purpose of the Act is to prevent the removal of Confederate memorials from public places in Tennessee. As put by the New York Times, the Act shows \\"an express intent to prevent municipalities in Tennessee from taking down Confederate memorials.\\" In 2018, because of Memphis's transfer of ownership of statues of Robert E. Lee and Nathan Bedford Forrest as a means of removing them (see Memphis Greenspace), an amendment to the Act prohibits municipalities from selling or transferring ownership of memorials without permission. The amendment also \\"allows any entity, group or individual with an interest in a memorial to seek an injunction to preserve the memorial in question.\\" Under the THPA, as of August, 2020, the Tennessee Historical Commission board has permitted the removal and relocation of several World War II monuments in Chattanooga, and has approved the sale of several acres of the historic Sam Davis Home in Smyrna for commercial development. Davis was known as the “Boy Hero of the Confederacy.” The Commission has heard a total of four cases, one of which was Memphis's application to remove the Nathan Bedford Forrest statue. In 2018 The Tennessee Historical Commission acknowledged that one member (Judge David Tipton) also belonged to the Sons of Confederate Veterans. The Memphis Mayor's office has said that as of 2016 there were several people who belonged to both organizations. == References  See also == * Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials * Lost Cause of the Confederacy * Racism in the United States Category:Tennessee law Category:2013 establishments in Tennessee Category:Statutes dealing with Confederate monuments and memorials ","title":"Tennessee Heritage Protection Act"},{"id":"56102461","text":"Claudia Devita Scott (born 1945) is an American-New Zealand academic.

Yoo argued Korea is isolated at diplomatic relation between global society. The term derives from Bill Clinton visited to only China without visited to Japan in 1998, which the Japanese media called the 'Japan passing', \\"Japan's alienation from the global society.\\" In early 2017, 'Korea passing' emerged as a diplomatic keyword in relation to the situation facing the South Korea.  Criticism  Originally, 'passing' is Japlish and the correct English expression is a 'cold-shoulder'. Also, some point out that it is more of a 'Konglish' that each country's government will not use. However, major U.S. media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and Fox News, mentioned Korea passing as a new term related to the situation in South Korea. == Controversy ==  United States   South Korea-U.S. Friction on North Korea and THAAD  Park Geun-hye was impeached in March 2017 and there was a high probability that Moon Jae-in, who is more friendly to North Korea, would be winning the election. The Trump administration was concerned that the incoming South Korean government would be passive in imposing strong sanctions on North Korea. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula escalated when North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test in September 2017 after firing several ballistic missiles in April 2017. In response, the Trump administration has stepped up sanctions and pressure on North Korea. Moon Jae-in administration, who took office at the same time, ensured the safety of the North Korean regime. Also, the administration formulated a policy that resume Kaesong Industrial Complex and Mount Kumgang tour for consolidating an economic cooperation with North Korea. Therefore, conflicts between Korea and the United States have emerged in earnest in this regard. Donald Trump got in touch with Shinzo Abe right after North Korea fired ballastic missile, but there was nothing contact to Moon Jae-in. In this point, controversy was flared up more about Korea passing. On the one hand, Moon Jae-in posed a question about transparency in deployment of the THAAD in Korean territory. And the conflict over the THAAD deployment deepened as the U.S. Department of Defense refuted the question.  U.S. side reaction  The New York Times stirred up the controversy by claiming that South Korea will be 'odd man out' due to differences in North Korea policy at the Korea-U.S. and Japan summit on September 21, 2017. Then Donald Trump visited Korea on November 7 and had press conference with Moon Jae-in. Donald Trump made a comment \\"Korea is very important countries,\\", \\" there will be no exclude.\\" and denied the 'Korea passing'. However, conservative opposition partys insisted Trump's comment is a usual diplomacy rhetoric and the controversy about 'Korea passing' will be continued because there was no the agreement. Right after the US-South Korea summit, Donald Trump appreciated Moon Jae-in's cooperation to resolute North Korea problem and spoke there were several progress. But, the Wall Street Journal pointed out Moon jae-in's policy of Kaesong Industrial Complex, THAAD problem with China and they said, Moon Jae-in is 'unreliable friend' It was suggesting that US society was still negatively they rated the Moon Jae-in administration.  Controversy between South Korea and the U.S. during the North Korea-U.S. summit.  On May 19th, 2018, Donald Trump called to Moon Jae-in when right before Moon Jae-in visited US and asked why there is difference Moon Jae-in's pledge and North Korea's stance about denuclearization. And, Donald Trump has expressed discomfort. Trump also kept a stiff look on his face during the May 22 summit between South Korea and the U.S. In addition, Trump unilaterally had most press conference peremptorily and scaled back existing an exclusive interview. Trump was questioned a total of 28 questions, Moon Jae-in had only two opportunity to reply. Trump refused the interpreter to Moon Jae-in's last reply unilaterally, he said \\" I'm sure that's what I've heard before, so I don't have to listen to an interpreter.\\". On May 24th, Trump announced the cancellation of the 2018 North Korea-U.S. Summit, which was scheduled for June, without notice to the Republic of Korea. Blue House belatedly received the news of the cancellation through Twitter. Related to this, controversy over 'Korea passing' has resurfaced. Hong Jun- pyo, who was delegatee of Liberty Korea Party, made mention of 'Korea passing', and contended Moon Jae-in administration is excluded from North Korea-U.S. summit negotiation. Then, he added the success of negotiation is up to U.S. and China. On June 30th, 2019, when 2019 Koreas–United States DMZ Summit was held, Trump didn't want Moon to join him according to John Bolton's book.  China  China To abandon the debate of the Republic of Korea after the inauguration of the Moon Jae-in administration also flared up.  Conflict between South Korea and China over the THAAD deployment  Moon Jae-in Sade to determine the additional deployment is president, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi 'This decision is sprinkled with cold water on relations between the two countries.' protest. In addition, China, Xi Jinping said 'Moon Jae-in deceived us.' and sad as he complained. On October 31, 2017, South Korea and China released a joint document containing 'results of consultation between the two countries on improving relations' to normalize their relations.In the process, China touted that South Korea promised not to do three things: deploy additional THAAD, participate in the U.S. missile defense system, and cooperate with South Korea, the U.S., and Japan.This led to a controversy over Korea's diplomatic humiliation. China did not express its regret over the THAAD retaliation or prevent a recurrence, and stressed that exchanges between South Korea and China can be normalized as soon as possible by keeping the\\" Not-doing 3 Things\\" promise, leaving the possibility that the issue could spark in the future.  North Korea North Korean policy change after the launch of the government's Moon Jae-in. The South Korean government has continuously proposed military talks, Red Cross talks and requests for the North to participate in the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, but the North Korean People's Republic of Korea has been unresponsive for some time, causing controversy. But North Korea's participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics has been sputtering after its top leader Kim Jong-un signaled his intention to participate in the 2018 Winter Olympics in his New Year's message for 2018. Since then, there has been a flurry of inter-Korean relations, even after the successful inter-Korean summit in April 2018, but the dispute over the Korea Passing has flared up again due to conflicts over denuclearization and the North's unilateral disregard for the South Korean side. North Korea unilaterally called off scheduled high-level talks between South Korea and the United States, denouncing the joint South Korea-U.S. exercise \\"Max Thunder\\" in a strong tone and condemning the defection of Thae Yong-ho, a former British construction worker in North Korea's state, as \\"human scum.\\" In June 2020, North Korea blew up an inter-Korean joint liaison office.  Japan  In Japan, it has been recognized that ignore politely is the best way to deal with Moon Jae-in's administration. And in defense white paper, Defense of japan 2019, Japan gave South Korea cold shoulder as security partner by lowering South Korea’s standing. Since 2018, the legal foundation of the friendly and cooperative relationship between two countries had overthrown. The legal foundation is \\"Agreement on the Settlement of Problems concerning Property and Claims and on Economic Co-operation between Japan and the Republic of Korea\\". Under this severe situation surrounding the relationship caused by the South Korea side, the government of Japan is waiting for South Korea to resolve this internationally illegal situation. On the South Korea side, controversy erupted over Korea Passing when it was failed to arrange a summit meeting with Japan during the period of 2019 G20 Osaka summit. A former Korean minister of foreign affairs, Gong Ro-myung, criticized the Korean government for acting like amateurs, leading Korea-Japan relations to deteriorate catastrophically and hit rock bottom politically and economically. == See also == *Foreign relations of South Korea *THAAD *Moon Jae-in *Donald Trump *North Korea-United States summit (disambiguation) *2017 North Korean nuclear test *Globalization ==References== Category:South Korea Category:Neologisms Category:International relations ","title":"Korea Passing"},{"id":"56102871","text":"A leadership election of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), then the opposition party in the Parliament of Australia, was held on 22 December 1977.

The webcomic often focuses on two angsty teenagers, Kabir and Ananya, who frequently have to deal with their overprotective and intrusive parents. Many pages of Brown Paperbag are modeled after the hypocrisies perpetuated by Indian society, but the webcomic does not feature any particularly political themes. ==Development== Sailesh Gopalan began Brown Paperbag on June 25, 2016. 20 years old at the time, Gopalan was studying animation at the Srishti Institute of Art, Design & Technology in Bangalore. Gopalan has stated that he decided to start a webcomic on a whim, as he had noticed a lack of Indian daily life satire comics that were devoid of politics. Gopalan made the first page of Brown Paperbag within an hour of conceptualizing Brown Paperbag as a whole. He initially released the page both on Facebook and WEBTOON, under the pen name Saigo. The name of the webcomic is based on the skincolor of Indian people, as well as the \\"unvarnished realities of everyday life.\\" In an interview with Scroll.in, Gopalan stated that \\"I was trying to portray society as it really is, without the mask that people put on. When you look at old cartoons, you see brown paper bags with two eyeholes punched in them that people put on their heads to hide.\\" However, Gopalan insists that the webcomic is not intended to be particularly political, as he stated that \\"there are enough political comics in India.\\" Brown Paperbag explores the behavior of people in Indian culture, rather than focusing on the people in power. Gopalan has said that his characters are stereotypes, but not based on any particular group of people. As such, Brown Paperbag typically exaggerates the conventional social roles assigned to parents, teenagers, and siblings. Brown Paperbag was inspired by Shenanigansen's Bluechair and Sarah Andersen's Sarah's Scribbles. The webcomic's approach to storytelling and comedy was also influenced by that of manga artist Eiichiro Oda. Gopalan has stated that he intended to implement 2D animation to Brown Paperbag at some point, and produced a short celebratory animation when he reached 100,000 followers on Facebook in 2017. Though Gopalan gets many suggestions from fans, he primarily tries to take scenarios from his own life and work on his own ideas. ==Impact== Gopalan's webcomic went viral within a month after its launch, getting over 50,000 likes in its first five days and getting over 70,000 followers in only three weeks. Gopalan had acquired over 174,000 followers on Facebook and over 185,000 followers on Instagram by October 2018. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Indian webcomics Category:2016 webcomic debuts Category:2010s webcomics ","title":"Brown Paperbag"},{"id":"56103000","text":"Luca Pignatelli (born 22 June 1962) is an Italian artist. == Biography == Luca Pignatelli was born on 22 June 1962 in Milan, Italy, where he still lives and works. In the early 1980s, he entered Politecnico di Milano to study Architecture, but started his artistic career soon after with his first solo exhibition in 1987 at the Galleria Jannone in Milan.Galleria Antonia Jannone - Disegni di architettura, \\"Luca Pignatelli. Immaginazione, paesaggi e architetture\\", 1987, Milan. http://www.antoniajannone.it/mostre/luca- pignatelli.-immaginazione-paesaggi-e-architetture-testi-di-m.de-michel Pignatelli's early production is mostly figurative and possesses an architectural quality derived from his university studies. The artist's vast repertoire includes both buildings and natural elements, like towers and mountains; vehicles such as airplanes, trucks and boats; war scenes taking place over the dark ruins of a city; wild animals fighting, and the lonely stillness of a generic suburb. During the 1990s, he exhibited his work mostly in Italy (Milan, Rome, Bologna). In 1991, he hosted a solo show at the Leighton House Museum in London. In 2000, Pignatelli won the first edition of the prestigious Milanese prize, Premio Cairo.Milan, Cairo Art Prize, first edition (2000), \\"La giovane figurazione italiana\\". http://www.cairoeditore.it/Premio-Cairo-2000.html Over the last twenty years, Pignatelli has consolidated his artistic research, and his path is marked by exhibitions held by some of the most distinguished national and international institutions. In 2008, he was invited by the National Archaeological Museum in Naples where Pignatelli completely covered the walls of one of the rooms with \\"Schermi\\", a series of works representing ancient Greek vases, and he also exhibited in the Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. In 2009, Pignatelli participated in the 53rd edition of the Venice Biennale, where he was present in the Italian pavilion with three works titled \\"La Battaglia di Lepanto\\", positively cited by Italian art critic Gillo Dorfles.\\"Per fortuna c'è un'interessante \\"Battaglia di Lepanto\\" di Luca Pignatelli\\", Gillo Dorfles su Corriere della Sera, mercoledì 10 giugno 2009. In the same year, the artist had a solo show in Nice at MAMAC - Musée d'art moderne et contemporaine. The last decade has seen some of Pignatelli's most successful exhibitions, marking his presence in the Italian art scene as an established artist with a wide recognition. in 2011, Pignatelli exhibited his works in Rome at the National Institute for Graphic Art.\\"Luca Pignatelli. Icons Unplugged\\", Istituto Nazionale per la Grafica, Roma, 2011. In 2014, the Capodimonte Museum in Naples invited the artist to showcase his work in the contemporary wing of the institution's complex, more specifically in its Sala Causa,Raffaello Causa is the Supervisor of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage behind the project that brought contemporary artists at Capodimonte Museum. The first contemporary living artist to be exhibited in the hall that later took after his name, Sala Causa, was Alberto Burri in 1978. Burri produced the artwork Grande Cretto Nero specifically for this location and requested that his piece would be set up close to Caravaggio and the Caravaggeschi. the hall where the museum started to exhibit the work of contemporary artists in the 1970s. Today, Pignatelli's monumental work, \\"Pompeii\\", is part of the Capodimonte Museum's permanent collection,http://www.museocapodimonte.beniculturali.it/portfolio_page/arte- contemporanea/ as it was donated by the artist after the exhibition to be staged on top of the master staircase, next to a piece by artist William Kentridge. The same year marked another important milestone in the artist's career. He took part in \\"Ri-conoscere Michelangelo\\", a collective exhibition hosted by Galleria dell'Accademia in Florence to celebrate the 450th anniversary of Michelangelo's death. Here, Pignatelli's artworks Sculture/8788 (2014) and Analogie (2013) depicting Schiavo, Fauno Barberini, and Prigione Morente are placed closely to Michelangelo's masterpiece David. In 2015, the Uffizi Gallery in Florence invited the artist to exhibit his famous \\"Heads\\" (one of the series that the artist is most known for) in the Gallery of Portraits (also known as Corridoio Vasariano). A series of nine works on wood titled \\"Migranti\\"\\"Arturo Carlo Quintavalle, Luca Pignatelli: the Antique as Difference and Repetition, pag. 46, Galleria degli Uffizi, Firenze, 2015: \\"The title: Migrants. First of all because these pieces obviously, have travelled a long way to end up in the collections of the West, but above all because they are traces of narrative, of stories that are evoked by their names\\". was exhibited in the spaces of the Vasarian Corridor and one of them, \\"Self portrait as Mithridates\\" was acquired by the museum and is not part of the permanent collection of portraits. In 2017, Pignatelli's exhibited Persepoli for the first time. Persepoli is a mixed media on Persian carpet where a feminine head, derived from the artist's accustomed antique repertoire, is superimposed on an ancient carpet. This work sparked ample reactions in the art world and was controversially censored in the 2017 edition of the Maastricht Art Fair. The decision was never fully justified by the directional board of the fair. Only a couple of months later, Pignatelli brought \\"Persepoli\\" and the other carpets from that series to Venice and exhibited them at the historical Grand Teatro La Fenice in the show titled, \\"Persepoli. Riflessi del residuo\\". == Work == Pignatelli's imagination feeds on antiquities, nature, and the connection between the concepts of Time and History.Donald Kuspit, Between raverie and dream, Generous Miracles Gallery, New York, 2000. \\"(...) Pignatelli is an archeologist in spirit. (...) [He] excavates familiar images from unfamiliar past, presenting them in all their morbid transience, which he monumentalizes, confirming their archetypal significance\\". While his first production conveyed the perception of a looming menace, of the quiet moment announcing a disaster,Donald Kuspit, Between raverie and dream, Generous Miracles Gallery, New York, 2000. \\"Pignatelli deepens the mood of loneliness by adding to it a note of terror, making it more tragic\\" his later work is often characterized by a sense of universality and a more complex historical reflection.Simonetta Golia, da http://www.beniculturali.it/mibac/export/MiBAC/sito- MiBAC/Contenuti/MibacUnif/Eventi/visualizza_asset.html_1275939881.html: \\"L’atemporalità e il metalinguaggio palesati oggi da Luca Pignatelli nella visualizzazione del suo lavoro, ci permettono di confrontare i nostri saperi con quelli di luoghi e culture lontane nel tempo e sentirli più vicini\\". The City and the History of Art represent for the artist a sort of permanent setting to human events, but nonetheless a dimension where Pignatelli engages his artistic research, operating analogies as well as modifications. The artist is driven to visit warehouses, storage areas, military depots and large building sites, towards which he has always harbored an attraction and curiosity. He is fascinated by the anonymous architectures of port cities, with their construction sites and movement of goods; by the works of Vignola, Loos and Mies van der Rohe, encountered during his travels across European cities; by Milan, his native city and place of choice; and with New York, where he has visited for long periods since 1986. Pignatelli is also a painter capable of facing the challenges posed by large scale works. He normally utilizes recovered and unexpected supports, pictorial in themselves: canvases and tarpaulins, wood and iron, assembled papers, onto which he operates applying his selection of images, icons of the collective memory taken from a kind of universally renown repertoire. His work explores images that are often of a lofty classical nature, but also urban or mountain landscapes, sometimes trains, planes, symbolic elements, employed by the artist to construct and deconstruct a new evocative visual repertoire. == Exhibitions ==  Solo exhibitions  * \\"In un luogo dove gli opposti stanno\\", a cura di Sergio Risaliti.

It tells the story of a teenager who is forced to leave her life behind when her estranged policeman father is reassigned to the province. The film deals with supernatural mythical creatures, among them is the \\"sitsit,\\" a creature that preys on women at night and is believed to be the cause of sudden disappearances and deaths of women in the subject town. Haunted Forest was released in Philippine cinemas as an official entry to the 43rd Metro Manila Film Festival, on December 25, 2017. ==Plot== The story revolves around Aris (Raymart Santiago) and his estranged daughter, Nica (Jane Oineza).

He stated that his film as an all-in-one film being a horror, family story, and love story while making sure the film won't have the impression of being a \\"mishmash\\". ==Release== An official trailer for Haunted Forest was released by December 4, 2017. The film was premiered in cinemas on December 25, 2017 as one of the eight entries of the 2017 Metro Manila Film Festival. ==Reception== On January 4, 2018, Lily Monteverde of Regal Films was satisfied of the box office gross of the film despite describing the then undisclosed figure as \\"not overwhelming\\".

Naval Home Command was a name given to the military formation administered by the post. ==History== As the Royal Navy's size decreased during the Cold War, commands were amalgamated. In 1969, the Home and Mediterranean Fleets were amalgamated, and on shore, the great historical garrison commands of Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth and Commander- in-Chief, Plymouth were combined in July 1969. The result was Naval Home Command, under a Commander-in-Chief whose title was abbreviated as CINCNAVHOME. In 1994 the post of Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command was unified with that of the Second Sea Lord following the rationalisation of the British Armed Forces following the end of the Cold War. By 2007-08, the primary responsibility of the CNH/2SL was to maintain operational capability by providing correctly trained manpower to the fleet.

In the process of stigmatization, drug addicts are stereotyped as having a particular set of undesirable traits, in turn causing other individuals to act in a fearful or prejudicial manner toward them. Drug use discrimination also leads to many users being secretive about drug use. As it relates to healthcare stigmatizing attitudes surrounding drug use can cause barriers to treatment uptake and engagement. In some of its manifestations, discrimination against drug addicts involves a violation of human rights. People with substance use disorders are often depicted as human beings who are not capable of staying drug free and are often addressed using derogatory terms. The reasoning for not helping patients seek the treatments needed are often due to the terms used to identify them, such as \\"crackhead\\" or \\"junkie\\". The name calling and stigma places a sense of shame in people with substance use disorder for a disease that takes control of them physically and psychologically. Discrimination against people who use an illegal substance is very common in the workplace, a familiar example happens when employers give random drug test to see if the employee will pass it. However, according to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, employers are supposed to ensure that alcoholics and other drug addicts get help and the accommodations that they need. The lack of job opportunities and treatment for drug addicts often results in relapses or in jail. == Basic information == Drug abusers often choose the jail system because being in the real world exposes them to the very things that made them turn to drugs. Many drug users choose jail so they can utilize the Drug Court Program. The first drug court program was started in 1989 in Florida. The purpose of the drug court program was to put the court's authority in motion to reduce the drug crime rate by offering rehabilitation to drug addicts. In 2015, up to 3,000 drug courts were available in the U.S. and merely 120,000 defendants were being worked with per year. The overall goal of the drug court program is to reduce the need for drugs and the crimes that accompany them. Statistics have led researchers to believe drug court may be an effective resolution to end drug addiction. == Problematic Patterns == Drugs (especially opioids and stimulants) can change the motivational patterns of a person and lead to desocialization and degradation of personality. Acquisition of the drugs some times involves black market activities and leads to criminal a social circle. == Institutional patterns == The drugs Ritalin (methylphenidate) and Adderall (amphetamine) are stimulants often prescribed for ADHD.https://childmind.org/article/understanding-adhd-medications/ In colleges there has been an influx of this type of drug trafficked. These drugs stimulate your nervous system making you awake and attentive. Prescribing opioids to patients and related overdose has become a serious problem in the US.https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-opioid-epidemic == Lack of objective information about drugs == An important role in the process of discrimination is played by the lack of objective information about drug addiction and drug addicts, caused by legislative barriers to scientific research, the displacement of such information by propaganda of various kinds. Drug addiction has been categorized as a subcategory of mental illness. They are referred to as co-occurring disorders, which means if a person is dealing with an addiction, they may also struggle with a mental illness. Most individuals who suffer from drug dependency are nearly twice as likely to suffer from a mental illness as well.Proudfoot, Jesse. 2017. “Drugs, Addiction, and the Social Bond.” Geography Compass 11 (7): n/a-N.PAG. doi:10.1111/gec3.12320. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, about 8.9 million adults who have an addiction also have a psychiatric disorder. When dealing with either a mental illness or a drug addiction some symptoms people will experience are being incapable of controlling their own impulses and mood swings. When an individual falls victim to drug addiction, they will undergo the five stages of addiction which are the first use, the continued use, tolerance, dependence, and addiction. The first use stage, is the stage where individuals experiment with drugs and alcohol. This is the stage where individuals will partake in drug use because of curiosity, peer pressure, emotional problems etc. They discover how the drug will make them feel. In the continued use stage, individuals know how the drug makes them feel and is likely to notice that they're not getting “high” as quickly as they use to. In the tolerance stage, the brain and the body have adjusted to the drug and it takes longer to get the “high” an individual is seeking. Tolerance arrives after a period of continued use and is one of the first warning signs of addiction. In the dependence stage, the brain becomes accustomed to the drug and doesn't function well without it. Substance abusers become physically ill without the use of drugs and will begin to develop symptoms of withdrawal. This is sign that the addiction is beginning to take hold of the individual. In the addiction stage, individuals find it impossible to stop using drugs even if they do not enjoy it or if their behavior has caused problems within an individual's life. With the increasing number of adults that suffer with an addiction, only a few will receive treatment due to the complexity of health care systems. Most health care systems do not have insurance coverage for addiction recovery and many health care providers have little to no training in treating addiction. Some doctors do not feel comfortable treating an addiction due to their lack of knowledge and training of the topic. This is one of the reasons why drug dependence is difficult to recover from. == Drugs and HIV infection == Among injecting drug users, the incidence of HIV infection is higher than among other drug addicts, however punitive and discriminatory measures against drug addicts are not able to eliminate either the spread of drug addiction or HIV. == Global Impact ==  Africa  Africa has an estimated number 28 million substance users. This number is impacted by the rising availability of injection-based drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamines. Socio-demographic factors are often primary determinants of the health status of drug users. These factors contribute to individual drug use behaviors such as the sharing of needles and the solicitation of sex in exchange for police protection or more drugs. Nutritional status, family support, stigma/discrimination, adherence to medication, and recovery from addiction are also impacted by these socio- demographic factors. Research shows that the majority of drug users transition from the use of non-injection substances to injection substances or use both simultaneously.  Kenya  In Kenya there is a link between injection- related discrimination, mental health, physical health, and the quality of life for those who inject drugs. The rates of discrimination are linked to higher levels of psychological distress and risk behaviors. Women in Kenya account for 10% of drug users. These women tend to experience the regular discrimination faced by drug users in addition to gender related discrimination. Levels of discrimination are often higher for those that are also HIV positive. == See also == * Cognitive liberty * Drug liberalization * Legalisation of marijuana == References == Category:Discrimination Category:Drug culture Category:Addiction ","title":"Discrimination against drug addicts"},{"id":"56103162","text":"Robert Anthony \\"Tony\\" Merson (1950–2016) was a British numismatist and philatelist, with a particular interest in the coins of medieval France. == Life == Robert Anthony Merson F.C.A. was born on 22 May 1950.

R. Vishwaa. The film features newcomers Krishnakumar Balasubramanian, Srushti Dange, Amrita Chhabria, Nadhim Khan, Roshan Nawaz, and Nakshatra in the lead roles, while Prakash Raj and newcomer Vijay Gopal play supporting roles. The film had musical score by A. R. Reihana, cinematography by Ravi Shankar, and editing by B. Manoharan. The film released on 28 May 2010. ==Plot== A group of four youngsters get on a train. They are then scolded by a quick-tempered stranger named AK (Prakash Raj). He tells the friends that today's young people are immature and good-for-nothing. The friends are about to prove him wrong. Nandhini Velu Nachiyar (Srushti Dange), Reshmi Kaur (Amrita Chhabria), Mahesh Muthusamy (Nadhim Khan), Mohammed Aslam (Roshan Nawaz), and Angelina Kristy (Nakshatra) were visual communication students and best friends. After the graduation, they had to split up and to go in different directions. Then they met the magician Thyagu (Krishnakumar Balasubramanian), and everything changed. Thyagu and Nandhini were childhood friends and were in love with each other. However, both were from different castes. Nandhini's brother-in-law Raja Rajasekharan (Vijay Gopal) was a despicable caste fanatic and an influential person. He had hatred towards every caste other than his and wanted his community people to get a high post in the society. Thereafter, the six friends formed a group named \\"Mantra\\", performing dance, magic, or songs for advertisement companies. When Raja was made aware of Nandhini's love, he killed her and swept this issue under the rug. The five friends protested to grant justice for Nandhini's death, but the police force stopped the protest and beat up the friends. The five then started a TV show in which they exposed the truth behind Nandhini's death. When the four friends reach their destination, AK is shocked to see Thyagu and Nandhini together. He later reveals that he is actually a CBI officer who was in charge of Raja's case and then forces the friends to tell him what happened. The friends reveal that Nandhini's death was a sham and they used a fake body to make it look like Nandhini. Also, Raja committed suicide when the police tried to arrest him for a murder he did not commit. While AK is initially unhappy at first, he praises the youngsters for their braveness and hushes up the case, revealing his real name as Ananthakrishnan. He then departs as the six friends rejoice in happiness. ==Cast== *Krishnakumar Balasubramanian as Thyagu *Srushti Dange as Nandhini Velu Nachiyar *Amrita Chhabria as Reshmi Kaur *Nadhim Khan as Mahesh Muthusamy *Roshan Nawaz as Mohammed Aslam *Nakshatra as Angelina Kristy *Prakash Raj as Ananthakrishnan (AK) *Vijay Gopal as Raja Rajasekharan *George Maryan as Sankaran *Kashish as Kashish Kapoor *Santhesh as Sivaprabhu *Jayashree as Mythili *Payisha ==Production== \\"Wide angle\\" Ravi Shankar was hired as cinematographer, A.

The sole fatality, an elderly man, died eight days after the attack. ==Incident== According to witnesses and police, the driver, Saeed Noori, deliberately ran a red light then accelerated into an area with a speed limit of where he ran into the pedestrians. His car then hit a bollard beside a tram stop. The nineteen injured included nine foreign nationals: three from South Korea, and one each from China, Italy, India, Venezuela, Ireland, and New Zealand. An off-duty officer of the Victorian Police was credited with quickly subduing the suspect who was wrestled to the ground, handcuffed, and arrested. A second man, filming the incident, was also arrested and found to be carrying a bag containing three knives and a quantity of marijuana. It was subsequently determined that he was not directly involved in the incident. On 21 December, Victoria Police Commander Russell Barrett stated \\"At this stage we believe it is a deliberate act.\\" As a result of the incident, nineteen people were taken to a hospital. As of 23 December 2017, three were in a critical condition. One victim, Antonios Crocaris aged 83, died in hospital on 29 December 2017.http://neoskosmos.com/news/en/Greek-community-mourns-the-first-fatality- of-the-Flinders-Street-attack-Antonios-Crocaris ==Perpetrator== Noori, aged 32, was known to police for a 2010 assault and had a history of drug use and mental health issues. In June 2017, he was convicted and fined $1000 for driving without a license, using a mobile phone while driving and failing to answer bail. Noori was unlicensed at the time of the December incident, and was driving a vehicle that belonged to a relative. Noori appeared in court on 23 December, charged with 18 counts of attempted murder and one count of reckless conduct endangering life; one of the attempted murder charges was upgraded to murder following Crocaris' death on December 29. He was remanded in custody and ordered to undergo a psychiatric assessment. After his arrest he exhibited drug addiction withdrawal symptoms and was suspected to have other illnesses, including a psychiatric one. He was on medication for mental health issues. Noori is an Australian citizen of Afghan descent who entered Australia in 2004 with six other siblings as a refugee. Noori had a two-year- old son and at the time of the attack his wife was pregnant with their second child. The West Australian 12/26/2017In an informal police interview he \\"spoke of dreams and voices, but also attributed some of his activities as well due to the mistreatment of Muslims\\". Noori also made comments in regarding Allah and ASIO following his arrest. One of Noori's co-workers at the call centre where they worked said: \\"There was always talk of his religious beliefs, he was very strong in that. People would say 'I believe in God' and he'd say 'you need to believe in Allah'.\\" On 22 December the Victorian Police stated that while they had not yet determined Noori's motivations, \\"we haven't found anything at all to indicate his linkage or involvement with any type of extremism with any terrorism organisation or anything of a terrorist nature\\". On December 7, 2018, Noori pleaded guilty to one count of murder, and 18 counts of attempted murder.Saeed Noori pleads guilty to murder of one, injuring dozens, in Flinders Street car attack (news.com.au) Noori was sentenced in March 2019, to serve life imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 30 years. ==Reactions== Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said that Melbourne has \\"special challenges\\", including wide streets, wide footpaths and tramways, which enable a driver to make such an attack. It would be impossible to install bollards in every part of the city. Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews praised the off-duty police officer who responded first, saying he \\"instinctively came to the aid of others, in the protection of public order, and potentially, avoiding so much other carnage\\". ==See also== * Vehicle- ramming attack * Timeline of major crimes in Australia * January 2017 Melbourne car attack ==References== Category:2017 crimes in Australia Category:2017 road incidents Category:2010s in Melbourne Category:Attacks in 2017 Category:Crime in Melbourne Category:December 2017 crimes Category:Road incidents in Australia Category:Vehicular rampage in Oceania Category:December 2017 events in Australia ","title":"December 2017 Melbourne car attack"},{"id":"56103293","text":"A leadership spill of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), then the opposition party in the Parliament of Australia, was held on 16 February 1956. ==Background== Labor frontbencher Allan Fraser unsuccessfully challenged ALP leader H.

Whereas his had abolished most of the rotten boroughs for parliamentary purposes, the 1835 Act applied the similar reforms in terms of local government to 178 boroughs.

Prabhu. The film stars Karthik Raj, Niranjana and Manobala in the lead roles. The film was released on 24 March 2017. == Plot == Jai (Karthik Raj) works as a doctor for a private hospital along with Manobala. Despite Karthik being fallen in love with another woman, a fellow doctor falls in love with Karthik. At a given point in time, both Manobala and the lady doctor dies under mysterious circumstances. Karthik who is present at the murder scene chases an unidentified woman in green dress, but unable to catch her. Police suspect Karthik had a hand in the murders. Karthik tries to move on, but strange things begin to happen around him. One day, Karthik sees a girl being chased by unidentified men. He sees that the girl slowly turns into a ghostly figure (we will refer to her as girl ghost). This incident stuns Karthick. Another day day he meets an old man on a deserted road claiming her granddaughter is in need of medical help. Karthik tries to help him and the old man leads him to a seemingly deserted and haunted house. The house is devoid of any lighting and the old man makes Karthik take a stairs to check his granddaughter. However the old man vanishes and Karthik is greeted by a friendly but strange woman claiming she is the owner of the house and the old man is actually a ghost. Karthik tries to leave the place but finds that the woman is murdered in the kitchen. On his way out of the house, he sees the same girl ghost. Karthik is confused and returns home, where he discuses the ghost sightings with his brother and man servant. The man servant feels Karthik should be more careful as he keeps seeing the same girl again and again. In his room, Karthik sees a newspaper article, which states that the girl ghost is actually a person who was killed in a train accident almost an year ago. He is further confused on whats happening around him. Next day his brother brings Karthik a set of potential prospects for Karthik's marriage. Karthik is stunned to see the photo of the girl named Harini, which resembles the girl ghost. Intrigued Karthik marries Harini with the sole motive to prove she indeed is a ghost. Karthik treats Harini badly, verbally insulting her of being a ghost. Harini tries to adjust with Karthik as she is an orphan. She is dedicated for his well being and devoted as a wife, but does not understand why Karthik keeps referring him as a ghost. Karthick's brother believes his sister in law and chides Karthik for treating her badly. One day when Karthik and his brother are in a coffee shop, Karthik's brother convinces that there is nothing wrong with Harini and Karthik has to change his ways. Karthick realizes his mistake and tries to make things up and apologizes to Harini over a phone. Karthik's brother is happy that he is patching things with his wife and leaves the coffee shop. As he prepares to leave, he is shocked to see the girl ghost sitting in the same seat as his. She slowly walks away and gets into a car, maintaining a ghostly smile. Karthick rushes home and finds his brother and man servant there. Both bizzarely claim they never left the home and Harini is upstairs in her room. Things take a bad turn as Harini gets tired of Karthik accusing him of being a ghost and she complains to the hospital where Karthick works. His superiors from the hospital subdue Karthik due to his violent behavior and starts wondering is Karthik is facing a mental breakdown and hallucinating. When questioned, Karthik's brother and man servant claim they never were in the coffee shop and its a figment of imagination from Karthik. Karthik is admitted to the hospital on suspected mental illness and he starts suspecting himself. We get to hear that Karthick is in line for a 150 crore inheritance from his family and the formalities are to be closed in a 2 days time. The chief doctor instructs that no one apart from the hospital should know about Karthik's mental condition and asks Harini not to be around Karthik as it might affect him mentally. Next day Karthick hears a knock on his door only to see the whole hospital is deserted. He starts to doubt his sanity when he sees the girl ghost again. The ghost smiles at Karthik, slowly gets into a car and leaves. Karthik tries to chase the car on foot, but in vain. He steals a bike from someone and gives a chase to the car the girl got into. The car drives to the same house from the previous scene where the old man claiming his sick granddaughter was. We see that the ghost come out of the passenger side door, and it is Karthik's brother who comes out of the drivers seat. Things start to make sense for Karthick, where he understand the whole ghost episode is nothing but a drama orchestrated by his brother. The girl enters the haunted house while his brother leaves. Karthick chases the girl and subdues her. He finds may selfie videos in the girl's mobile, where the plot unfolds. The girl is actually a girl friend of his brother. She along with Karthik's brother and man servant had co-conspired against Karthik to play an elaborate show to make Karthik question reality. Their ultimate aim was to declare Karthick as mentally unstable and claim the inheritance. In the process, the conspirators kill Karthik's girlfriend and her father Manobala. Enraged, Karthik kills the girl. The scene now shifts 6 years later, where we see Karthick has married another beautiful girl and happily settled in to family. The couple have a daughter. The daughter sees the actual ghost of the girl (Harini). Unknown to Karthick and his wife, the ghost possesses the kid. == Cast== * Karthik Raj as Dr. Jai * Niranjana * Manobala * Pavani Reddy as Jai's wife * Uday Mahesh * Jayashree Rao * Crane Manohar == References External links== * Category:2017 films Category:2017 horror films Category:2010s Tamil-language films Category:Indian ghost films Category:Indian horror films Category:Indian films Category:2017 directorial debut films ","title":"465 (film)"},{"id":"56103505","text":"Acolbifene/prasterone (tentative brand name Femivia) is a combination formulation of acolbifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, and prasterone (dehydroepiandrosterone; DHEA), an androgen, estrogen, and neurosteroid, which is under development by Endoceutics for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) in postmenopausal women.http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800043933 It is intended for use by mouth.

The book, written for children aged three years and above, tells the story of a young wombat who fears he will not be given a part in this years Nativity play, but is delighted in the end to be chosen for the part of the Christ Child. A 21st anniversary edition of the book was published in 2016. == Plot summary == Wombat has long dreamed of being in the annual Nativity play. When he is finally old enough to participate, he enters every audition, only to be rejected each time on the grounds that he is \\"too big for some parts, too small for others, too short, too clumsy ...\\" until he fears that his dream will go unfulfilled. Fortunately, \\"wise Emu\\" has an idea--a sleepy Wombat would be well suited to the part of baby Jesus. Wombat accepts the part and ends up stealing the show as he falls asleep during the performance, just as a real baby might.  Characters  In addition to Wombat, the story features a host of native Australian animals as characters including kangaroos, koalas, numbats, emus, bilbies and platypuses. == Composition and publication == Wombat Divine was written by Australian childrens author Mem Fox and illustrated by Kerry Argent. The book came about via a request from the authors then publisher, Omnibus Books, to write \\"a typically Australian Christmas story.\\" Fox replied that she had never written a book to order and doubted she could manage it, but her publisher promised assistance. After two years of failed collaborative effort, Fox declared that she was unable to complete the project. In a last-ditch attempt, Foxs publisher suggested that she \\"make a 32-page book and write the story in it.\\" This proved to be the conceptual breakthrough for Fox, and she was able to write the book. Wombat Divine is 32 pages long and in height. Originally published in 1995 by Omnibus Books (), a 15th anniversary edition was published in 2009 and a 21st anniversary edition on 1 October 2016 by Scholastic Australia (). == Reception == American childrens author Ally Condie wrote of Wombat Divine that \\"[m]y kids love the different animals and the lovely illustrations, and the ending is perfect and inclusive.\\" BookPages childrens book editor described Wombat Divine as \\"vintage Mem Fox ... the native Australian animals display such human concern for Wombat that readers of any age will be immersed in the drama.\\" The Australian government website described Wombat Divine as a \\"favourite\\" and an example of \\"truly Australian children's Christmas literature.\\" A bullet review in The New York Times said of the book that \\"[t]he story and the illustrations are both enchanting and endearing. Plus nifty animals.\\" The books author, Mem Fox, related on her blog how one reader, while thanking her for the book, had remarked that \\"I have a Down's syndrome child and this wombat is just him. I couldn’t stop crying.\\" Fox then revealed that a memorable performance she had seen of a Downs syndrome child in a childrens play had provided inspiration for the story. Fox has also said of the book that she likes the \\"gentle religious reminder to return Jesus to the centre of the Christmas story, which is missing from many Christmas books.\\" The book has spawned a number of study aids for teaching young children. In 1996, Australian composer Sean O'Boyle wrote a score to accompany an audio version of the story.

It is the brightest carbon star in the Southern Hemisphere at 12 μm. In 1987, the infrared source IRAS 15194-5115 was identified as an extreme carbon star. It was seen to be strongly variable at optical and infrared wavelengths. It is very faint visually, 15th or 16th magnitude in a red filter and below 21st magnitude in a blue filter, but at mid-infrared wavelengths (N band) it is the third-brightest carbon star in the sky. A star at the location had earlier been catalogued as WOS 48, a possible S-type star, on the basis of strong LaO bands in its spectrum. On the basis of infrared photometry, IRAS 15194-5115 was given the variable star designation II Lupi in 1995, although the variability type was still unknown. More detailed infrared photometry confirmed that II Lupi was a Mira variable and showed regular variations with a period of 675 days over 18 years. The mean magnitude also dimmed and brightened during that time and has been characterised as a 6,900-day secondary period although less than a full cycle was observed. The secondary period could be interpreted as an isolated or irregular obscuration event in a dust shell surrounding the star. == References == Category:Mira variables Category:C-type stars Category:Lupus (constellation) Lupi, II Category:IRAS catalogue objects Category:2MASS objects ","title":"II Lupi"},{"id":"56103620","text":"Gosam is a union council of Lower Dir District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.

The game was released on MS-DOS in July 1996 and is the first game in the series game to contain snooker as a playable game (the next was Virtual Pool Hall in 1999). Virtual Snooker was released the year after the original Virtual Pool, and uses the same game engine many of the same digital assets as the previous installment. However, whilst Virtual Pool featured four different types of pool to play, Virtual Snooker only presents the ability to play traditional snooker, as the name suggests. Originally released only for DOS, it was later ported to Windows 95 and Windows 98 (in a single three-platform release), distributed by SoftKey. ==Gameplay== Taking the break in a frame of Virtual Snooker Similar to other releases in the Virtual Pool series, the game is controlled by keyboard and mouse, with shots being made by mouse movement. The game features first-person 3D graphics and allows the player to stand up away from the line of the shot, and move around the table to see different angles. The game boasts a higher frame rate than that of the original Virtual Pool. In each release of the game, there is the ability to play locally networked multiplayer games on an Ethernet LAN, and to do basic online multiplayer between two remote computers via analog modems. The game features LAN capabilities, and the ability to connect two computers via modem for basic online multiplayer. As with other games in the series, Virtual Snooker was marketed with a guarantee that the simulator would improve the player's non-simulated game at a real table. The game's box indicates six-time World Snooker Champion Steve Davis in a starring role. The game offers 52 minutes of instructional videos with Davis, and the option to pause the video and attempt the shot being demonstrated by the game. This live-action material also includes the world's first televised maximum break in history, completed by Davis. Ronnie O'Sullivan, another top-level professional player, acts as presenter in the game (both he and Davis feature in the cover art, superimposed on snooker balls). O'Sullivan would later work on World Snooker Championship 2007 and his own game, Ronnie O'Sullivan's Snooker. ==Reception== Critical Reception for Virtual Pool Hall was moderate, with review aggregator website Game Rankings scoring the game 67%. Stephen Pool of GameSpot scored the game at 7.2/10 saying \\"how much you enjoy Virtual Snooker depends mainly on how much interest you have in real snooker.\\". GameSpot cited the game for following on from Virtual Pool, and \\"you can expect the same excellence\\" in terms of gameplay. They also stated that the inclusion of Steve Davis in game was an \\"excellent job\\", that \\"show(ed) you the ideal way to play the game.\\" GameSpot were less impressed with the lack of depth in gameplay modes; \\"where Virtual Snooker disappoints is in its lack of variety.\\" Where Virtual Pool had other types of Pool to play, Virtual Snooker only had Snooker. Other paper reviews, such as Germany's PC Joker, cited the game for its playability, as well as its looks, but also found the game did not have much replayability. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Developer Celeris official website Category:1996 video games Category:DOS games Category:Interplay Entertainment games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Virtual Pool Category:Windows games ","title":"Virtual Snooker"},{"id":"56103633","text":"The 2018 Tirreno–Adriatico NAMEDSPORT was a road cycling stage race that took place between 7 and 13 March 2018 in Italy.

The general classification was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded to the first three finishers on all stages except for the time trials: the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for the second and third riders respectively. Bonus seconds were also awarded to the first three riders at intermediate sprints; three seconds for the winner of the sprint, two seconds for the rider in second and one second for the rider in third. The leader of the general classification received a blue jersey. This classification was considered the most important of the 2018 Tirreno–Adriatico, and the winner of the classification was considered the winner of the race. { class=\\" floatleft\\" style=\\"text- align: center\\" + Points for stage victory - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Position ! scope=\\"col\\"  1 ! scope=\\"col\\"  2 ! scope=\\"col\\"  3 ! scope=\\"col\\"  4 ! scope=\\"col\\"  5 ! scope=\\"col\\"  6 ! scope=\\"col\\"  7 ! scope=\\"col\\"  8 ! scope=\\"col\\"  9 ! scope=\\"col\\"  10 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Points awarded  12  10  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1 } The second classification was the points classification.

Unlike in the points classification in the Tour de France, the winners of all stages – with the exception of the team time trial, which awarded no points towards the classification – were awarded the same number of points. Points were also won in intermediate sprints; five points for crossing the sprint line first, three points for second place, two for third and one for fourth.

Each of the sixteen climbs was categorised as either Superior-, or single-category, with more points available for the more difficult, Superior-category climb to Sassotetto. For this climb, the top seven riders earned points; on the other climbs, only the top four riders earned points. The leadership of the mountains classification was marked by a green jersey. The fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, marked by a white jersey. Only riders born after 1 January 1993 were eligible; the young rider best placed in the general classification was the leader of the young rider classification. There was also a classification for teams, in which the times of the best three cyclists in a team on each stage were added together; the leading team at the end of the race was the team with the lowest cumulative time. {   center; font-size:smaller;\\" - ! width=\\"1%\\" Stage ! width=\\"16.5%\\" Winner !

The City of York Green Belt is a green belt environmental and planning policy that regulates the rural space within the Yorkshire and the Humber region of England. It is contained wholly within the county of North Yorkshire. The core function of the belt is to more rigorously manage development around York and surrounding areas, preserving its setting and historic character, discouraging urban sprawl, and convergence of outer villages into the built up areas of the city. It is managed by local planning authorities on guidance from central government. == Purpose == There are five stated local aims for the green belt: * Maintain the historic setting and character of York; * Keep the urban sprawl of York in check; * Preserve the surrounding countryside from further development; * Stop nearby settlements converging towards each other; * Encourage urban regeneration, by promoting the recycling of brownfield or other urban land. ==Geography== Formally created in 1980 after decades of being an interim local policy since the 1950s, the local development plan defines the green belt outer edge as being 'about 6 miles from York'. Land area taken up by the belt is hectares (0.2% of the total land area of England (2010). The belt nearly covers all of the city district, but avoids the main built-up area and larger surrounding villages. It extends into the surrounding North Yorkshire districts of Hambleton, Harrogate, Ryedale, and Selby. East Riding of Yorkshire borders York but does not contain any green belt. The rural areas and smaller villages of the district are \\"washed over\\" wholly with green belt, meaning there is limited development scope in these areas:Acaster, Malbis, Askham Bryan, Askham Richard, Deighton, Heslington, Hessay, Holtby, Hopgrove, Knapton, Murton, Naburn and Rufforth. The South and West Yorkshire Green Belt lies a few miles to the south west. Due to the York city belt lying across several adjacent districts, responsibility and co-ordination lies with the city and aforementioned local district councils whose land covers the belt, as these are the local planning government bodies. ==See also== * Green belt (United Kingdom) ==ReferencesExternal links== * Interactive map of green belt land Category:Green belts in the United Kingdom Category:Environment of North Yorkshire Category:York ","title":"York Green Belt"},{"id":"56103650","text":"Toormang-2 is a union council of Lower Dir District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.

It was the 109th edition of the Milan–San Remo and the eighth event of the 2018 UCI World Tour. The race was won by Vincenzo Nibali from the team, becoming the first Italian rider since Filippo Pozzato in 2006 to win La Classicissima. Nibali had attacked on the Poggio di San Remo, and managed to hold off the sprinters in the closing stages to seal victory. Caleb Ewan () led the sprinters home in second ahead of 's Arnaud Démare, the 2016 winner. ==Teams== As Milan–San Remo was a UCI World Tour event, all eighteen UCI WorldTeams were invited automatically and obliged to enter a team in the race. Seven UCI Professional Continental teams competed, completing the 25-team peloton. Each team was allowed to bring seven riders to the race, leading to a field made up of 175 riders. ==Route== As one of the sports monuments, Milan–San Remo – generally considered to be a sprinters' classic – is among the highest-rated races in professional cycling. The 2018 route was initially scheduled to be long, running from the Via della Chiesa Rossa in Milan to the traditional finish on San Remo's Via Roma. The final part of the race included the climbs of the Cipressa and the Poggio, which usually prove decisive for the race outcome. Also on the route, the riders also had to tackle the climb of the Passo dello Turchino, although it was not considered to be a key point in the race. After the Turchino, the route followed the Aurelia road along the coast from Genoa all the way to the finish in Sanremo. With a little over left to go, the first of the coastal climbs started with the Capo Mele, the Capo Cervo and the Capo Berta, before meeting the final two climbs leading to the finish. The day before the race, it was announced that the race was to be lengthened to with a diversion after the original mark, at Basaluzzo. ==Pre-race favourites== Peter Sagan (pictured at the 2017 Tour de France) was considered the main favourite for victory. Three-time world champion Peter Sagan () was considered the highest ranked favourite for the victory. Unlike others in the field, he was considered as a rider who could win both through a bunch sprint as well as a late attack on the final climb. He came into the race with good form, having finished second on three stages of Tirreno–Adriatico, a stage race held before Milan–San Remo. Michał Kwiatkowski (), the defending champion, was also considered a strong favourite, as he had won the general classification at Tirreno–Adriatico. Julian Alaphilippe (), who was third in 2017, was also counted among the favourites for the race. While Kwiatkowski and Alaphilippe were considered to have to rely on a breakaway on one of the final climbs, several sprinters were counted among the favourites if a larger group reached the finish line together. 2014 winner Alexander Kristoff () was among them, as was Arnaud Démare (), who won the race in 2016, but had to withdraw from Paris–Nice due to a cold. Other strong sprinters at the start line were Elia Viviani (), Matteo Trentin (), Edvald Boasson Hagen (), Magnus Cort (), André Greipel () and Marcel Kittel (), who took part in the race for the first time. Michael Matthews (), usually also a favourite, was not given a strong chance due to a fractured shoulder, suffered three weeks prior at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. 2015 winner John Degenkolb () missed the race due to illness, as did his teammate Giacomo Nizzolo. Fernando Gaviria () also missed the race, because of a fractured hand suffered at Tirreno–Adriatico. His teammate Philippe Gilbert, who had finished on the podium of Milan–San Remo twice before, aimed at a victory to get closer to his goal of winning all five \\"monument races\\" of cycling. More riders considered to potentially play their hand on one of the climbs before the finish were Vincenzo Nibali (), Olympic champion Greg Van Avermaet (), Gianni Moscon () and Nathan Haas (). ==Race report== The peloton descending down the Capo Berta climb The race started in heavy rain in Milan. The rolling start took place at 10:13 am local time at the Via della Chiesa Rossa outside of the city. An early breakaway formed, consisting of Mirco Maestri and Lorenzo Rota (both ), Evgeny Kobernyak (), Guy Sagiv and Dennis van Winden (both ), Sho Hatsuyama (), Charles Planet (), Matteo Bono () and Jacopo Mosca (). The maximum time gap the group held was six minutes after about an hour of racing. The peloton began to pull back on the Passo Turchino climb, cutting the break's lead to 4:30 minutes by the summit, though it extended back to five minutes as the riders reached the sea front. With the roads still wet, a crash in the field involved both Kristoff and Greipel among others. With of the race to go, the rain eased up. By the first of the so- called Capi climbs from the finish, the breakaway's lead was down to two minutes. At the Cappo Berta, with left, the lead had decreased further to half a minute, while the high tempo in the field distanced Marcel Kittel. Maestri attacked from the break on the descent, taking Rota, van Winden, and Bono with him. However, they were caught at San Lorenzo al Mare, before the finish. As the field reached the climb of the Cipressa, more riders failed to keep contact with the field's high pace. However, no major attacks were launched. At the base of the Poggio climb, and set the tempo. Mark Cavendish () had to retire after a spectacular accident in which he hit a traffic bollard and crashed onto the road. Marcus Burghardt () led the first acceleration on the climb, with Jempy Drucker () following. Drucker moved past Burghardt but was reeled back by the squad. Krists Neilands () attacked shortly before the summit and Vincenzo Nibali reacted, leaving Neilands shortly thereafter and heading towards the finish on his own. His lead at the summit was 12 seconds. Matteo Trentin () tried to counter the attack on the descent, but was unable to do so. At the bottom of the descent, Nibali's lead was nine seconds over a larger group of riders. Alaphilippe set the pace as they tried to reach Nibali before the line, but to no avail. Nibali won the race just ahead of Caleb Ewan and Arnaud Démare, who led out the sprint from the group behind. It was Nibali's third victory in one of cycling's \\"monument\\" races, having won Il Lombardia twice before. He was also the first Italian to win the race since Filippo Pozzato in 2006. ==Post-race== Vincenzo Nibali (pictured at the start) won the race for . Following his victory, Nibali thanked his teammates for their efforts. He described the final kilometres of the race as \\"endless – pure suffering.\\" He added: \\"I was very cold and calculating. I knew I was working for the team. When I attacked, I knew I had to go alone, and it was that way\\". Second-placed Caleb Ewan stated that he was surprised to have been so close to victory. He felt that the race had gone his way, adding: \\"All that went wrong for us is that Vincenzo was too strong.\\" Sixth-placed Peter Sagan congratulated Nibali on his win, saying: \\"He deserves it. None of us had any means against his attack.\\" Mark Cavendish's crash, which left him with a broken rib, caused him to miss the 2018 Commonwealth Games. André Greipel, who suffered two crashes in the last of the race, was forced to miss the rest of the spring classics season due to a broken collarbone. ==Result== Results show only the top-ten finishers. ==References== Sources * ==External links== * Category:2018 in Italian sport Category:2018 UCI World Tour Category:March 2018 sports events in Italy 2018 Category:2018 in road cycling ","title":"2018 Milan–San Remo"},{"id":"56103657","text":"Sean Hepburn Ferrer is an American film producer and author.

Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund  His mother's death in 1993 led him the following year to found the Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund (originally named Hollywood for Children Inc.), a charity funded by exhibitions of Audrey Hepburn memorabilia. He directed the charity in cooperation with his half-brother Luca Dotti, and Robert Wolders, his mother's last significant other, which thereafter continued the humanitarian work of Audrey Hepburn. Ferrer brought the exhibition \\"Timeless Audrey\\" on a world tour to raise money for the foundation. He served as Chairman of the Foundation before resigning in 2012, at which point Dotti became Chairman. In 2017, Ferrer was sued by the Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund for alleged self-serving conduct. In October 2017, Ferrer responded by suing the Fund for trademark infringement, claiming that the Fund no longer had the right to use Hepburn's name or likeness. Ferrer's suit against the Fund was dismissed in March 2018 due to the complaint's failure to include Dotti as a defendant. Archived from the original on July 28, 2020. In 2019, Ferrer prevailed in the Fund's suit against him, with the judge ruling there was no merit to the charity's claims it had the independent right to use Audrey Hepburn's name and likeness, or to enter into contracts with third parties without Ferrer's consent. Other charity work From 2014 to 2018, Ferrer was ambassador of the annual Rare Disease Days. == Personal life == Ferrer has a daughter, Emma Ferrer, from his marriage to Leila Flannigan.

He primarily played at he played club football with the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the Eastern Suburbs Roosters ==Playing career== Harrington made his debut for the South Sydney Rabbitohs as an 18 year old in his side's 48–12 victory over the Illawarra Steelers at Redfern Oval in round 23 of the 1983 season. Harrington also scored his first try in his debut match. In the 1984 season, Harrington was one of his side's star players when the Rabbitohs made the finals for the first time since 1980. Souths came from 0-14 behind to beat the Manly Sea Eagles 22–18 in a memorable first semi-final, but were knocked out the following week by the St. George Dragons. The appointment of new coach George Piggins in 1986 saw a reversal in the club's fortunes. They went from being easybeats (having not won a premiership since 1971) to title contenders. Souths' best two years under the coaching of Piggins were 1986 and 1989 under the captaincy of Mario Fenech. The Rabbitohs narrowly missed out on the minor premiership in 1986, and were subsequently bundled out in straight sets after losing both semi-finals to the Canterbury Bulldogs and Balmain Tigers respectively. Harrington played in the Rabbitohs' 1986 Presidents Cup grand final victory over the Penrith Panthers. After a disastrous 1988 season, in which Harrington only made seven appearances, Souths led from basically start to finish in the 1989 season, remarkably not losing a single match away from their then home ground the Sydney Football Stadium. Souths finished the regular season as minor premiers on 37 points with 18 wins and a draw, losing only three games along the way. However, come finals time, they lost a classic semi-final to the Balmain Tigers and a week later the Canberra Raiders powered home to end Souths' hopes of making their first grand final appearance since 1971.Middleton, David Rugby League 1989/1990; p. 123. Apart from Harrington himself, Souths' stars during this period included forwards Michael Andrews, David Boyle, Les Davidson and Ian Roberts, hooker and captain Mario Fenech, halfback Craig Coleman and mercurial five-eighth Phil Blake. Troubles hit Souths the following season where they went from minor premiers in 1989 to wooden spooners in 1990. Souths survived in the competition but for much of the year were at the bottom of the ladder, George Piggins was subsequently sacked from the coaching role at the end of the 1990 season. Harrington's stint with the Rabbitohs ended at the conclusion of the 1991 season. In 1992, Harrington shifted to arch rivals the Eastern Suburbs Roosters. He made only two appearances with the Roosters, ironically his final first grade appearance was his sides' 56–16 win over his former club the South Sydney Rabbitohs at the Sydney Football Stadium in round 22 of the 1992 season. Harrington decided to retire at season's end. He finished his career having played 104 games and scoring 15 tries. ==References== Category:1964 births Category:People from Sydney Category:Rugby league players from Sydney Category:Sportsmen from New South Wales Category:Australian rugby league players Category:South Sydney Rabbitohs players Category:Sydney Roosters players Category:Rugby league wingers Category:Living people ","title":"Ross Harrington"},{"id":"56103694","text":"The Frederick H. and Elizabeth Stafford House was constructed as a private house, located at 4489 Main Street in Port Hope, Michigan.

It was built on the premises of the Worcester Pressed Steel Company owned by John Woodman Higgins to house his museum-worthy collection of steel artifacts, mostly European weapons and armor but also early American steel constructs. The L-shaped building appears to be a massive city-block sized structure, but in reality it wraps around the former factory, to which it was connected via catwalks. The building was often used to impress potential clients, as well as becoming a locally known museum and cultural venue open to the public. The museum was first accredited after Higgins died in 1972 by the American Association of Museums and continued operations through the closing of the Worcester Pressed Steel Company in 1975. On January 4, 1978, it was the victim of a theft of arms and armor worth over . The museum changed from a private foundation owned by the Higgins family to a public-supported charity in 1979. At the vote to incorporate under a public board of trustees, the incorporators turned down offers by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City to purchase the collection, as well as an offer of a merger with the Worcester Art Museum. The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston offered to buy the entire collection in 1985, but that offer was also turned down. The new museum board rewrote the mission statement, closed the exhibits on modern steel manufacturing, and devoted the museum entirely to ancient and medieval arms and armor. By refocusing the collection, the board created the only museum in America devoted purely to arms and armor. The Higgins Armory lost this title in 2004 with the opening of the Frazier Historical Arms Museum in Louisville, Kentucky. The Higgins Armory began facing fiscal issues during the beginning of the 2010s due to a dwindling endowment and inability to raise enough revenue to balance its budget. Deficits at the museum ranged between almost and , draining the already small endowment to . In order to shore up the endowment, the board voted in July 2012 to sell off more than 500 objects, with the proceeds being put directly into the endowment. Museum director Suzanne W. Maas stated that it was \\"simple housekeeping\\". \\"We have 10 virtually identical examples of troopers' helmets,\\" she pointed out. \\"Do we need 10, or do we need seven?\\" With the endowment still shrinking, the trustees voted in November 2012 to integrate the museum into the Worcester Art Museum, and they announced in March 2013 that the museum would close at the end of that year. Maas stated, \\"There is not enough long-term support, and I can say I am very gratified that the trustees have made the tough decision and did not draw it out.\\" The museum closed on December 31, 2013, and now its entire inventory and endowment have been transferred to the Worcester Art Museum less than three miles away. An exhibit displays highlights of the Higgins collection, and the art museum will renovate its current library to house the collection permanently. The new gallery was slated to open in 2015. The building is under new ownership for the first time in more than 80 years and has been renamed the John W. Higgins Armory. It functions as a wedding and event venue and as studio and office space for Worcester's small businesses. 542x542px ==Architecture== The Higgins Armory Museum building was constructed between 1929 and 1931 specifically to hold Higgin's collection of arms and armor in a museum setting. The four-story Art Deco building was designed by Joseph D. Leland of Boston, Massachusetts. The steel-framed building features large expanses of glass and cost more than $300,000 to construct; it is believed to be the first building constructed solely out of steel and glass. The building is L-shaped with a chamfered corner. The entrance is located on this chamfer, and a large decoration of a half suit of armor sits on the roof above it. The exterior consists of visible steel pilasters decorated with oversized rivets, dividing sections of glass windows along the sides of the building. A decorative band of steel runs above the first story windows, and a row of large medallions decorates the cornice. The first two floors of the building were originally for offices, while the upper two housed the museum. The main hall stands in sharp contrast to the exterior. The interior walls of the main galleries were constructed of plaster on metal lathe, and the whole space was designed to resemble Prince Eugene of Savoy's Hohenwerfen Castle in Austria, where Higgins acquired a selection of works in the collection. The walls were finished to resemble the Gothic stone arches in the medieval castle. Medieval- style lighting fixtures can be found throughout the building. In 1980, the museum was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and two renovations have been completed since then. The 1988 renovation cost $1.4 million, followed by another in 1992 which used $2.6 million raised in campaign.Edgers, Geoff. Founder's kin fights to stop Higgins Armory's closure.

The term \\"the end of painting\\" appears in the descriptions of radical art movements in painting that express the nihilistic stance towards the progress of artistic creation. Such an attitude was stimulated by the disappearance of the utopian dimension of art, which was meant to transform the social relations and the position of man towards himself,Purgar, K., \\"Neo-Baroque Subject: Lovro Artuković and images of our time\\", Meandar Media, Zagreb, 2006, p.98 in a time marked by the deaths of political ideologies and the strengthening of global capitalism.Rus, Z., \\"End of Painting?\\" In: K15 Glossary of New Croatian Art, Krešimir Purgar (editor), Kontura Art Magazine, Zagreb, 2007, p. 65. Artistic movements of this type are active throughout the 20th century, culminating with Malevich's White Square on the white background, Reinhardt's black canvases from the fifties, analytical painting, and finally emphasising the verbal component of conceptual art. The phrase \\"Return to painting\\" as a media and tradition, is a reaction to the mentioned art practices and manifests itself in the realities of the twenties and thirties of the 20th century (Forces Nouvelles in France, Valori Plastici and Novecento in Italy, Verism and Neue Sachlichkeit in Germany, Precisionism and Regionalism in America) and in the eighties (Neue Wilde, Transavantgarde, Neo-Expressionism). The lack of interest for painting during the nineties influenced the new ways of performing arts (performance, land-art, body art, etc.) and the expressive possibilities offered by electronic and digital media (installations, video). Elements that make today's art valuable and relevant are collective art practices, participatory aesthetics, and social engagement, and the \\"ideology of the new\\" has almost become a canon in (post) modern exchange of ideas.Purgar, K., „K15 Glossary of New Croatian Art”, Kontura Art Magazine, Zagreb, 2007, p. 7 At the beginning of the 21st century, new momentum is emerging in the media of painting, and contemporary art is marked by the search for inspiration in various styles, movements, and currents of art history, so there are frequent quotes and references within visual art. Croatian contemporary painting is characterized by the pluralism of styles ranging from traditional media relations to multidisciplinarity and the exit from the conventional boundaries of the image. == Painting of the nineties == In the nineties, there was no art practice in Croatian painting that would unite the perspectives of active artists, but the influence of the new painting (from the seventies) and the new painting of the eighties dominated. In the seventies, Đuro Seder proclaimed a dogmatic view on painting as a self-limiting medium in his text \\"Impossibility of Painting“ (1971).Jozić, M., “Faces of the Infinite: Bottom of Existence and Bottom of the World”, in: Exhibition Catalogue Đuro Seder: Faces of the Infinite, Klovićevi Dvori Gallery, Zagreb, 2007, p. 7 He gradually progressed from monochromatic paintings, which had problematized the relationship towards painting and denied the sense of narrative artistic content whereas in the eighties, he began to see the possibility of non- referential art, that by reproducing the artist's experience creates a new autonomic reality within the work. His works from the nineties are characterized by an expressive stroke and a thick paint application, with an emphasis on building the image, while figuration and content remain side elements. He is turning to religious themes that challenge the spiritual crisis of a man seeking the figure of Christ as the founding hope in fulfilling human aspirations. Vatroslav Kuliš creates works somewhere between realism and abstraction, maintaining the connection with nature by using motives of landscapes, sea, and water.Zidić, I., \\"Vatroslav Kuliš and His Work: Letters, Figures, Motives, Language\\", Školska knjiga, Zagreb, 2010, p. 451 Igor Zidić explains his art using the term neoromanticism, which is manifested in the coloristic compositions of utopian character and emphasizing the perfection of nature and the dreamy escape from reality. By using various materials (sand, wax, pigment, jars, cardboard) and combining media (painting, photography, installations), he seeks to erase the boundaries between art and reality. His recent works are mostly abstract colourist compositions characterized by almost lyrical character, the spontaneity of the movement, and absence of narrative content. The paintings of Igor Rončević in the eighties and nineties mark the duality between abstraction and figure, which, according to Zvonko Maković, refers to \\"the illusion of existence\\". The artist dissolves and fragments objects and characters, emphasizes colour and brush strokes, and offers ambiguous interpretations of the content.Maković, Z., “Paintings of Igor Rončević”, in: Dimensions of Painting, Meandar, Zagreb, 2005, p.120 The transavantgarde approach to the image is manifested in the artist's study of various possibilities of acting in pure painting, that doesn't exclude his aesthetic, associative or any other values, which was the case in analytical painting.Maković, Z., “The Trace of Hand: Paintings from the Series “Hands” by Igor Rončević”, in: Dimensions of Painting, Meandar, Zagreb, 2005, p.124. The work of Edita Schubert in the 1980s was based on a geometric abstraction that was constantly interpreted within the influence of the neo-geo movement.Maković, Z., “Paintings by Edita Schubert”, in: Dimensions of Painting, Meandar, Zagreb, 2005, p.135. In the Portable series in the 1990s, she creates works she calls „collages“, canvases of standardized format entirely covered by even paint strokes freed from expressivity and extra significance, thereby approaching more analytical painting. Reducing the visual language to a colour-based confrontation of two colours is a way of reflecting on the image category and emphasizing its objectivity and portability as the title itself suggests.Pančević, D., \\"Edita Schubert: From Trapeze to Apartment: Artistic Work from 1985 to 1999\\", graduate thesis, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, Department of Art History, 2000, p. 15 After expressionism and colourism in the first half of the eighties, during her stay in New York (1986-93) Nina Ivančić gravitated to the apersonal abstract-geometric mode of neo-geo, and in the 1990s she produced a series of paintings called Ghosts, silhouettes of ships in flat and rigid black acrylic on a white canvas base. The results are the paintings- diagrams which she, after the year 2000, multiples and expands, and intertwines with the images of the airplanes. She drew inspiration from the promotional brochures and the pop artist heritage of Lichtenstein and Rosenquist, which makes her paintings historically retrospective, while on the other hand she shows a certain legacy and further development of non- expressionism during her stay in America. Maković, Z., “Neo-expressionism of Nina Ivančić”, in: Dimensions of Painting, Meandar, Zagreb, 2005, p. 127 Zoltan Novak begins to paint in the 1980s, and his work is characterized by a visible psychological-expressive moment in depictions of impertinent and lonely human characters, with morally and mentally empty psyches.Gudelj Barać, L., “Zoltan Novak: An Individual in a Labyrinth of Megalopolis”, in: Kontura Art Magazine, Number 120, Zagreb, 2013, p. 72 The representative symbol of his painting is the motif of the walker, while in his recent works the painter gives his own introspective view of the urban man who is lonely within modern megalopolis. == Transdisciplinary model of creativity == The transdisciplinary model of creativity implies a free choice of the most appropriate solution for the production, realization, and presentation of a concept. Many Croatian artists create works that, by combining different media, tend to cross the boundaries of the image, and often instead of the expression denoting a specific media (painter, sculptor, video artist, etc.), the term visual artist is used. Damir Sokić's work ranges from analytic and primary over transavantgarde and neo-geometry to installations, objects, and assemblages. He is a protagonist of new and innovative artistic thoughts and actions, and he works in almost all media, trying to overcome the boundaries of a single media guided by the interest for pure art speech.Viculin, M., “Exhibition Catalogue Damir Sokić: Blind Streets”, Klovićevi dvori Gallery, Zagreb, 2013, p.24 In his works, he often refers to the artists and performers of modern art, especially Mondrian in his neoplastic series and installations that he adapts to new visual possibilities and demands. Boris Demur is a painter, conceptual and multimedia artist, performer, theoretician and one of the most provocative protagonists of contemporary visual art. At the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb, he showed interest in radical conceptual solutions and processual, theoretical and analytical research of the nature of painting language.Rus, Z., “Exhibition Catalogue Boris Demur Retrospective I. Expressionism as Reality of Life and Art Reality: Primary, Analytical, Elementary, Processual Painting and Sculpture: Spiral Painting and Spiral Sculpture 1970-2000”, Modern Gallery, Zagreb, 2004, p. 40 The processual character of his artistic practice is defined by the discovery of a spiral form that becomes an identifying sign of his art. By repeating and making variations of the same motif, he introduced a component of time and existential expression in the form of spiral motion in his work. The spiral often comes with new signs (such as crosses, yin and yang, ancient Chinese symbols), thus enriching it with layers of new meanings. The result is a combination of primary and analytical action painting, further elaborated with verbal components and outdoor work in the form of land-art, which he documents with photos and videos. Željko Kipke became interested in the transavantgarde spirit in the early 1980s, and since the 1990s, in the spirit of postmodernism, he has been redefining the limits of figuration and abstraction and integrating the verbal component into his work. He creates multimedia exhibitions (a combination of literature, painting and video works) supported by theoretical works, where he defines his own notion of the Painting of the New Aeon, which marks the complex process of opposing various meanings and symbols linking the paintings with the field of philosophy, mathematics, computer science, etc.Srhoj, V., “Željko Kipke or the Bulk Cargo of Added Value”, in: Kontura Art Magazine, Number 118/119, Zagreb, 2012, p. 46. The series of five images from 2010 was directed like \\"stages of a scenario for the movie about cinephilic dictators, a bottle of wine, a spiral of success and scenes of real crimes\\" and is dedicated to the victims of political systems like the British biochemist who was liquidated along with his wife and minor daughter. Duje Jurić is one of the protagonists of the aesthetics of neoconstructive and neoplastic painting based on Bauhaus, De Stijl, New Tendencies, and Fluxus.Roje Depolo, L., « Duje Jurić : Works 1988 – 2002 », Glyptotheque of the Croatian Academy of Arts and Sciences, Zagreb, 2002, p. 7 At the end of the 1990s, he accepted the motive of a computer chip, that is, memory chips in his work. He experimented with strong, open colours combined with a dense network of horizontal shapes and colours. The artist often exhibits a series of images that logically continue one after another, thus obtaining long horizontal friezes that can be up to 15 meters in length. The verbal component appeared in the mid-80s in certain works, but culminated in a series of Paintings-books (2000), consisting of horizontally and vertically- painted grids, where he writes words without a syntactic meaning, of incomprehensible interrelationship and in various languages. At the beginning of the new millennium, he began to experiment with the refraction of light and created light environments in which he introduced a new plastic-visual design element. Tomislav Buntak appeared on the art scene in the late nineties as a representative of religious painting in which he integrates the current Christian and humanistic messages and questions the need for new spirituality. In the drawings with the fluid lines, which he makes with silver or gold pen, he depicts idyllic timeless world with elements of Arcadia and allegory, which are in strong contrast with the reality of our time.Koljanin, A., “Temporality”, in: K15 Glossary of New Croatian Art, Krešimir Purgar (editor), Kontura Art Magazine, Zagreb, 2007, p. 141 The creativity of Matko Vekić includes a wide range of traditional painting techniques, intertwined with skilful craftsmanship, as well as meaningful dialogue with some of the forms of other media. He builds a motor in his works, which rotates them so they look like rotating advertising billboards. The work The sheep that have not been lost show lambs rotating in the form of an advertising billboard. It represents an ironic combination of a high-tech world and the world, which in its original rusticity (barbecued lamb) is transformed into a product that advertises itself as fast-food. == Realism in Contemporary Croatian Art == Lovro Artuković is a representative of realistic painting in Croatia. His art is based on a traditional approach, on searching for patterns in nature, drawing by observing and eventually using drawings for creating a composition. .Gavrilović, F., „Lauba: First nine months of the House for people and art“, in: Kontura Art Magazine, Number 116, Zagreb, 2012, p. 73 In the second half of the nineties, he changes his style and uses this static medium for depicting the course of time by creating series of double portraits and nature scenes without characters with a visible shift towards pure painting.Vukić, F., „Lovro Artuković 1985 – 1997“, Meandar, Zagreb, 1998, p. 72 In the series of paintings Artists in Nature, Artuković creates allegorical images of art: Jasper Johns, Anselm Kiefer, Joseph Beuys, Ivan Kožarić, Igor Rončević and Željko Kipke. The works are done in a similar form of monochrome compositions with silhouettes of characters and colour-accentuated details and/or realistic depictions. With these works, Artuković addresses the painting conditions in „the end of art“ circumstances and expresses distrust in the representational systems of the new art. In the series Pictures Seen by Someone Else, Artuković continues to elaborate the synchronization of the actual and imaginary, contemporary and historical within the image context. The ambiance in which the characters are placed resembles a staged scene, thus emphasizing the opposition between fiction and reality within the work, which becomes the main theme of this cycle. The series Fake scenes consist of staged sceneries within basement spaces in which the artist plays with ambiguous puns of visual and semantic images. In further work, he turns to veristic scenes, which he physically creates in his atelier or in rented spaces. Under the influence of the realistic trends that emerge at the Zagreb Academy of Fine Art and the art of Lovro Artuković, a new generation of young artists is being formed in the spirit of new realism. What many artists have in common are scenes of a realistic motif, which are at the same time a reflection of the artist's inner self and his attitude towards the world. Stipan Tadić creates paintings from a series of strokes in quadratic fields that merge into a coherent whole, in which he shows that it is possible to remain faithful to the image and at the same time to show the width of formal aspects of painting. He refers to old masters by recreating their way of painting, such as painting traditional nudes in the technique of egg tempera and oil or interpolating motives from representative works in art history in the contemporary content.Gavrilović F., “Stipan Tadić: Layered content and masterful realism”, in: Kontura Art Magazine, Number 118/119, Zagreb, 2012, p. 60 Zlatan Vehabović's painting consists of figural representations of topics from personal life or selected topics in popular media such as styles of films, books, newspapers, magazines or postcards. Items and characters, located in empty spaces or undefined landscapes, do not convey a real scene but reflect the artist's personal experience or imagination. == References  Sources == 1\\\\.

Following a vote held at its 2018 AGM, the former hierarchy led by a General Secretary was replaced by a horizontal operational structure, and key decisions are now made democratically by an Executive Committee formed by staff and members on a voluntary basis. Its members are mainly migrant cleaners and workers in other service or low-wage/outsourced industries. UVW has a strong association with the Latin American community, and was formed amid a protracted effort to secure the London Living Wage for outsourced cleaners at the Barbican Centre. This was the subject of a 25-minute documentary, Waging a Living in London (2014). In 2019, UVW launched Legal Sector Workers United (LSWU), an initiative supported by Michael Mansfield QC. Groups of architects, designers/cultural workers and workers from domestic/sexual violence organisations also organise within the union. UVW has been organising strippers and other sex workers since 2018, in collaboration with groups advocating for the decriminalisation of sex work. In 2020, the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation granted UVW the funds to employ two full-time organisers to unionise the private childcare sector. UVW's longest-running active campaign is at the Ministry of Justice, where cleaners, security guards and receptionists outsourced to OCS are demanding the London Living Wage plus parity of sick pay and annual leave with civil servants. Their first strike took place in August 2018, and a second was staged in January 2019 in conjunction with PCS union members striking at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. In July 2020, UVW won recognition as trade union for OCS workers at the Ministry following a 70% vote in favour. == Campaigning style == UVW in early years represented small groups of workers in disputes with global brands such as Sotheby's and Topshop, taking a radical, often experimental approach to organising precarious and migrant workers who felt shunned and under-served by established unions. More recently, UVW has been able to recruit larger numbers of members in workplaces such as hospitals and universities. Co-founder and former General Secretary Petros Elia has said: > \\"If you don’t have a good network of motivated workers or supporters ready > to take direct action then you won’t defend striking workers. One of the > things UVW and IWGB [a sister union] offer workers, besides prospects of > winning real gains, is a sense of community ... that is a large part of the > reason why workers join and stay.\\" Campaigns are characterised by noisy and disruptive pickets and protests, embracing diverse groups and social media to attract further support: > In the street, this scaling-up of the protest was facilitated by a strong > element of fun. The picket lines were turned into festive moments where > participants could dance zumba, make banners with artists, listen to poetry > and live music, and take part in salsa-dancing flash mob occupations of the > LSE’s directors buildings. Online, the campaign circulated petitions (e.g. > against the surprising police presence on campus), and produced Facebook > pages, while established bloggers and professional photographers documented > every step of the protest. This combination of online and street presence, > media attention, and broad-based alliances, contributed in making the > cleaners’ struggle impossible to ignore. The openly confrontational attitude of UVW and IWGB distinguishes them from larger unions: > They also take an uncompromising approach to their demands. Both unions are > quick to call strike action, often with short work stoppages of several > hundred employees that take place alongside protests designed to generate a > social media buzz and exert public pressure on an employer ... \\"We tell > workers that they need to take action, serious action, protracted action > until they win,\\" says Mr Elia. \\"The demands we make are non-negotiable. We > want everything we ask for.\\" == Joseph Rowntree Foundation / Guardian documentary == Filmmaker Hazel Falck secured funding for a short documentary about UVW after her pitch won a contest judged by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation at Sheffield Doc/Fest 2019. Contestants were asked to pitch films that would \\"explore the nature and impact of poverty in the UK, in a way that can ... shift attitudes towards some of the most marginalised people and communities.\\" Shooting of the film coincided with the duration of UVW's campaign at St. Mary's Hospital, and concluded shortly before Covid-19 would have made further filming impossible. Released for public viewing on the Guardian website in August 2020, United Voices centres on migrant women leading the St. Mary's campaign as they organise for strike action. == Picket arrest of Franck Magennis == Franck Magennis, a barrister then working for UVW as Head of Legal, was attending a peaceful picket with striking security guards outside St. George's medical school on the morning of January 13th 2020. A dozen Met police officers presented the crowd with a letter from St. George's requesting that they move the picket, and claimed that the picket was \\"an illegal nuisance on NHS property\\". As Magennis questioned that assertion, he was handcuffed and then released minutes later on the condition that he leave the area immediately. > \\"By the time I showed up, the music had already stopped. I was in the middle > of having a conservation with a police officer who was saying that everyone > here was committing an offence, which is outrageously broad. I asked the > police officer how the offence was made out. If you look at the statute, the > offence is committing nuisance ‘without reasonable excuse’. Surely > industrial action is a reasonable excuse — and even if you consider that > music constitutes a nuisance, which is questionable, it had come to an end. > In the middle of this conversation, he just slapped the cuffs on me.\\" The picket then dispersed, but returned the following morning and proceeded without resistance. In July 2020, a crowdfunder was launched to cover initial costs of legal action against the Met Police. Magennis and UVW claim the arrest was unlawful and an attempt to intimidate a legal picket. == Covid-19 and death of Emanuel Gomes == Emanuel Gomes, a UVW member from Guinea Bissau, died of coronavirus on April 24th 2020, hours after finishing a night shift at the Ministry of Justice. He had been sick for 5 days but continued to clean the deserted offices despite his agency bosses and all civil servants being absent. Emanuel's employer, OCS, had been unresponsive to safety concerns despite informing the cleaners that they were \\"essential workers\\" during the pandemic. Since 2018, UVW have been campaigning for improved wages and sick pay for outsourced cleaners, security guards and receptionists at the Ministry of Justice, and in July 2020, the MoJ announced that outsourced staff would receive full pay for any coronavirus-related sick leave, backdated to 1 April. St. George's medical school, where UVW has been campaigning with security guards employed by Bidvest Noonan, announced in July 2020 that the guards would be entitled to 3 weeks of full sick pay, and full pay during self- isolation after contraction of coronavirus. Some of the security guards had previously walked off the job in protest of non-essential duties and visitors at a time when most students and management were self-isolating, and the lack of provision of PPE. == Campaign history ==  London School of Economics  In late 2016, contested dismissals of cleaners employed by Noonan Services at the London School of Economics (LSE) escalated into a full-scale dispute for equality of rights to match those of LSE's in-house staff. Dozens of cleaners, all of ethnic minorities, faced significant disparities in paid annual leave, sick pay, paternity/maternity pay, and pension contributions when compared to LSE employees. They wore uniforms inscribed with both the name of the university and their employer, but had been instructed by Noonan's management to change out of uniform before using the university's fourth-floor cafeteria. They were subsequently assured by LSE management that the cafeteria was open to all customers, which highlighted a further disparity: the cleaners typically brought their own food and drink (and therefore would not be customers), but unlike in-house staff, had no common room or kitchen space to make use of. Large campus protests and weekly strikes were organised by UVW in the summer of 2017, attracting much student support despite coinciding with the exam period. It was announced in June 2017, after a 10-month campaign, that around 200 outsourced workers at the LSE would be offered in-house contracts.  St. Mary's Hospital  Cleaners, porters and caterers at St. Mary's (and four other London hospitals managed by Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust) were employed by Sodexo on the minimum wage (£8.21), significantly less than they would earn on corresponding NHS pay bands. They were also denied the sick pay, maternity pay, annual leave and pensions enjoyed by NHS staff. In the final months of 2019, over 100 Sodexo workers at St. Mary's joined UVW. In total 10 days of strike action took place from late October to late November, then plans to strike in December were cancelled as Tom Orchard, CEO of Imperial NHS Trust, committed to negotiations to be concluded in January 2020. As Sodexo's contract was coming to an end, and with UVW threatening an \\"all-out\\" indefinite strike, it was announced at the end of January that over 1,000 Sodexo workers in five hospitals would be in-housed as NHS employees from April 2020.  Ark Globe Academy  The Ark Globe Academy in Southwark, London outsourced its maintenance operations to Ridge Crest Cleaning, who paid the cleaners the minimum wage (£8.72) with no occupational sick pay. Repeated instances of unpaid work led to a spontaneous walkout on June 4th and 5th 2020, after which Ridge Crest paid all outstanding wages. Other demands included the provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in the face of Covid-19, and audio was then recorded from a telephone call where Emma Nabola, manager at Ridge Crest, repeatedly implied that PPE and improved pay would be contingent upon the cleaners ceasing their union activities. Simon Wrenn, managing director at Ridge Crest, announced in a letter dated July 16th that from the beginning of September term, cleaners would be paid the London Living Wage of £10.75 and sick pay in parity with Ark Globe Academy staff. UVW then confirmed plans to file a collective tribunal claim against Ridge Crest for trade union victimisation.  Harrods  Over 450 kitchen and waiting staff at the 16 restaurants and cafes within Harrods were being kept in the dark about the total proceeds of a discretionary 12.5% service charge added to bills. They received only an unspecified percentage of the total, which while not rare in the hospitality industry, was particularly controversial given Harrods' profitability and the wealth of its Qatari owners. It was reported that Harrods management had told staff in a meeting that 50% of the total was retained by the company as revenue, though many believed the true figure to be as high as 75%, which would have resulted in each employee losing out on £5,000 per year. During early January sales in 2017, a contingent organised by UVW including Harrods employees staged a surprise protest and roadblock along the Brompton Road storefront. A large inflatable cube read \\"Stop Stealing Our Tips\\" while a red flare was lit, entrances were locked, two arrests were made, and more than two dozen police frustrated the protestors for several hours. Harrods announced on the 20th of January that \\"an improved tronc system\\" would be introduced to guarantee that 100% of service charges go to employees.  The Daily Mail Group  In 2018, the Northcliffe House offices of the Daily Mail Group (DMG) were being cleaned by migrants from the Caribbean, Africa and Latin America on the minimum wage (£7.50). Mitie, the contractor employing the cleaners, allegedly threatened the cleaners not to strike, and would not confirm whether they had initiated a \\"redundancy process for its Northcliffe House cleaners as recently as February, off the back of demands from DMG to decrease the cost of the contract\\". A Change.org petition in support of the cleaners' demand for the London Living Wage attracted over 100,000 signatures. Refusing to voluntarily recognise UVW as the cleaners' trade union, and facing strikes and protests, DMG issued a statement claiming that Mitie had \\"some time ago\\" approved pay increases for the cleaners. Mitie confirmed that \\"our teams working at DMG ... have been informed of a pay increase to at least, and in some cases, beyond the London Living Wage.\\"  University of Greenwich  Cafe workers serving the main lobby of Greenwich university joined UVW complaining of low pay, overworking and insufficient sick pay. They were all employees of Baxterstorey, which had been contracted to run the cafeteria. One chef working 80 hours a week had collapsed shortly after a typical day in intense kitchen heat, but returned to work the next morning because he couldn't afford to skip a single shift. All of his colleagues were to become UVW members, and as they announced their campaign, Baxterstorey immediately raised their pay by 50p to £9.75 an hour. Demanding the full London Living Wage of £10.55 as well as improved sick pay and annual leave, the workers went on strike for four days in October 2019. Protests interrupted the annual graduation ceremony and a top-level university board meeting, calling on students and staff to boycott the cafeteria. With more strikes and protests planned, it was announced in early January 2020 that all outsourced cafe workers, cleaners and security guards at the university would receive the London Living Wage, in addition to the same sick pay and annual leave as equivalent in-house staff.  The Royal Parks  Around 50 attendants who maintain the seven Royal Parks in central London, mostly from Ghana, Nigeria and Sierra Leone were being paid the minimum wage (£8.21) by their employer, Vinci Facilities. After two strike days in October 2019 and threats of further strikes, the board of Royal Parks agreed to raise wages of Vinci staff to the London Living Wage of £10.75 backdated to November 1st, 2019. However, disparities remained in relation to Royal Parks in-house staff's sick pay and entitlements to annual leave, pension, overtime, on-call allowance, redundancy pay and maternity pay. 15 of the attendants have filed a claim of \\"indirect race discrimination\\" against Royal Parks at the Central London Employment Tribunal. It will be a test case to \\"force employers to think more carefully before they operate a two-tier system which disadvantages migrant labour,\\" while also claiming damages, back pay and pension contributions valued at £750,000.  Topshop  Susana Benavides, a Latin American cleaner employed by Britannia Services Group to clean Topshop's flagship store on London's Oxford Street, was represented for several years by UVW in her fight for dignified treatment and the London Living Wage. She had suffered depression resulting from an ongoing series of bullying incidents. In May 2016, two hundred protestors were joined by Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell MP in a show of solidarity for Susana, and hundreds of leaflets were placed in the pockets of clothing items. An online petition supporting Susana attracted over 35,000 signatures. She and her colleague Carolina were suspended and then sacked. A 2019 ruling secured by Cloisters barrister Akua Reindorf in Susana's successful claim against Britannia found it to be clear “beyond any argument” that Susana was dismissed for engaging in legitimate trade union activities.  Sotheby's  Cleaners and porters at Sotheby's New Bond Street auction house were employed by Contract Cleaning and Maintenance (London) Limited (CCML), who conceded several demands after UVW initiated a formal dispute and 24 MPs signed an Early Day Motion condemning a litany of \\"poor employment practices\\". Sotheby's then terminated their contract with CCML and brought in Servest, taking UVW's dispute back to square one. A surprise protest on the 1st of July 2015 sought to disrupt a major auction night including contemporary art by Andy Warhol and Francis Bacon. Four of the workers involved were denied access the following morning, and suspended indefinitely, after CCTV allegedly captured protestors spraying water pistols at clients. Two were later reinstated while the other two were dismissed. Sotheby's Battersea classic car auction in September was disrupted by another UVW protest. In February 2016 it was announced that Sotheby's and Servest had reached an agreement to pay all outsourced workers the London Living Wage and improved sick pay.  Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea  Cleaners working for Kensington and Chelsea council, principally at the town hall, were employed by Amey via a £150m 10-year \\"Tri-borough\\" services contract. Amey paid them the minimum wage of £7.83 per hour, and provided no sick pay beyond the statutory minimum, which paid nothing for the first three days of absence, and only a heavily reduced wage thereafter. In May 2018 a group of cleaners represented by UVW demanded the London Living Wage (LLW) of £10.20 per hour, and in August coordinated a joint strike with cleaners at the Ministry of Justice, supported by the then MP for Kensington, Emma Dent-Coad. On the first of three planned strike days, RBKC issued two mixed messages within a few hours, the first apparently committing to bringing the cleaners in-house, and the second merely promising a review of Amey's contract. The striking cleaners burst into a council meeting later that afternoon, securing an agreement from council members to engage with cleaners on the picket line the following morning. A statement by the council's chief executive Barry Quirk the following day confirmed that \\"all options\\" were being considered in order to deliver the cleaners' wage demands, including ending Amey's contract and bringing the cleaners in-house. In September, the council fully committed to paying the LLW as of January 2019, with council leader Elizabeth Campbell further promising to try and secure backdated payment of the LLW from October 2018 onwards.  Orion Waste Management  Peruvian employees at Orion's industrial recycling plant in East London walked off the job in March 2018. They had been sorting construction waste in unsafe and dusty conditions, with insufficient personal protection and a lack of basic facilities. Along with UVW staff and supporters, they confronted the general manager and laid out their demands, which included: the London Living Wage, contractual sick pay, slower working, new face masks, soap, toilet paper, a shower room, and a decent supply of gloves, uniforms and hard hats. Many of the requested items were ordered the same day, and the striking workers were promised full pay until they resumed work, as well as board-level consideration of wage and contractual demands.  100 Wood Street  The 100 Wood Street offices in the City of London, designed by Norman Foster, were cleaned by Latin American migrants employed by Thames Cleaning & Support Services. Demanding a raise to the London Living Wage, and the reinstatement of several colleagues after a heavy cost-cutting restructure in early 2016, a group of cleaners commenced an \\"indefinite strike\\" and daily picket. After 52 days, a record for any strike in the City of London, a confidential agreement was reached that apparently secured the Living Wage and a promise to \\"resolve other issues\\". == Ideology and supporters == UVW's early growth has been led by staff and volunteers who have spent time in Latin America and are generally sympathetic towards socialist governments and movements. In particular, there is a strong influence of anarcho-syndicalist ideas and a drive to make the union more inclusive and member-led. Over a dozen mostly Labour MPs have actively supported UVW campaigns. > \\"Externally, UVW operates as part of a growing ecosystem of groups and > organisations on the wider autonomous left.

The cemetery covers eight acres and is owned and maintained by Mid Devon Council. ==History== Tiverton Cemetery opened in 1855 on a three-acre site following a rapid growth in population nationally and locally during the early Victorian era. The first burial occurred on 5 June 1855 and was of five-year-old Charles Harris from the Union Workhouse, the first of eight interments that week. In its early months the cemetery was used exclusively for burying the poor because those who could afford to preferred to be buried at St. Peter's Church in Tiverton. In December 1855 the first grave to be purchased was bought by George Askew, a local Tailor and Draper who had a triple wide vault built. By the 1860s graves were being bought by Tiverton's wealthier families and it was at this time that some of the cemetery's grandest monuments were built, at least one of which, that of William Rudall Haydon (c.1845 – 1897) and other members of his family, is a Grade II listed monument.History of Tiverton Cemetery - Mid Devon Council websiteMonument to W R Hayden in Tiverton Cemetery - English Heritage Listed Building database Grade II listed By the middle of the 1880s the original cemetery was filling up and an adjoining plot of another three acres was purchased and opened in 1895. When this too was filled, burials moved to the 'new' cemetery which was laid out on former allotments in 1954. This has resulted in the old and new sections being divided by a narrow road which is now a private drive. The 'new' cemetery was extended in the 1980s to the east and later again into the last of the allotments. The last extension to the cemetery opened in 2013 and was consecrated by Nick McKinnel, the Bishop of Crediton.'Tiverton Cemetery – consecration of a new burial ground' - 25 November 2013 The cemetery originally had two small chapels and the surviving chapel was for Church of England funerals; another chapel for nonconformist funerals stood a hundred yards to the north but this was demolished in the late 1970s.

Introduced for the 2018 edition, time bonuses were awarded to the first three finishers on all stages except for the time trials: the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for the second and third riders respectively. Bonus seconds were also awarded to the first three riders at intermediate sprints; three seconds for the winner of the sprint, two seconds for the rider in second and one second for the rider in third. The leader of the general classification received a yellow jersey. This classification was considered the most important of the 2018 Tour of the Basque Country, and the winner of the classification was considered the winner of the race. Additionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a green jersey, a change from white in 2017. In the points classification, cyclists received points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage.

Each of the twenty-three climbs were categorised as either first, second, or third-category, with more points available for the more difficult, higher- categorised climbs. For first-category climbs, the top six riders earned points; on second-category climbs, four riders won points; on third-category climbs, only the top three riders earned points. The leadership of the mountains classification was marked by a red jersey with white polka-dots. Instead of the sprints classification, as it was in 2017, the fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, marked by a light blue jersey. Only riders born after 1 January 1993 were eligible; the young rider best placed in the general classification was the leader of the young rider classification. There was also a classification for teams, in which the times of the best three cyclists in a team on each stage were added together; the leading team at the end of the race was the team with the lowest cumulative time. {   center; font-size:smaller;\\" - !style=\\"width:1%;\\" Stage !style=\\"width:16.5%;\\" Winner !efefef; width:16.5%;\\" General classification 25px !efefef; width:16.5%;\\" Points classification 25px !efefef; width:16.5%;\\" Mountains classification 25px !efefef; width:16.5%;\\" Young rider classification 25px !efefef; width:16.5%;\\" Teams classification -  1  Julian Alaphilippe style=\\"background-color:yellow;\\" rowspan=\\"3\\" Julian Alaphilippe style=\\"background:lightgreen;\\" rowspan=\\"4\\" Julian Alaphilippe style=\\"background-color:salmon;\\" Jonathan Lastra style=\\"background- color:lightblue;\\" rowspan=\\"4\\" Enric Mas style=\\"background:orange;\\" rowspan=\\"4\\" -  2  Julian Alaphilippe style=\\"background-color:salmon;\\" Mark Padun -  3  Jay McCarthy style=\\"background-color:salmon;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Thomas De Gendt -  4  Primož Roglič style=\\"background- color:yellow;\\" rowspan=3 Primož Roglič -  5  Omar Fraile style=\\"background:lightgreen;\\" rowspan=2 Primož Roglič style=\\"background- color:salmon;\\" Mark Padun style=\\"background-color:lightblue;\\" Jack Haig style=\\"background:orange;\\" -  6  Enric Mas style=\\"background- color:salmon;\\" Carlos Verona style=\\"background-color:lightblue;\\" Enric Mas style=\\"background:orange;\\" - !colspan=2 Final !style=\\"background- color:gold;\\" Primož Roglič !style=\\"background:limegreen;\\" Primož Roglič !style=\\"background-color:red;\\" Carlos Verona !style=\\"background- color:skyblue;\\" Enric Mas !FF8C00;\\" } ==References== Sources * ==External links== * 2018 Category:2018 UCI World Tour Category:2018 in Spanish road cycling Category:April 2018 sports events in Europe Category:April 2018 events in Spain Category:2018 in the Basque Country (autonomous community) ","title":"2018 Tour of the Basque Country"},{"id":"56103871","text":"Frederick Adams was a British boxer.

The competition opposes every two years a European team and a team representing Asia/Pacific, and the venue alternates between courses in Europe and Asia/Pacific. The Trophy is named after Patsy Hankins (1945–2015), one of the most respected golf administrators New Zealand has produced. The first competition took place in 2016 at Vidago Palace Golf Course, Portugal. ==Format== The Patsy Hankins Trophy involves various match play competitions between players selected from two teams of twelve representing Europe and Asia-Pacific. It takes place over three days, with a total of 32 matches being played, all matches being over 18 holes. The first two days comprise five foursomes matches and five four-ball matches. On the final day, there are 12 singles matches, when all twelve players compete. The winner of each match scores a point for his team, with a half point each for any match that is tied after the 18 holes. The winning team is determined by cumulative total points. In the event of a tie (16 points each) the Patsy Hankins Trophy is retained by the previous holder. A foursomes match is a competition between two teams of two golfers. On a particular hole the golfers on the same team take alternate shots playing the same ball. One team member tees off on all the odd-numbered holes, and the other on all the even-numbered holes. Each hole is won by the team that completes the hole in the fewest shots. A fourball match is also a competition between two teams of two golfers, but all four golfers play their own ball throughout the round rather than alternating shots. The better score of the two golfers in a team determines the team's score on a particular hole; the score of the other member of the team is not counted. Each hole is won by the team whose individual golfer has the lowest score. A singles match is a standard match play competition between two golfers. { center;\\" ! rowspan=2  Year !! colspan=2  Day 1 !! colspan=2  Day 2 !! colspan=2 rowspan=2  Day 3 !! rowspan=2  Total points - !

While rights can be suspended, there is no mechanism to expel a member. The procedure is covered by TEU Article 7. It would be enacted where the EU identifies a member persistently breaching the EU's founding values (respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities), as outlined in TEU Article 2. The European Council can vote to suspend any rights of membership, such as voting and representation as outlined above. Identifying the breach requires unanimity (excluding the state concerned), but sanctions require only a qualified majority.Suspension clause, Europa glossary, accessed 1 June 2010 The Council acting by majority may alter or lift such sanctions. The state in question would still be bound by the obligations of the treaties. ==Background== Following the fall of the Berlin Wall the EU began to consider enlargement to the former Eastern Bloc states. With concerns over the EU's ability to intervene where its core principles and values were violated, there was a desire to introduce some mechanism before enlargement to those states took place. This came to be via the Treaty of Amsterdam which allowed the suspension of rights of a member state which breached the EU's values under Article 2.Article 7 sanctions: a legal expert explains the EU’s ‘nuclear option, the conversation 28 July 2017 In early 2000, Austria formed a government which included the right-wing populist Freedom Party. Invoking Article 7 was deemed excessive so other member states threatened to cut off diplomatic contacts instead. This event led to a desire for an intermediate step to provide a warning sign without full suspension.EU can still block Hungary’s veto on Polish sanctions Politico 11 January 2016EU takes unprecedented step against Poland over rule of law Euractiv 4 January 2016 The Treaty of Nice provided this (in Article 7.1) whereby the Council, acting by majority, may identify a potential breach and make recommendations to the state to rectify it before action is taken against it as outlined above. In 2014 the European Commission introduced a three step mechanism to identify \\"systemic threats\\" to EU values. The mechanism must be complete before Article 7 is discussed.What is Article 7? Politico 13 January 2016 ==Process== Article 7.1: The mechanism begins with a proposal to find a \\"Clear Risk of Serious Breach\\" of EU values either by the Commission, the Parliament or one-third of member states. This is then approved by a two-thirds majority in Parliament. The accused country is then called to answer to the Council, which may then issue recommendations and vote by four-fifths to identify a breach. Article 7.2: In the event of a \\"serious and persistent breach\\" (i.e. the country does not heed the Council's guidance) then the Commission or one- third of countries, approved by a two-thirds majority in Parliament, calls the country to answer to the European Council again. The European Council must then decide unanimously to proceed to Article 7.3. Article 7.3: Once the European Council has unanimously decided that the breach is still occurring, the Council then votes by qualified majority to suspend rights of the accused country, including voting rights within the Council, until all duties are fulfilled. ==Usage== In its early history, from about 2000 to 2012, the possibility of activating Article 7 was debated but official recommendations were not made. Events for which activation of Article 7 was debated include the aforementioned Austrian coalition with the far right in 2000, the French government expulsion of thousands of Roma in 2009 and a political struggle in Romania between Traian Băsescu and Victor Ponta in 2012. Use against Hungary In June 2015, the European Parliament asked the Commission to present a proposal for starting the mechanism against Hungary over rule of law concerns in the country; but in October voted down a similar proposal to begin procedures against Hungary over its treatment of migrants. At the same time, a European Citizens' Initiative called for the start of Article 7 mechanisms against Hungary.Commission registers call for EU sanctions on Hungary, EU Observer 30 November 2016 On 12 September 2018, the European Parliament voted for action against Hungary, alleging breaches of core EU values.European Parliament to trigger article 7 procedure against a member stateThe European Parliament has voted to pursue unprecedented disciplinary action against Hungary UK Conservative MEPs supported the right wing Hungarian leader, Viktor Orbán, against a motion to censure him in the European Parliament. Pablo Casado, leader of Spain's People's Party directly ordered the PP members of the European Parliament to abstain in the voting of the Sargentini report calling for triggering Article 7 proceedings against the Hungarian government of Viktor Orbán. On 30 March 2020, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, Parliament approved a bill to make the state of emergency indefinite and grant the ability for Prime Minister Orbán to rule by decree. The bill also makes the deliberate distribution of \\"misleading information that obstructs responses to the pandemic\\" punishable by up to five years in prison. The bill faced opposition for containing indefinite restrictions on these powers, as well as concerns over the possibility that the \\"fake news\\" prohibition in the bill could be abused for censorship of independent media outlets. As a result, European Parliament group leaders raised concerns, in a meeting of the Conference of Presidents, about the emergency measures and a majority of groups asked Parliamentary President David Sassoli to relay their concerns in a letter to the Commission and to consider activating the Article 7 procedure. The rule by decree was later voted out by the Hungarian parliament. Use against Poland From the end of 2015, the Polish government became subject to international criticism over its media and judiciary changes and the European Commission began action against Poland in January 2016. On 20 December 2017, the European Commission triggered Article 7 for the first time in relation to Polish judicial reforms because, in the view of the Commission, they remove the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary. \\"After two years, the Commission can only conclude that there is now a clear risk of a serious breach of the rule of law,\\" Vice President Frans Timmermans added. Any action to deprive Poland of its voting rights would require a unanimous vote of its fellow member states. , Hungary would be expected to exercise its veto in Poland's favour. ==Expulsion== While a state can be suspended, there is no provision to expel a member state outright. The idea appeared in the drafting of the European Constitution and the Lisbon Treaty but failed to be included. There are a number of considerations which make such a provision impractical. Firstly, a member state leaving would require amendments to the treaties, and amendments require unanimity. Unanimity would be impossible to achieve if the state did not want to leave of its own free will. Secondly it is legally complicated, particularly with all the rights and privileges being withdrawn for both sides that would not be resolved by an orderly and voluntary withdrawal. Third, the concept of expulsion goes against the spirit of the treaties. Contrary to expulsion, most available sanctions are conciliatory, not punitive; they do not punish a state for failing to live up to fellow states' demands, but encourage a state to fulfill its treaty obligations.Athanassiou, Phoebus (December 2009) Withdrawal and Expulsion from the EU and EMU, Some Reflections (PDF), European Central Bank.

The Islamic Society sought to establish a closer burial place than Enfield, Connecticut. After a complicated process, with much back and forth between the Islamic Society and town officials, the necessary permit was issued over a year later. ==Proceedings== At the initial hearings, some residents made it clear that they did not want this cemetery in their town with concerns that included noise, traffic and well water contamination issues. The comments of some of the small town's residents raised concerns of religious bigotry. At the meeting, all the speakers in support of the Islamic Society were booed, and members of the public variously denounced the need to bury Muslim dead locally compared to the deaths of American soldiers fighting radical Islamic terrorist groups overseas, called the existing cemetery a \\"pigsty\\", and called the society's attempt to build a cemetery a \\"crusade\\" (both offensive given Islam's consideration of pigs as ritually unclean, and the history of Christian Crusades conquering parts of the Middle East). Though Muslim tradition is to bury without a coffin, in response to concerns about water quality the Islamic Society promised to use vaults. A series of test pits dug by the applicant, with the Dudley Board of Health Inspector present, showed that the average water table was 24\\" below the grade of the ground, with many spots having ground water only 18\\" from the surface.http://a.disquscdn.com/uploads/mediaembed/images/3782/9463/original.jpghttp://a.disquscdn.com/uploads/mediaembed/images/3782/9461/original.jpg The public hearing of the Zoning Board of Appeals reviewed the status of the land as an agricultural protected parcel protected under MGL Chapter 61A. At a town meeting held on May 23, 2016, action was postponed authorizing the board of selectmen to exercise the Town's first right of refusal in order to proceed to purchase the agricultural piece of land. When the Zoning Board of Appeals met on June 2, 2016, they asked the Islamic Society of Worcester if they were presenting a revised 5 Acre cemetery plan which they had read about in the newspapers the week before. The Islamic Society of Worcester stated there was no revised plan and they expected the Zoning Board of Appeals to vote on their original proposal for 12,000+ grave sites. The Zoning Board of Appeals then scheduled a full vote for June 9, 2016, at which it denied the permit on the grounds the land was under Chapter 61A conservation protection and the town of Dudley thus had the right of first refusal to purchase the land. The board claimed that this meant the Islamic Society of Worcester lacked the proper legal standing to submit the cemetery plan until after the town's right of refusal had been extinguished. The society complained that it could not complete the purchase of the land and gain the standing the board required of it until the zoning approval had been granted, because its purchase agreement was contingent upon that action, putting the society in a Catch-22 situation. The denial prompted a federal investigation by the U.S Attorney into potential religious discrimination, and a warning letter from the Massachusetts Attorney General. The Massachusetts chapter of the ACLU filed a lawsuit in state land court, claiming the denial violated freedom of religion provisions in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, the Federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, and the state Dover Amendment (which exempts certain religious organizations from zoning regulations). It also claimed the Chapter 61A protection was not applicable to conversion to cemetery use. The town Attorney argued that the Muslim cemetery, unlike Christian cemeteries, was not a religious land use due to differences between where Muslim and Christian burial rituals are held. Both sides came to an agreement in December 2016 with the zoning board granting the permit for the cemetery on March 3, 2017. Burials will be restricted to for the first 10-years. The permit requires a buffer zones of vegetation between the burials and the neighboring property in accordance with the agreement. After winning this approval (though not final Board of Health approval) and affirming its rights, the Islamic Society dropped its plans to build a cemetery in Dudley, and instead moved forward with plans to bury Muslim dead in a city-owned cemetery in Worcester, partly due to lower cost and parly because the city was more welcoming. The U.S. Attorney announced on April 12, 2017, that it was closing the investigation whether town officials had violated federal civil rights law that prohibits religious discrimination. ==References== Category:Islam in Massachusetts Category:Dudley, Massachusetts Category:Muslim cemeteries Category:Cemeteries in Worcester County, Massachusetts Category:2016 controversies in the United States Category:2016 in Islam Category:2016 in Massachusetts ","title":"Dudley, Massachusetts cemetery controversy"},{"id":"56104158","text":"İzmirspor is an underground station on the Fahrettin Altay—Evka 3 Line of the İzmir Metro in Hatay, Konak.

Forming a rough C shape around the west part of Walnut Hill Park, the area was developed in the late 19th century as one of its premier upper-class neighborhoods, home to business and civic leaders, with a fine array of late 19th and early 20th century architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. ==Description and history== New Britain experienced an economic boom in the years after the American Civil War, driven by innovation and manufacturing of building hardware and similar goods. Walnut Hill Park was laid out in 1870, and the city received landscape design guidance from Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux on the layout of the park and the surrounding areas to the northwest, west, and south. Much of this land was owned by Henry Russell, chairman of the park commission, who platted out streets roughly parallel to the park boundaries and sold off lots for residential development between 1884 and 1908. This resulted in the present layout of roads running northeast-to- southwest (Lincoln, Forest, and Vine Streets) and east-west (Hart Street) that form the core of the historic district. The houses that were built in this area are predominantly in the restrained styles of the early 20th century, including the Colonial Revival, American Foursquare, and Tudor Revival. They are typically set on handsome lots with generous setbacks, on tree-lined streets. The local architectural firm of Davis and Brooks designed a significant number of these houses, including a fine Shingle style house on Vine Street that eventually became the home of architect William Brooks. Many homes were built for executives of the Stanley Works, New Britain's leading hardware manufacturer. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford County, Connecticut ==References== Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Shingle Style architecture in Connecticut Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Connecticut Category:Tudor Revival architecture in the United States Category:New Britain, Connecticut ","title":"West End Historic District (New Britain, Connecticut)"},{"id":"56104335","text":"Mischa Kamp (born in Rotterdam on 7 August 1970) is a Dutch film director best known for the 2014 TV film Jongens (English title Boys). ==Career== In 1989, Kamp studied communications science at the New School for Information Services in Amsterdam.

Twenty of those killed were trapped in a sauna on the second floor of the building, which also housed a variety of other commercial establishments including a gym, a golf practice facility, and a number of restaurants. Around 20 people were rescued from the roof. Preliminary reports indicated that victims were incapacitated by toxic smoke, which was produced so quickly that they were unable to evacuate; smoke inhalation was also the cause of many injuries. Rescue operations were delayed due to the continued presence of toxic gas and exceptionally thick smoke. ==Summary== On December 21, 2017, at 15:53 (KST), a vehicle in Duson Sporium caught on fire from electric heating wires being installed in the first-floor ceiling of the parking lot, in turn setting the eight-story building itself on fire. Jecheon Fire Department arrived at 16:00 (KST), but were unable to approach because of the explosion risk of the vehicle and LP gas tank on the first floor. The accident killed 29 people and injured 36 people. Cause The crime lab concluded that the fire was started by a spark in the heating wires that were being installed in the ceiling pipes on the first floor parking lot. The ceiling structures then collapsed on a parked vehicle, further expanding the fire to other parked vehicles. In addition, the emergency exit on the second floor, where a women's sauna was located, was being used as a warehouse. Moreover, there were no employees to help evacuate and the automatic door at the main entrance was broken, making it harder for victims to escape and causing more casualties. Civilian response The building owner, Lee, tried to put out the fire with a fire extinguisher but failed, and entered the building to evacuate people. However, for fear that there would be naked women in the sauna, Lee refused to go inside and instead opted to warn people to evacuate by yelling outside the door. A private ladder truck rescued people during the delay of the firefighting trucks' ladder installation. In addition, an elderly man helped rescue 15 people at the scene, but was later taken to the hospital. Aftermath On December 25, 2017, the police raided the homes of both the owner of the building and the manager to collect evidence that would help charge them with manslaughter caused by professional negligence and violation of the fire law. The police plan to seek arrest warrants for both. ==Reactions== President of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, voiced \\"deep sorrow\\", along with the Prime Minister of South Korea, Lee Nak-yeon, vowed to expedite the dispatching of rescue services to the location. Organizers of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang announced that a scheduled visit by the Olympic torch relay to Jecheon would be cancelled, and the route revised, due to the incident. ==Controversy and criticism== Some point out that the Jecheon fire department failed to properly deal with the fire. Victims escaped through the exit but the firemen did not approach the exit. In addition, no attempts were made to enter through the second floor's window and the fire engine's ladder was not installed properly. Some also criticized the lack of firefighting equipment and manpower, caused by the local government's negligence, which contributed to the disaster. The firefighters believed that most of the victims had inhaled toxic gases and died early in the fire, however, a controversy arose when a family member claimed that they receive a phone call from the victim four hours after the fire broke out. The bereaved families criticized the fire department for having missed the emergency rescue golden time. == References == Category:2017 fires Category:2017 disasters in South Korea 2017 fire Category:Building and structure fires in South Korea Jecheon fire Category:Disasters in sports venues ","title":"2017 Jecheon fire"},{"id":"56104432","text":"Naum Alexandrovich Babaev (, IPA: nɐ′um ɐlʲɪk′sandrɐvitɕ bɐ′baʲef) is a Russian entrepreneur, the founder of the Russian dairy company Rusmolco, a major raw milk producer, and the co-founder and joint owner of DAMATÉ group, a large agricultural holding specialising in poultry farming, dairy farming, and milk processing. == Education and career == Naum Babaev was born in Kislovodsk, Stavropol Krai on March 17, 1977, into the family of Rosa Michailovna and Alexander Naumovich Babaev. Аfter finishing high school in 1994, Naum entered the Financial Academy under the Government of the Russian Federation and graduated in 1999. Being a college undergraduate, he started off as a financial analyst at Cherkizovsky, a major Russian meat processing plant, which was subsequently reorganized into a JSC Group Cherkizovo, Russia's largest producer of meat products. In 2000, Babaev took over as a head of the poultry production business unit in the company's agro-industrial complex and was managing it until 2005, when, due to the merger of the company's agro-industrial and meat processing units, a larger facility was formed, namely CHERKIZOVO Group; Naum was appointed the company's Strategy and Development Director. According to Vedomosti, the prominent Russian business daily, his achievements at the position were fully recognized with CHERKIZOVO's IPO launch in 2006. At the beginning of 2007, Babaev resigned to proceed on his own. Cherkizovo's official statement marked his contribution to the Group. == Business == Rusmolco was established in October 2007, when Babaev started two mega dairy farms, from the ground up in Penza Oblast about 700 km south-east of Moscow. By 2011 Rusmolco had become a major regional raw milk producer, doubling the average milk productivity in Russia at 9270 kg per cow against the average 4500 kg, according to the data of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation. \\"Babayev has thrived on importing foreign best practices to Russian farms\\", said The Moscow Times. At the beginning of 2012, Rusmolco embarked on a strategic cooperation with a Singapore company Olam International, a leading agri-business, operating in 70 countries. OLAM invested $75 million in the deal, thereby attaining 75% of Rusmolco assets. The partners announced their intention to form a large-scale dairy enterprise with $400 million investment capital (the initial 20-thousand milking herd was meant to reach up to 50 thousand heads in the short run). Thus, Russia's agriculture secured a hefty chunk of investment, labeled in the mass media as being \\"unprecedented\\". In 2012, by a year-end estimation of the Institute for the Agricultural Market Studies, Rusmolco secured the fourth place among the five largest raw milk producers in the Russian Federation. In 2011, shortly after the Olam International deal, Babaev undertook the effort to consolidate the leftover assets (namely, the turkey production plant, the PENZENSKY dairy complex as well as a veal-and-milk production facility in Penza and Tyumen regions, and 25K hectares of agricultural land. The effort had been a success, resulting in the launch of the agro-industrial holding company Damaté Group. The Group's priority was turkey meat production. At the time, turkey was not popular with the Russians; the average consumption per capita wobbled at 0, 8-1,0 kg, with the overall production hardly totaling 120-150 thousand tons per year. By the end of 2016, Damaté became the largest turkey producing company in Russia. According to the Agrifood Strategies data, in 2016, the company produced 60,800 tons of turkey in carcass weight. The Damaté leadership had also been confirmed by Rosptitsesoyuz, the Russian Union of Poultry Producers. According to Vedomosti, \\"In the 10 years' span, the entrepreneur Naum Babaev made a profound career leap, from the top-manager of a major agro-holding to the owner of the largest turkey producer in Russia\\". At the end of 2016, Damaté had been ranked among the top-100 largest meat producers in this country. In 2012, Babaev acquired the dairy product plant Penzensky (MOLCOM), the largest processor of milk in Penza region with a cheese factory in Belinsky town. At the end of 2013, Damaté, in partnership with food group Danone, launched a high-powered production of the premium quality milk in Tyumen region, Western Siberia. At the beginning of 2017, Tyumen delivered its first tons of milk to Danone production facilities Babaev owns Damaté on a par with the holding's CEO Rashid Khairov. They had met in 1998, long before the Damaté endeavor. According to Vedomosti, in their current partnership, Babaev is implementing the strategic management of the firm, while Khairov is being responsible for the day-to-day management. == Personal life == Naum Babaev is married to Anna, a photographer; the family is raising three children, Alexander (2006), Mikhail (2009), and Elizaveta (2013). == References == Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:People from Kislovodsk Category:Russian businesspeople Category:Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation alumni ","title":"Naum Babaev"},{"id":"56104444","text":"296x296px The International Pole Sports Federation (IPSF) is a not-for-profit global organization that has been recognized as an Observer Member by the Global Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF) as the international governing body for pole sports. The IPSF is the umbrella organization for national pole federations and hosts the annual World Pole Championships. == Background and history == Pole sports involves the use of metal poles where athletes engage in acrobatic and artistic movements and tricks choreographed to music. In the 1990s and 2000s, pole dance developed into a fitness activity. In 2009, Katie Coates and Tim Trautman formed the IPSF to promote pole as a sport. They felt that as pole dance was developing as a sport, it was spread out in local competitions with irregular standards, and they wanted to bring structure and fair play to further its development and professionalization. The IPSF is governed by an executive committee. The IPSF has created rules and regulations to govern pole sports, such as a code of points, policies regarding health and safety, and certification for sports officials. National federations work with the IPSF on implementing these standards in national pole sports competitions. National pole sports federations associated with the IPSF now exist in multiple continents, from Africa to Asia, and other federations are in the process of creating a structured plan to become endorsed by the IPSF. The United States, for example, has a national federation under the IPSF called the American Pole League. National federations send their top competitors to the World Pole Championships hosted by the IPSF. The IPSF is one of the signatories of the World Anti-Doping Code through the World Anti-Doping Agency (a code which arose through the impetus of the International Olympic Committee (IOC)). In 2012, the IPSF began the annual World Pole Championships where men, women, and youth athletes compete. In 2017, 229 athletes from 36 countries participated. Viewers could view the competition live online via livestream. The IPSF has partnered with SolidSport to produce and promote viewership of the championships. The IPSF has met with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and has stated that one of its goals is to make pole sports an Olympic sport. Their efforts to do so have generated international media attention for pole sports, the IPSF and its founders. Most recently, the IPSF applied to SportAccord (now GAISF) in 2015, and was formally granted observer status by GAISF in 2017. The media has questioned the purpose of the IPSF and whether it can be a professional sport, especially for youth athletes; the media has also reported on IPSF efforts to standardize the sport, the athleticism required within the championships the IPSF organizes, and IPSF inclusion of a range of age categories, from child athletes to masters athletes in championships. Some pole dancers are concerned that the IPSF's efforts and professionalization will promote pole sports over other forms of pole dance, for example making poling more athletic, standardized, and trick heavy to the neglect of artistry. However, other pole dancers believe that it would bring greater international recognition to the sport, potentially prompting greater funding and support for national federations and more participation from youth. Some of the IPSF's standards are designed to separate pole sports from gymnastics. According to the IPSF, the organization signed a three-way agreement with GAISF and FIG (the Federation of International Gymnastics) specifying conditions whereby FIG would support the IPSF's entry into GAISF. == Disciplines == In addition to pole sports, the IPSF has created codes and standards for competitions in the disciplines of ultra pole, artistic pole, and para pole. Ultra pole involves rounds of trick battles between participants. Artistic pole puts more emphasis on artistic elements compared to pole sports. Para pole \\"has been developed in line with Paralympic criteria to now include three categories, muscle, limb and sight deficiency.\\" == References == Category:Pole sports Category:International sports organizations Category:Sports organizations established in 2009 ","title":"International Pole Sports Federation"},{"id":"56104449","text":"John Barradell is the Town Clerk of London and Chief Executive of the Corporation of the City of London.

It served as a branch of Amiri Baraka’s Congress of African People (CAP) until 1974, when The East pulled out of CAP due to CAP's ideological shift towards increased Marxism. Originally located at 10 Claver Place in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, The East served as a hive of many activities. It provided day care for children and evening classes for adults, and served as home for Black News, a bookstore, restaurant, catering service, food co-op, and a bi-weekly national Black nationalist news publication. The East functioned as home to an independent African-centered school named Uhuru Sasa Shule (whose name translates to \\"Freedom Now\\" in Kiswahili, that emerged in response to the 1968 Ocean-Hill Brownsville school crisis.Rickford, Russell. \\"“Our Nation Becoming”: Uhuru Sasa Shule and the Dual Power function of “Black Independent Institutions” in the Black Power Era.\\" Dartmouth College: Avery Center Black Power Conference, 2012.

It hosted performers including the Last Poets, Freddie Hubbard, Betty Carter, McCoy Tyner, Max Roach, Sun Ra, Lee Morgan, and Roy Ayers. Its name was included in the album title of Pharoah Sanders' \\"Live from the East.\\" There were two extensions of The East, one named The Mid-East located in Brownsville, Brooklyn, NY managed by Yusef & Dara Iman and The Far- East managed by John Watusi Branch with Yusef & Kubballah Waliyaya in Queens and, until 1974, hosted jazz, drama, dance, and poetry, as well as evening classes and a Uhuru Sasa preschool.

It normally uses underglaze cobalt blue for the design outline and some parts of the images, and overglaze enamels in red, green, and yellow for the rest of the designs. Parts of the design, and some outlines of the rest, are painted in underglaze blue, and the piece is then glazed and fired. The rest of the design is then added in the overglaze enamels of different colours and the piece fired again at a lower temperature of about 850°C to 900°C.Medley, 204; Pierson, 14–15 It has its origins in the doucai technique. The usual distinction made with doucai, which also combines underglaze blue with overglaze enamels in other colours, is that in wucai only parts of the design include blue, and these cover wider areas, and are often rather freely painted.Medley, 205–207 In doucai the whole design is outlined in the blue, even if parts are overlaid by the enamels and invisible in the finished product. Some parts may also be painted in the blue.Grove; Vandelstein, 175; Nillson on wucai However, this is not true of all pieces classified as doucai, especially from the 18th century onwards. Fragments of incomplete examples, only done in blue, have been excavated from waste tips at the kiln.Sotheby's The next development, Famille verte (康熙五彩, Kangxi wucai, also 素三彩, Susancai), adopted in the Kangxi period (1662–1722), uses green and iron red with other overglaze colours developed from wucai, normally without any use of underglaze blue. In Japan it is pronounced gosai and was initially imported. Kinrande is a form that developed out of this during the time of the Ming dynasty. ==Notes References == * \\"Grove\\", Medley, Margaret, Oxford Art Online, section \\"Ming; Jingdezhen porcelains, Polychome\\" in \\"China, §VIII, 3: Ceramics: Historical development\\" * Medley, Margaret, The Chinese Potter: A Practical History of Chinese Ceramics, 3rd edition, 1989, Phaidon, * Nillson, Jan-Eric, \\"Doucai Chinese porcelain decoration\\", in Chinese porcelain glossary, Gotheborg.com * Pierson, Stacey, From Object to Concept: Global Consumption and the Transformation of Ming Porcelain, 2013, Hong Kong University Press, , 9789888139835, google books * \\"Sotheby's\\": the \\"Meiyintang Chicken Cup\\", Sotheby's Hong Kong, Sale HK0545 Lot: 1, 8 April 2014 * Valenstein, S.

Recently, it has gained attention as a potential anthelmintic drug target due to the fact that parasitic hosts do not synthesize or use this cofactor. Because this cofactor is used in low oxygen environments, many helminth-like organisms have adapted to survive host environments such as the areas within the gastrointestinal tracks. ==Theorized Biosynthesis== Currently the biosynthesis of RQ is still being debated, but there are two main biosynthetic pathways that are being researched. First, is the need for the organism to produce Ubiquinone (UQ) so that the amine group can be added onto the quinone ring. Second, is that RQ can be synthesized without any UQ within the organism by using tryptophan metabolites instead. Figure 1. Proposed biosynthesis of rhodoquinone In the case of the prokaryotic organism P. rubrum, RQ seems to be synthesized by addition of an amine group to a pre- existing UQ; thus UQ needs to be present as a precursor before RQ can be made. Figure 1 uses ‘n’ to represent the number of isoprene units between various organisms. Dimethylallyl diphosphate A and isopentyl diphosphate B come together to form polyisoprenyl diphosphate C. With the addition of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, the product that arises is 3-polyprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid D. The next three steps of synthesis varies between different organisms, but molecule E is made across all organisms and through oxidation, demethyldemethoxyubiquinone (DDMQ) is eventually formed. Rhodoquinone has been theorized to be synthesized from DDMQn, DMQn, DMeQn, and ubiquinone, as shown with the dashed arrows. Recent studies have shown that path D- RQ biosynthesis via UQ, seems to be the most likely route. Figure 2. Alternative proposed biosynthesis for rhodoquinone Research in C. elegans, has shown an alternative path for production of RQ. Even after knocking out all UQ production, RQ is still present within those mutant strains. Based on this data, RQ production is not solely based on UQ-like molecule and instead can be made via tryptophan metabolites. Therefore, the amine group that has been previously proposed to be added in late stages of synthesis is instead always present throughout intermediate stages. With this proposed biosynthesis, the kynurenine pathway still needs to be upregulated, and activity from certain genes like KYNU-1, an enzyme that catalyzes production of 3-Hydroxy-L- Kynurenine to 3-Hydroxy-Anthranilite, needs to be upheld. ==References== ","title":"Rhodoquinone"},{"id":"56104558","text":"McBirney is a surname.

It was published by Voenizdat, the publishing house of the Soviet Ministry of Defense, between 1976 and 1980. == Background == In the early 1930s, an attempt at publishing a projected twelve-volume Soviet Military Encyclopedia was made under the direction of Robert Eideman, the head of the Frunze Military Academy. However, only the first two volumes were published by the People's Commissariat of Defense in 1932 and 1933, due to the execution of Eideman and many of the editorial board during the Great Purge. Due to revolutions in military affairs in the second half of the 20th century, the Soviet Ministry of Defense decided to publish an encyclopedia to summarize developments. == Editions and translations == Beginning in 1976, the eight volumes of the encyclopedia were published by Voenizdat, the publishing house of the Soviet Ministry of Defense. 106,000 copies were printed. After the publication of the initial eight volumes, two smaller editions of the Military Encyclopedic Dictionary () were published in 1983 and 1986 based on the content of the Soviet Military Encyclopedia. The first volume of the second edition, under the general editorship of then-Chief of the General Staff Mikhail Moiseyev, was published by Voenizdat in 1990. The second edition was not completed due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Russian Ministry of Defense published the successor Military Encyclopedia in Eight Volumes () beginning in 1994, including articles on subjects excluded by the Soviet version for ideological reasons, such as those relating to the White movement. An abridged four-volume English translation of the encyclopedia was published by Westview Press in 1993, edited and translated by William C. Green and W. Robert Reeves. == Content == The encyclopedia contains around 11,000 articles on military theory, military history, military technology, and military geography, as well as biographical articles. The eight volumes of the encyclopedia are illustrated with more than 5,500 maps, diagrams, and photographs. According to then-Chief of the General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov, writing in the journal Voyennaya Mysl (Military Thought), the encyclopedia's articles are mostly objective and reliable, but it devotes much of its space to promoting Soviet ideology, making the encyclopedia \\"excessively politicized\\". As a result, it is \\"not without subjectivity in assessing the role and significance of certain military operations and military and political figures\\", reducing the \\"objectivity and scientific value of the articles\\". == Authors == The Soviet Ministry of Defense supervised the writing of the encyclopedia, with contributions from prominent Soviet military leaders and military scientists. Then-Minister of Defense Andrei Grechko chaired the Main Editorial Commission of the encyclopedia for volumes one and eight, and then-Chief of the General Staff Nikolai Ogarkov took over the position after Grechko's death in 1976.

Kuh was the youngest son of six siblings; he also had a younger sister. His father was a Nationalist government official, and later worked for a bank. Ernest Kuh was raised in Shanghai and attended Nanyang Model High School before enrolling at Shanghai Jiao Tong University from 1945 to 1947 for electrical engineering. In December 1947, Kuh escaped the Chinese Civil War, arriving in the United States, where he finished his bachelor's degree at the University of Michigan. He earned his master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Upon graduating from Stanford University with a doctorate in electrical engineering, Kuh worked for Bell Labs until 1956. In 1956, he joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley on the recommendation of Donald Pederson, whom Kuh had met at Bell Labs. Kuh was named chair of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences in 1968, and appointed the dean of the College of Engineering in 1973. Later that year, Kuh returned to China for the first time since he left in 1947, and in his later career, repeatedly traveled to China, Japan, and Taiwan to enhance the teaching of electrical engineering.

It then became Police Regiment Warsaw (Polizei-Regiment Warschau). It was redesignated as the 22nd Police Regiment in mid-1942 before it received the SS title in early 1943. ==Formation and organization== The 4th Police Regiment was redesignated as Police Regiment Warsaw on 4 November 1939. Under its control were the four battalions of Police Group 6 (Polizeigruppe 6) as well as Police Battalions (Polizei-Batallion) 6, 10. The latter battalion had been transferred to Police Regiment Lublin before the other five battalions were formally assigned to the regiment in mid-December. By early 1940 the regiment had only four battalions under command and it remained that size until around September 1940 when another battalion was transferred elsewhere, although the individual battalions assigned periodically changed.Arico, pp. 61, 65–66, 79, 83, 116, 266; Tessin & Kanapin, pp. 536, 554 The invasion of Russia in June 1941 created a need for rear-area security units on the Eastern Front and Police Regiment Warsaw provided some of these. They were partially replaced by worn-out units returning from Russia. When the regiment was redesignated on 9 July 1942 as the 22nd Police Regiment, its I Battalion came from Police Battalion 41, II Battalion was formed from independent police companies scattered throughout occupied Poland, and III Battalion was formed by redesignating Police Battalion 53, although it was still Russia and remained there until September. All of the police regiments were redesignated as SS police units on 24 February 1943.Arico, pp. 156, 176; Tessin & Kanapin, p. 557 The 22nd SS Police Regiment helped to crush the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in April–May. Together with the 25th SS Police Regiment and other security forces, the regiment participated in Operation Harvest Festival (Aktion Erntefest) on 3–4 November, the massacre of 42,000 Jews imprisoned in the Majdanek extermination camp and several of its sub-camps.Blood, pp. 219–20, 224 In July 1944, the regiment was transferred to Belarus and was destroyed there.Tessin & Kanapin, p. 624 ==NotesReferences== * Arico, Massimo.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. It is now operated as a bed and breakfast, the Lake Street Manor. ==History== Richard Smith was born in Roxburghshire, Scotland 1840 and immigrated to Peterborough, Ontario in 1857. He moved to Auburn, New York three years later, and then to Port Austin in 1865. Smith purchased a 120-acre parcel of land, and was elected Huron County Surveyor in 1866 and county register of deeds and clerk in 1868. In 1870 he purchased the plot of land on which this house sits, and likely built the house in about 1871. In 1873, the Huron County seat moved to Bad Axe, and Smith, still serving as register and clerk, moved with it. When his last term ended in 1877, he moved back to Port Austin. In 1883, he returned to Bad Axe, and sold this house to Cornelius Culhane in 1885. Cornelius Culhane was born in Ireland in 1847, and moved to the United States as a young man. By 1871 he had moved to Port Austin, married Ellen Kennedy, and purchased farmland, but was soon working as a logger, running a logging outfit that contracted to sawmills to cut over timber lands. By the mid-1880s, Culhane was logging near Higgins Lake with a crew of one hundred men, and by the 1890s he was working in the Upper Peninsula. He was killed in 1903 in a logging accident. The Culhanes apparently used this house as their home when they were not working a logging camp. Ellen Kennedy Culhane continued to live in the house until her death in 1923, after which their son William lived in it until his death in about 1931. The house remained in the possession of the Culhane family until 1938. In 1985, Jack and Carolyn Greenwood purchased the house and opened it as a bed and breakfast. The couple still operates the property. ==Description== The Smith-Culhane House is a 1-1/2 story Late Victorian T-shaped house with reddish-orange brick walls and a high gable roof. The gables and eaves have curvilinear vine-like bargeboards. Windows are one-over-one units, and have brick segmental-arched caps, as do the two front entrances. Two brick-walled slant-sided bay windows push out from the main body of the house. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Lake Street Manor Category:National Register of Historic Places in Huron County, Michigan Category:Houses completed in 1871 ","title":"Smith-Culhane House"},{"id":"56104933","text":"A tonnage tax is a taxation mechanism that can be applied to shipping companies. The tax is determined by the Net tonnage of the entire fleet of vessels under operation or use by a company. It is on the basis of this variable that taxation is applied. Given that the tax perceived is independent from the volume of material transported and from the operating profit of a shipping company, it is less complex to manage for tax authorities and shipping companies. This method of taxation is based on an objectively measurable variable - net tonnage - by independent certifying bodies that determine the transport capacity of the vessels. Under current international practice, tonnage tax regimes are used to incentivise the modernisation and improved environmental performance of merchant fleets. The first country to introduce a tonnage tax was Greece back in 1975.Weintrit, Adam and Tomasz Neumann (Editors), 2013.

He is also founder of C2 , a global platform and series of events exploring the intersection between creativity and commerce. He is also a visual artist whose contemporary photographic work has been exhibited in Montreal, New York, Toronto, Miami and Paris. == Background == Jean-François Bouchard was born in Montréal in 1968. He went to boarding school at Collège Notre-Dame and studied law at the University of Ottawa. Before co-founding Sid Lee in 1993, he worked as an articling lawyer at Lavery and at the Ministère du Revenu du Québec. Bouchard is also a visual artist and photographer and has exhibited in Montreal, Paris, Miami, and Toronto. == Career ==  Sid Lee  Bouchard co- founded creative company Sid Lee in 1993 with art director Philippe Meunier, whom he met at 16 when they launched a short-lived student newspaper which featured Jane Fonda in its first edition. Some of Sid Lee’s first clients were the Greek restaurant near their office, a plumber, and Bouchard’s dentist. Diesel was renamed as Sid Lee (an anagram of “diesel”) in 2006 to avoid confusion with the popular Italian jeans brand, Diesel. Sid Lee went on to collaborate internationally with brands such as Cirque du Soleil, adidas, The North Face, Absolut Vodka, Videotron, Ubisoft, and many others. Bouchard was CEO of Sid Lee from 1993 to early 2017, when Bertrand Cesvet took helm of the company after playing a central role in its development since 1997 as the third member of the partnership. The ownership of the company eventually expanded to include more than 30 partners. In 2012, Cirque du Soleil, a long- time partner and client, acquired a significant minority stake in the company. In 2006, Bouchard was listed among Canada's Top 40 Under 40 and was also named Young Entrepreneur of the Year by the Jeune Chambre de commerce de Montréal (Young Chamber of Commerce). In 2011, Bouchard was selected along with his partners as the Personality of the Week by La Presse.  C2  Bouchard is also the founder and chairman of C2 Montréal, a global innovation conference on commerce and creativity launched with the support of Cirque du Soleil and Stephen and Claudia Bronfman. Notable speakers have included Richard Branson and James Cameron. Described by the European press as the \\"Davos of creativity,\\" C2 attracts 7,000 executives from 60 countries for its unique mix of talks, workshops, masterclasses, exhibitions, and festivities. C2 also produces private events globally for corporations such as EY and Michelin. C2 also operates a conference venue at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal. The company launched C2 Melbourne in Australia in November 2017. C2 Montreal was selected Most Innovative Event and Best Business Event by Biz Bash in 2015, 2016, and 2017. == Photography & Visual Art == Bouchard is a photographer and has held exhibitions in Montreal, Paris, Miami, and Toronto. His photo series Transpose, which features transgender men in various stages of transition, was presented at Arsenal Contemporary (Montréal and Toronto) and awarded the Nannen Prize in 2017. It also received a Pride Photo Award in 2015. He also received the LUX Award from Infopresse on two occasions. His previous solo exhibitions have been shown at SAS Gallery and The Sherbrooke Museum while he has participated in group shows such as the Paris Nuit Blanche, the Miami Nuit Blanche and Art Souterrain in Montréal. In April 2019, his new exhibition In Guns We Trust was presented at Arsenal Contemporary in New York City. It consisted of photographs and a video installation exploring the very extremes of gun culture in the USA. The Magenta Foundation published a book on the works that is distributed by Thames & Hudson of London. Douglas Coupland wrote the foreword note of the book and the curated the exhibition. Artnet chose the exhibition as one of the “Must See Shows in NYC”. This body of work was also featured in the Washington Post, WIRED and the British Journal of Photography. Edward Burtynsky is quoted in the book explaining: “Through his surreal series of images and installations, Bouchard parses the extremity of this marginalized gun culture at ground zero, their place of worship. In his brief essay, Douglas Coupland brings us a sharp and insightful take on this culture. This book is a must-have for curious minds trying to comprehend the perplexing condition in which we find ourselves.” == References == Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:People from Montreal ","title":"Jean-François Bouchard"},{"id":"56105064","text":"Las Vegas Lady is a 1975 American crime film directed by Noel Nosseck, and starring Stella Stevens, Stuart Whitman, George DiCenzo, Lynne Moody, Linda Scruggs, Joseph Della Sorte, Hank Robinson, and Karl Lukas.

The total number of Jews in the country is 16,000. Of these, 11,000 are mountain Jews, about 6,000 in Baku, 4,000 in Guba and thousands in other cities. Ashkenazi Jews are 4.3 thousand people. Most of them live in Baku and Sumgayit. The Georgian Jews are about 700. Q.Zelmanovich said that there are 10 synagogues in Azerbaijan. Two of the synagogues are located in Baku, six of them in Guba and two of them in Oguz: \\"Synagogues have been built mainly in areas where Jews live. One of the synagogues in Baku was built in 2003 and another in 2012. Jews living in Azerbaijan, every day worship in the synagogue, celebrate their festivals, hold mourning ceremonies.\\" == Synagogue of Mountain Jews == The building of the Mountain Jews Synagogue in Baku has been functioning since 1945. During the Soviet era, after the end of the Second World War, mountain Jews were given an ancient building for religious needs in the center of the city. The condition of the building was very damaging, and those who worshiped here were suffering from unpleasantness. This situation continued until Azerbaijan gained independence. During the period of independence, repair and restoration works were started, the second floor of the synagogue was built, and favorable conditions were created for worshipers. In connection with the reconstruction and capital rehabilitation works carried out, there was a need for a new synagogue for Mountain Jews and has been functioning in Baku in 2010. The opening ceremony of the new temple for the Mountain Jews was held on April 5, 2011. According to the architectural features and dimensions, officials, heads of religious confessions functioning in Azerbaijan, members of the Jewish community, as well as guests from Israel, Russia and other countries attended in opening ceremony of other Jewish temples’ synagogue not only in Azerbaijan but also in the region. == European and Georgian Jews Synagogues == The synagogue of Jews of Europe and Georgia, located at Baku, was opened on March 9, 2003. The temple was built based on the project of the architect Alexander Karberin. This place of worship is considered to be the first synagogue built in the Near East in 60–80 years. This building, considered to be one of the largest synagogues in Europe, was erected instead of the old temple. After the Second World War, Soviet Power gave a one-storey building with ancient military warehouses to Georgian and European Jews for religious needs. Here men went down cold and damp basement for praying, and women prayed in the upper room. The balcony of the building was also given to women. At present, in three-storied, new synagogue built from white stone has created comfortable conditions for believers. People from different religions and classes participated in the synagogue construction. The name of each person and organization that has been worked in the project is engraved on boards at the entrance of the temple. Not only Jewish organizations living abroad, but also Caucasian Muslims Office and the Baku and Russian Orthodox Church in Azerbaijan have been closely participated in financing the construction. == Gilaki Synagogue located at Red Village == The Gilaki synagogue, located in the Red settlement in Guba region, was built by immigrants from the Gilan Province of Iran. The architect of the temple is Gilel Ben Haim. His name was engraved on the brick facade of the synagogue. It is clear from the inscription on the foundation stone that the temple was erected in 1896. There is also another board on the entrance door. And here is written another date - 1857. Perhaps this board was brought from the more ancient temple of the Jewish emigrants and was put on the door of the synagogue. The Summer Synagogue in Quba There are 12 windows in the synagogue building, according to the number of Israel branch. From historical sources it is known that earlier there was a spring near the synagogue. It is likely that the mosque built in Guba in the first half of the 19th century was a prototype for the temple of Gilaki, because the hexagonal dome was once a glass and illuminated the prayer room. Anological roofing is also available at the Guba mosque. In the past, there were no separate rooms for women in the Gilaki synagogue as in the other temples of mountain Jews. Women only came in here during the holidays and sat in the yard of the synagogue. At present, women are allowed to enter the temple during holidays. == Six Dome Synagogues in Red Town == A synagogue in the Red Village of Guba District was built in 1888 by architect Gilel Ben Haim. Six dome (synagogue is also hexagonal) is a symbol of immigrating of the residents of Qilhat settlement here from the village of Galaduz during 6 days with the permission of Huseynali Khan of Guba. The temple has 14 main windows. The synagogue, a large worship hall, is an ancient architectural monument built in the Eastern style. The section facing the wall of worship is called aron-kadus. Its height is 7 meters. The Holy book is kept in a wardrobe on the wall. The windows are made of oak tree in shape of hexagonal star. The restoration of the synagogue began in 1995 and was completed in October 2000. There is also a 60-person worship hall and a kitchen for religious ceremonies at the temple's cellar. == Upper Quarter of synagogue == The Upper Quarter of Synagogue located at Oguz city was built in 1897 by helping and heading of Ravvin Barukh. In the Soviet era, this synagogue was also closed as other places of worship, and later used as a warehouse. In October 2004, the synagogue was begun to repaired by local Jews living in Oguz, and the renovation was completed in 2006. The synagogue is now used as a temple. On the Friday and Saturday, the Jews worship freely. == Lower Quarter of synagogue == The Lower Quarter of Synagogue in Oguz city, was built in 1849. This synagogue was used as a tobacco and furniture warehouse during the Soviet era. The synagogue began to repaire by local Jews in 1992 and ended in 1994. == See also == History of the Jews in Azerbaijan == References == ","title":"Synagogues in Azerbaijan"},{"id":"56105092","text":"Major Charles Edmund Stanley Phillips OBE FIP FRSE (1871-1945) was a 20th- century British physicist and radiologist.

Between 1941 and 1943 he was a member of the Ładoś Group also called the Bernese Group. Rokicki used his diplomatic position of vice consul to produce false Latin American passports and had them smuggled to the German-occupied Poland and Netherlands where they saved lives of their Jewish bearers. For his efforts Rokicki was named Righteous Among the Nations by Israel in 2019. ==Childhood and early career== Rokicki was born to Józef and Konstancja née Pawełkiewicz. Being a cavalry lieutenant, he got two awards for bravery, probably during Poland's war of independence, or the Polish-Soviet war, 1919–1920. In 1934, he was qualified as reserve officer for the 1st Regiment of Riflemen.Yearbook of Reserve Officers from 1934 p. 607 On August 17, 1936, Rokicki married Maria, née Goldman (Goldmanis). The couple had a daughter, Wanda Rokicka (1938–2008), who would become a UN employee in Geneva. In 1931, he joined the consular service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Between 1932 and 1933, he was a contractual employee of the Polish Consulate in Minsk, at that time capital of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1934–1936 he was vice-consul in Riga, and in the years 1936–1938 a contract employee of the Polish Legation in Cairo. From 1939 to 1945, he was the vice-consul of the Republic of Poland in Bern. Sample visa issued by consul Konstanty Rokicki in Riga, 1935, and used for transiting to British Palestine. ==Holocaust rescue action and \\"passport affair\\"== It is estimated that between 1941 and 1943, Rokicki and his subordinate, Jewish diplomat Juliusz Kühl produced several thousands of illegal Paraguayan passports which served as protection documents for Jews stranded in the Nazi ghettos in German-occupied Poland and who were threatened with deportation from German- occupied Netherlands.Rudolf Hügli’s interrogation, 18.01.1943, Federal Archives in BernChaim Eiss’s interrogation, 14.05.1943, Federal Archives in BernAbraham Silberschein’s interrogation, 1.09.1943, Federal Archives in Bern Rokicki and Kühl personally bribed the Paraguayan honorary consul, Bernese notary Rudolf Hügli to obtain blank passes which Rokicki filled out with the names of the Polish Jews. The lists of beneficiaries and their photos were smuggled between Bern and occupied Poland thanks to the network of Jewish organizations, in particular Agudat Yisrael and RELICO, headed by Chaim Eiss and Abraham Silberschein respectively. The passports of Paraguay – unlike the passports of other Latin American countries – had a special value, because this country – under the pressure of Poland and the Holy See – temporarily recognized (1944) their validity. ==Later life and legacy== Consul Rokicki left the diplomatic service in 1945, after the establishment of the pro-Soviet Provisional Government of National Unity and settled permanently in Switzerland. He died in Lucerne in July 1958, after several years of illness.Konstanty Rokicki’s obituary, Życie Warszawy, July 1958 Rokicki's name was never mentioned by historians, despite the fact that Agudat Yisrael mentioned him in its thank you letter to the Polish government alongside Aleksander Ładoś, Juliusz Kühl and Stefan Ryniewicz. The organization claimed in it that, without their activities, it would not be possible to save \\"many hundreds of people\\".Harry A.

The document erroneously called Ładoś and Ryniewicz \\"consuls\\". The decision sparked outrage and frustration among the family members of the two other late Polish diplomats, and among survivors. Thirty one of them signed an open letter to Yad Vashem. Rokicki's cousin refused to accept the medal until two other Polish diplomats, Rokicki's superior are recognized as Righteous Among The Nations, too. Polish Ambassador to Switzerland Jakub Kumoch who contributed to the discovery of Rokicki also refuted the Yad Vashem's interpretation stating that Rokicki worked under Ładoś and Ryniewicz. ==See also== * Ładoś Group * Raoul Wallenberg ==Literature== * Mark Mackinnon: He should be as well known as Schindler': Documents reveal Canadian citizen Julius Kuhl as Holocaust hero, The Globe and Mail * Zbigniew Parafianowicz, Michał Potocki: Forgotten righteous.

It was founded in 1995 by Ray Muzyka, Greg Zeschuk, and Augustine Yip. They signed a partnership with American publisher Interplay Productions to get investment and development resources for their first game Shattered Steel, a mech simulation action game released in 1996. The game was a modest success, but BioWare's second title, Baldur's Gate (1998), achieved overwhelming critical praise and defined the company's future direction. A role-playing video game (RPG) based on Dungeons & Dragons, Baldur's Gate sold more than two million copies and became the most successful Dungeons & Dragons game ever at the time. Two years later, the studio released an acclaimed sequel Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn, which along with the use of BioWare game engines in RPGs such as Planescape: Torment (1999) and Icewind Dale (2000) helped propel the studio to the forefront of the computer RPG genre. Interplay was suffering financially by the early 2000s, so BioWare collaborated with publisher Infogrames to release their next Dungeons & Dragon-based RPG Neverwinter Nights (2002). BioWare was given the opportunity to work on another popular intellectual property, Star Wars, when LucasArts approached them at the turn of the millennium. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic released first on Microsoft's Xbox video game console in 2003. While it was not BioWare's first console game, it helped the studio break into the console market since Microsoft Game Studios wanted to partner with them on console exclusive titles, such as Jade Empire (2005) and Mass Effect (2007). In March 2006, BioWare expanded their operations and opened a new studio in Austin, Texas, to helm the development of a massively multiplayer online role- playing game (MMORPG). In October 2007, American publisher Electronic Arts (EA) announced that it had acquired BioWare. Under EA, BioWare established the fantasy RPG series Dragon Age, continued to release games in their science fiction RPG series Mass Effect, and opened a new studio in Montreal. They also revisited the Star Wars franchise with BioWare Austin's MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic (2011). In the early 2010s, EA restructured and rebranded several of its other studios under the BioWare label, including Mythic Entertainment and Victory Games which respectively became BioWare Mythic and BioWare Victory. New games from these studios were announced as BioWare projects, but they were cancelled and the studios shut down in the following years. In September 2012, co-founders Muzyka and Zeschuk announced their retirement and departure from BioWare. Following the release of Mass Effect: Andromeda in 2017, BioWare Montreal was merged into an EA's Motive Studios. == Games == All games developed by BioWare Edmonton, except where noted. ==References== * BioWare ","title":"List of BioWare video games"},{"id":"56105516","text":"Carl Morris Loeb was a German-born American businessman who served as the president of the American Metal Company and the founder of Carl M. Loeb & Co, which became Loeb, Rhoades & Co. in 1938. ==Early life and education== Carl Morris Loeb was born to a middle-class Jewish family on September 28, 1875 in Frankfurt, Germany, the son of Minna (née Cohn) and Adolph Loeb.Stack, Elizabeth. Immigrant Entrepreneurship: \\"German American Biographies: \\"Carl Morris Loeb\\" Retrieved December 21, 2017 His parents were dry goods merchants and he had one older brother, Julius, and one younger sister, Ella. ==Career== American Metal Company In 1893, Loeb graduated from gymnasium and moved to New York City to work with his brother at the American Metal Company (AMCO), a lead and zinc trader and subsidiary of Metallgesellschaft AG (founded by Wilhelm Ralph Merton, Leo Ellinger, and Zachary Hochschild). In 1893, he moved to St. Louis to assist at a branch office (and also met his future wife) and was promoted to branch manager after convincing then AMCO president Jacob Langeloth that he could handle the responsibility despite being only 21. In 1898, he became a U.S. citizen. Loeb vertically integrated the company by expanding into the ownership of smelting and refining facilities while securing his supply of raw materials by signing exclusive contracts with large mines to purchase their entire output; and then processing them at AMCO-owned facilities. He also expanded AMCO's activities into Mexico with investments in lead, silver and zinc mining first as an agent for its parent Metallgesellschaft and later as a direct investor during World War I. In 1917, AMCO refined 250 million pounds of copper, 547 million pounds of zinc, and 168 million pounds of lead. Loeb became president of AMCO after Longeloth died in 1914. Before the United States entered World War I in October 1917, Metallgesellschaft (then led by Richard Merton, the son of Wilhelm Ralph Merton), transferred its 51% ownership in AMCO to several American citizens who were also AMCO managers. Once the US entered the war, the US passed the Trading with the Enemy Act 1914 which required that German- owned business assets be held by the Office of Alien Property Custodian. Despite Merton's efforts to hide Metallgesellschaft's ownership, Loeb reported to the agency that the assets were in reality still owned by their German parent and the stock was then transferred into a trust which was supervised by Henry Morgenthau Sr., Berthold Hochschild, and Joseph F. Guffey. In 1918, the Alien Property Custodian sold the 51% stake it had confiscated at a public auction for $5.75 million with many of the shares being purchased by a syndicate of investors including Ludwig Vogelstein (who had 20%), Berthold Hochschild, and Loeb. In 1920, Berthold Hochschild was appointed chairman of the board with Loeb as president and various investors as vice presidents including Otto Sussman, Henry Bruère, Harold K. Hochschild, Carl's brother Julius Loeb, and Vogelstein. Later, Andrew Mellon joined the board to represent the government's interest. In 1921, Richard Merton filed a claim with the government asserting that the confiscation of AMCO shares was unlawful as the shares had been transferred to a Swiss subsidiary before the U.S. involvement in World War I; he also bribed some government officials to assist in his recovery. Unfortunately for Merton, the bribes were exposed and the claim rejected (and President Harding's Attorney General Harry Daugherty was tried and acquitted twice for his alleged involvement). In 1929, Loeb resigned as AMCO's president over a disagreement in AMCO's taking on debt to fund the purchase of copper mining interests in Africa (previously, AMCO had minimized its ownership in mines and instead relied on exclusive supply contracts). The board purchased Loeb's 80,000 shares for eighty-five dollars apiece which was fortuitous for Loeb as the Wall Street Crash of 1929 followed later in the year. Carl M. Loeb & Co In December, Loeb and his son John L. Loeb formed Carl M. Loeb and Company, paying $250,000 to become a member of the Wall Street Stock Exchange.The company later merged with Rhoades & Company, a company that was hit hard during the Great Depression and needed capital to bolster its position, to form Loeb, Rhoades & Co. in 1938. ==Personal life== On November 12, 1896, Loeb married Adeline Moses, daughter of Alfred Huger Moses; they had four children: * Margaret Loeb Kempner (born 1899), who married stockbroker and publishing executive Alan H.

Thawil was a student of Sheikh Nawawi al-Bantani, an Indonesian Islamic teacher from Banten who became the Imam of the Great Mosque of Mecca. In December 1945, Sukarno, as the president of Indonesia delivered a speech before the people of Banten in Serang square. At the beginning of his speech, Sukarno mentioned that Arsyad Thawil was a great hero from Banten. ==Biography== Early life Thawil was born in Lempuyang village, Tanara, Serang Regency. His father was a Bantenese named Imam As'ad bin Mustafa bin As'ad, while his mother was Ayu Nazham. No one knows the exact of date and year of his birth, but on his tombstone it was written that he was born in 1851 AD. Thawil was born under the name of Mas Mohammad Arsyad. The nickname \\"Mas\\" was an abbreviation of Permas, a Bantenese noble title that was a descendant of the sultanate. While, named Thawil () which means long because there was a friend named Shaikh Arsyad Qashir al-Bantani, Qashir () was mean short. Therefore, to distinguish him from Arsyad Qashir, his friends then pinned Thawil's name behind his name. Education Thawil received basic Islamic religious education such as reading al-Quran from his father directly, Imam As'ad who was also a cleric at his pesantren at Tanara. In addition, he also studied other sciences such as nahwu (arabic grammar), sharaf (morphology), fiqh, and tawhid from his father. In 1867 when Thawil was 16 years old, he went to Bima to study with Sheikh Abdul Gani. But only arrived in Surabaya he met his prospective teacher who will carry out hajj to Mecca, next he expressed his desire to learn from him. Then Sheikh Abdul Gani accepted Thawil as a disciple as well as invite him to go to Mecca together. At Masjid al-Haram, Thawil followed the lesson given by Ahmad Zayni Dahlan, Mufti of Mecca, especially regarding nahwu, fiqh, and al-sīra al-Nabawiyya. In addition studying to Ahmad Zayni Dahlan, Thawil also studied with some cleric in Mecca, among them Sheikh Nawawi al-Bantani and Sayyid Abu Bakri Syatha (under the guidance of his two sons, Sayyid Umar Syatha and Sayyid Uthman Syatha). Thawil deepens the science of hadith to Habib Muhammad ibn Husein al- Habsyi al-Makki under the guidance of his son, Mufti al-Muhaddits al-Habib Husayn ibn Muhammad al-Habsyi al-Makki. In addition, Thawil also obtained the study of the hadith from the Medina cleric, Sheikh Abdul Ghani bin Abi Sa'id al-Mujaddidi under the guidance of some of his disciples, Sayyid Ali bin Zhahir al-Watri, Sheikh Shalih bin Muhammad az-Zhahiri, and Sheikh Abdul Jalil Barradah. As for the science of fiqh, Thawil also deepens it to Sheikh Muhammad bin Sulaiman Hasbullah al-Makki. Personal life Thawil married in his exile in Manado with a Minahasa girl of a local pastor named Magdalena Runtu (b. 1880; d. 1937), who after converting to Islam changed her name into Tarhimah Magdalena Runtu. ==Close relationship with Sheikh Nawawi== For five years (from 1868 - 1873), Thawil was a disciple of the Meccan cleric who also came from Banten, Sheikh Nawawi al-Bantani. One day, Sheikh Nawawi sent his work in the form of a manuscript (kitab) to Egyptian cleric, but the work was rejected and returned in code form. After the code was received, Sheikh Nawawi then replied it with the same code. Receiving a shipment of codes from Sheikh Nawawi, the Egyptian scholar was very surprised because only certain scholars of highly knowledgeable scholars could understand the code. To cure the curiosity, the Egyptian scholars agreed to invite Sheikh Nawawi for questioning. Sheikh Nawawi also fulfilled the invitation of the Egyptian scholars and invited Thawil as his pupil to play and swap places (Sheikh Nawawi became Thawil, as well as vice versa). The arrival of the Banten cleric was welcomed by Egyptian scholars albeit without ceremony. In the presence of the Egyptian scholar, Thawil, who performed as Sheikh Nawawi sat on a chair, while Sheikh Nawawi sat down as a bodyguard. Many questions were asked by Egyptian scholars who were not easy to answer by any scholar. As Sheikh Nawawi, Thawil also ordered his bodyguard (who was none other than Sheikh Nawawi) to answer these questions, then all questions asked were answered satisfactorily by Syekh Nawawi who acted as bodyguard of Thawil. The Egyptian scholars were amazed to hear such a satisfactory answer, So they think that his bodyguard was so great, let alone who guarded, surely more great. After the invitation, Indonesian clerics were increasingly respected. The work of Sheikh Nawawi who was rejected by Egyptian publishers began to be published. This also affected the good respect to the Indonesian clerics by Egyptian scholars at that time. ==Roles and struggles== Cilegon War In 1893, Thawil returned to his homeland, Banten. At that time Banten was facing a major disaster: After the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa which claimed at least 36,417 deaths, then followed by the outbreak of animal diseases in 1885, until the peoples believe in superstition and shamanism. Not only that, the Dutch colonizers then make Banten society increasingly depressed with punishment given to the people unfairly. Later cleric and peasants agreed to wage a total war with the Dutch colonial side which was later approved by Sheikh Nawawi al- Bantani in Mecca, Sheikh Abdul Karim al-Bantani, and several other cleric. Simultaneously the Muslims took up arms in the jihad, including Arsyad Thawil. Arsyad was a leading figure in the Battle of Geger Cilegon 1888 (Cilegon War) and thus became the most sought-after cleric by the colonials. As a result of the rebellion the Dutch then arrested the Bantenese cleric and exiled them (all the exiled leaders numbered 94). Some of those exiled include: Hajji Abdurrahman and Hajji Akib dumped to Banda Islands, Hajji Haris to Bukittinggi, Hajji Arsyad Qashir to Buton, Hajji Ismail to Flores, while Arsyad Thawil then dumped to Manado, North Sulawesi. Besides then dumped into Tondano, Ternate City, Ambon, Kupang, and other cities. ==Activity== In Mecca On February 27, 1879, Thawil was made a Sheikh (taking care of the hajj who came from Indonesia), and since there were two Arsyads from Indonesia, he was called Arsyad \\"Thawil\\" (arabic: tall) and one more was Arsyad \\"Qasir\\" (arabic: short). When take care of Hajj he then often visited the Dutch consulate office in Jeddah and became acquainted with Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje who eventually became his friend in discussing the teachings of Islam. In the place of exile After the defeat in the Cilegon War he was caught along with 100 other fighters. He was put in prison in Serang, then moved to Batavia. When imprisoned in Batavia Snouck Hurgronje met him, but that friendship did not changing his status as a prisoner. Not long after being imprisoned in Batavia, he then dumped to Manado, North Sulawesi. Sheikh Arsyad Thawil actively teaches peoples in his exile place, Manado. He teaches in the field of Islamic sciences, among them are fiqh, nahwu-sharaf, tasawwuf, hadith and others. No less hundreds of scholars from Manado, Gorontalo, Ambon, Ternate, Poso Regency, Tolitoli Regency, Donggala Regency and other areas studied to Sheikh Arsyad. He was also recognized as one of the carriers of Islam to region of the Christians majority in Indonesia. Even, he married the girl of pastor who had converted to Islam, named Magdalena Runtu. Thawil died in Manado, North Sulawesi, on Monday, 14 Zulhijah 1353 AH or 19 March 1935 AD. The Imam of his Janazah prayer is al-Habib Hasan bin Abdur Rahman Maula Khailah al-'Alawi. ==Appreciation== The name Arsyad Thawil then enshrined into the name of a mosque in Komo Luar, Wenang, Manado by the name Kyai Hajji Arsyad Thawil mosque. The Commemoration of the day of his death is always held every year in this mosque. On the 79th anniversary of his death, the Provincial Office of Social Affairs of North Sulawesi will file Arsyad Thawil as a national hero. ==References== Footnotes Bibliography * * Category:1851 births Category:1934 deaths Category:People from Banten Category:Indonesian Muslims Category:History of West Java Category:Dutch East Indies ","title":"Arsyad Thawil al-Bantani"},{"id":"56105684","text":"Götz Draeger (born 31 July 1944), sometimes incorrectly referred to as Dräger, is a German rower. ==Rowing career== Draeger was born in 1944 in Bad Landeck in Silesia; his home town was named Lądek-Zdrój after the war and is now part of Poland. In his youth, he competed in decathlon and played handball. He started rowing in 1965 aged 21 for TSC Berlin, which in 1969 became SC Berlin- Grünau.

In 1969, he again came second with Schmied in double scull, and also came second in single scull, beaten by Joachim Böhmer. At the 1970 East German championships, he came third in the double scull with Christof Kreuziger, and won the single scull title. This qualified Draeger to compete at the 1970 World Rowing Championships in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada in the single scull, succeeding Achim Hill who had for many years dominated the boat class in East Germany. In Canada, Draeger could not beat the champion from the 1969 European Rowing Championships, the Argentinian Alberto Demiddi, but he came second. For his success, he was awarded Master of Sport in September 1970. Draeger won the East German single scull championship title again in 1971. At the 1971 European Rowing Championships in Copenhagen, he once again came second to the Argentinian Demiddi. During 1972, Draeger was not in form. At a regatta on the Rotsee in Lucerne, Switzerland, he came fifth in the single scull, with his Wolfgang Güldenpfennig (SC Magdeburg) in third place. Whilst Draeger was nominated for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, he went as a reserve only and did not compete. It was Güldenpfennig who competed in the single scull at the Olympics, and he won a bronze medal. Draeger regained some of his form in 1973, when he came third in the 1973 East German championships in single scull (Güldenpfennig came first, and Joachim Dreifke was second). He won an international regatta in Prague in June 1973 in the single scull. SC Berlin- Grünau first competed in the East German championships in the quad scull in 1973 (a new boat class at the time), when Draeger's boat came third. In 1974, quad scull teams were formed by rowers from different clubs, and the composite team made up of Dreifke, Draeger, Rüdiger Reiche, and Jürgen Bertow became national champions. The same team went to the 1974 World Rowing Championships in Lucerne, where the quad scull made its first appearance in the world championship programme. The rowers from East Germany were successful and won the world championship title, ahead of teams from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. In November 1974 alongside all other East German World Rowing Championship winners, Draeger was awarded a Patriotic Order of Merit in bronze. In 1975, Draeger lost his seat in the East German composite crew to Martin Winter, with the other three remaining in the team. This new composition came second at the East German championships, and the winning crew went on to win the 1975 World Rowing Championships. ==Professional career== Whilst he was actively competing, Draeger had graduated with a chemical engineering degree from the Humboldt University of Berlin, specialising in fermentation and technology.

It is not a form of playoffs at the end of the season (as is typically seen in North American sports), but is more like the Canadian Championship or the FA Cup, albeit only for League1 Ontario teams. All matches are separate from the regular season, and are not reflected in the season standings. The cup tournament for the men's division is a single-match knockout tournament with a total of four rounds culminating in a final match in the start of August, with initial matches determined by random draw. Each match in the tournament must return a result; any match drawn after 90 minutes advanced directly to kicks from the penalty mark instead of extra time.

While some types of cell naturally exist in a separated form (for example blood cells), other cell types that are found in solid tissue require specific techniques to separate them into individual cells. This may be performed by using enzymes to digest the proteins that binds these cells together within the extracellular matrix. After the matrix proteins have been digested, cells remain loosely bound together but can be gently separated mechanically. Following isolation, experiments can be performed on these single isolated cells including patch clamp electrophysiology, calcium fluorescence imaging, and immunocytochemistry. == Techniques == cardiac myocytes taken using confocal microscopy  Circulating cells  The techniques required to obtain isolated cells vary depending on the cell type required. Circulating cells such as blood cells or some tumour cells can be isolated by taking a blood sample. As blood samples contain a mixture of many different cell types, a method of separating out cells into different types must be used. The most commonly used method for this is flow cytometry, during which an automated analyser inspects a narrow stream of cells. In one version of this technique, a light is shone on the stream of cells, and the analyser detects the reflected light or fluorescence before using this information to rapidly manoeuvre the cells of interest into a collection chamber.  Solid tissues  When dealing with solid tissues, obtaining tissue for cell isolation may be more challenging. Surplus human tissue can sometimes be obtained at the time of planned surgery, for example specimens of right atrial appendage are often excised and discarded during open heart surgery such as coronary artery bypass surgery. Other tissues such as samples of pancreas or bladder may be taken as a biopsy. Alternatively, tissue from animals is frequently obtained by sacrificing the animal. After a tissue specimen has been obtained, it must be surrounded or perfused by a solution at an appropriate temperature containing the salts and nutrients required to keep the cells alive. This may be performed by simply submerging the tissue in the solution, or may involve more complex arrangements such as Langendorff perfusion. Commonly used solutions included modifications of Tyrode's solution or Krebs and Henseleit's solution These solutions contain precise concentrations of electrolytes including sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, chloride, and glucose. The concentrations of these electrolytes must be carefully balanced, paying attention to osmotic pressure. The acidity of the solution must be regulated, often using a pH buffer such as HEPES. Isolation of cells from some tissues may be improved by oxygenating the solution. In the initial stages, perfusing the tissue with a solution that does not contain calcium is useful particularly when isolating cardiac myocytes, as the absence of calcium causes separation of the intercalated disks. Proteolytic enzymes can then be added to the solution. Enzymes that digest collagen (collagenases) are often used when isolating cells from the heart or bladder. General-purpose enzymes that digests many sorts of protein (proteases) may also be used. When isolating cells from brain tissue, other enzymes that break down DNA (DNAases) may be required. These enzymes, in addition to digesting the extracellular matrix, can also digest other important proteins essential for the cells of interest to function. If cells are exposed to these enzymes for too long then cell death results, but if they are not exposed to the enzymes for long enough then digestion of the extracellular matrix will not be complete. After the enzymes have been removed from the tissue by perfusing it with a second solution that does not contain enzymes, cells can be mechanically separated or dissociated. A simple technique for dissociating cells involves cutting the tissue into small chunk before agitating the chunks in a solution using a pipette. == Uses == Isolated cells can be used to study how cells work, how they change in response to disease, and how they are affected by drugs. An example of an experimental technique which uses isolated cells is patch clamp electrophysiology, used to study how charged particles flow across the cell membrane. Complementary techniques include calcium fluorescence imaging using dyes that emit light in response to calcium to measure how calcium is regulated within the cell, and immunocytochemistry which uses antibodies tagged with a fluorescent marker to identify where proteins are located within a cell. Isolated cells can also be used for cell culture, in which a single cell multiplies to create a colony of cells. Cell isolation can also be used as part of a treatment. Isolation of pancreatic islet cells, followed by their subsequent culture and transplantation, has been used to treat patients with Type 1 Diabetes. == See also == * Cell sorting == References  Further reading == * Isolation of Atrial Cardiomyocytes: * Isolation of Ventricular Cardiomyocytes: * Isolation of Pancreatic Islet Cells: * Isolation of Haematopoetic stem cells: * Isolation of Mesenchymal stem cells: * Isolation of Hepatic stellate cells: * Isolation of Circulating tumour cells: * Isolation of Neuroglial cells: * Isolation of Urothelial cells: Category:Cells Category:Laboratory techniques ","title":"Cell isolation"},{"id":"56106126","text":"1928 Drexel Dragons football team represented Drexel Institute—now known as Drexel University—in the 1928 college football season.

As a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives for Davidson County, he sponsored pro-labor legislation for women and children. His bills also led to the racial segregation of streetcars in Nashville, and to the requirement of a medical prescription to purchase cocaine. ==Early life== Fahey was born in 1862 in Nashville, Tennessee, to Irish immigrants Patrick Fahey and Katherine Ward.Tennessee, Death Records, 1908-1958 He was educated in St. Louis, Missouri. ==Career== Fahey began his career in the leather industry. He became a labor leader, first as a member or delegate of the Leatherworkers' Union, the Tennessee State Federation of Labor. He was also a delegate to the Southern Labor Congress and the American Federation of Labor. Fahey served as a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives twice, in the 52nd and 54th general assemblies, representing Davidson County. Fahey sponsored pro-labor legislations, like \\"the first child labor law\\", \\"another measure reducing the hours of working women in the state\\", and \\"another bill making all stores and shops of all kind provide stools for their women employees when not busy.\\" In 1901, he introduced Bill Number 80 to ban the informal sale of cocaine; instead it had to be purchased with a prescription from a physician. The bill passed both the state house and senate. Fahey was also in favor of racial segregation. In January 1905, he introduced Bill Number 87 \\"to separate white and colored passengers on streetcars.\\" His effort was successful, and the streetcars were segregated by July of the same year. Fahey resumed his involvement with the labor movement after leaving office. He attended at least the 30th Annual Convention in St. Louis, Missouri in November 1910 and the 33rd Annual Convention of the AFL in Seattle, Washington in November, 1913. In 1913, he was nominated to serve as the member of the Tennessee Senate for Davidson County, but he decided not to run. Instead, he was \\"closely identified with legislators in advocating laws beneficial to the workers and was recognized as an authority on all questions pertaining to labor.\\" ==Personal life and death== Fahey married Kate Gorey; they had a son, who died as an infant. Fahey attended services at St. Columba Church, a Catholic church in East Nashville. They resided at 703 Main Street in Nashville, Tennessee. His wife predeceased him in 1904. Fahey died of heart disease on March 4, 1915 in Nashville. He was buried in the Calvary Cemetery in Nashville. Shortly after his death, the Nashville Trades and Labor Council passed a resolution in his honor. ==References== Category:1862 births Category:1915 deaths Category:Politicians from Nashville, Tennessee Category:Catholics from Tennessee Category:Leaders of American trade unions Category:Members of the Tennessee House of Representatives Category:American people of Irish descent Category:Date of birth missing ","title":"Charles P.

The festival typically takes place over the course of three weeks in June and consists of opera, musical theater, chamber music, jazz, dance, drama, and more. ==History== The Princeton Festival was founded in 2004 by its current artistic director Richard Tang Yuk, who had formerly served as the Assistant Conductor of the Opera Festival of New Jersey. Recognizing the need not only for opera but diverse programming capable of reaching a larger audience in the area, Richard Tang Yuk assembled a program of five events to run in the summer of 2005, which culminated in a performance of Sweeney Todd. Over the years, the festival has grown to encompass as many as fifty different events at venues across central New Jersey, adding public lectures, master classes, and a piano competition to the traditional performing arts lineup. ==Production== The Princeton Festival is known for alternating traditional opera works with more modern pieces that are rarely staged in the New Jersey area. Past notable performances include John Adams' Nixon in China, Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, Handel's Ariodante, Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress, and Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream, the last of which was praised by The New York Times for its strong cast and imaginative production style.Tommasini, Anthony. \\"Britten’s ‘'Dream,’' Tweaked With an Otherworldly Pungency\\", The New York Times, June 21, 2009. Accessed December 23, 2017. \\"The Princeton Festival, which started in 2005, offers a wide range of performances and productions in the performing arts. In recent years the offerings have had an overall theme, and this summer it is 'Midsummer Magic, Dreams and Deceptions.'\\" For four consecutive years, The Princeton Festival received the People's Choice Award from the Jersey Arts organization, in recognition of the highest quality opera produced in the state of New Jersey. Common performance venues include Miller Chapel, the Lewis Center for the Arts, Princeton University Chapel, Richardson Auditorium, the Princeton Abbey, and Taplin Auditorium. Though the opera and musical theater performances are cast nationally, The Princeton Festival also partners with local groups such as LustigDanceTheatre, Bucks County Choral Society, VOICES Chorale, Concordia Chamber Players, Jazz Nights, and The Westminster Solo Vocal Institute, in order to offer a broader range of orchestration and programming. The Princeton Festival Baroque Orchestra was introduced in 2015 and regularly performs a wide cross section of music from the baroque period. ==Organization== The Festival is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization made possible by funds from the National Endowment for the Arts, Art Works, and New Jersey State Council on the Arts, among other groups and foundations. Additional annual fundraisers are held in the Princeton area to support musical programming. The Princeton Festival is not connected to Princeton University, though some of their performances take place in University venues. ==References== Category:Musical groups established in 2004 Category:American opera companies Category:Arts organizations established in 2004 Category:Music festivals in New Jersey Category:Classical music festivals in the United States Category:Opera festivals Category:Princeton, New Jersey ","title":"The Princeton Festival"},{"id":"56106200","text":"Mary Montagu, Duchess of Montagu (c.1711 - 2 May 1775), known as Countess of Cardigan between 1730 and 1749, was the wife of George Brudenell, 4th Earl of Cardigan.

Most mosaics are embedded in the cobblestone pavement of the city centre of Freiburg. ==History== These mosaics are commonly attributed to the paver Alois Krems, who lived in Freiburg in 1858. His work was inspired by pavings he had seen during his time as an apprentice in southern France. In the late 19th century, major road reconstruction works took place in Freiburg, during which the Bächle were relocated from the centers to the edges of the roads. As a result, several roads in different parts of town (Wiehre, Herden, Neuburg) were repaved with cobblestone between 1901 and 1911. The new basalt pavements are streaked with veins of white marble. Furthermore, they feature the year in which they were constructed. Even though the bombing of Freiburg on 27 November 1944 destroyed about 38km of roads and pavements, many of the pavings survived and can still be admired today. 48th parallel north, Habsburgerstraße, Freiburg im Breisgau The tradition of cobblestones enjoyed a revival during the 1970s when the old city of Freiburg was turned into a pedestrian zone. For instance, the pavements of Kaiser-Joseph-Straße, Freiburg's main shopping street, was paved with red porphyry and decorated with bands of white marble and smaller cobbles found in the Rhine. Larger cobblestones from the Rhine were also used to pave the Minster square. In 2012 a path leading to the main entrance of the minster was evened out so that the handicapped can access the church more easily.Frank Zimmermann: Barrierefreies Freiburg? Da fehlt noch ein Konzept, Badische Zeitung, 6 September 2012, retrieved 20 December 2013 At the beginning of the Habsburgerstraße a mosaic on the pavement marks the course of the 48th parallel north. ==Origins of the Stones== Bertoldstraße, Freiburg im Breisgau The round mosaics, decorative bands and at times even the paving of whole alleys consist mostly of coloured cobblestones from the Rhine. In the past, the stones used to be extracted from the Rhine flood plains close to Breisach in periods of low flow. However, this has become more difficult nowadays since the stock has depleted. Occasionally, new cobbles are obtained from gravel pits in the Rhine basin. Furthermore, stones that were replaced by asphalt are stored and reused. Other stones like porphyry, granite, basalt and marble have been purchased in Europe in the past and are obtained from all over the world today for economic reasons. Sporadically, artificial stones are used for details. ==Processing== To attain flat ellipsoidal cobbles, the paving stones are either cut by machine and have their edges smoothed in a drum mixer, or they are manually broken down and trimmed underneath to improve their stability. They are cut to be 6 to 12 cm long and 2 to 3 cm wide. The depth of each stone needs to be at least 2/3 of its length. The finished cobbles are set in the ground with their flat side facing up to create a smooth surface. Bigger stones are processed by machines. Usually, the cobbles are set in a sand subfloor. Occasionally, as is the case in Kaiser-Joseph-Straße a mortar subfloor is used. The cobbles are pressed into the subfloor using a paving hammer. Wasserschlössle, Symbol of Freiburg In the city centre of Freiburg, round mosaics in the paving can be found almost everywhere. These mosaics often show symbols of trade or historical references to the building that lies behind it. Some of these mosaics have mere ornamental character, others display emblems, coat of arms or short brand names. Hair Salon, Bertoldstraße, Freiburg If these round mosaics take great effort to piece together they are assembled with the help of a wooden stencil in a steel ladle filled with mortar. This technique has been used in Freiburg since the 1970s. This way the mosaics can be prepared at a builder's yard and do not have to be destroyed for road work. Each of these portable mosaics weighs ca. 400 kg. Freiburg's twin cities each were given such a mosaic showing Freiburg's coat of arms. Commissioned mosaics for cities in the vicinity are also produced in Freiburg.

The boundary between the two territories was formed approximately by the River Lahn. Walram took over the southern part of the realm (Walramic main line) and Otto, the northern part (Ottonian main line). The marriage between Otto and Agnes of Leiningen gave the Ottonian main line suzerainty over the March of Hadamar. Otto's death in 1290 led to repeated inheritance disputes among his sons. In 1303, they shared his estate, under the mediation of John I of Limburg. The eldest son Henry took over the sub- county of Nassau-Siegen with its estate in the Siegerland and the Barony of Westerwald, the second son Emich/Emicho I inherited the sub-county of Nassau- Hadamar with Driedorf and Esterau, and the third son, John the sub-county of Nassau-Dillenburg with its estates around Dillenburg, Herborn, Mengerskirchen, the Calenberg Tithe and the jurisdiction (Gericht) of Heimau.

It was redesignated as the 23rd Police Regiment in mid-1942 before it received the SS title in early 1943. ==Formation and organization== Police Regiment Kraków was formed on 4 November 1939. Under its control were three battalions from Police Group 1 (Polizeigruppe 1) as well as Police Battalions (Polizei-Batallion) 5 and 106. By April 1940 the regiment had only two battalions under command as they rotated in and out, but its strength had increased to three battalions by June and then to four battalions by October.Arico, pp. 81, 188, 191, 271, 309, 441–42; Tessin & Kanapin, pp. 536, 554 The invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, in June 1941 created a need for rear-area security units in Army Group Rear Areas and Police Regiment Kraków provided some of these. They were partially replaced by worn-out units returning from the occupied Soviet Union. When the regiment was redesignated on 9 July 1942 as the 23rd Police Regiment, its I Battalion came from Police Battalion 307, while II and III Battalions were formed from independent police companies scattered throughout occupied Poland, although their headquarters companies were not formed until 23 January 1943. In early 1943, I Battalion was redesignated as III Battalion of the 24th SS Police Regiment and was replaced by a newly formed unit. All of the police regiments were redesignated as SS police units on 24 February. The III Battalion helped suppress the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of April–May 1943.

Committed by Nazi Party members, the brutal murder cast a dark shadow over the political advance of Hitler and the Nazis at the time. Many acts of violence would follow; the Potempa Murder was an early precursor. It led then President Paul von Hindenburg to suspect that the murder was symptomatic of how the Nazi Party operated. On the night of 9 August 9 1932, five uniformed Nazi Stormtroopers (Sturmabteilung) burst into the apartment of Konrad Pietrzuch, a Communist miner and trade unionist, in the Upper Silesian village of Potempa (now part of the rural community of Krupski Młyn in Poland) and beat him to death in the presence of his mother. The five murderers did nothing to disguise themselves during the attack and they were quickly arrested. After a well-publicized trial in Beuthen (now Bytom, Poland), they were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Hitler, along with other senior Nazis, was furious not only with the verdict but also with the sentence. While the five murderers were in jail, he sent them a telegram: “My comrades! I am bound to you in unlimited loyalty in the face of this most hideous blood sentence. You have my picture hanging in your cells. How could I forsake you? Anyone who struggles, lives, fights, and, if need be, dies for Germany has the right on his side.” The government under Chancellor Franz von Papen, which strove for law and order amid rising political violence, had only days before passed an emergency decree authorizing the death sentence for politically motivated killings. Chancellor von Papen was not keen to see the five murderers executed soon after the crime as he feared an escalation of Nazi violence nationwide. In September 1932, the government commuted the sentences to life imprisonment, on the ground that the new decree was unknown to the defendants at the time of the murder. The \\"Potempa Five\\" became a significant point of contention in the debates between Hitler, von Papen, and President Paul von Hindenburg over the extent of Nazi participation in the German government. On 30 January 1933, continuing political chaos led to Hitler's being appointed Chancellor. On 21 March 1934, the Nazi government introduced legislation that granted amnesty to anyone in prison who had committed a crime “for the good of the Reich during the Weimar Republic”. All five murderers were released from prison that same month. == References == * http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/modern-world- history-1918-to-1980/weimar-germany/the-potempa-murder-of-1932/ * http://weimar_republik.enacademic.com/615/Potempa_Murder * http://skepticism.org/timeline/august-history/8015-sa-stormtroopers-found- guilty-murder-alleged-communist-potempa.html == See also == * Franz von Papen Category:1932 in Germany Category:Bytom Category:1930s murders in Germany ","title":"Potempa Murder of 1932"},{"id":"56106449","text":"Lola Fani-Kayode is a Nigerian television producer known for the creation of Mirror in the Sun and Mind-bending.

In February 2014, it was declared treasure, under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996. == Discovery == Two members of the \\"West London Archaeological Searchers\\", a metal-detecting group, Stuart Gullick and Michael Barker, found the hoard on 4 November 2012. The site was a hilltop location, close to the River Wylye. 50px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) license. == Composition == The find consists of 41 copper alloy objects split across two deposits or concentrations of finds, with a small number of finds found a short distance away. All the objects are of a similar typo-chronology and are likely to represent a single hoard comprising 31 'ornaments', 8 'tools' and 4 'other' or unidentified objects. The artefacts were recovered by the finders from two deposits in close proximity (c.2-3m apart), with two pits subsequently identified by a local amateur archaeology group (the Wiltshire Archaeology Field Group) on 10 November 2012. There was, however, no opportunity to independently date the pit cuts. The first deposit appears to have been a closed deposit, with the finders noting that the torcs were 'stacked' on top of one another within the pit (verbal communication). The second deposit is likely to have been disturbed by agricultural operations as the objects were dispersed across a small area. == Inquest == An inquest was held by the Salisbury coroner in February 2014 at which the hoard was declared to be treasure.

First published through the Instagram account @tahilalats in 2014, the daily four-panel comic is one of the most-followed webcomics in Indonesia, being published primarily via WEBTOON and social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook. The webcomic follows the slice of life genre, generally with the addition of over- exaggerated, absurd twists. ==History== In an interview with Antara News, Mursyid stated that he had been creating picture stories since he was child, unaware of the existence of comics. During his civil engineering studies in a polytechnic in Makassar, Mursyid became an illustrator for a local newspaper. Upon his graduation, he accepted a job offer from Jakarta-based social media company Dagelan. Mursyid's parents did not support his career choice until he got a stable income from it. Around this time, he began publishing four-panel comics through Instagram account @tahilalats (Tahi lalat is Indonesian for nevus, a large one of which is prominent on Mursyid's face while Mind Blowon is a portmanteau of mind blown and blo'on, an Indonesian slang for \\"dumb\\"). While he had begun publishing webcomics on his personal blog by 2013, it did not gain much attention. Contrary to the locally popular manga-styled webcomics of the time, Mursyid opted for a simpler style in order to deliver surreal stories akin to some western webcomics. Due to the webcomic's rising popularity in social media, Mursyid received and accepted an offer from WEBTOON to become a contributor. Later in December 2015, he went to South Korea along with other popular Indonesian webcomic authors, attending the 2015 Webtoonist Day. A collection of Tahilalat strips was released in form of physical comic book in April 2017. Published by Loveable Publishers, the comic book was released as a limited print. ==Style== In general, the webcomic satirizes various daily activities of Indonesian teenagers and young adults ranging from having meals, taking examinations, driving, etc. by adding an absurd plot twist at later panels. Mursyid is self-taught, and most of inspiration comes from his own everyday life. Tahilalats' artstyle is inspired by western webcomics; Mursyid stated that this style \\"works fairly well for a comic strip with surreal storylines. Simple, but people get the idea.\\" Most strips of Tahilalats are one-shots, although in several cases a page would be related to another one published afterwards. ==Reception== Tahilalats has become one of the most popular webcomics in Indonesia, with nearly 3 million subscribers through WEBTOON and 2.4 million Instagram followers, excluding its presence in other social media websites. In May 2017, it was placed second between other Indonesian webcomics registered in WEBTOON, where Indonesians form the largest user base of the service. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Tahilalats on Instagram * Tahilalats on WEBTOON Category:2010s webcomics Category:2014 webcomic debuts Category:Indonesian comedy webcomics Category:Gag-a-day comics Category:Yonkoma ","title":"Tahilalats"},{"id":"56106487","text":"Harold Langley (11 June 1903 - 3 March 1988) was a British athlete.

Col. James R. Shaler, a Missourian commanding the 27th Arkansas, was universally despised by his men. Shaler had a number of run-ins with his company officers, and it is supposed that Ford was a victim of Shaler's retribution. Enoch O.

They were so successful that Union leaders labeled them as guerrillas; however, Ford and his men were regularly mustered Confederate soldiers. The battalion's only significant combat was during Price's Missouri Raid campaign in the Fall of 1864. The unit participated in the following engagements: :Price's Missouri Raid, Arkansas-Missouri-Kansas, September–October 1864 :Battle of Fort Davidson (September 27, 1864)United States. War Dept..

Tim Reeves. Several senior Confederate Commanders were captured during the battle of Mine Creek, including General Cabell and General Marmaduke. The Federals captured also seven majors including Major Wolf Maj. E. 0. Wolf. Early in Price's raid, at the Battle of Ironton, Confederate forces had captured Major James Wilson of the Missouri State Militia and five of his men. As soon as Col. Tim Reeves, a Confederate colonel, learned that Major Wilson was a prisoner he took a file of men and went to the guard tent and demanded Major Wilson and the six privates. As soon as Major Wilson saw Colonel Reeves he exclaimed: \\"I am a dead man, Colonel Reeves will kill me.\\" And in his day book he wrote a few lines to his wife, and give it, money, and a pocket knife to a Federal prisoner. Colonel Reeves took Major Wilson and the six privates out a short distance and executed them. This execution was reportedly in retaliation for actions that Major Wilson had taken against the families of some of Colonel Reeves's men earlier in the war. After Price's men had left the area, the bodies were discovered and the executions were reported to Union Major General Rosecrans. Ironically the number of Union prisoners killed was miss reported as being Major Wilson and six privates, instead of Major Wilson and five. General Rosecrans ordered a Confederate major and six Confederate privates being held as prisoner of war be executed in retaliation for the killing of Major Wilson and the six privates. As the Union currently had no Confederate majors as prisoners, they took out six privates and executed them on six hours' notice. When Major Wolf was captured at the battle of Mine Creek, the Union had its opportunity to seek revenge for the slaying of Major Wilson. The guards told Major Wolf that they drew straws to see which one should pay the debt, and Major Wolf was the unlucky one. On November 7, Department of the Missouri, Special Orders No. 287, ordered that Wolf be shot on November 11, in retaliation for the murder of Major Wilson. The next morning after Major Wolf got to St. Louis, the guards attached a thirty two pound ball with chain to his leg. Then they took him to a large room set apart and read this sentence to him: \\"By orders of Major General Roseerans. Major Wolf, you are to be shot to death with musketry in retaliation for the murder of Major Wilson and the six privates that Colonel Reeves executed.\\" It was very early in the morning, and several Federal officers were present. On first reading Major Wolf did not fully understand, and called for a second reading, and when the adjutant had finished the second reading. Major Wolf explained that he knew nothing about the killing of Major Wilson, but as they were looking for an ardent Southern man to execute in retaliation, he supposed that they had made a fair selection. After the reading of the sentence they escorted Major Wolf to a cell, where he was closely guarded to await execution. They gave him four days. Captain Allen commanded the prison and treated Major Wolf kindly. Fellow Confederate prisoners, General Cabell and Major Cariton wrote several letters to Union authorities at St. Louis on behalf of Major Wolf while he was under sentence of death. Captain Allen furnished Major Wolf with pen, ink, and paper, and he wrote a letter to his wife telling her the sad news and that it had fallen to his lot to be executed for the wrongs of other men. He told her how to rear his dear children and to take care of what he had left her. He hoped she would have no trouble rearing his children with the assistance of his Masonic friends. When Major Wolf had finished his letter, Captain Allen asked him if he wanted a preacher, and Major Wolf said yes. Captain Allen sent for Rev. A. C. Osborn, a Baptist minister. Rev Osborn told Major Wolf that if he had any relics he wanted his wife to have, he would take charge of them and see that she got them. The minister told Major Wolf if there was anything in the letter that was contraband he wouldn't be allowed to take it. The minister read Major Wolf's letter and noticed that Wolf told his wife to take care of what he had left her and with the assistance of his Masonic friends. The preacher asked: \\"Major, are you a Mason?\\" The Major replied: 'I am,\\". Rev. Osborn hurried out and called the lodge together and telegraphed President Abraham Lincoln to attempt to stop the execution.http://www.history- sites.com/cgi-bin/bbs62x/mocwmb/arch_config.pl?md=read;id=7558 Lincoln received telegrams from James E. Yeatman, Able Barton, and P. L. Terry, of St. Louis, Missouri, asking for clemency in the case of Major Wolf. On November 10, 1974, General Rosecrans acknowledged receipt of Lincoln's telegram, and on November 11 wrote a detailed report covering the essential facts of Major Wolf's case. President Lincoln ended the practice of retaliatory executions. == Surrender == Lieutenant-Colonel Ford surrendered his battalion at Jacksonport, Arkansas, where they were paroled on June 5, 1865. == References  External links == *Edward G.

Carl Browne (1849–1914) was an American cattle rancher, cartoonist, journalist, and politician. A former close political associate of controversial San Francisco politician Denis Kearney, Browne is best remembered as a top leader of the Coxey's Army protest movement of 1894. ==Biography== Early years Carl Browne was born July 4, 1849 in Newton, Iowa. His father was a soldier who had seen action in both the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War, in which he fought as a member of the Union army.W.T. Stead, Chicago To-Day, or, The Labour War in America. London: Review of Reviews, 1894; pg. 44. San Francisco political activity Browne worked a variety of jobs during his younger years, including time as a printer, a painter, a cattle rancher, a cartoonist, and a journalist. Browne moved to San Francisco and became active in politics as an active member there of the Workingmen's Party.Donald L. McMurry, Coxey's Army: A Study in Industrial Unrest, 1893–1898. Boston: Little, Brown & Co., 1929; pg. 30. He was soon recognized for his commitment to the organization and served a stint as personal secretary to party leader Denis Kearney, a nativist politician who lead a popular movement for the exclusion of Chinese people from the United States. While in San Francisco, Browne launched a radical weekly newspaper which he edited and for which he drew political cartoons, The Open Letter. In a 1929 monograph, historian Donald L. McMurry described the colorful Browne in the following manner: > Browne's picturesque appearance made him a conspicuous figure wherever he > went. Tall, heavy, and bearded, his unkempt hair streaked with gray, he > added to the effect by wearing an exaggerated Western costume. It consisted > of a buckskin coat with fringes, and buttons made of Mexican silver half- > dollars, high boots, a sombrero, a fur cloak when weather permitted, and > around his neck, instead of a collar, a string of amber beads, the gift of > his dying wife.... Closer inspection revealed the reason why his men called > him 'Old Greasy. It was suggested that he would have been a more pleasant > companion if he had bathed oftener.McMurry, Coxey's Army, pg. 31. The Coxey campaign Carl Browne on horseback, addressing marchers from \\"Coxey's Army\\" in 1894. At a Chicago convention of advocates of free silver held in August 1893, Browne made the acquaintance of Ohio politician Jacob Coxey, who saw in the charismatic labor agitator Browne a potential popularizer of his proposed governmental reforms.McMurry, Coxey's Army, pg. 32. Browne had become well known in Chicago as an agitational public speaker, addressing a series of public meetings at Lake Front Park on the problem of unemployment and its possible solution – one means of which, he is said to have suggested, would be a march of unemployed workers on the nation's capital.McMurry, Coxey's Army, pp. 34–35. Impressed with the charismatic Browne's effectiveness and intellectual proximity to his own ideas, Coxey convinced Browne to join his campaign for the Good Roads Bill – a plan for putting the unemployed to work improving the transportation infrastructure of the United States. Browne obliged, both speaking in its behalf and drawing a series of cartoons illustrating the dysfunctional nature of the current economic system and depicting the benefits to be obtained by society through passage of the Coxey plan. Coxey was pleased with Browne's commitment to the cause of labor reform and persuaded him to stay with him at his home in Massillon, Ohio through the winter of 1893–94, a grim time when the United States was buffeted by the severe economic contraction known to history as the Panic of 1893. Together Coxey and Browne discussed a means of better publicizing the Good Roads Bill, with the pair determining to, in Coxey's words, \\"send a petition to Washington with boots on\\" through a cross-country march of the unemployed.McMurry, Coxey's Army, pg. 33. Browne and Coxey held a series of public meetings in Massillon and other towns in the area, drawing attention to Coxey's proposed Good Roads Bill and drawing attention to the planned march, which was to depart from Massillon for Washington, DC on Easter Sunday, 1894.McMurry, Coxey's Army, pg. 36. Browne gained notoriety for his Theosophic religious views, which posited the reincarnation of souls from a common pool of the deceased – with Browne contending that both he and Coxey possessed unusually large components of the soul of Jesus Christ.McMurry, Coxey's Army, pg. 37. Browne immodestly referred to Coxey in public as the \\"Cerebrum of Christ\\" and himself as the \\"Cerebellum of Christ,\\" monikers deemed sacrilegious by many devout Christians of the day. Coxey was converted to Browne's unorthodox theological ideas and the pair came to regard their march as an \\"Army of Peace,\\" giving the name \\"Commonweal of Christ\\" to their movement.McMurry, Coxey's Army, pg. 38. This quasi-religious interpretation of the 1894 march movement was broadly ridiculed, generating some publicity for the cause but generally doing \\"a great deal more harm than good,\\" in the estimation of at least one historian.McMurry, Coxey's Army, pg. 39. Arrival and arrest The \\"Commonweal of Christ\\" arrived in Washington, DC on May Day, 1894, with about 400 marchers in the ranks.Alexander, Coxey's Army, pg. 103. Coxey and Brown made their way to the steps of the United States Capitol to address the accompanying crowd, but were blocked by mounted police.Alexander, Coxey's Army, pg. 98. The pair jumped a stone wall in an attempt to reach their goal, along with Christopher Columbus Jones, leader of the marchers from Philadelphia, but police on foot chased the three down and detained them, first holding down Browne and beating him, tearing his clothes and ripping off the amber bead necklace from his neck.Alexander, Coxey's Army, pg. 99. Coxey was released, but Browne and Jones were placed under arrest, with bond posted by two wealthy sympathizers of the marchers. On May 2, Coxey, Browne, and Jones were charged in police court with carrying an illegal banner on capitol grounds, with Coxey and Browne additionally charged with trampling the grass.Alexander, Coxey's Army, pg. 101. A jury trial followed, during which the District Attorney denigrated Browne as \\"a fakir, a charlatan, and a mounteback who dresses up in ridiculous garments and exhibits himself to the curious multitudes at 10 cents a head.\\"Alexander, Coxey's Army, pg. 102. The three defendants were convicted on the morning of May 8 and freed on bond. Sentence was pronounced on May 21, with Coxey and Browne each fined $5 for walking on the grass, and Coxey, Browne, and Jones sentenced to 20 days in jail for carrying banners on capitol grounds.Alexander, Coxey's Army, pg. 105. Later years, death, and legacy Browne married Jacob Coxey's daughter, Mamie, in 1895.Benjamin F. Alexander, Coxey's Army: Popular Protest in the Gilded Age. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2015; pg. 119. According to contemporary press reports, the bride's father did not approve of the union and the marriage was brief, but the pair did live for a time in California, where they were parents to a son. During the decade of the 1910s, Browne tried his hand as an inventor, working on a heavier-than-air flying machine. In January 1914, Browne collapsed and died. He was 64 years old at the time of his death. A committed member of the Socialist Party of America, Browne's Washington, DC, funeral was arranged and financed by his party comrades. No members of the Coxey family are believed to have attended. In 1944, San Francisco socialist William McDevitt published a posthumous pamphlet by Browne, entitled When Coxey Marcht [marched] on Washington. ==FootnotesWorks== * When Coxey's Army Marcht on Washington.

The participants watch the game via live streaming media and use a smartphone app to select the plays. A series of three games were played in May 2018 at Historic Dodgertown in Vero Beach, Florida, and again in 2019 in Jacksonville, Florida, with cash prizes awarded in both series. In February 2020, Your Call Football stated in an Instagram reply that it had no plans to host a 2020 competition as its parent company had moved on to adapting the technology in other sporting environments.https://www.instagram.com/p/B81X9ZpB3Ym/ \\"we don’t have anything planned right now as we are working to integrate predictive technology into other sports. But we miss it!\\" == Founding and development == In 2013, Forrester Research CEO George F. Colony devised the concept for Your Call Football. Colony's concept was to give fans the power to control the outcome of live, professional football games. In September 2017, the company was awarded a patent for its fan play-calling technology. The company announced the awarding of two additional patents for live fan play-calling and the associated scoring algorithm in March 2018. The company also was amenable to having its technology licensed by the NFL for events like the Pro Bowl. == Gameplay ==  On-field rules  The game on the field follows a similar format to that of the NFL, with 11 players on each side of the ball. The main rule differences for Your Call Football games include: * A 45-second play clock to allow time for fan voting * No kickoffs * No punts  Participant interaction and scoring  Prior to each offensive snap, the head coach sends a list of three possible plays for voting to participants' mobile devices. The play with the most votes is executed on the field, and the subsequent results either earn or lose points. Fans who pick the selected play receive a \\"Field Score\\". The scoring system works similarly to that of fantasy football, in which fans can earn or lose points depending on a play's result. A loss of yards or a turnover results in negative points, while a yard-gaining completion or run earns points. Examples of field score include: * 0.1 points per yard gained * 6 points for a touchdown * -3 points for an interception * -3 points for a fumble If a user votes for a different play, he or she is not impacted by the result, but can earn \\"Against the Grain\\" points if the play results in a negative outcome on the field. Fans can also receive \\"Coach Pick\\" bonus points for picking the play that the head coach would have selected. The coach's pick does not overrule the fan-selected vote. Fans' scores are calculated after every play based on the results on the field, and fans with the highest scores on the leaderboard at the end of the half, game and series win cash prizes. ==2018 series== Your Call Football's inaugural series began May 3, 2018 at Historic Dodgertown in Vero Beach, Florida, when its two teams, Power and Grit, competed for the first of three weekly matchups. The teams were composed of former NFL and college players and were coached by former Green Bay Packers and Montreal Alouettes head coach Mike Sherman and former Pittsburgh Steelers running back and ESPN analyst Merril Hoge. The series was streamed on YCF's app and website, and also on YouTube. The on-air broadcasters included Jabari Greer, Jennifer Hale and Justin Kutcher. YCF reported that more than 46,000 fans streamed the games, and more than 295,000 offensive plays were called. Approximately $50,000 in cash prizes was distributed over the course of the series. ==2019 series== The company announced in January 2019 that it would hold a second series beginning February 25 and run for four weeks. The games were held at Dream Finders Homes Flex Field at Daily's Place in Jacksonville, Florida. In addition to $72,000 of cash prizes to be awarded after each quarter, game and for the entire 4 game series, the company announced a \\"$1 Million Perfect Game\\" for fans who earn the maximum number of points possible during any one of the four games. One of the teams was again coached by Merril Hoge, while current broadcaster for Sky Sports and former NFL teammate of Hoge's, Solomon Wilcots, took the place of Mike Sherman. Team Grit won 3 of the 4 games in the series behind the stellar play of former NCAA and James Madison University standout, Vad Lee. For the 2019 series, the XFL used Your Call Football to test proposed rules changes for its inaugural season in 2020.https://www.xfl.com/articles/yourcallfootball == Notable players == Many of the players on the two YCF rosters had played professional football in either the CFL or the NFL. Notable players included wide receiver Robert Meachem, who played in the NFL from 2007 through 2014 as a member of the New Orleans Saints and San Diego Chargers. Meachem was one of four Super Bowl champions in the league, along with B. J. Daniels (Seattle Seahawks), Bernard Pierce and Tommy Streeter (both as members of the Baltimore Ravens). According to the Associated Press, a number of players from Your Call Football's 2018 roster attended NFL minicamps or ended up on NFL or CFL rosters after the series. In 2019, the YCF rosters were made up of many returning players from the original showcase, with additional former Division 1 and NFL mini camp players joining for the new series. == References == Category:American football competitions Category:Interactive media Category:2018 in American football Category:2018 in Florida ","title":"Your Call Football"},{"id":"56106657","text":"Eliphalet S.

Surya is from a middle-class family and lives with his father Ramakrishnan (Rajesh), mother Seetha (Fathima Babu), and little sister Divya (Thanalakshmi). Ramakrishnan advised Surya to be more responsible and find a job as quickly as possible. Surya, with a certificate on hand, decides to look for a job. One day, at a pedestrian crossing, Surya falls in love at first sight with a girl named Pooja (Preethi Varma). Surya starts hanging out with his friends in his lover's college. Surya tries to impress Pooja by acting like a hero and offering her gifts, but she refuses to accept his love. Pooja tells him that she does not believe in love marriage. Surya, with his parents, arranged a meeting at the groom’s house, where he made a marriage proposal to Pooja. Pooja and her family agree to an arranged marriage. Surya and Pooja eventually get married. All of these events turn out to be Surya's imagination. At the pedestrian crossing, Surya is immersed in his dreams and gets hit by a car, so Gayathri (Preethi Varma) takes the seriously wounded Surya to the nearby hospital, and he is saved by the doctors. Afterwards, Surya starts the quest to find his lover Gayathri. Gayathri lives with her aunt Vasantha (Nalini), a ruthless loan shark who wants all of her wealth, and her psychopath cousin Gaja (Babu), who wants to marry her. After the death of her parents, Gayathri found herself alone and became depressed. She needed the love of a person, so she runs away from her aunt's house. Thereafter, she tries to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff, but Surya, who passed through, saves her. Surya then reveals that he is crazy about her and wants to marry her. First completely disoriented, Gayathri finally accepts his proposal. Mad with rage, Vasantha and Gaja are looking for Gayathri.

It is often used on broadcast shortwave receivers or communications receivers and some types of two-way radio transceivers. The noise blanker is only effective on impulse- type noise such as from lightning or from automotive ignition systems, and cannot improve performance on wideband continuous background noise, or interfering signals on the same frequency. Cornell Drentea, Modern Communications Receiver Design and Technology, Artech House, 2010, pp. 316-319 In cases where there are strong signals on frequencies near to the desired frequency, a noise blanker circuit may be ineffective and may reduce the quality of the received signal. Mark J. Wilson (ed.), The ARRL Operating Manual for Radio Amateurs, American Radio Relay League, 2007,, page 6-4 == Implementation == Typically this is a network in the intermediate frequency section of the receiver; when a pulse of noise passes through the IF amplifiers, it is usually of greater amplitude than the desired signal. The noise blanker circuit momentarily reduces the gain of the IF stage during the impulse. More complex noise blankers may use a secondary IF stage and have adjustable threshold and timing characteristics so as to reduce the noise passed through to the audio stages of the receiver. A noise blanker is best applied before any narrow-bandwidth filters in the signal path, so as not to introduce \\"ringing\\" and distortion in the filtered signal. Noise blankers are most useful with amplitude modulation or single sideband signals. Frequency modulation receivers generally include a signal limiter stage which tends to reject noise pulses. ==References== Category:Radio electronics Category:Receiver (radio) ","title":"Noise blanker"},{"id":"56106820","text":"Wilhelm Gross (24 March 1886, Molln – 22 October 1918, Vienna) was an Austrian mathematician, known for the Gross star theorem.Kaplan, Wilfred. Extensions of the Gross star theorem. Michigan Math. J. 2 (1953), no. 2, 105–108. Wilhelm Gross graduated from the Gymnasium in Linz and then studied from 1905 to 1910 at the University of Vienna, where he received his Ph.D. (Promotion) on 20 May 1910 with Wilhelm Wirtinger as thesis advisor. In October 1910 Gross passed his teaching qualification examination in mathematics and physics. After a three-semester stay in Göttingen during the years 1910–1912, he became in 1912 an assistant and from 1913 a Privatdozent at the University of Vienna. In the year 1918 he was promoted there to professor extraordinarius. In the same year he was awarded the Richard Lieben Prize for his research on the calculus of variations, but he died of influenza in the 1918-1920 pandemic.Josef Lense: Groß, Wilhelm, in: Neue Deutsche Biographie 7 (1966), p. 146; Online Gross did research on function theory, differential equations, measure theory, geometry and invariant theory. In function theory he is known for his investigations of singularities of meromorphic functions on Riemann surfaces, in particular, the Gross star theorem. ==Gross star theorem== *Hypothesis: Let f be a meromorphic function which is the ratio of two entire functions. Suppose that z is a complex number which is not a singular point of f. Define w = f(z).

His father was a solicitor and the family was of upper class origins, dating back to ancestors in the former county of Alost (now Alst, in present-day Belgium) including Pietr Damant, Bishop of Ghent, whose tomb can be found there in St Bravos Cathedral. Damant attended a boarding school called the Grange upon the Isle of Wight and later became a naval cadet aboard HMS Britannia. He married Eleanor May Brook on 23 July 1913 and had three children: Eleanor, Tommy, and Mary. Damant died on 29 June 1963 of colon cancer. == Early career == After becoming a naval cadet in 1896 Damant served on a variety of stations before joining HMS Excellent with the intent of becoming a gunnery officer in 1905. During his training, he was given a basic course in diving since gunnery officers were placed in charge of the divers. Being an amateur natural scientist he was fascinated by the underwater world and devoted his career to diving. In 1906 he met John Scott Haldane who was commissioned by the Admiralty to find a way to prevent decompression sickness. Damant volunteered and was allowed to join Haldane as a researcher and experimental diver. This research led to the invention of staged decompression, which is still in use today. Damant as an experimental diver, achieved a world record in deep diving on 31 August 1906 while testing these decompression methods by achieving 210 feet in Loch Striven. Haldane, Damant, and Arthur Edwin Boycott co-authored a paper that disseminated the new knowledge. Damant was named inspector of diving in 1907 and worked on the salvage of several wrecks including (1908) and (1909). He retired from the navy in 1911 as a Lieutenant Commander. == World War I and the Laurentic gold salvage == At the outbreak of World War I, Damant was recalled from the retired list. He served at HMS Excellent as a staff officer until late January 1917 when he was ordered by the Admiralty to recover the forty-four tons of gold bullion that sunk with the Laurentic off Lough Swilly on 25 January 1917. Using the mooring lighter, Volunteer, he and a crew of divers were successful at first and recovered three boxes of the gold. Then late winter gales drove them off the site for a couple of weeks. When they returned, the found the Laurentic crushed like an accordion. Divers, who had been working inside the wreck, were now forced to excavate vertically until they came in touch with the gold again in June and continued salvage operations. By the time salvage was called off in September, Damant and his team had recovered 542 bars out of a total of 3,211 that had gone down with the ship. In 1918, Damant was reassigned under the Naval Intelligence Division headed by Rear Admiral William Reginald Hall to lead a team of covert divers to enter and remove intelligence materials from freshly sunken U-boats. The work took place mostly in the English Channel but took them as far afield as Scapa Flow. They dove upon at least fifteen different wrecks of which approximately seven provided valuable intelligence material. Damant's team, which later entered into popular imagination as the so-called \\"Tin-Openers,\\" materially contributed to the war effort. They were diving right until Armistice Day. For this and his work on the Laurentic, Damant was inducted into the Order of the British Empire (military division). After the war, Damant returned to the Laurentic salvage and continued to work on the project until 1924. He and his team were highly successful, recovering all but 25 bars of gold. In subsequent years, private salvage companies recovered another five, leaving twenty bars of gold still under the wreck. To date, the salvage is the largest recovery of sunken gold by weight in history. == Subsequent career == After the war, Damant was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1924 Birthday Honours and promoted to Captain on the retired list. He retired to Cowes on the Isle of Wight and continued to consult on deep sea diving and salvage matters until his death in 1963. == See also == * * ==References== Category:1881 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Sailors from the Isle of Wight Category:Royal Navy officers of World War I Category:British divers Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire ","title":"Guybon Chesney Castell Damant"},{"id":"56106885","text":"is a song recorded by Japanese singer Shizuka Kudo.

It was adopted by the 37th Plenary meeting of the tenth emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly during the tenure of the seventy-second session of the United Nations General Assembly on 21 December 2017. The draft resolution was drafted by Yemen and Turkey. Though strongly contested by the United States, it passed by 128 votes to 9 against with 21 absentees and 35 abstentions. ==Background== On 6 December 2017, US President Donald Trump said that he would recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital and begin the process of moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This was a departure from previous Security Council resolutions and prevailing international norms (where no state either recognises Jerusalem as a national capital nor has an embassy there). After a United Nations Security Council resolution was vetoed by the U.S. three days earlier, Palestinian UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour said that the General Assembly would vote on a draft resolution calling for Trump’s declaration to be withdrawn. He sought to invoke Resolution 377, known as the \\"Uniting for Peace\\" resolution, to circumvent a veto. The resolution states that the General Assembly can call an Emergency Special Session to consider a matter \\"with a view to making appropriate recommendations to members for collective measures\\" if the Security Council fails to act. ==Campaign== On 20 December, US President Donald Trump threatened to cut US aid to countries voting against the US's side. The day before the vote, he said: \\"Let them vote against us...We don't care...this isn't like it used to be where they could vote against you and then you pay them hundreds of millions of dollars. We're not going to be taken advantage of any longer.\\" Ambassador Nikki Haley warned her country would remember and \\"take names\\" of every country that voted in favour of the resolution. The governments of Turkey and Iran denounced the threats made by the US as \\"anti-democratic\\" and \\"blackmail\\". Haley had sent a letter to dozens of member states that warned Trump had asked her to \\"report back on those countries who voted against us.\\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said \\"I call on the whole world: Don't you dare sell your democratic struggle and your will for petty dollars\\" and warned Trump that \\"he cannot buy Turkey's democratic will with his dollars.\\" He added: \\"I hope and expect the US won't get the result it expects from there (UN) and the world will give a very good lesson to the United States\\". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel rejects this vote before it passes and called the UN a \\"house of lies\\". Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the PLO’s Executive Committee, condemned Trump's warning to countries receiving aid from the US: \\"Trump should know that there are things that are not for sale or subject to blackmail, particularly issues of principle, legality and morality.\\" Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland's spokesman, a country which was seeking re-negotiations of the NAFTA, confirmed its intention to abstain from the vote and that the resolution should not have come to the General Assembly. ==Content== The text of the resolution includes the following key statements: > The General Assembly, *Bearing in mind the specific status of the Holy City > of Jerusalem and, in particular, the need for the protection and > preservation of the unique spiritual, religious and cultural dimensions of > the City, as foreseen in the relevant United Nations resolutions, *Stressing > that Jerusalem is a final status issue to be resolved through negotiations > in line with relevant United Nations resolutions, *Expressing in this regard > its deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem, > *Affirms that any decisions and actions which purport to have altered, the > character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem > have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded in compliance > with relevant resolutions of the Security Council, and in this regard, calls > upon all States to refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in > the Holy City of Jerusalem, pursuant to resolution 478 (1980) of the > Security Council; * Demands that all States comply with Security Council > resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem, and not to recognize any > actions or measures contrary to those resolutions; *Reiterates its call for > the reversal of the negative trends on the ground that are imperiling the > two-State solution and for the intensification and acceleration of > international and regional efforts and support aimed at achieving, without > delay, a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East on the > basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions, the Madrid terms of > reference, including the principle of land for peace, the Arab Peace > Initiative and the Quartet Roadmap and an end to the Israeli occupation that > began in 1967. ==Motion== The motion was proposed by Yemen and Turkey. Debate In introducing the resolution as chair of the Arab Group, Yemen's Ambassador said the US decision was a \\"blatant violation of the rights of the Palestinian people, as well as those of all Christians and Muslims.\\" He emphasized that it constituted a \\"dangerous breach of the Charter of the United Nations and a serious threat to international peace and security, while also undermining the chances for a two‑State solution and fuelling the fires of violence and extremism.\\" Turkey, who was the co-sponsor of the draft resolution, also spoke as current chair of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said that Trump’s decision was an outrageous assault to all universal values. \\"The Palestinians have the right to their own state based on 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital. This is the main parameter and only hope for a just and lasting peace in the region. However, the recent decision of a UN Member State to recognise Jerusalem, or Al-Quds, as the capital of Israel, violates international law, including all relevant UN resolutions.\\" The General Assembly heard from Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki, who said that the meeting was \\"not because of any animosity to the United States of America\\" but instead the sessions was \\"called to make the voice of the vast majority of the international community — and that of people around the world — heard on the question of Jerusalem/Al‑Quds Al‑Sharif.\\" He called the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and to move its embassy there \\"an aggressive and dangerous move\\" which could inflame tensions and lead to a religious war that \\"has no boundaries.\\" He added that though the decision would have no impact on the city’s status, it would nevertheless compromise the role of the United States in the Middle East peace process. He urged member states to reject \\"blackmail and intimidation.\\" US Ambassador Nikki Haley then said that her country was \\"singled out for attack\\" because of its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. She added that: \\"The United States will remember this day in which it was singled out for attack in the General Assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation,” Haley said. \\"We will remember it when we are called upon to once again make the world’s largest contribution to the United Nations, and so many countries come calling on us, as they so often do, to pay even more and to use our influence for their benefit.\\" She added that: \\"America will put our embassy in Jerusalem. That is what the American people want us to do, and it is the right thing to do. No vote in the United Nations will make any difference on that...this vote will make a difference in how Americans view the UN.\\" Israel's Ambassador Danny Danon then told the assembly that the vowed that \\"no General Assembly resolution will ever drive us from Jerusalem.\\" Venezuela’s ambassador, speaking for the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), expressed \\"grave concern about Israel’s ongoing violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including attempts to alter the character, status and demographic composition of the City of Jerusalem. [It was] slso concerned about the decision to relocate the United States embassy [and] warned that such provocative actions would further heighten tensions, with potentially far‑reaching repercussions given the extremely volatile backdrop. Other speakers included Pakistan, Indonesia, Maldives, Syria, Bangladesh, Cuba, Iran, and China. Malaysia's Ambassador Datuk Seri Mohammed Shahrul Ikram Yaakob said that, as a member of the OIC and NAM, \\"Malaysia joins the international community in expressing our deep concern and rejects the decision by the United States to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. It is also an infringement of the Palestinian people’s rights and their right to self determination.\\" He called for a peaceful two-state solution and that Malaysia is concerned the situation will only feed into the agenda of extremists.\\" Other speakers included, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Africa. The Permanent Observer for the Holy See, Tomasz Grysa, emphasised that Jerusalem was most sacred to the Abrahamic faiths and a symbol for millions of believers around the world who considered it their \\"spiritual capital.\\" Its significance went \\"beyond the question of borders, a reality that should be considered a priority in every negotiation for a political solution.\\" The Holy See, he said, called for a \\"peaceful resolution that would ensure respect for the sacred nature of Jerusalem and its universal value...reiterating that only international guarantee could preserve its unique character and status and provide assurance of dialogue and reconciliation for peace in the region.\\" After the motion was passed, more speeches continued with Estonia, who also spoke on behalf of other states. Australia’s Ambassador then explained her country’s government did \\"not support unilateral action that undermined the peace process [and] it did not believe today’s text would help to bring the parties back to the negotiating table.\\" Other speakers included, Paraguay, whose Ambassador said that the country would abstain because \\"the question of Jerusalem was a matter for the Security Council, as the primary body responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security.\\" This was followed by El Salvador, Argentina and Romania. Canada's Ambassador Marc-Andre Blanchard called the proposal \\"one-sided\\" and said: \\"We are disappointed that this resolution is one sided and does not advance prospects for peace to which we aspire, which is why we have abstained on today’s vote.\\" He, however, added that Canada wanted to emphasise Jerusalem's special significance to the Abrahamic religions of Jews, Muslims and Christians. \\"Denying the connection between Jerusalem and the Jewish, Muslim and Christian faiths undermines the integrity of the site for all. We also reiterate the need to maintain the status quo at Jerusalem’s Holy sites. Nicaragua explained its support of the resolution, as it \\"rebuffed recent unilateral attempts to modify the character and status of Jerusalem. Such unilateral actions were in blatant violation of resolution 2234 (2016) and others...unilateral actions jeopardised peace and stability in the Middle East and drew the international community further away from a solution.\\" Mexico’s ambassador then explained the abstention and emphasised that convening an emergency session was a disproportionate response. \\"The United States must become part of the solution, not a stumbling block that would hamper progress...the international community was further than ever from agreement.\\" The Czech Republic then said that while it supported the European Union position, it had abstained because it \\"did not believe the draft resolution would contribute to the peace process.\\" Armenia said that is position \\"remained unchanged. The situation should be resolved through negotiations paving the way for lasting peace and security.\\" Hungary echoed Armenia's stance and said it would not comment on the foreign relations of the United States. Latvia then spoke, before Estonia re-took the floor to say it had also spoken on behalf of Albania, Lithuania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

During the 2018 State of the Union Address, Trump said that the countries which voted against the resolution opposed the United States' \\"sovereign right to make this recognition\\" and said he would ask Congress to pass legislation which would ensure foreign aid would \\"only go to America's friends, not enemies of America.\\" * – Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the result shortly after it was announced in call it \\"preposterous,\\" while he also thanked the states that supported \\"the truth\\" by not participating in \\"the theater of the absurd.\\" He added that: \\"Jerusalem is our capital. Always was, always will be...But I do appreciate the fact that a growing number of countries refused to participate in this theatre of the absurd. So I appreciate that, and especially I want to again express our thanks to [US] President (Donald) Trump and Ambassador [Nikki] Haley, for their stalwart defense of Israel and their stalwart defense of the truth.\\" Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman, reminded Israelis of the longstanding Israeli disdain for such votes. \\"Let us just remember that this is the same UN about which our first ambassador to the organization, Abba Eban, once said: 'If Algeria introduced a resolution declaring that the earth was flat and that Israel had flattened it, it would pass by a vote of 164 to 13 with 26 abstentions'. There is nothing new in what just happened at the UN.\\" He also praised the US as \\"the moral beacon shining out of the darkness.\\" Minister of Strategic Affairs and Public Security Gilad Erdan said: \\"The historic connection between Israel and Jerusalem is stronger than any vote by the 'United Nations' — nations who are united only by their fear and their refusal to recognize the simple truth that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and the Jewish people.\\" *However, opposition Joint List Chairman and MK Ayman Odeh called the vote a wake-up call for Israel: \\"In the international arena, there still exists a large and definitive majority that believes that the Palestinian people, like all other nations, deserve a place in this world and the right to self-determination. This evening's vote by the majority of the world's nations against Trump's announcement, in spite of the pressure and threats, flies in the face of Trump's and Netanyahu's diplomatic policy and is a clear statement by the international community in support of peace and the right of the Palestinians to an independent state, whose capital is East Jerusalem.\\" * – A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the vote \\"a victory for Palestine;\\" Abbas himself thanked the member states who voted in support of the resolution \\"in spite of the pressures they faced.\\" UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour called the vote \\"a massive setback\\" for the US. * – Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammad Javad Zarif called the result a \\"resounding global no\\" to the Trump administration's \\"thuggish intimidation.\\" * – Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa said that it was \\"unhelpful to pick up a fight with Trump over a side issue and urged countries to concentrate on the threat posed by \\"theo-fascist\\" Iran instead.\\" **Israel's Foreign Affairs Ministry reacted in writing on Twitter that Khalifa had denounced an Arab boycott of Israel and confirmed Bahraini citizens were free to visit Israel. **Iran responded to this by saying that \\"Palestine's freedom from the clutches of Israeli occupation remains the Islamic world's highest priority\\" and that \\"despite all complex plots, manufactured crises and fictitious threats propagated by the US-Zionism axis, Palestine still is and will remain the Islamic world's number one priority until it is liberated, and no one... can distract Muslims from this serious issue.\\" * – Jimmy Morales, the president of Guatemala, one of the nine countries which voted against the resolution, announced on 24 December 2017 that he would follow Trump in move his country's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. ;Media Haaretz's Noa Landau, wrote, in citing unnamed diplomatic sourced, that Israel was particularly disappointed with countries like India that have enhanced bilateral relations with it recently. \\"The main disappointment in Israel was with the countries that have enhanced bilateral relations in recent years, especially those that share a particularly conservative worldview with the Netanyahu government. For example, India – whose Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, visited Israel in July, a tour that was memorable mainly for the pastoral photographs of him and Netanyahu embracing and wading in the waves – voted for the resolution against Israel and the United States.\\" ;Others At a \\"Solidarity to Save Jerusalem\\" rally organised by the Barisan Nasional government in Malaysia, one of the attendees Association of NextGen Christians of Malaysia President Joshua Hong said at the Putra Mosque: \\"We are here because we feel that the decision made by President Trump on announcing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is merely a political decision. He added that the decision also hurts Christian and Arabic churches in Palestine and not just the Muslims. \\"To us as Christians, Jerusalem is a city of peace and after that announcement, we feel there is no more peace. I think it is not right and unjust. We believe we should continue pursuing the sustainable peace solution for Palestine and Israel, rather than just a single nation declaring it just like that.\\" He claimed that about 50 members of the group turned up in a show of support for the Palestinian people. ==See also== *United Nations General Assembly Resolution 43/177 *United Nations General Assembly Resolution 67/19 *List of United Nations resolutions concerning Israel *List of United Nations resolutions concerning Palestine *United Nations General Assembly resolution ==ReferencesExternal links== *History of key resolutions in the Israel-Palestine conflict Category:2017 in international relations Category:2017 in Israel Category:2017 in the State of Palestine Category:2017 in the United Nations Category:December 2017 events Category:Israel, Palestine, and the United Nations Category:State of Palestine Category:United Nations General Assembly resolutions concerning Israel Category:United Nations General Assembly resolutions ","title":"United Nations General Assembly resolution ES-10/L.22"},{"id":"56106912","text":"Ramigekko swartbergensis, sometimes called the Swartberg (African) leaf-toed gecko, is a species of African gecko which is a localized endemic of the Cape Fold Belt in South Africa.

Immigrant Entrepreneurship: \\"German American Biographies: \\"Carl Morris Loeb\\" Retrieved December 21, 2017 Hochschild moved to the U.S. in 1884 and the firm was incorporated in New York in 1887. AMCO started out as an agent for Metallgesellschaft AG of Germany, the Henry R. Merton & Co. (founded by the brother of Wilhelm Ralph Merton) of the United Kingdom, and the Société Le Nickel of France (founded by the Rothschild family). Also in 1887, Jacob Langeloth, an executive of Metallgesellschaft in Germany moved to New York to assist Hochschild. The company experienced rapid growth due to a surge in demand for copper especially in Germany which then consumed 1/3rd of U.S. exports. Under Langeloth, AMCO expanded into production, opening refining plants for lead and copper. 1910s to 1920s Prior to World War I, AMCO made a minority investment in Climax Molybdenum Company, the world's largest producer of molybdenum named after the Climax mine; the investment paid off due to increased demand from the war.National Mining Hall of Fame: \\"Hochschild, Harold K.\\" retrieved November 29, 2017 In 1914, after the sudden death of Langeloth, Carl M. Loeb, previously a branch manager, became president of AMCO.Stack, Elizabeth. Immigrant Entrepreneurship: \\"German American Biographies: \\"Carl Morris Loeb\\" Retrieved December 21, 2017 Loeb vertically integrated the company by expanding into the ownership of smelting and refining facilities while securing his supply of raw materials by signing exclusive contracts with large mines to purchase their entire output; and then processing them at AMCO-owned facilities. He also expanded AMCO's activities into Mexico with investments in lead, silver and zinc mining first as an agent for its parent Metallgesellschaft and later as a direct owner during World War I. In 1917, AMCO refined 250 million pounds of copper, 547 million pounds of zinc, and 168 million pounds of lead. Before the United States entered World War I in October 1917, Metallgesellschaft (then led by Richard Merton, the son of Wilhelm Ralph Merton), transferred its 51% ownership in AMCO to several American citizens who were also AMCO managers. Once the US entered the war, the US passed the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 which required that German-owned business assets be held by the Office of Alien Property Custodian. Despite Merton's efforts to hide Metallgesellschaft's ownership, Loeb reported to the agency that the assets were in reality still owned by their German parent and the stock was then transferred into a trust which was supervised by Henry Morgenthau Sr., Berthold Hochschild, and Joseph F. Guffey. In 1918, the Alien Property Custodian sold the 51% stake it had confiscated at a public auction for $5.75 million with many of the shares being purchased by a syndicate of investors including Ludwig Vogelstein (who had 20%), Berthold Hochschild, and Loeb. In 1920, Berthold Hochschild was appointed chairman of the board with Loeb as president with and various investors as vice presidents including Otto Sussman, Henry Bruère, Harold K. Hochschild, Carl's brother Julius Loeb, and Vogelstein. Later, Andrew Mellon joined the board to represent the government's interest. In 1921, Richard Merton filed a claim with the government asserting that the confiscation of AMCO shares was unlawful as the shares had been transferred to a Swiss subsidiary before the U.S. involvement in World War I; he also bribed some government officials to assist in his recovery. Unfortunately for Merton, the bribes were exposed and the claim rejected (and President Harding's Attorney General Harry Daugherty was tried twice and acquitted twice for his alleged involvement while Alien Property Custodian Thomas W. Miller was convicted). 1930s to 1950s In 1929, Loeb resigned as AMCO's president over a disagreement in AMCO's taking on debt to fund the purchase of copper mining interests in Africa (previously, AMCO had minimized its ownership in mines and instead relied on exclusive supply contracts). The board purchased Loeb's 80,000 shares for eighty-five dollars apiece which was fortuitous for Loeb as the Wall Street Crash of 1929 followed later in the year. In 1930, AMCO purchased a major interest in two of the world's largest copper mines in Africa, including the Roan Antelope Copper Mine in Luanshya (in the Copperbelt Province) and the Rhodesian Selection Trust (formed in 1928 by Irish-American mining magnate Alfred Chester Beatty). In 1934, Harold K. Hochschild was elected president of AMCO, and Otto Sussman succeeded the late Ludwig Vogelstein as chairman of the board. During World War II, the business boomed, thanks to the demand brought about by the war. Under Harold Hochschild's tenure, AMCO expanded into petroleum, potash, and silver. In 1947, Harold was elected as board chairman; in 1950, he was replaced as president by his brother, Walter Hochschild. Merger In 1957, the American Metal Company merged with the Climax Molybdenum Company. The new entity was renamed AMAX Inc. and Harold Hochschild retired as director. In 1993, AMAX merged with the Cyprus Mines Corporation to form Cyprus Amax Minerals Company, the world's leading producer of molybdenum and lithium, and a leading producer of copper and coal. In 1999, Cyprus Amax Minerals was acquired by Phelps Dodge Corporation which in turn was acquired by Freeport- McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) in 2007, forming the world's largest copper producer. ==ReferencesExternal links== *AMERICAN METAL COMPANY (LIMITED), THE Trademarks Category:American companies established in 1887 Category:Zinc mining companies ","title":"American Metal Company"},{"id":"56107088","text":"Hollywood is a Brazilian brand of cigarettes, currently owned and manufactured by Souza Cruz, a subsidiary of British American Tobacco. Is one of the best- known and sold cigarette brands in Brazil, just behind the Derby brand. ==History== In 1903, Albino Souza Cruz, a manufacturer of cigarettes, settled in Rio de Janeiro and created a company to sell different brands of cigarettes. In 1931, he announced the launch of the Hollywood cigarettes, which gradually became famous for using a slogan known as \\"success\\". In the early 1970s, Souza Cruz invented the slogan \\"Isto é Hollywood\\" (\\"This is Hollywood\\"), popularizing the image through rustic and well related young practicing extreme sports. The motto remains alive to this day: \\"\\"Isto é Hollywood O Sucesso\\" (\\"This is Hollywood success\\"). The \\"young\\" practicing various kinds of sports, who were the characters in the TV advertisements, were responsible for the success of the brand by associating it with the idea of adventure. The appeal took, too, to the patronage of a pioneer rock festival organized in Brazil, Hollywood Rock, in the summer of 1975 in Rio de Janeiro. The event was recorded in the breakneck pace of the same year. In the 1990s, more ads were displayed, of which the \\"Flying Lap\\" commercial was one of them.. TV sponsorship for Hollywood, as well as various other brands, ended once the Brazilian parliament voted to repeal cigarette advertisements on public television. As of 2016, the brand Marlboro has surpassed Hollywood as the most popular brand, making it the second most popular brand in Brazil. ==Sponsorships== 1976 March 761 c/n 761-8, raced by Robin Hunter at the 2011 Monterey Historics Races at Laguna Seca.

His mother was Jerri Edwards, a third grade school teacher. She died on November 8, 2005. His father was Charles Alexander. He was predominantly raised by his grandmother, Jean Williamson. Mo Alexander went to the predominantly black private catholic school, Father Bertrand Elementary, where he balanced being a computer nerd and playing basketball while trying to find his place. This is where he found that humor would get him out of bad situations. His high school years were spent at Memphis Catholic High School hanging out with the nerdier set of kids who also had his twisted version of humor.

In his senior year he was at school from 6am until 8pm nightly because of sports. He was a wrestler, a cheerleader, and the school mascot. Unlike most mascots, Mo was not silent. He was never afraid to take a mic and make the crowds rowdy. After Graduating he moved on to the university of Memphis where he majored in Physics and minored in Theatre. He quit there in 1994 when he decided he wanted to do comedy full-time and didn’t want to have a degree to fall back on. He believed “if I have something to fall back on I won’t try hard enough in comedy.” Later in a conversation, Keenen Ivory Wayans told him the same thing. Mo is a hardcore University of Memphis Tigers fan. ==Personal life== rightthumb The Viper Room In 1999, Mo visited the Viper Room in West Hollywood, CA.

When security was not forthcoming with an answer, he began demonstrating various death poses on the ground near the door and was subsequently physically removed from the nightclub. He would later learn that the band performing that night was Recreational Racism fronted by Maynard James Keenan of Tool. Due to a foot injury that resulted in immobility, Mo Alexander suffered a bilateral embolism that resulted in his two minute death on Easter Sunday, April 5, 2015. He underwent 7 surgeries due to complications and after being hospitalized for 77 days at Methodist University Hospital in Memphis, Tn, he then spent an additional 13 days in a physical rehabilitation center. Seven days later he was performing on stage at the 2015 Chicago Comedy Exposition in Chicago, Illinois despite being in a wheelchair and has been busy touring ever since. == Discography/Videography == {  + !Title !Year !CD !DVD !Digital - Mo Files 2000 x   - Evolution 2006 x x x - Nappy Headed Hoes and Other FCC Infractions 2008 x  x - Just in Case the Mayans are Right 2012   x - Got Clots 2016   x } == Filmography == * Get Serious (1995) * A Letter From Death Row (1998) * Sicc in the Head (2014) == Television == * Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher (1999) * Who's Laughing Now?

It was undertaken by English forces and their Gascon subjects against Charles II of Albret, a powerful nobleman in southwestern France. Albret was hostile to the English and his presence in Gascony caused much trouble to the English in the region, thereby raising the need to strike against him. The bulk of hostilities only lasted up until early 1441: the siege had dragged on inconclusively, and peace terms were agreed between the attackers and defenders. The ceasefire was extended several times until mid-1442 as both sides awaited further support from England and France. The conduct of this affair became an important subject as one of the arrangements concluded in 1441 stated that Albret had to switch his allegiance if his suzerain, Charles VII of France, failed to aid him against his enemies. This had in fact raised the possibility of the entire nobility of southwestern France switching their allegiance to the English. Nothing came of it, however. Undermanned and outnumbered, the English withdrew in face of an approaching French army on 24 June 1442. ==Context== Gascon fiefs in the alt=Map depicting the vassal holdings of the duchy of Gascony. The stronghold of Tartas was located halfway between the towns of Dax and Mont-de-Marsan, in what would later become the Landes department, all in the region of Gascony in southwestern France. The town is crossed by the Midouze, a tributary of the Adour. Tartas was the capital of the namesake viscounty of Tartas, which in turn was held, since 1338, in personal union with the bordering lordship of Albret, owned by the House of Albret, one of the most powerful and influential noble families in the region. The House of Albret had been attached to the English cause in the 14th century, as vassal in Aquitaine under Edward, the Black Prince, but switched sides in the late 1360s and was aligned to the House of Valois ever since. The Lord of Albret at the time of the siege of Tartas was Charles II. His presence was a thorn to the English in Gascony as he constantly raided their territories in the region. A neutralization of Albret by the English would strengthen their positions in Gascony and protect their territories from French raids and attacks. Repeated French threats in Gascony did not go unnoticed by the government in England. In 1439, the English sent to the region an army of 2,300 men (2,000 archers and 300 men-at- arms) under the command of John Holland, Earl of Huntingdon, appointed lieutenant of Aquitaine on 27 March. Holland landed with his force at Bordeaux on 2 August 1439, and was shortly afterwards joined by sir Thomas Rempston (the English seneschal of Guyenne) and by other important English-attached figures in the region. Anticipating an Anglo-Gascon onslaught, in October 1439 the French Estates of Languedoc in southern France assembled at Castres and raised a subsidy to defend Guyenne and Gascony against Holland's army. Charles VII, the King of France, financed the potential expenses the Lord of Albret might have in order to defend his lands from the English. The manpower and nobility of southwestern France were mobilized in preparation for a possible upcoming confrontation. ==Development of the siege (1440)== Smaller version of the 1612 illustration of the fortified town. The fortifications and hilly landscape present a difficulty for attackers. In order to initiate a campaign in the region, the English tried to secure support and funding from their Gascon subjects. Two of the three Gascon Estates of Lannes, the provincial assembly of English Gascony, agreed to fund an English army for a 6-month siege of the town of Tartas. They also requested Huntingdon that Thomas Rempston should lead the besieging force, due to the large size of the defending garrison. Rempston positioned his army, numbering about 100 men-at- arms, 400 archers, and several artillery pieces, around the town's walls on 31 August. As the siege progressed, it was noted that Tartas was well defended and well supplied, and the English would likely not be able to take it before the stipulated 6 months. Charles II of Albret and his nephew John, Viscount of Lomagne (eldest son and heir of John IV, Count of Armagnac, another powerful nobleman in the region), attempted to raise the siege by ravaging nearby English lands, in particular the Chalosse and the lands of the Lord of Lescun (Rempston's lieutenant), which in turn included Coudures, Audignon, Sainte- Colombe, and Eyres. This did not deter the English from their objective, however, and the siege dragged on. In late 1440, the Earl of Huntingdon was recalled to England, where he arrived on 21 December. The exact cause for this is not known, but apparently his indentures were not being fulfilled by the English government. This left Thomas Rempston as the main English commander in the region, but otherwise the English affairs in Gascony were left without a unified command. After more than 4 months, the city was damaged, and the citizens inside were suffering with hunger and poverty. Albret's men were exhausted after a long resistance and after fruitless raids, while the besiegers weren't making enough progress. Eventually, both sides agreed to initiate peace talks. Albret sent his nephew, the viscount of Lomagne, and his ambassadors (which included a nephew of La Hire), to meet with the English delegation to discuss terms of conditional surrender. They met at Saint-Sever with representatives of the Gascon Estates of Lannes, and managed to reach an agreement. Albret, located at Coudures, endorsed the agreed provisions on 3 January 1441, followed by Rempston on the following day, and both of them formalized the agreement by signing a treaty on 20 January. ==Peace agreement (1441)== Both parties agreed to a 3-month truce, an exchange of hostages, and the establishment of a provisional government over the town. As a guarantee to enforce the terms, the Lord of Albret handed Tartas over to Charles, his underage son, who would be placed under the tutelage of several prominent Gascon figures who were attached to the English. The town would, in effect, be placed under joint control by Albret and the English. The inhabitants were to be allowed to freely maintain their relations with the rest of Gascony as they wished. The most important point agreed, however, was one that stipulated that a trial of strength would be held at Tartas between the French and the English on the day the truce ended, and that the strongest side left standing would be awarded control of the town. Furthermore, if the English emerged victorious, Albret's lands would be handed to his son Charles, who in turn would pledge allegiance to the English. Should he refuse, the Albret family lands would be forfeited and absorbed into the royal domain of the Lancastrian crown. Albret had essentially agreed that if his overlord, Charles VII of France, failed to come to his aid, he would switch his allegiance, thus placing all of his lands under the suzerainty of the English. He promptly requested help from Charles VII. Though it could be thought that a small Gascon town would not have concerned the king much in normal circumstances, the consequences of a potential defection from one of his most powerful vassals in Gascony would be disastrous for the Valois regime in southwestern France. Charles VII would see large amounts of land in the region immediately and suddenly pass over to English control, more so since Albret's noble neighbours in the Midi-Pyrénées perhaps would also feel compelled to follow suit, for fear of having their lands invaded by the English. Gascony would be placed firmly under enemy hands. With the support of the southwestern French nobility, the English would be able to focus their energies more in defending northern France, strengthening their hold on the entirety of their French territories. The capitulation created a challenge to Charles VII. The King of France, whose disputed legitimacy to such title was the cause of the whole war itself, was expected to protect his vassals in times of adversity, and failure to do so would justify Albret and other vassals recognizing as king another (in this case the King of England) who could do a better job of offering protection. This was especially true since Albret's family had been strong supporters of the House of Valois: Albret's father Charles I had died while commanding the French armies at the Battle of Agincourt, while Charles II had fought with Joan of Arc and held Charles VII's sword during the latter's coronation in 1429. A lack of action from Charles VII would constitute an insult to Albret, and would undermine the trust and confidence of the French king's other vassals. It was thus imperative for both claimants to the French throne to show up and demonstrate their power in this stipulated show of force. Southwestern France was home to several influential nobles, such as the Counts of Armagnac, Foix, and Comminges, whose support would determine the balance of power in the region. Their allegiance was vital to the continued war effort of either side. ==Intrigues in France and England (1441–1442)== The situation didn't seem too promising for the English, however. The confrontation had been scheduled to 1 May 1441, the day the 3-month truce would expire, but the English in Gascony were lacking men and resources, which forced the local English captains to postpone the show of force several times. Ever since the Earl of Huntingdon was recalled to England in late 1440, English affairs in Gascony were left without an ultimate direction, and the English crown was finding it increasingly difficult to worry about its Gascon territories, as the focus was on defending northern France from attacks by Charles VII. Though the Gascon Estates sent emissaries to England in February 1441 to update King Henry VI on the situation and to request aid, little to no help was forthcoming for the time being. The show of force was eventually stipulated to happen on St. John's Day (24 June) of 1442. This agreement paralyzed Gascony for 18 months. The English king's uncle and heir presumptive Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, criticized the English crown's neglect for Gascony and its failure to properly support the Earl of Huntingdon in the region. He warned that English positions in Gascony would be vulnerable to an attack by forces of the houses of Albret, Foix, and Armagnac, the most powerful families in southwestern France, all of whom were nominally loyal to the House of Valois. Gloucester advocated for an active policy of intervention to protect English territories. His influence was limited however, as Henry VI was increasingly favourable to his uncle's rival, Cardinal Henry Beaufort, and his policy of reconciliation, over Humphrey's irredentism. Charles VII of France also faced his own problems. He led a difficult campaign against the English in the Île- de-France in 1441, and in early 1442, he had a meeting at Nevers with his some of his leading nobles, who made various requests not too dissimilar to those which formed the pretext of the Praguerie revolt two years earlier. Among these nobles were the Dukes of Orléans and Burgundy, whose families had previously been mortal enemies in the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War several decades earlier, but were now close political allies. Furthermore, Count John IV of Armagnac (one of Charles VII's more rebellious nobles) had been negotiating his daughter's marriage to the king of England himself, which would have strengthened the English position in Gascony, and helped to sway other French nobles to the English side. While Gascony stood on the sidelines, the English captain Thomas Rempston, at this point the main English figure in southwestern France, hoped to exploit the diplomatic advantage and took the time to try to extend the truce to the entirety of Guyenne. He engaged in negotiations with other nearby hostile French nobles. On 8 August 1441 he concluded a truce with the viscounts of Limoges and Turenne (nephew of Pope Gregory XI), who held lands not far from Bordeaux. At the Nevers meeting of 1442, the Duke of Orléans tried advocating for peace between France and England, not forgetting the promise he made to the English after his release in 1440. Charles VII however was determined to lift the siege of Tartas at once without delay. Charles ignored the demands of his vassals and skillfully dismissed them, and prepared a large expedition to Gascony, the so-called \\"Journée de Tartas\\". ==Journée de Tartas== Vigiles de Charles VII, 15th century) Charles VII assembled a large army, essentially provided by smaller nobility, as his leading vassals and princes of blood, the dukes of Orléans, Burgundy, Alençon, and Bourbon, who were all at odds with their overlord, did not bother contributing to the force. At the same time, the Count of Armagnac was in the process of negotiating a marriage alliance with the English. The French army was commanded by Charles VII and by the constable of France, Arthur de Richemont. Jean Bureau was in charge of the artillery, and the Counts of Maine and Eu served as marshals. The force departed in May 1442 from the region of Limousin, arrived at Figeac on 2 June, and finally at Toulouse on 8 June. They left Toulouse on 11 June, after which the army was temporarily split due to logistical problems, with Richemont assuming command of the left wing and Charles VII of the right wing. Richemont's forces went through Riscle and Grenade, bypassed Saint-Sever which was occupied by the English, and avoided crossing the Adour river. Charles VII's troops passed through Auch, Vic, Nogaro, and Le Houga. The French army further split into several companies who went through different roads, with several towns refusing them obedience, the companies themselves being unable to stop the march and retaliate. The army's parts joined again at Mont-de-Marsan, where Charles VII arrived on 21 June. The French captain La Hire arrived the following day, after, according to legend, having fought a group of English routiers and assaulted a castle close to Ygos. On 23 June, Charles VII stayed in the fortified town of Meilhan (which belonged to the Count of Foix), and in the following day he went to Tartas along the Midouze river. On 24 June, the French showed up at Tartas with about 12,000 men. As no English force showed up, the French troops didn't bother assuming a full battle formation. Only a skirmish was reported east of the city, but otherwise no significant confrontation happened, and the English and their Gascon allies didn't try to resist. Arthur de Richemont was received by the Lord of Cauna and by Augerot de Saint-Per, both of whom were important figures in the region and who were attached to the English cause. Accompanied by their hostage, the young Charles d'Albret, they handed the keys of the town to Richemont. Perhaps fearful of losing his lands, the Lord of Cauna afterwards paid homage to Charles VII, but Saint-Per remained faithful to the English party and took refuge in nearby Dax. The whole episode at Tartas thus rendered no benefit for the English, and the French emerged victorious. ==Aftermath== The French continued campaigning in Gascony. They succeeded in taking tows such as Dax, Condom, Marmande, and Saint-Sever, but failed to take the two most important cities, Bordeaux and Bayonne. Saint-Sever switched hands multiple times, but eventually fell to the French, and Thomas Rempston, the English seneschal, was captured there. After taking La Réole on 8 December (where Charles VII was almost burnt within a house which was set on fire), the French withdrew to Montauban on 23 of the same month to spend the winter, marking the end of the campaign. The captain La Hire died there on 11 January 1443. In all of this, English Gascony had been left to fend for itself, as still no support came from home. Henry VI received a letter from his secretary Thomas Beckington, dated on 18 October 1442, which informed the king about the enemy's progress in Guyenne and the capture of La Réole. It also complained about the lack of support from the English crown in the situation, stating that a few reinforcements would have stopped the French advance and even resulted in the possible capture of Charles VII himself. It is not totally clear whether the English crown couldn't send men or if the lack of action was the result of neglect from Henry VI's ministers. Dax eventually fell back to the English with the help of pro-English elements in the region. But otherwise this show of strength by the French went to show the decline of English power and influence in France. On 11 May 1443, the Gascon Estates of Lannes, previously loyal to the English, were incorporated into the realm of Charles VII. A seneschal of Lannes had been appointed by the French king on 9 January.

It referred to the ongoing War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) which Britain was leading participant in. It implied that no peace treaty could be agreed with Britain's principal enemy Louis XIV of France that allowed Philip, the French candidate, to retain the Spanish crown. The term became a rallying cry for opposition to the Tory government of Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford and the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht. ==Origin== The Duke of Marlborough was closely associated with Britain's war effort until his dismissal in 1711. He then joined with Whig politicians to oppose the Peace of Utrecht. The phrase was first popularly used by the Tory politician Lord Nottingham in Parliament in December 1711.Pearce p.54 However it was soon adopted by the rival Whig movement, who were increasingly regarded as the \\"war party\\" opposed to the \\"peace party\\" of the Tories. The Whigs were buoyed by the campaigns in the Low Countries where the British commander, the Duke of Marlborough, led the Allies to a series of victories. The Whigs demanded that King Louis be made to abandon his expansionist policies, and renounce any attempts to make Spain a satellite state. While the term originated in London, it also spread to several Allied capitals as a statement of intent. However, this represented an extension of the war aims the Allies had originally agreed upon, potentially extending the conflict.Falkner p.173 ==Spanish War== Victory at Villaviciosa in December 1710 settled the war in favour of Philip V The intervention in Spain started well for the pro-Habsburg side, with the capture of Gibraltar in 1704 and Barcelona in 1705 and securing the support of Portugal and the Catalans. However, it soon became clear the Bourbon candidate Philip V was far more popular in Castile than the Austrian Archduke Charles. The Allies were forced to evacuate Madrid in 1706 and soundly beaten at the Battle of Almanza in 1707.Hugill p.244-270 In 1708 the new British commander James Stanhope took the island of Minorca, a possession of more use to the British than Charles' prospects of becoming King of Spain. Philip's forces recaptured Alicante in April 1709 and defeated an Anglo-Portuguese army at La Gudiña in May. The Portuguese now declared an informal truce, allowing trade and agriculture to recommence. A renewed Allied effort in 1710 led to victories at Almenar and Saragossa in July and August and the capture of Madrid in September. However, lack of support from the local population meant Charles entered an almost deserted city and the Allies were effectively isolated when Portuguese forces were prevented from crossing into Spain. In November, they left Madrid for Catalonia in two separate detachments, Stanhope's division of 5,000 and one of 12,000 under the Austrian Starhemberg. At Brihuega on 9 December 1710, Stanhope was taken by surprise and forced to surrender to an army led by Louis Joseph, Duke of Vendôme.Falkner p.182-90 Vendôme followed this up the next day by defeating Starhemberg at Villaviciosa; these defeats were a devastating setback to Allied ambitions in Spain.Holmes p.356-357 In April 1711, Emperor Joseph I died and his brother Archduke Charles succeeded him as the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI; an Austrian union with Spain was as unwelcome to Britain as a French one, which meant to many strategists there seemed little point in continuing the war. ==Treaty of Utrecht== Robert Harley, the leader of the Tory government that negotiated the Treaty of Utrecht. His concessions over Spain were fiercely attacked by the opposition. A new Tory government, led by Robert Harley, came to power in 1710. Committed to ending Britain's involvement in the European war, which had been costly in lives and money, it took steps to disengage, which eventually resulted in the dismissal of the hawkish Marlborough, who was replaced by the Irish Tory commander, the Duke of Ormonde.Holmes. British Politics in the Age of Anne. p.28 An increasingly struggling France was eager to discuss terms. A major stumbling block had been an earlier demand for Louis XIV to assist, by force if necessary, to drive his own grandson from the throne of Spain. After lengthy negotiations an agreement was established, which included a compromise peace in Spain. That allowed Philip to keep the throne but granted to Britain the possession of Gibraltar and Minorca.Harding p.38 Britain then withdrew from the war effort in both Flanders and Spain. The terms of the Treaty of Utrecht were bitterly contested by the Whigs once they became clear. Jonathan Swift's The Conduct of the Allies was published as a defence of the Tory government.Monod p.119 The celebrated Hamilton-Mohun Duel was fought between Lord Mohun, a Whig partisan, and the Duke of Hamilton, who had just been appointed Ambassador to France. Tories portrayed the duel in which both men were killed, as a Whig plot to derail the peace agreement.Banks p.18 Whigs remained furious about what they regarded as the abandonment of Spain. The slogan became a popular rallying cry against the Treaty and the Tory government in general. In order to secure a majority in the Whig-dominated House of Lords, the government created twelve new Tory peers who were known as \\"Harley's Dozen\\". Nonetheless, Parliament voted for the Utrecht terms. Still using the slogan of \\"No Peace Without Spain\\", Britain's former allies such as the Austria and the Dutch Republic tried to fight on but suffered defeats without the financial and military support that had been provided by London. The Allies reluctantly agreed terms with France. While they represented a successful outcome of the war, they were less than had been hoped for a few years before. Philip was acknowledged as King of Spain but was forced to give up significant territories to the Emperor in Austria. The Allies then withdrew their last forces from the Iberian Peninsula. The final fighting in Spain took place when the remaining anti- French stronghold, Barcelona, fell after a lengthy siege.Hugill p.352 ==Aftermath== In 1714 George I the ruler of Hanover, one of the Allies who had opposed the withdrawal from Spain, succeeded to the British throne. George dismissed the Tories who had pushed through the compromise peace. He rewarded the opponents of Utrecht with places in government. These were mostly Whigs, although the new cabinet included the Tory Nottingham who had originally moved the \\"No Peace Without Spain\\" amendement. Marlborough was reinstalled as head of the Army with William Cadogan as his deputy. General Stanhope, a Whig, who had commanded in Spain and vigorously opposed the peace became chief minister and the architect of Britain's post-war foreign policy. However, in an ironic turn of events, Britain soon agreed an Alliance with France. Before long the two countries were fighting together against a revived Spain under Philip, who was trying to overturn the Treaty of Utrecht and recover lost territories abroad. This war ended in defeat for Spain, although Philip kept his throne. Tories used this as evidence of the success of their policy. However, some younger Patriot Whigs such as William Pitt saw the compromise peace as leading to the later Franco-Spanish Alliance which caused Britain many problems throughout the 18th century. Despite the prominence at the time of the \\"No Peace Without Spain\\" debate, the war in the Iberian Peninsula has largely been neglected by historians who have chosen to focus on Marlborough's Flanders campaigns.Lyons p.10-11 ==ReferencesBibliography== * Banks, Stephen.

Over the years, the star has been found to brighten and dim erratically, dimming by as much as a tenth of its usual luminosity. RZ Piscium has been found to emit large amounts of infrared radiation, suggesting the presence of a substantial mass of gas and dust orbiting the star, possibly from a \\"disrupted planet\\". ==Disrupted planet== Because of the infrared excess and rapid light variations, astronomers conclude that: According to astronomer Ben Zuckerman: ==Observations== In 2017, RZ Piscium was studied using the XMM- Newton satellite, the Shane 3-meter telescope at Lick Observatory in California and the 10-meter Keck I telescope at W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The temperature of the star was found to be about the same as the Sun (). Further, the star was found to produce about a thousand times more x-rays than the Sun, suggesting that the star is relatively young. On the other hand, RZ Piscium was found to contain a relatively small amount of surface lithium, which suggests the star is between 30 − 50 million years old; this is somewhat \\"old\\" for a star with so much circumstellar dust. Most young stars that are as dusty as RZ Piscium may be producing planets, but given its relatively advanced age, RZ Piscium may be destroying and consuming its planets instead. In 2020, the red dwarf companion with the mass of 0.12 Solar mass was detected on the projected separation of the 23 AU from the primary star. The incandescence of the companion star thus make up about one third of excess infrared emission previously attributed to the dust. == See also == * List of stars that dim oddly == References External links== * , star with unusual light fluctuations (21 December 2017). * , a presentation by Tabetha S.

It has a single tubular leaf and up to forty densely-crowded, pale green flowers with pinkish markings. ==Description== Prasophyllum retroflexum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf long and wide. Between ten and forty flowers are crowded along flowering stem long which reaches to a height of . The flowers are lemon-scented, pale green with pinkish markings and open widely. As with others in the genus, they are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long and about wide. The lateral sepals are a similar length but narrower, linear to lance-shaped and are free from each other. The petals are a similar size to the lateral sepals and spread widely with their tips curved backwards. The labellum is pink to purplish, broadly egg-shaped, about long, wide and curves upwards near its middle. There is a raised green, fleshy, channelled callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs from November to December. ==Taxonomy and naming== Prasophyllum retroflexum was first formally described in 2000 by David Jones and the description was published in The Orchadian from a specimen collected near Adaminaby. The specific epithet (retroflexum) is derived from the Latin words retro meaning \\"backwards\\" and flexum meaning \\"a bending or turning\\".

However, with the Union holding more weight as a single bloc, there are at times attempts to speak with one voice, notably on trade and energy matters. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy personifies this role. In this article, DPRK is a shorthand name for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, commonly known as North Korea. ==Political relations== The EU has a policy of \\"critical engagement\\" towards North Korea. The EU wishes to help the DPRK \\"promote peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, in particular through support for international efforts to promote denuclearisation and an improvement in the human rights situation\\". The European Union first started diplomatic relations with DPRK in May 2001 and most EU countries have since made diplomatic relations with the DPRK. The EU has routinely mentioned the human rights situation in the DPRK bilaterally and through United Nations (UN) bodies, including co-sponsoring country resolutions. The EU still is concerned about human rights violations they allege are occurring within the country and has hosted talks with anti-DPRK defectors. The EU wishes for the DPRK to not engage in nuclear or ballistic missile related programs or funding. It has not ruled out further sanctions if the DPRK fails to comply. The EU has implemented UN Security Council resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013), 2094 (2013), 2270 (2016), 2321 (2016), 2356 (2017), 2371 (2017) and 2375 (2017) and has also adopted additional autonomous measures that complement and reinforce the UN-based sanctions. ==Humanitarian support== The EU has delivered primarily food assistance to the DPRK since 1995. Some member states have their own efforts in addition to those of the EU. ==Trade and sanctions== The DPRK had economic interests in the European Union. In March 2002, the DPRK's trade minister visited certain EU member states, including Belgium, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Sweden, and the country has also been known to send short-term trainees to Europe. Additionally, workshops regarding DPRK's economic reform have taken place with EU diplomats and economists as participants. Before increasing economic sanctions against the DPRK in 2016, the DPRK's external trade to the EU accounted for less than 0.5% of the country's total external trade. The EU has put into place restrictions on member state interactions to the DPRK as well, such as restrictions of certain services and financial support for DPRK external trade. Some of these services banned include computer assistance, nuclear or ballistic missile research, mining services, and refining services. The EU has a prohibition of export credits, guarantees, insurances, and investments to the DPRK. The EU currently bars the import and export of arms to the DPRK as well as any nuclear-related or ballistic missile related items. The EU does not permit the export or import of many natural ground resources to the DPRK (i.e. coal, iron ore, gold, silver, etc.). In addition, the EU forbids the export or import of statues, helicopters, vessels, banknotes and coinage, luxury goods, textiles, aviation and rocket fuel, petroleum, natural gas, and seafood from or to the DPRK. ==See also== * Foreign relations of North Korea * Foreign relations of the European Union * South Korea–European Union relations ==References== Category:Bilateral relations of North Korea Category:Third-country relations of the European Union ","title":"North Korea–European Union relations"},{"id":"56108097","text":"Felinfoel Brewery logo Felinfoel Brewery building Felinfoel Brewery is a brewery based in the village of Felinfoel near Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, Wales. The existing brewery building dates from 1878 (according to a date plaque on its south facade), constructed by local innkeeper (and iron and tinplate works owner) David John. The brewery grew to employ fifty people and expanded its market to the surrounding counties. After John's retirement his sons took over the business and, in 1906, it was registered as a limited company. In the 1920s the company was managed by John's daughter, Mary Anne Lewis, a formidable woman who always carried a big stick. In 1935 Felinfoel became the first brewery in the UK (and one of the first breweries in Europe) to produce beer in cans. It managed to stop the beer reacting with the metal by coating the inside of the cans with wax, unlike the Gottfried Krueger Brewing Company in the USA, who had to create a new pasteurised drink to get around the problem when they produced the world's first canned beer earlier the same year. Felinfoel were spurred into action when the Western Mail announced rival brewery Buckley's was investigating canned beer. Felinfoel won the race, producing their first canned beer in December 1935. Felinfoel had the advantage of owning a tinplate works. In turn, the local tinplate industry benefited from the developments, with Llanelli's Trostre tinplate works going on to produce all of Britain's tinplate for food and drink cans and cookware. The cans were originally half pint containers, with a crimped metal top. They were packaged in cardboard boxes of twenty four cans. Because of their light weight, relatively to the traditional glass beer bottles, the Felinfoel beer was a popular choice to send to the British soldiers during World War II. However, the wax coating did not work so well in warmer climates, melting and giving the beer an unpleasant taste, possibly leading to Felinfoel's nickname of \\"Feeling Foul\\". The Felinfoel Brewery building has a heritage listing, as a \\"rare surviving example of a once important industry in Wales\\".

The Top Holiday Albums chart is a seasonal chart published weekly by Billboard during the holiday months of each year. Throughout the 2010s, many albums, compilation albums, extended plays, and soundtrack albums reached the top spot of the chart. The soundtrack album to the 1993 film The Nightmare Before Christmas reached the top spot several times and was often the first number one entry upon the reintroduction of the Top Holiday Albums chart. Italian opera singer and songwriter Andrea Bocelli received the decade's first number one with his 2009 album My Christmas. Several artists collected multiple number one albums during the decade. American a cappella group Pentatonix scored four number ones with That's Christmas to Me (2014), A Pentatonix Christmas (2016), Christmas Is Here!

He was the last superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical Survey and began a readership in geodesy at the University of Cambridge. ==Early life and family== He was born at Springhill, Moneymore, County Londonderry, to Laura Calvert Arbuthnot, fourth daughter of Isabella Boyle and George Arbuthnot, and Sir William Fitzwilliam Lenox-Conyngham KCB DL JP, first son of Charlotte Staples and William Lenox-Conyngham. He was the seventh of eleven children. When he was aged ten, his family moved to Edinburgh, where he attended Edinburgh Academy. He went to the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich when he was seventeen years old and passed out first with the sword of honour and the Pollock medal. Attached to the Royal Engineers as a lieutenant, he spent two years at the School of Military Engineering at Chatham before being posted to India. ==Career== In 1889 he joined the trigonometrical branch of the Survey of India. He became assistant to Sidney Burrard who, that same year, commenced an investigation into discrepancies evident in measurements of the longitude perpendicular to lines of latitude; the investigation provided new data which were successful. Thus began a lifelong friendship. In 1890, Lenox-Conyngham married Elsie Margaret Bradshaw, daughter of British Surgeon-General Sir Alexander Frederick Bradshaw. They had one child, a daughter named Enid. A redetermination of the longitude of Karachi undertaken by Burrard and Lenox- Conyngham in 1894, which required journeys to Europe and the Middle-East, was later found, using radio signals, to be accurate to 0.02 of a second of arc. In 1898, Lenox-Conyngham received two British astronomers to observe the total eclipse in northern India, including Cambridge astrophysicist Hugh Newall with whom he became firm friends, unknowingly smoothing the path for a future career at Cambridge. Burrard suggested that anomalies in latitude found by the Survey in the early 1800s parallel to the mountains to the north might be caused by a large mass below the Indo-Gangetic Plain. New four-pendulum-based equipment to measure the gravitational force was modified to suit and, between 1903 and 1908, Lenox-Conyngham collected gravitational data across the subcontinent. The data showed a negative relative gravitational component in the region of the Plain, a fact readily apparent in modern measurements (see image). This 1996 gravity map of the globe clearly shows a gravitational force below the mean value (negative values are in shades of blue) in the Indian subcontinent south of the Himalayas, as Lenox-Conyngham showed 90 years earlier. Credit: F.G. Lemoine et al., Nasa Goddard Space Flight Centre Lenox- Conyngham succeeded Burrard as superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in 1912 and was promoted to colonel two years later. In 1918, Elsie Lenox-Conyngham was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire and Lenox-Conyngham himself was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. The following year he was created Knight Bachelor. After his return from India in 1920, he planned to settle in Oxford but was invited to join a committee at the University of Cambridge to promote the study of geodesy. He was delighted to be offered a praelectorship, took up residence in Cambridge, was made a Fellow of Trinity College in 1921, received an honorary M.A. as he had no university education and in 1922 a first readership in geodesy was created for him, beginning his second career. With few funds from the University, he began, solely, teaching undergraduates and later new officers on probation for the Colonial Survey Service who spent a year at the School of Geodesy before they were posted abroad. With the assistance of Sir Horace Darwin, his ideas led to newly designed gravitational equipment which was built by Darwin's company, the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company. He added seismology and geothermal science to his curriculum and worked hard to secure funds and equipment. He made an expeditions to the Great Barrier Reef (regarding the isostasy of Pacific islands), and was asked to visit Montserrat to investigate earthquakes. He attended conferences worldwide and even acted as a representative of the British government in the Pacific Science congresses of 1923 and 1926. His faculty later became the Department of Geodesy and Geophysics (incorporated in 1980 into the Department of Earth Sciences). His students included pioneering scientists such as the geophysicist Edward Bullard. He retired in 1947. He died at Addenbrooke Hospital aged 90 and his funeral service was at Trinity College Chapel. He is commemorated there by a brass plaque with a Latin inscription on the south wall of the Ante-Chapel. The translation includes: \\"He approved innovative ideas but also old-fashioned values. A kind, prudent, dutiful man\\". ==References== Category:1866 births Category:1956 deaths Category:Irish geophysicists Category:Irish geographers Category:Irish scientists Category:Irish surveyors Category:Irish knights Category:19th-century Irish people Category:20th-century Irish people Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Lenox-Conyngham family ","title":"Gerald Lenox-Conyngham"},{"id":"56108321","text":"Dimitrie Eustatievici (1730 - 1796) was an Austrian philologist, scholar and pedagogue.https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimitrie_Eustatievici ==Biography== Of Serbian origin but raised in a Romanian milieu, Eustatievici was born in the village of Grid in Fogaras County, now Romania. He was from a Serbian family that came from Old Serbia and gave to the Orthodox community of that region several priests and schoolmasters. A remarkable intellectual, he was a beneficiary of a sound education, first at the Romanian gymnasium in Șcheii Brașovului where his father was the archpriest of St. Nicholas Church. Eustatievici's father was able to secure a stipend for his son to study at the prestigious Kiev Theological Academy from Serbian bishop Visarion Pavlović who readily sponsored Serbian and Romanian high school graduates wanting a teaching career. After graduation in 1753, Dimtire Eustatievici taught at his alma mater in Scheii Braşovului from 1753 until 1762.http://data.bnf.fr/12862753/dimitrie_eustatievici_brasoveanu/ In July 1761, Maria Theresa signed a decree appointing bishop Dionisije Novaković to his post in Transylvania; at the same time, he kept his office in Buda. In September, the new military governor, general Adolph von Buccow was present at the installation of Bishop Dionisije (Novaković) in St. Nicholas Church in Șcheii Brașovului, reading the decree in Latin, following which the bishop immediately delivered a speech in the same language. Beforehand, the priests and laymen of Șcheii, known for their attachment to Orthodoxy, obliged him to swear allegiance to the faith. The following year (1762), the empress issued a new decree of toleration, this time accompanied by eleven conditions meant to facilitate conversion to Greek Catholicism. It was at this time that Eustatievici decided to become an interpreter and secretary of bishop Dionisije Novaković, the first of three Serbian bishops (Dionisije Novaković, Ioan Popovici, and Ghedeon Niketici) at Răşinari and Sibiu.https://lapasprinbrasov.ro/brasoveni-celebri-eustatievici- dimitrie-1730-1796/ Bishop Dionisije Novaković chose Sibiu instead of Brașov as his residence, initially renting a house for two years. During one of his absences, the building was taken over by the head of the local post office, forcing the bishop to move to a three-room peasant house in Rășinari that still stands. In 1764, upon the insistence of his priests, he asked the provincial government for permission to build a permanent residence, but the request was denied. In spite of the obstacles placed in his path, Novakovic and Eustatievici worked to organize the revived diocese. In 1766, Novaković held a census, finding that there were 635,454 Orthodox under his jurisdiction. The following year, he counted 1224 priests in 44 archpriests' districts. He had ordained 198 of these, while the remainder were ordained either in Wallachia and Moldavia or by Serbian bishops in Arad and Timișoara. His findings constitute the oldest detailed listing of Orthodox priests in Transylvania. Dionisije made several pastoral visits and learned the Romanian language with the help of Eustatievici. Later, Eustatievici served as secretary of the new vicar Ioan Popovici, an archpriest in Hondol, Hunedoara County, who held the post for ten years until 1784. Then, on 6 November 1783, Ghedeon Niketici was appointed as Bishop of Transylvania, ordained at Sremski Karlovci on 9 May 1784 and installed at Sibiu on 1 July that year. Ghedeon Niketici was the last Serbian bishop whom Dimitrie Eustatievici served as secretary. The two had known each other for many years, for Ghedeon had been a student at the Kiev Theological Academy at the same time as Eustatievici. In 1786 he was appointed the first director of National Romanian and Serbian Schools in Transylvania and teacher of the first pedagogical-theological course in Sibiu (1786-1795). He spoke Serbian, Romanian, Russian, Hungarian, German, Latin, Greek and Old Slavonic. ==Works== Eustatievici was a man of distinguished culture, a polyglot and editor of textbooks and manuals, a translator, that is, a personality fit for the age in which he lived. * He compiled a series of textbooks; * The first Romanian grammar known in 1757 (left in manuscript, published only in 1969); * Textbook on arithmetic and accounting, Sibiu, 1789; * The devotions and interpretations of the Gospels of the feasts and of some days, Sibiu, 1790; * Synopsis of the old and new Testament.

The district contains Greenville's oldest existing affluent residences, dating to as early as the 1850s. In the initial federal land sale following the Creek War, the area that became northwest Greenville was claimed by William Dunklin. Dunklin sold the claim to William Burnette, who began to parcel the land for sale and to give to family members. Burnette's daughter and son-in-law built a Corinthian-columned Greek Revival home in 1857. A few other pre-Civil War houses remain, and construction continued after the war, including a school building that was later converted into a house. Most of the early residences were large, and built in Greek Revival, Second Empire, and Colonial Revival styles. Beginning in the 20th century, bungalows and cottages on smaller lots began to emerge.

The expressway connects the prefecture's capital, Aomori, and the Tōhoku Expressway to the municipalities of Goshogawara, Tsugaru and, Ajigasawa. It is owned and operated by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism and is signed as an auxiliary route of National Route 101 as well as E64 under their \\"2016 Proposal for Realization of Expressway Numbering.\\" ==Route description== Mount Iwaki from the Tsugaru Expressway The expressway's eastern terminus lies near the Namioka Interchange of the Tōhoku Expressway. A signaled intersection along National Route 7 separates the entrance to the Tōhoku Expressway from the Tsugaru Expressway. From this intersection, the expressway follows a northwestern heading out of the city limits of Aomori into Goshogawara. The expressway serves as a high-speed alternate to the main National Route 101 from National Route 7 to Goshogawara. When the expressway meets National Route 101, it instead serves as a bypass to the city, curving around heading north, west, and then south to meet its western terminus at another junction with National Route 101. The speed limit is 70 km/h for the entire route; however, during the winter the speed limit is reduced to 60 km/h. Ajigasawa section About further west along National Route 101 in Ajigasawa, a section of the expressway was partially completed in 2016 and expanded in 2019. Its eastern end lies just outside of Ajigasawa in Tusagru at an intersection with Route 101. The expressway segment has a single junction with Aomori Prefecture Route 31 and a crossing over the Narusawa River before it meets its end at Route 101 once more. ==History== On 8 August 1989, planning began on the route from the Namioka bypass to Goshogawawra. Construction began on the expressway in 1994. The first section of the expressway opened to traffic between Goshogawara-higashi and the Namioka bypass in 2002. Another section of the expressway opened to traffic between Goshogawara-higashi and Goshogawara-kita on 14 December 2007. The third section of the expressway opened to traffic between Goshogawara-kita and Tsugaru Kashiwa on 3 November 2014. On 17 March 2015 the maximum speed was increased to 70 km/h. On 30 July 2016 the Ajigasawa section opened to traffic with a temporary at-grade junction with Melon Road. This junction was replaced with a bridge on 26 March 2019 and the section was extended east to end at a junction with National Route 101. ==Future== Tsugaru Expressway widening project The expressway is being widened within the city of Aomori from two lanes to four. Plans are in progress for the construction of an expressway linking the Ajigasawa section to the rest of the Tsugaru Expressway along the long gap. The route would parallel Route 101 from the north until just before the route would meet the Ajigasawa section where it would cross the road, paralleling it from the south. This expressway is planned to be extended south through Fukaura, Aomori to Happō in Akita Prefecture. ==Junction listReferencesSee also== *Japan National Route 101 ==External links== * Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport: Tohoku Regional Development Bureau Category:Roads in Aomori Prefecture Category:Expressways in Japan Category:2002 establishments in Japan ","title":"Tsugaru Expressway"},{"id":"56108559","text":"The title page of Toldos Adam, volume two Rabbi Yechezkel Feivel (1755–1833) was the Maggid in Vilnius in the early 19th century and the author of several books, including Toldos Adam, a hagiography of Rabbi Zalman of Vilna, the famed brother of Chaim of Volozhin and student of the Vilna Gaon. Feivel was the Maggid of Vilna from 1811 until his death. ==Reception and Analysis of Toldos Adam== Feivel's magnum opus, the biography Toldos Adam, achieved singular success in the rabbinic world.

The length of its prosome can vary anywhere from . The antennae are longer or of equal length to the body. This copepod is very clear, and is generally colourless. The gut walls and posterior may be orange to dark red in colour, with a prominent lipid sac that is usually red- orange. The borders between segments have a deep red pigment. ==Distribution== C. hyperboreus is found in the Arctic, north of the Bering Strait in the Pacific and the Lofoten Islands in the Atlantic. It occurs as deep as . ==Ecology== Reproduction and life-cycle This copepod spawns between October and March (winter), using lipid-reserves to fuel reproduction (making it a capital breeder). The male is most abundant during the breeding season, found between in depth at this time. The females lay clutches at depths between , usually at intervals of 9 to 10 days, generally containing 51 to 150 eggs. Life spans from one to two years to four to six years have been suggested for C. hyperboreus based on food availability. After the plankton bloom, the eggs develop into stage II and III copepodites and feed actively near the surface from May to October (summer). They then overwinter, generally at depths from , as stage III copepodites, and grow to stage IV copepodites over the next summer. After overwintering again, they grow to stage V during the next summer, increasing their dry mass by a factor of seven, and expanding their lipid content to be more than 65% of their dry mass. The development into an adult occurs over another winter, after which C. hyperboreus breeds. In some areas, such as the West Spitsbergen Current, stage V copepodites likely moult (below depths of to males and females before their third-year of overwintering. During this winter, some mature females are found near the surface. This shows a life cycle of three years (in the case of the male, which is not found during the summer) and three to four years (for the female). In other areas, like the Greenland Sea Gyre, development into adults may occur in the second year of development, indicating a likely life cycle of two to three years. Compared to the congeneric C. finmarchicus, C. hyperboreus has a higher concentration of lipids as a percentage of dry mass. Additionally, its lipid stores have a higher concentration of wax esters than C. finmarchicus and C. glacialis. C. hyperboreus also has longer chained fatty alcohols and (albeit to a lesser extent) fatty acids than the two other species. This is likely due to the higher concentration of energy per unit mass of longer chained fatty alcohols and acids. Finally, this species also has higher concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids than either C. finmarchicus or C. glacialis. Feeding This species is a herbivore and a filter feeder, feeding on phytoplankton and protists, especially diatoms. ==References== Category:Calanoida Category:Crustaceans of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Fauna of the Arctic Ocean Category:Fauna of the Pacific Ocean Category:Crustaceans described in 1838 Category:Taxa named by Henrik Nikolai Krøyer ","title":"Calanus hyperboreus"},{"id":"56108752","text":"A Wake in Providence (also titled Almost Married) is a 1999 American independent comedy film that is the directorial debut of Rosario Roveto Jr. It stars Vincent Pagano, who also co-wrote the screenplay, and Victoria Rowell. ==Premise== When Anthony's African-American girlfriend Alissa meets his Italian-American family at his grandfather's funeral, confrontations, confessions, and a hilarious race to the altar ensue! ==Cast== *Vincent Pagano as Anthony *Victoria Rowell as Alissa *Mike Pagano as Frankie *Adrienne Barbeau as Aunt Lidia *Micole Mercurio as Aunt Elaine *Lisa Raggio as Claudia *Dan Lauria as Rudy *Kaye Kingston as Gram Baldassarre *Louis Guss as Uncle Guy *Sam Coppola as Uncle Joe *John Capodice as Uncle Sal *Mark DeCarlo as Vinnie *Jane Milmore as Patty *John Mariano as Brunie *Billy Van Zandt as Louie ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:1999 films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American comedy films Category:Films set in Rhode Island Category:Italian-American culture in Providence, Rhode Island Category:1999 directorial debut films Category:1999 comedy films ","title":"A Wake in Providence"},{"id":"56108767","text":"C'Mon Kids was an Australian children's television show which screened on the Nine Network from 1986 to 1990.

It covers 923 acres surrounding the Tyendinaga area and the majority of the Deseronto township. This claim is based on the loss of over 800 acres of land during the continued loyalist settlement during 1820-1843 which proved to be the loss of the majority of the land from the Simcoe Treaty. In 2003, the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development stated that the land claim would be negotiated through the Specific Claim Policy in regard to financial compensation instead of negotiating for the land itself. In 2013, after ten years of negotiations this was appealed on the basis that the Specific Claim Policy does not support a strict financially based negotiations for land claims. The Honourable Mr. Justice Rennie states the following in his decision: > [6] The Minister has publicly stated that the Policy does not permit a land- > based settlement, only financial compensation. This is incorrect. The Policy > explicitly contemplates the acquisition and return of land. The Minister’s > comments insinuate that he either refused to recognize the settlement's > options or simply misunderstood altogether. Due of the continued infrastructure development on treaty signified land tensions have risen during negotiations but the return on the land continues to be the main issue. As of 2014, the Culbertson Tract Land Claim is currently designated as “in the negotiation process” with the Department of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada. == Background ==  History  The Haudenosaunee Confederacy, established in the early 1500s and consisting of the five Iroquoian nations of the Seneca, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga and Mohawk (and later in 1722, adopting the Tuscarora) were a significant military force that maintained neutrality during the coming American Revolutionary War. During this period British Army Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe signed the Simcoe Deed, otherwise referred to as Treaty 3 1/2. This treaty ensured that the People of the Six Nations Confederacy would have the right to land in the Bay of Quinte. This would continue to be occupied and settled by Loyalist people after this treaty was signed, making the land ensured in the Simcoe Treaty was largely taken by non-aboriginal communities.  Legal  The right for aboriginal communities to claim heritage land has been a troubled process through Canadian history. The legal foundation for Aboriginal rights to claim heritage land was founded in 1973. The case of Calder et al. v. Attorney-General of British Columbia that the Supreme Court decision allowed Canadian aboriginal communities legal rights to claim land. The Canadian government later created an official process of land reclamation that is negotiated between the claiming community and the Department of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada. This process has four stages; submission of claim, assessment, negotiations as well as settlement and implementation. == Impact == Mohawks of the Bay of Qunite Flag. There has been growing academic literature based on the continuation of settler colonial attitudes through the land reclamation process. Since the Culbertson Tract Land Claim has taken over twenty years, this is seen as the foundation of colonial attitudes on Indigenous populations.  Protests  As one of the largest First Nations Territories in Ontario, the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte have protested in the past in solidarity with other smaller first nations communities to create awareness.  Highway 401 blockade - June 2007  On June 29, 2007, Mohawk protestors constructed a blockade on Ontario highway 401. The blockade spanned 30 kilometres in length to bring attention and recognition to the land that the highway was built on. This protest lasted only one day in hopes to bring attention to the Culbertson land claim.  Gravel quarry occupation - March 2007  In March 2007, a local group of Mohawk protestors gathered at the Gravel Quarry located in the Culbertson tract. This group was not supported by the community council but protested the continued profit from land that was in negotiation under this community land claim. This protest only lasted one day and the Gravel Quarry is still in use.  Community backlash  In 2008 Band Chief of the Tyendinaga Mohawks, Donald Maracle, criticized these protests based on the community's policy of decision-making through council decisions. The protests were not supported by the community council which wished for continued peaceful negotiations. In 2011, Amnesty International released a report on the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) response to these protests. The report outlines the inappropriate level of force displayed by the OPP during these protests, citing one instance of guns being drawn due to the mistaken sighting of a rifle in the protest. == See also == * Indigenous land claims in Canada == Notes == Category:Hastings County Category:First Nations in Ontario ","title":"Culbertson Tract land claim"},{"id":"56108853","text":"Mirror Cube solved Mirror Cube disassembled Mirror Cube scrambled The Mirror Blocks, also known as the Mirror Cube and Bump Cube, is a type of twisty puzzle and shape modification of the standard 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube and was invented in 2006. The puzzle's internal mechanism is nearly identical to that of the Rubik's Cube, although it differs from normal 3x3 cubes in that all pieces are the same color (typically reflective gold or silver stickers) and are identified by shape since each one is also a distinct rectangular prism. Like the Ghost Cube and Mastermorphix, the mirror cube has a 3x3x3 shape, meaning that it can be solved the same way as the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube. There are many unofficial world records for the fastest solve, the most recent of which being held by Sebastian Häfner, who solved the cube in 9.32 seconds. Due to the Mirror Blocks not being a WCA-sanctioned puzzle, records are more difficult to establish). == Origin == The Mirror Blocks was originally invented by Hidetoshi Takeji in 2006. He initially named the puzzle the \\"Bump Cube\\" due to it having an uneven, bumpy surface when scrambled. At a competition in Osaka, Hidetoshi showed his puzzle to a speedcuber who took great interest in it. Hidetoshi decided to lend his puzzle to the speedcuber, who showed it to a project group. In the fall of 2008, the puzzle was first mass-produced in Boston by Rubik's and manufactured by MegaHouse. When it was released, it was officially named the Mirror Blocks. == References == Category:Rubik's Cube ","title":"Mirror blocks"},{"id":"56108859","text":"Eugenio Florit y Sánchez de Fuentes (October 15, 1903 - June 22, 1999) was a Cuban writer, essayist, literary critic, translator, radio actor and diplomat. == Biography == Eugenio Florit was a Cuban writer, born in Madrid in 1903. He lived in Catalonia, until 1918, the year he moved with his family to Cuba, where his mother was born. Soon he comes into contact with the cultural circles of Havana, where he stands out very quickly. Although his birth occurred in Spain and he lived in Madrid and Port Beu, the work of Eugenio Florit is heritage of the Cuban culture. In the Cuban capital he studied at Colegio La Salle, between 1918 and 1922. Then he studied law in Universidad de la Habana. In 1927 he joined the Secretaría de Estado of the government of General Gerardo Machado, a branch in which Nicolás Guillén also worked during those years. Florit was also a lecturer and radio actor. Precisely, in that period of his work in the Secretaría de Estado was when he joined the group of the Revista de Avance, a magazine of extraordinary value for the culture of the country. His main activity will be literary, in which he will focus on pure poetry, with important presence of the Spanish classics of the Siglo de Oro (Golden Century). His first book was \\"32 Poemas Breves\\", in which he uses classic, romantic and symbolist elements. In 1940, Florit was assigned to the Consulado General de Cuba in New York and that same year he received a tribute at the Instituto Hispánico de Nueva York. He was a recurring candidate for the Premio Cervantes and received numerous other distinctions from Spanish and American universities. Although he never lost his Spanish accent and lived more than half of his life in the United States, Florit assured on numerous occasions that he considered himself Cuban. His last trip to Cuba was in 1959, the same year of the triumph of the Cuban Revolution of Fidel Castro. He was a professor of Latin American literature at Barnard College where he retired in 1969. His bibliography reaches forty titles. In 1974 publishes “Tiempo y Agonía” where he insists on the instability between life and death and it is appreciated that he still feel nostalgia for the Island, not from a deeply painful evocation but from the poet who assumes its new circumstances and finds the way of culturally translate his feelings to poems. In 1992, he published his last work, “Hasta luego”. Florit dies in Miami in 1999. Florit had a close relationship with the famous Spanish poet Juan Ramón Jiménez. Many of Florit's writings were collaborations with him. About Florit and his personality Jimenez expressed: > Por donde Eugenio Florit venga o vaya, anda por una senda apartada de > estatuas y lirios. Exquisito de nacimiento, gris sencillo por suerte para > él, está en la estirpe perpetua de la inmanente aristocracia poética y > humana: el noble instinto, la buena conciencia, que con su cultivo lo miran > y lo entienden todo hermano.

The stems reach to a height of with smooth grey bark on older growth. Younger stem are mostly dull red and are covered with greyish hairs. The leaves are arranged alternately and are linear to oblong, mostly long, wide, succulent and more or less semi-circular in cross-section. Young leaves are slightly hairy but become glabrous as they age. The flowers are arranged singly or in small groups of up to thirteen in leaf axils or on the ends of branches, with a scale leaf at the base of each flower. Each flower is on the end of a hairy dull red pedicel long. The flower is composed of four hairy tepals long, which are fused at the base but with the tips rolled back. The central style is surrounded by four yellow anthers which are also joined at the base with the tips rolled back, so that it resembles a cross when viewed end-on. The ovary is glabrous. Flowering occurs mainly from January to March and is followed by fruit which are dull green drupes long and about wide. ==Taxonomy and naming== Persoonia hindii was first formally described in 1997 by Peter Weston and Lawrie Johnson from a specimen collected in the Newnes State Forest. The description was published in Telopea. The specific epithet (hindii) honours Peter Hind, who first collected this species in 1989. ==Distribution and habitat== This persoonia is only known from nine populations in the Newnes State Forest, each population consisting of only one to a small number of individual plants.

He was the recipient of the 2017 John Aubuchon Press Freedom Award from the National Press Club. He is a 2018-2019 Knight-Wallace Journalism Fellow at the University of Michigan, despite being denied asylum on multiple occasions. ==Early life and career in Mexico== Emilio Gutiérrez Soto was born circa 1963. He became a reporter for El Diario de el Noreste, for which he wrote articles about allegations of corruption among the Mexican Army in Chihuahua. ==Denied asylum in the United States== Gutiérrez reportedly received death threats for his reporting in Mexico and he fled to the United States with his son, where he sought asylum at the Antelope Wells Port of Entry on June 16, 2008. In December 2017, Gutiérrez's request for asylum was denied, which is, according to Gutiérrez, almost a death sentence for him. Organizations like Reporters Without Borders, the National Press Club and the Society of Professional Journalists vehemently opposed the court's decision. Gutiérrez was sent to a detention facility in Sierra Blanca, Texas, during his appeal. Gutiérrez was awarded the John Aubuchon Press Freedom Award by the National Press Club on December 18, 2017, \\"on behalf of Mexico's besieged journalists.\\" The ceremony was held remotely, by video conference. He was released from detention with his son in July 2018. In July 2018, Gutiérrez became a Knight-Wallace Journalism Fellow at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor for the 2018-2019 academic year.

In March 2019, Republican Congressman Fred Upton and Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell asked the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement not to deport Gutiérrez in a letter. A few days later, Gutiérrez spoke about his experience at an event on campus in Spanish. ==Personal life== Gutiérrez has a son, Oscar, who was 24 in 2017. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1960s births Category:Mexican journalists Category:20th-century journalists Category:21st-century journalists ","title":"Emilio Gutiérrez"},{"id":"56109107","text":"\\"Blue Zone\\" is a song recorded by Japanese singer Shizuka Kudo for her fourteenth studio album, Full of Love.

It is the 2nd overall episode of the series and is written by Norm Hiscock and directed by Craig Zisk. It aired on Fox in the United States on September 24, 2013. The show revolves around the fictitious 99th precinct of the New York Police Department in Brooklyn and the officers and detectives that work in the precinct. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is an immature yet very talented detective in the precinct with an astounding record of crimes solved, putting him in a competition with fellow detective Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). The precinct's status changes when the Captain is retiring and a new commanding officer, Cpt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) is appointed as the newest Captain. This puts a conflict between Jake and Holt for their respective methods in the field. In the episode, Captain Holt assigns Jake to a graffiti case after he arrives late to work, which he considers to be below his level. However, the case is more difficult than expected given the perpetrator's relation to a big figure. Meanwhile, Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) gets taunted by a psychic (Artemis Pebdani), who states that his love for Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz) will remain unrequited. The episode was seen by an estimated 4.03 million household viewers and gained a 1.8/5 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. It received positive reviews, with critics praising Andy Samberg's and Joe Lo Truglio's performances in the episode. ==Plot== Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) arrives late to work and is confronted by Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) for his recent misbehavior and scolded for his lack of proper work. As punishment, Peralta is assigned to a graffiti case where a person draws penises on police cruisers, with Holt acting as his \\"babysitter.\\" Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti) introduces her friend, Carlene (Artemis Pebdani), to the gang, who claims to be a psychic. Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) is told by Carlene that Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz) will never love him. Peralta and Holt set up a stakeout and pursue the tagger, managing to catch him. However, while preparing the report, Peralta discovers that the tagger is Trevor Podolski (Michael Grant), the Deputy Commissioner's son, and fears retaliation from the Deputy Commissioner if Trevor is arrested. Meanwhile, Boyle, Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero) and Diaz raid an apartment as part of a drug bust. Boyle becomes paranoid when he finds that the psychic managed to predict many items in the apartment and wonders if Rosa truly does not love him. The psychic later tells Boyle that if he gets up from a chair, he will receive a severe injury. Rosa then punches Boyle while he is still seated, proving to him that the psychic was wrong. Podolski (James Michael Connor) arrives at the precinct, demanding Trevor's release. He refuses to read Peralta's report and walks out of the precinct with Trevor. Peralta gets counsel on the case from Holt, who comments that Trevor can get away with anything thanks to his father's position. After getting enough evidence about Trevor's past crimes, Peralta and Holt arrive at Podolski's home and arrest Trevor. On another day, Holt holds a briefing and roll call when he finds Peralta living on a tent in the precinct in order to arrive to work in time. ==Reception== Viewers In its original American broadcast, \\"The Tagger\\" was seen by an estimated 4.03 million household viewers and gained a 1.8/5 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a 35% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 6.17 million viewers with a 2.6/8 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 1.8 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 5 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With these ratings, Brooklyn Nine-Nine was the second most watched show on FOX for the night, beating Dads and The Mindy Project but behind New Girl, fourth on its timeslot and tenth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind New Girl, Trophy Wife, Person of Interest, Chicago Fire, NCIS: Los Angeles, The Goldbergs, NCIS, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and The Voice. Critical reviews \\"The Tagger\\" received positive reviews from critics. Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.5 out of 10 and wrote, \\"Brooklyn Nine-Nines still finding its footing, but as compared to the pilot, this week's episode served-up an equal number of smiles with a few more laughs in the mix.\\" Molly Eichel of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade and wrote, \\"The importance of 'The Tagger' is that it gives the Nine-Nine its first real villain in the form of Deputy Commissioner Podolski. He vows to keep an eye on Holt and Peralta for arresting his son. It's an interesting first villain. It's not the criminals who pose the biggest threat, but bureaucracy and authority.\\" Aaron Channon of Paste gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 and wrote, \\"What 'The Tagger' lacked in legitimate laugh-out-loud humor — there were certainly laughs, just not enough — it made up for in rounding the pilot's caricatures into genuine and more interesting people. The series hasn't hit its stride just yet, but it's getting there, one baby step at a time.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Brooklyn Nine-Nine (season 1) episodes ","title":"The Tagger"},{"id":"56109182","text":"Department of Government Transport is the government department responsible for providing transport to government departments and agencies and maintenance of government transport pool vehicles in Bangladesh and is located in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

This festival is celebrated thirty-five days after the autumnal Durgapuja celebration or fifteen daus after Kali puja in Kartik Purnima. To the people of Nabadwip Rash Festival is everything. The entire commonwealth eagerly wait for this festival all year round. The main features of the Nabadwip Rash are to make huge idols with clay and to worship Shakti. Every idol has an artistic design, a variety of imagination, religious discourse, and deep understanding of the scholars, which help entertain innumerable people. Cartoonist Chandi Lahiri said that hugeness of clay idols differs from any other festival as Nabadwip's idols are shapely and symmetric despite their light weight. == Historical groundings == Ras festival mainly part of Vaishnavism. In the time of Chaitanya deb or some years earlier, Rash Yatra was started in Nabadwip. But it was Vaishnabic festival. Shakta ras is totally different from that. Sakta Ras festival may be older than Vaishnava Ras, because in the beginning, idols were worshipped in Patachitra. During the time of Krishnachandra and mainly Girishchandra, Nabadwip Rash yatra became popular. Krishna Chandra and Girishchandra spent much money to popularise the festival and since then worshipping started through clay idol.Nadia Kahini, addition, pg-372 Girish Chandra Basu highlighted the first glimpse of Nabadwip Ras. In 1853–1860, he was a daroga of Nabadwip-Shantipur and Krishnanagar. In his book Sekaler Daroga Kahini (published 1888 AD), he wrote various socio- cultural reports along with the geographical location of the Nabadwip of that time. == Kali puja and Ras festival == Nabadwip is a sanctum of Tantra. Many Shakta and Tantra philosophers worshipped Devi kali even before the Shakta Ras Festival began. Later these Kali idols were worshipped in Ras festival. Fundamentalism of Brahmin led other people to turn towards Tantra. Since the twelfth or fourteenth century, tantra has been enriched with tendance of Tantra philosophers throughout Bengal. == Conflict with Vaishnavism == In the early 16th century, some Vaishnabic scholars started the Vaishnabic movement. So it was an obvious conflict with Shakta followers who were worshipping Tantra. == Shakta ras in early days == Documentation of early days of Shakta ras is very rare as flood and earthquake hit several times. Although Girish Chandra Basu and Kanti Chandra Rari gave glimpse of Shakta ras in early days.  Girish Chandra Basu  Girish Chandra Basu, Daroga of Nabadwip-Shantipur- Krishnagar, wrote \\"Sekaler Daroga Kahini, where he described socio-cultural view of Nadia.

She served as a judge on the Criminal Court of First Instance in the 7th district of the city of Montevideo, where she was investigating more than 50 complaints of human rights violations linked to the civil-military dictatorship. In 2010 she condemned former president and dictator Juan María Bordaberry for crimes of attack against the Constitution, forced disappearance of persons, and political murder. She was transferred to a civil court in 2013 by order of the Supreme Court of Justice, which caused a controversy regarding the possible reasons for this transfer, and generated various demonstrations of rejection by human rights organizations. She was appointed to the board of directors of the National Institute of Human Rights on 1 August 2017. ==Biography== Mariana Mota was born in Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay. Her first years were spent in Montevideo. Later she went to live in Paysandú with her parents and two older brothers, where she attended public school and high school. At age 18 she returned to reside in Montevideo, to enter the of the University of the Republic. During her years as a law student she was a trade union activist, but not a political militant. She is considered to be a \\"humanist\\". ==Action on cases of human rights violations== As a criminal judge Mota participated in cases against military figures and civilians accused of crimes committed during the 1973–1984 civic- military dictatorship. She presided over more than 50 complaints based in the Criminal Court of First Instance of the 7th District. On 9 February 2010, she pronounced sentence condemning former President Juan María Bordaberry as \\"co- author\\" of an attack against the Constitution, forced disappearance of persons, and political murder of eleven Uruguayan citizens because: The judge deemed that these were crimes against humanity, under the provisions of Article VI of the Nuremberg principles. In supporting her actions under international human rights law, the judge argued that reference to Law No. 18.831, known as the Expiry Law, was not relevant to this judgment. Regarding the crime of assault on the Constitution, Judge Mota condemned Bordaberry for leading the 1973 coup d'état by dissolving the Parliament through Decree 464/973, a decision that \\"the Constitution in no way enabled him to take,\\" according to Mota's ruling. The conviction was based on article 117 of the Criminal Code. This crime, which would be prescribed after 20 years, could not be tried previously due to the interruption of normal functioning of the rule of law between 1973 and 1985, and for procedural reasons that hindered the judicial process until 2006. After the ruling in the case of Bordaberry and the declaration of unconstitutionality of the Expiry Law, Mota reactivated other cases that were paralyzed in the 7th Court. This motivated further complaints, making it the criminal court with the greatest number of cases with these characteristics. During her time as a criminal judge, she had a difficult relationship with the Ministry of Defense, due to what she considered insufficient cooperation with the cases she was investigating. On 27 September 2012 she went to Infantry Battalion No. 13 accompanied by witnesses, to perform a visual inspection of the Army's Material and Armament Service. During the visit, she was prevented from taking photos by a supposed order of Minister Eleuterio Fernández Huidobro. Mota declared that the ministerial authorities were in contempt; finally through an agreement she managed to access the site to take photographs. For her work in the cases of human rights violations during the dictatorship she won the support of social organizations and left-wing parties, but her work also earned her criticism. Mota did not deny her commitment to the search for truth and the restoration of justice, while discounting any association of her actions with party politics. ==Investigation into disappearance of Air Class flight== Judge Mota investigated the case of the Air Class flight that disappeared in the Río de la Plata on 6 June 2012, which occurred in water ten meters deep, 1.5 kilometers southeast of Isla de Flores. The search for the plane and its crew by the National Navy did not yield results until 20 July, when they found the remains of the ship with the cooperation of Héctor Bado, a specialist in historical shipwrecks. The plane's black boxes, which were found, did not contain the cabin recordings. After this finding, the judge sent a letter to the Ministry of Defense to resume the search with the participation of Bado, since she considered that the elements found did not allow a complete expert opinion. The defense authorities considered that there were enough elements to determine the causes of the incident. Finally, it was ordered to resume the search in December 2013, although the judge did not obtain new information to continue the investigation until the moment of being transferred to another court, being removed from this and other cases. After another search, other remains of the plane were found, but the bodies of the missing pilot and co- pilot did not appear. Relatives of the crew members continued with the criminal case against the company Air Class, which was finally filed with the 2nd Court of Appeals in 2015. ==Transfer== On 13 February 2013, the Supreme Court of Justice (SCJ) informed Mota of its decision to transfer her to a civil court. This communication took Mota by surprise, since she, according to her words, \\"neither had requested the transfer nor had committed any fault.\\" Raúl Oxandabarat, spokesman of the SCJ, explained that \\"Article 99 of Law 15.750 gives the SCJ the power to make use of its human resources without providing explanations,\\" and maintained that the measure did not imply a punishment or sanction against the judge because the transfer from criminal to civil was not equivalent to a degradation of hierarchy. He explained that the court had opened two ongoing investigations related to the judge and that neither had been issued. These cases were for her criticism of the human rights policy of Uruguay in statements to the Argentine newspaper Página/12, and the omission of information requested by the court. The situation gained notoriety and Judge Mota received expressions of public support at the national and international level. Several public figures ( and Washington Beltrán, among others), as well as social and political organizations, expressed consternation and rejection of the decision to remove the judge from the criminal court at a time when she was investigating several cases of human rights violations, in addition to the disappearance of the Air Class plane. Baldemar Tarocco, vice president of Crysol (the association of former political prisoners of Uruguay), stressed that this was not the first transfer of judges who worked in cases related to human rights and the recent past. On 15 February, the day on which the transfer was completed, a public demonstration took place outside the headquarters of the SCJ, and some protesters were prosecuted for the crime of asonada (unrest), among them the social activists Irma Leites and Álvaro Jaume, and the politician . The transfer of Mariana Mota was appealed through an administrative request to the SCJ, arguing that the explanations given were insufficient and that the formal measures established for a transfer were not taken correctly. The SCJ replied that although some procedural formalities were not complied with, this did not invalidate the transfer. Subsequently, Mota filed an appeal for annulment before the for \\"misuse of power\\". This was dismissed in a 2015 judgment. ==Appointment to the directorate of the National Institute of Human Rights== Mariana Mota was nominated as a candidate to join the board of directors of the National Institute of Human Rights for Mothers and Relatives of Disappeared Detainees, with the support of the PIT-CNT and feminist and human rights organizations. The name of the judge was proposed by the Broad Front in the General Assembly of the Legislature, where she was finally elected along with Wilder Tyler, Mariana Blengio, María Josefina Plá, and on 1 August 2017. ==References== Category:Living people Category:People from Colonia del Sacramento Category:University of the Republic (Uruguay) alumni Category:Uruguayan judges Category:Women judges Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Mariana Mota"},{"id":"56109313","text":"Usha Varanasi is an Indian-American marine scientist who in 1994 became the first woman to lead one of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's major field laboratories for fisheries, until her retirement in 2010. she focuses on questions about how exposure to nature can improve people's health.

Party's Information Secretary Shireen Mazari , in March 2015, wrote a letter seeking suspension from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly. She maintained that, his basic membership was suspended for going public against party, and now he went against party in senate polls.

In order to keep further conflicts in check, Chief minister Pervaiz Khattak politically addressed the problem through dialogues, he also appointed Nasim at position of parliamentary secretary. Nasim was allegedly involved in horse trading during 2018 Pakistani Senate election and didn't voted PTI's supported candidates. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Khyber Pakhtunkhwa MPAs 2013–2018 Category:People from Peshawar Category:Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf politicians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Javed Nasim"},{"id":"56109329","text":"Liz Yeraldine Marcano Cabeza (born 3 June 1992) is a Venezuelan female karateka.

Randa, who assumed senior status on February 5, 2016. On February 15, 2018, the web site BuzzFeed reported that Giampietro had made negative remarks about \\"calls for diversity\\", birth control, and gay marriage in blog comments and radio interviews. A spokesman for U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin called the statements \\"extremely troubling\\" and complained that they had not been provided to the Wisconsin Federal Nominating Commission, a bipartisan commission which vets federal judicial nominees. In response, Giampietro released his application to the Wisconsin federal nominating commission, which shows what questions he was asked by the state's federal nominating commission and the answers that he provided. Giampietro's supporters, including the Catholic League, have said they believe criticisms of his past comments have to do with his Catholic faith.

In the game, the player assumes the role of a \\"James Bond- esque\\" spy and is tasked to complete levels. The game can be played using the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, PlayStation VR, and the Oculus Quest. ==Gameplay== In I Expect You to Die, the player must use their surroundings to solve puzzles I Expect You to Die is a virtual reality game in which the player must solve puzzle scenarios, ranging from breaking out an airplane in a car to surfacing an underwater escape pod. Most events are timed and require quick thinking in order to continue. Objects are hidden in the surrounding environment seemingly at random, but have a specific purpose the player must figure out in order to solve the puzzle and succeed. ==Synopsis== The game follows a spy who works for \\"The Agency\\", a secret organization that protects the world. The spy has just begun working and has been given a telekinetic implant that allows them to make objects float. In the spy's first mission, their boss Q reveals that a billionaire super-villain named Dr. Zor has a cargo plane containing a high- tech car that is scheduled to fly to Zanzibar. The spy gets into the car and activates a defense system that allows them to drive off the plane. In their next mission, the spy discovers that Zor has had his lieutenant Daniel Sans working on a super-virus to get revenge on The Agency. The spy goes undercover, and breaks open the window to the lab. They then use a machine and a note from a rogue scientist to build a cure. Though it seems too late when Zor launches the super-virus, the spy breaks open the nuke and combines the cure, saving the city. In the next mission, the spy is tasked with destroying Zor's submarine. While they succeed off-screen, the spy ends up in a broken escape pod. Using quick time thinking, the spy manages to fix the escape pod and signal Q. In their final mission, Q informs the spy Zor has hidden \\"Machine Z\\" in his hunting lodge. Once there, the spy solves clues and is attacked by \\"deer gas\\" and a \\"bear archer\\" before finding out that Machine Z is a gravity device powered by gravity crystals. They also discover that Zor intends to initiate Project Golden Goose, in which the machine will destroy The Agency, which Zor will profit from. The spy manages to destroy the machine and escape via helicopter. DLC: First Class, Seat of Power and Death Engine The spy, after stopping Zor four times, earns a vacation mentioned earlier in the game across India. However, while vacationing, the spy's train is stopped by Zor's tanks. Through a riddle from Q, the spy manages to make contact with Q, where he reveals a Zor agent is aboard the train and has defected to their side. The player gets in contact with them only to be attacked by Zor agents and one of the tanks, as well as a plane, defeating them all and continuing their vacation. The player learns from the defector that Zor is working on something called the Death Engine. The player breaks into a Zoraxis facility to learn more about the project before it's put to use. There, they solve clues while avoiding traps, eventually finding the intel the agency needs and using a rocket chair to escape. Using the intel from the previous mission, the player steals a personnel spacecraft off screen and docks with the Death Engine space station. Though they are initially mistaken for a Zoraxis assistant, the player is found out later in the mission. The player needs to solve puzzles, including a machine that can alter gravity, and a fuse box with only 1 operative fuse. The player eventually gains control of a robotic arm, however the Zoraxis employee controlling the station throws radioactive waste at the player’s pod. The player can either block the radioactive waste, or pick it up using the robot arm. The player then opens a hatch with a laser inside it. Using either the radioactive waste or a crystal found inside the pod, the player places it inside the laser resulting in the station blowing up. Despite the explosion, the player survives the crash but is still officially dead. The game ends with the announcer stating that they “expected you to die.” ==DevelopmentReception== I Expect You to Die was released to positive reviews from critics, with both the PC and PS4 versions garnering \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to review aggregator website Metacritic. According to developer/publisher Schell Games, the game has generated over $1 million in revenue as of August 2017. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:2016 video games Category:Action video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation VR games Category:Oculus Rift games Category:Oculus Quest games Category:HTC Vive games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Virtual reality games Category:Windows games ","title":"I Expect You to Die"},{"id":"56109450","text":"Yutaka Tokiwa is a Senior Researcher at Okinawa Industrial Technology Center, who has published extensively on the biodegradability of plastics.

Two U.S. F-15E fighter jets targeted senior ISIL leader Abu Nabil al-Anbari in the airstrike, who was the top ISIL commander in Libya. In January 2016, ISIL's Libyan faction confirmed Abu Nabil's death in a eulogy to him. Obama Administration officials were weighing a new campaign plan for Libya that would deepen the United States' military and diplomatic involvement, on yet another front against ISIL. The United States and its allies are increasing reconnaissance flights and intelligence collecting there—and even preparing for possible airstrikes and raids, according to senior American officials. Special Operations forces met with various Libyan groups near the end of 2016 to vet them for possible action against ISIL. On 19 February 2016, US warplanes carried out an airstrike on multiple ISIL targets in Libya, hitting an ISIL training camp and a senior extremist leader, the training camp was near Sabratha, Libya, 60 people were present at the camp at the time of the strike, more than 40 people were killed with more wounded, some critically, On 14 February 2016, a U.N.-designated council presented a new 18-member Libyan cabinet in the Moroccan city of Skhirat, weeks after an earlier lineup was rejected. The internationally recognized parliament has to endorse the new unity cabinet. If approved, the new unity government could eventually seek international military intervention against ISIL extremists who have taken advantage of the country's political vacuum since 2014. On 1 August 2016, U.S. crewed and uncrewed aircraft carried out airstrikes on ISIL targets in Libya, responding to the U.N.-backed government's request to help push the militants from their former stronghold of Sirte (where several hundred ISIL fighters remained), in what U.S. officials described as the start of a sustained campaign against the extremist group in the city. President Barack Obama authorized the airstrikes after a recommendation by U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter; the strikes hit an ISIL tank and two vehicles that posed a threat to forces aligned with Libyan GNA (Government of National Accord). This was the third U.S. air strike against ISIL militants in Libya, but this time U.S. officials said it marked the start of a sustained air campaign rather than another isolated strike, U.S. airstrikes would continue to target ISIL in Sirte in order to enable the GNA to make a decisive, strategic advance. United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) oversaw the US effort, which was known as Operation Odyssey Lightning. AV-8B Harrier IIs assigned to the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (22nd MEU) flying off conducted the airstrikes and uncrewed aircraft launched from undisclosed locations. Airstrikes continued, on 2 August, airstrikes hit a rocket launcher, an excavator and a pickup truck with a mounted recoilless rifle and on 3 August airstrikes struck a pickup truck with a mounted recoilless rifle; by 9 August the U.S. conducted 28 strikes against ISIL in Libya, with more than half of the strikes being conducted from uncrewed aircraft. By 16 August, U.S. airstrikes hit an ISIL vehicle and 4 militant positions in Sirte, bringing the number of U.S. airstrikes in Libya to 48. On 17 August, U.S. Africa Command officials announced on 16 August airstrikes on ISIL targets in Sirte struck 7 enemy fighting positions, 4 vehicle-borne bombs, 1 pickup truck with a mounted recoilless rifle, 12 enemy fighting positions and 1 command-and-control vehicle, bringing the total number of airstrikes in support of Operation Odyssey Lightning to 57. On 22 August, Stars and Stripes reported that U.S. Marine AH-1W SuperCobra helicopters participated in strikes against ISIL militants in Sirte on 20 and 21 August; a small detachment of U.S. special forces in Sirte provided most of the targeting information for the airstrikes which were then relayed to U.S. forces through Libyan government troops. On 31 August, Stars and Stripes reported that the U.S. military conducted 104 airstrikes against ISIL targets in Libya in August. On 22 September, the pace of U.S. airstrikes against ISIL militants in Libya slowed in September as the number of insurgents holed up in a hard-to-target section of Sirte had shrunk, (the U.S. conducted 50 airstrikes against ISIL targets, compared with 108 in August) with about 200 militants remaining. On 28 September, Fox News reported that as of 26 September, U.S. Marine Corps Harrier jets and attack helicopters as well as drones conducted 175 airstrikes against ISIL in Libya, according to the U.S. military's Africa Command. According to a U.S. official the number of ISIL fighters in Sirte was estimated to be \\"under 100\\" and that \\"ISIS is only in three neighborhoods.\\" On 2 October, the U.S. conducted 20 airstrikes (bringing the total number of strikes to 201) in Libya: knocking out a command and control facility, nearly 70 ISIL fighting positions and several other sites in what was the heaviest day of bombing since the operation began, according to U.S. Africa Command data. The strikes were in support of an offensive by ground forces aligned with the internationally backed Libyan government. On 11 October, the U.S. conducted 51 airstrikes against ISIL targets in Libya, particularly in and around Sirte, between 7 and 10 October, marking it as some of the heaviest bombing since the start of the operation; bringing the total number of U.S. airstrikes in Libya to 261. On 17 October, Fox News reported that US airstrikes against ISIL in Libya doubled in less than a month (bringing the number of airstrikes up to 324). On 21 October 2016, deployed to the Mediterranean Sea as part of Operation Odyssey Lightning to replace the USS Wasp in its role against ISIL. San Antonio carried UH-1Y Hueys and AH-1W Cobras from the 22nd MEU's Aviation Combat Unit, VMM-264; Marine Harrier fighters were part of the operation aboard Wasp, however San Antonio did not host fighter jets. On 4 November 2016, Fox News reported that the U.S. military ended its bombing campaign against ISIL in Sirte after three months of round-the-clock airstrikes the U.S. military conducted a total of 367 airstrikes since 1 August 2016. According to officials, no American airstrikes took place since 31 October; units taking part in the operation received orders on 1 November from AFRICOM to end offensive and collective self-defense airstrikes. A senior defense official said the U.S. military would \\"continue to provide military support to the GNA...ISIL-held territory in Sirte is down to a few hundred square meters. We'll continue to discuss with the GNA leadership what additional support they may need moving forward including air strikes.\\" Sirte was liberated by GNA forces in early December. On 20 December 2016, AFRICOM said that it carried out 495 airstrikes against militant vehicles and positions in the former ISIL stronghold of Sirte. Operation Odyssey Lightning concluded on 19 December, following an announcement from the Libyan government of the end of offensive military operations in Sirte. On 18 January 2017, two United States Air Force B-2 bombers and one Reaper drone struck two ISIL camps south of Sirte, killing more than 80 ISIL militants. The two bombers launched from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, flying round- trip for 34 hours to conduct the strikes. The B-2s dropped over 100 GPS-guided bombs on the two camps, after which a Reaper drone from Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily surveyed the area. One official called the airstrikes \\"a huge success,\\" with more than 80 ISIL fighters killed, one counter-terrorism official told ABC News there were \\"zero survivors\\" at the camps. Many of the ISIL fighters in the camps had fled Sirte during the battle, according to another official; Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said in a statement ISIL fighters had fled to the remote desert camps \\"in order to reorganize and they posed a security threat to Libya, the region, and U.S. national interests\\". The militants were carrying weapons, wearing tactical vests and standing in formation. The airstrikes were authorized by President Obama and were carried out in coordination with GNA; they were considered to be an extension of Operation Odyssey Lightning. US Defense Secretary Ash Carter said those targeted were \\"actively planning\\" attacks in Europe. NBC News later reported that the number of ISIL fighters killed was revised upward to 90; a U.S. defense official said that \\"This was the largest remaining ISIS presence in Libya,\\" and that \\"They have been largely marginalised but I am hesitant to say they've been completely eliminated in Libya.\\" On 22 September 2017, the U.S. conducted six airstrikes with unmanned aircraft on an ISIL camp southeast of Sirte, killing 17 ISIL militants and destroying three vehicles. AFRICOM stated the strikes took place \\"In coordination with Libya's Government of National Accord and aligned forces\\" and that \\"The camp was used by ISIS to move fighters in and out of the country; stockpile weapons and equipment; and to plot and conduct attacks\\". The strikes marked the first time airstrikes had been carried out in the country under the Donald Trump administration. Other actions The U.S. military has been closely monitoring ISIL movements in Libya, and small teams of U.S. military personnel has moved in and out of the country over a period of months. British, French, Italian and Jordanian special forces as well as the British Royal Air Force also have been in Libya helping with aerial surveillance, mapping and intelligence gathering in several cities, including Benghazi in the east and Zintan in the west, according to two Libyan military officials who were coordinating with them. British and American special forces have also been carrying out intelligence- gathering operations around Sirte. Since the beginning of 2016, British Special forces have been escorting teams of MI6 agents to meet with Libyan officials and organise the supplying weapons and training to the Libyan army and to militias fighting against ISIL. On 27 February 2016, The Telegraph reported that British special forces had deployed alongside its U.S. counterparts in the city of Misrata to stop ISIL from advancing further, their main role being to give tactical training to local militias and to build an army to fight ISIL. In May 2016, it was reported that British special forces had engaged in frontline combat against ISIL in Libya; in particular they destroyed two ISIL suicide vehicles that were targeting Libyan fighters. On 12 May, at the Shaddadah Bridge, south of Misrata, the approach of a suicide vehicle sent Libyan forces fleeing in panic, British special forces intervened and destroyed the vehicle with a missile. An estimated dozen U.S. special forces operated out of a base near Misrata and were in action near Tripoli. In a plan disclosed in late 2015, Britain was to offer the Libyan government 1,000 troops as part of a 5,000-strong combined with Italy, to train and equip the Libyan forces rather than take part in frontline fighting. In addition, British defence minister Michael Fallon announced that Britain was sending 20 troops from the 4th Infantry Brigade to Tunisia to help prevent ISIL fighters from moving into the country from Libya. In June 2016, it was reported that ISIL militants were retreating from Sirte and some fighters reportedly cutting off their beards and long hair to blend in with civilians as militia fighters allied to the unity government pushed into the city in tanks and armed trucks. The militias, mostly from Misrata, are allied to and are the main fighting force for the U.N.-brokered unity government installed in Tripoli the previous year. On 11 June, the BBC reported that Libyan forces claim they have retaken control of part of Sirte after fierce fighting with militants from ISIL. In July 2016, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said ISIL fighters in Libya are facing the \\"distinct possibility\\" of defeat in their last stronghold and are likely to scatter elsewhere in the country and the region; At the beginning of 2016, ISIL was believed to have more than 5,000 fighters in Libya, by August 2016, estimating there could be less than 1,000 left, by 9 August, only 350 ISIL fighters remained in Sirte. U.S. and British special forces were involved in the battle for Sirte: U.S. troops were operating out of a joint operations center on the city's outskirts, their role was limited to supporting forces unity government forces, providing direct, on-the-ground support. On 22 September, Stars and Stripes reported that since the start of the battle to retake Sirte by Libyan forces, many ISIL members fled the city, \\"looking to hide among the population, relocate to other Libyan towns or attempting to leave Libya altogether.\\" == Derna airstrike == On 15 November 2015, the US launched an airstrike in Derna, Libya killing senior ISIL leader Abu Nabil al- Anbari. Abu Nabil formerly led operations in Iraq alongside al-Qaeda from 2004 to 2010. This marked the first time United States military action was used against ISIL outside of Syria and Iraq. This was concurrent to the Battle of Derna. == February air raid == On 19 February 2016, the United States conducted a large series of bombings in Sabratha. The United States said that ISIL training camps were the target. The strike killed Noureddine Chouchane, a Tunisian resident who was blamed for having links to the 2015 Sousse attacks in Tunisia. The Pentagon later released a statement saying the intention was to weaken the chances of ISIL continuing the construction of new training camps and the ability to recruit new members. == Operation Odyssey Lightning == On 2 August 2016 The Pentagon released a statement that the United States would begin to collaborate with Libya's Government of National Accord (GNA) in an effort to free the city of Sirte from ISIL fighters that had captured the city in March 2015. The United States assured that this was done under the request of the Libyan government and that it was necessary to enable the Libyan forces to have strategic advantages for the offensive. The operations began a day before the announcement with precision airstrikes on Sirte. The United States continued airstrikes and military support from August to December. Originally the Libyan forces were to lead the offensive, while support provided by U.S AV-8B Harrier jets and AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopters struck militant strongholds inside the city. However, according to American field commanders, the GNA forces became \\"overwhelmed\\" attempting to enter Sirte and had become desperately in need of heavier support. The U.S. granted then granted fighter jets permission to use defensive weapon strikes against militants. On 6 December 2016, Libyan forces had officially liberated the city of Sirte. == January 2017 airstrikes == On 1–2 January 2017, the US attacked multiple ISIL training camps 25 miles southwest of Sirte.

The site is located southeast of Downtown Nashville on the Nolensville Pike. It is home to the Tennessee State Fair, and also hosts the Fairgrounds Speedway, the Tennessee State Fairground Sports Arena, and the Nashville Flea Market. The site is planned to be redeveloped into a mixed-use development, with commercial and residential use, a community park, a soccer stadium for the future Nashville SC of Major League Soccer. Additionally, there is a proposal to upgrade Fairgrounds Speedway to host NASCAR Xfinity and Truck Series events, but no plan has been formally announced or finalized. ==History== The fairgrounds originally opened in 1891 as a horse racing track named Cumberland Park. The park became the home of the Tennessee State Fair in 1906 and was purchased by the Davidson County government (later Metro) in 1910. At that state fair, on June 22, 1910, attendees witnessed the first night-time airplane flight. The plane was equipped with automobile headlights. On September 20, 1965, a fire on the opening night of the fair destroyed four buildings and caused $10 million in damage. The fairgrounds were re-branded as The Fairgrounds Nashville in 2015, in an attempt to lure more events. ==Sports Arena== The Tennessee State Fairground Sports Arena is on the grounds of the Nashville Fairgrounds. It is also known by the nickname the TNA Asylum due to the venue hosting Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, now Impact Wrestling) events for two years in the early 2000s. The building was constructed in 1922, by workers from South Dakota. The building was originally a flea market. It was operated throughout the 1960s and 1970s by promoter Nick Gulas as a professional wrestling venue. After taping their initial shows in the Von Braun Center in Huntsville, Alabama, then moving their next few to the Nashville Municipal Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, TNA moved their weekly pay-per-view events to the Tennessee State Fairgrounds Sports Arena in July 2002. The name \\"TNA Asylum\\" was first used during the ninth weekly pay-per-view by Ron Killings. The Asylum also served as the home of TNA Xplosion, TNA's weekly syndicated television show, from its inception until October 2004. After debuting TNA Impact!, which was taped at Soundstage 21 at Universal Studios Florida, TNA decided that they would eventually shut down their weekly pay-per-view operations in favor of switching to a monthly pay-per-view format. Shortly after, they held their final weekly pay-per-view event (on September 8, 2004) before permanently departing from the Asylum in favor of running their shows exclusively out of Universal Soundstage 21. Showtime All-Star Wrestling used the arena a couple times during the year of 2009, filming some of their television episodes at the Sports Arena. On October 6, 2009 it was announced that the Nashville Mayor Karl Dean would be closing down the Tennessee State Fairgrounds at the end of June 2010. On November 12, 2010, TNA Wrestling returned to the Asylum for a one last live event, headlined by Jeff Hardy defending the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against D'Angelo Dinero, before the proposed demolition of the building. However, on January 18, 2011, the Nashville City Council voted to keep the arena open through 2012. The vote on a referendum issue on the ballot for the August 2011 Metro Nashville- Davidson County election made it much harder legally for the municipality either to dispose of or severely alter the operation of the Fairgrounds, and most of the facilities there remain in at least limited operation as of 2015. On January 29, 2011, there was a \\"Tribute to the Fairgrounds\\" pro wrestling event, highlighting many of the Memphis-area wrestling legends who helped make the arena famous, with the main event being Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler vs \\"Superstar\\" Bill Dundee in front of a sold-out crowd of 1,700. Beginning in 2012, Crossfire Entertainment used the Sports Arena for their live events. They hosted \\"Tribute to the Fairgrounds\\" events before the proposed demolition, but later used it as a primary location for their shows. On August 4, 2012, Crossfire Wrestling announced TV production would return to the Nashville Fairgrounds Sports Arena, thanks to Paramount Pictures, as they were to be hosting HD/3D TV Tapings there. To add on to this, Crossfire was to be the first professional wrestling organization to be shot in 3D. On February 17, 2013, Crossfire Wrestling announced that they had to cease operations, leaving the venue empty for the time being. On September 6, 2013, TCW Wrestling's \\"Tennessee Takeover\\" was held at the Sports Arena, which was the first event held in the arena since January 2013. On June 22, 2014, the first- ever live televised pay-per-view for Ring of Honor, Best in the World 2014, was held at the venue. On October 21, 2018, the National Wrestling Alliance held its 70th Anniversary show in the building. Impact Wrestling returned to The Asylum on January 6, 2019 with a PPV event called Homecoming. ==Planned redevelopment== In 2009, Mayor Karl Dean announced the Metro government's intention to redevelop the fairgrounds into a mixed-use neighborhood, displacing the state fair amid financial struggles. Opposition to the closure prompted a citywide referendum in August 2011 that would amend the Metro charter to continue existing activities at the fairgrounds site. The amendment was passed by over 70 percent of voters. In 2016, mayor Megan Barry proposed demolishing several buildings on the fairgrounds to make way for community parks and soccer fields. The plan, which also includes a new soccer stadium for the new Nashville SC, has been accused of displacing the fair although Metro Nashville maintains that there will still be adequate space for the fair. ==References== Category:1906 establishments in Tennessee Category:Buildings and structures in Nashville, Tennessee Category:Fairgrounds in the United States ","title":"Nashville Fairgrounds"},{"id":"56109563","text":"Ronald Amundson (born 1946) is an American philosopher currently Professor Emeritus at University of Hawaii Hilo, retired since 2012, and an Elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. ==Education== He earned his B.A. and Ph.D at University of Hawaii in 1975. ==Research== His interests are evolutionary biology and he is recognized for his book The Changing Role of the Embryo in Evolutionary Thought (2005, ) currently held in 592 libraries. ==References== Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:American philosophers Category:Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Category:University of Hawaii faculty ","title":"Ron Amundson"},{"id":"56109571","text":"Brian Babylon is an American comedian from Chicago, and a regular panelist on NPR's Wait Wait...

He tended to the poor during his time as a parish priest in Marseilles and was noted for his desire to create a large and free hospital for them. He achieved this in 1921 and tended to the old and infirm in the hospital. Fouque also was known for his ministering to displaced peoples during World War I and for his commitment to evangelization. His beatification cause opened in 2002 and he became titled as a Servant of God. Pope Francis named him as Venerable on 21 December 2016 and later confirmed his beatification; it was celebrated in Marseilles on 30 September 2018. ==Life== Jean-Baptiste Fouque was born on 19 September 1851 in Marseilles to Louis Fouque (08.09.1822-???) and Adèle Anne Remuzat (08.06.1829-???). His parents married on 29 October 1850 and were devout in their faith. He studied in the school that the Joseph-Marie Timon-David had opened; both David and Jean- Joseph Allemand proved to be Fouque's spiritual masters during his education and were also influences on his desire to enter the priesthood. Timon-David helped Fouque discern his call to the priesthood which Fouque had felt since the beginning of his adolescence. This event - his ordination - took place in Marseilles on 10 June 1876. His first assignment following his ordination was to serve as a pastor in Auriol (12.1877-07.1885) at the Sainte-Marguerite parish and then in La Major (1885–88). His final assignment was to serve at the Sainte Trinité parish from 15 April 1888 until his death over three decades later. Fouque inaugurated \\"Le Sainte Famille\\" home for girls that he later entrusted to the nuns from the Presentation order from Tours. In December 1891 the archdiocesan vicar general asked Fouque to tend to the abandoned and to orphans. He threw himself into this work and created one such place that was transferred to a new location in 1894 and entrusted to nuns. He set himself on establishing this place following a Mass he celebrated on 3 October 1892 at Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde. In 1903 he helped to establish a house for girls and also a home for poor domestic workers both in Marseilles. In 1903 he also reopened the former boarding school of the Ladies of the Christian Doctrine while in 1905 - in a former convent - created \\"L'oeuvre de Salette\\" for the old and infirm. Fouque later founded \\"Le travail de l'enfance\\" on 27 November 1913 in Saint-Tronc which he later entrusted to the direction of a group of priests. Between 1914 and 1918 - upon the outbreak of World War I - he tended to the wounded and displaced peoples. He had no financial means following the war but decided to appeal to doctors to care for the poor who had little finances to request their services. There were some doctors who agreed while Fouque decided to set something up that would ensure better treatment of the poor. He asked industrialists and merchants to help finance this venture which became the basis for his idea in 1919 to create a large and free hospital for the poor in Marseilles. The people rallied behind him in this project and offered financial aid which resulted in Fouque inaugurating the Saint John Hospital on 20 March 1921. Fouque died on 5 December 1926 in the Saint John Hospital. The people revered him as a saint and even referred to Fouque as the \\"Saint Vincent de Paul of Marseilles\\". His remains were later transferred to the Saint Joseph's chapel in his old hospital on 29 April 1993. ==Beatification== The beatification process for Fouque commenced under Pope John Paul II on 6 July 2002 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections to the cause) edict and titled Fouque as a Servant of God. The Cardinal Archbishop of Marseilles Bernard Panafieu inaugurated the diocesan investigation into Fouque's life and works on 7 December 2002 and closed it a few months later on 15 March 2003. The C.C.S. validated this investigation twice in Rome on 4 July 2004 and on 9 November 2007. The postulation (those leading the cause) compiled and submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. for assessment in 2012. The theologians advising the C.C.S. assessed the dossier and approved the cause on 3 March 2016 while the cardinal and bishop members comprising the C.C.S. themselves approved the cause that 13 December. Fouque became titled as Venerable a week later on 21 December after Pope Francis confirmed that Fouque had lived a model life of heroic virtue. Fouque's beatification depended all upon a miracle (often a healing science and medicine fail to explain) receiving papal recognition. One such case was discovered and was investigated in the French diocese it had originated from before the C.C.S. validated this investigation later in Rome on 1 February 2013. Medical experts confirmed that the healing had no scientific explanation while consulting theologians determined that the miracle came as a result of Fouque's intercession. The cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. later confirmed these findings at their meeting on 5 December 2017. Pope Francis provided papal recognition for this miracle more than a week after on 18 December in a move that confirmed that Fouque would soon be beatified. The beatification took place on 30 September 2018 in Marseilles. The current postulator for this cause is the Premonstratensian priest Bernard Ardura. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Hagiography Circle * Official website Category:1851 births Category:1926 deaths Category:19th-century French people Category:19th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:20th-century French people Category:20th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Beatifications by Pope Francis Category:French beatified people Category:French Roman Catholic priests Category:People from Marseille Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope Francis ","title":"Jean-Baptiste Fouque"},{"id":"56109593","text":"Maryellen Noreika (born July 12, 1966) is a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. == Biography == Noreika earned her Bachelor of Science from Lehigh University, her Master of Arts in biology from Columbia University, and her Juris Doctor, magna cum laude, from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, where she was inducted into the Order of the Coif and served as a member of the University of Pittsburgh Law Review.

Government of Nunavut Cannabis in Canada has been legal for medicinal purposes since 2001 under conditions outlined in the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations, later superseded by the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations, issued by Health Canada and seed, grain, and fibre production was permitted under licence by Health Canada. The federal Cannabis Act, legalizing cannabis for recreational use, came into effect on 17 October 2018. Each province and territory set its own laws for various aspects, such as the legal age, whether householders can grow cannabis and the method of retail sales. ==2017 Cannabis legalisation survey== In August and September 2017, Nunavut residents aged 16 and older were encouraged to complete a brief online survey with their opinions on the upcoming legalization of cannabis. The results were released in December 2017, based on the feedback of 1,148 respondents. Among the survey's findings:NunatsiaqOnline 2017-12-15: NEWS: Three-quarters of Nunavut survey respondents support legalizing pot: survey * 75% of respondents supported legalizing cannabis, with 19% opposed and 6% no opinion * Nearly three-quarters of respondents wanted restrictions on where cannabis can be smoked, but fewer than half wanted restrictions on where non-smoked products could be used. * Respondents were \\"particularly interested\\" in cannabis's effects on \\"children, youth and pregnant women\\".

Prior to this, Robinson earned his wealth in the wholesale grocery business. ==Racing career== Driver Robinson first competed in the NASCAR All-American Series in 1998 and 1999. In 2000, he won six races in the series. Team owner Jay Robinson Racing =Xfinity Series= Robbie Faggart in Robinson's car at the 2001 CVS Pharmacy 200 at New Hampshire International Speedway. Robinson first competed as a team owner in the NASCAR Xfinity Series in 2000. The team's first race was the Myrtle Beach 250 at Myrtle Beach Speedway with Rodney Childers driving the #49 Southern Marine Chevrolet Monte Carlo. Childers started 33rd and finished 43rd (out of 43 cars) due to a crash after 69 laps. The team generally competed with different drivers in a particular car throughout the season. The first season the team competed with the same driver was when Kenny Wallace drove the #28 United States Border Patrol Chevrolet Impala SS in 2008. That season, Wallace got a best finish of 7th at the U.S. Cellular 250 at Iowa Speedway. Wallace would also finish 11th in the final point standings. Robinson's team competed in the series through 2011, getting a best finish of 3rd place with Wallace at the 2011 Kroger On Track for the Cure 250 at Memphis Motorsports Park. Kertus Davis in Robinson's car at the 2008 Camping World RV Sales 200 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. Davis frequently started and parked that season. He finished 35th in this race, claiming clutch issues. Later in their history, the team often used the practice of starting and parking (starting a race with no intention of finishing the race to collect the prize money) to fund their primary car. Robinson said of this activity, \\"The 28 car wouldn’t run without the start-and-park car. No chance. These haulers haul two cars. If you bring both of them in one transporter, you can make the numbers work out. If I brought only one car, I couldn’t make it work without more sponsorship. We’d race the 49 tomorrow, too, if there was a way.\\" Robinson-Blakeney Racing Robinson partnered with Houston, Texas, Texas businessman Troy Blakney to form Robinson-Blakeney Racing. =Cup Series= In the Cup Series in 2012, the team fielded the #49 America Israel Racing/JPO Absorbents Toyota Camry with J. J. Yeley and later Jason Leffler serving as the drivers. Yeley drove the car through the Lenox Industrial Tools 301 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. Yeley's best finish in the car was a 30th place finish at the Food City 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway. Leffler then attempted six races later in the season, qualifying for three of them. The best finish by Leffler in the car also came at Bristol, as he finished 31st at the Irwin Tools Night Race. Following the season, most of the team's equipment was put up for auction. =Xfinity Series= The team also competed in the Xfinity Series in 2012 with Yeley, David Green, Derrike Cope, Kevin Lepage and Tony Raines driving the #28 JPO Absorbents Chevrolet Camaro and Dodge Challenger. Lepage would get the finish for the team, finishing 31st at the Ford EcoBoost 300 at Bristol Motor Speedway. NEMCO-JRR Motorsports Prior to the 2013 season, Robinson merged his team with Joe Nemechek's NEMCO Motorsports. =Cup Series= 2013 NRA 500 at Texas Motor Speedway. Nemechek drove the #87 Toyota Camry in 34 races, qualifying for 33 of them, getting a best finish of 25th place at the Camping World RV Sales 301 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. Tomy Drissi also drove the car at the two road course races, finishing 38th at the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma Raceway and 42nd, due to a crash, at the Cheez-It 355 at The Glen at Watkins Glen International. =Xfinity Series= Nemechek also drove the #87 AM/FM Energy Wood & Pellet Stoves/England's Stove Works Toyota Camry in 28 of 33 Xfinity Series races in 2013, with Lepage and Johnny Sauter driving the car at the Iowa Speedway races. During the season, Nemechek got a best finish of 14th place at the Royal Purple 300 at Auto Club Speedway. Despite missing five races, Nemechek finished 19th in the final point standings with 513 points. Identity Ventures Racing Prior to the 2014 season, Nemechek and Robinson created a partnership with five business leaders, including housing investor Nat Hardwick. Michael Waltrip Racing later joined the team as a partner. =Cup Series= The fielded the #66 BlueDEF Diesel Exhaust Fluid/Land Castle Title/Royal Teak Collection Toyota Camry with Michael Waltrip, Nemechek, Jeff Burton, Brett Moffitt, Drissi, Timmy Hill and Mike Wallace driving at various points in the year. The car was run out of Waltrip's shop when Waltrip, Burton and Moffitt drove the car. Separate cars for the team were also driven by Nemechek, Hill and Wallace Burton got the best finish in the car with a 17th place finish at the Kobalt 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Moffitt got the best finish in the car when it came out of Robinson's shop with a 22nd place finish at the FedEx 400 at Dover International Speedway. It was later revealed that Hardwick embezzled at least $30 million from his companies, causing him and Land Castle Title (a company he was chief executive officer of) to be removed from the team. Premium Motorsports After Identity Ventures' demise, Robinson reformed the team as Premium Motorsports. =Cup Series= Brendan Gaughan's car at the 2015 Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma Raceway. The team started to compete in the Cup Series in 2015. Like Robinson's earlier Xfinity Series team, the team often uses multiple drivers in a car throughout the season. Since entering the Cup Series, Robinson has purchased various teams and folded them into his organization. These purchases started with purchasing Tommy Baldwin Racing's second car (namely the owners points and equipment). Robinson subsequently purchased Phil Parsons Racing in 2015, Hillman Racing in 2016 and the remainder of Baldwin's team in 2017. At the 2016 AAA Texas 500 at Texas Motor Speedway, #55 Toyota Camry driven by Reed Sorenson was sponsored by Donald Trump's Presidential campaign, which proved to be controversial. Kevin O'Connell practicing for the 2017 Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma Raceway. Tommy Regan practicing for the 2017 Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma Raceway.

M.Studies in Moro History, Law, and Religion. Bureau of Public Printing, Manila. p.63.) - known as Midted Sa Inged (Superintendent of the polity) of the Sultanate of Kudarangan, is the son of Sultan Bayao Bin Sultan Maitum, cousin of Datu Uto and elder brother of Sultan Tambilawan of Kudarangan and adviser to Datu Ali in the war against Pre-Spanish and the Pre-Americans Era. Datu Djimbangan lives at the old Spanish fort of Libungan (now known as Libugan, Cotabato), his only claim to distinction as he has but a small following. He is also known to Kabuntalan nobles as Datu Masbud (Fat) because he is very fat, hot tempered and inclined to be unreconstructed. He is also known as the thievish chieftain to the Spanish Governor of Cotabato for that once could come to Datu Djimbangan’s hand might well counted as lost.The World Magazine(April to September 1901). Volume 7. George Newnes, LTD.p.441,p.443,p.446. Datu Djimbangan was suspected of being implicated in the murder of a soldier of the thirty-first infantry in December 1900 though it has never been proven against him. He depends for protection upon his brother Datu Ali, who is fond of him. When the Spanish forces evacuated Cotabato in 1899, Datu Piang felt sure that the Spaniards would never be again in authority at Cotabato, he begged Governor Vilo, the latter governor of Christian population, to let him have twenty rifles to defend himself against a rival. The Christian governor agreed to this, and week by week Datu Piangʼs demands grew until, at length, all the rifles in the possession of the Christians passed to the Moros. But there still remained some cannons, and Datu Piang, having represented the necessity of making war on another chief up the Cotabato River, Vilo was persuaded to lend them to him. Suddenly Datu Piang, his son-in-law Datu Ali and his brother, Datu Djimbangan, at the head of a large party of armed Moros, fell upon and slaughtered the Christians. Viloʼs head was cut off.DeRackin, S.

Datu Uto and his allies Datu Piang along with loyal moro datus marched into the town, killing and terrorizing Christian Filipinos. The Christians who were unable to escape were carried off as slaves into the interior. He and his companions made their selections for themselves, leaving the remainder for their followers.Foreman,John(2007). The Philippine Islands.

He took the field in company with Datu Ali and was present in the Sar-Raya fort at the time of its destruction by the troops under General Wood' on March 11, 1904. After the battle, He was captured by Captain Thomas W. Darrah, at his Rancheria by a detachment under command of Major C. M. Truit, 23rd infantry. Datu Djimbangan was trying to hide his ponderous hulk behind a coconut tree when discovered by Captain Darrah, who leaped across a small stream and sprang upon the astounded Moro.Taschetta, Charles (April 4, 1905). \\"The Captured Moro Datto Sprang Across Stream and Upon Him\\" The Leavenworth Times, Kansas. p.4. == Ending of Slavery == In December 1903, Moro Province announced the anti-slavery law. Wood and Taft thought that the Maguindanaw would continue to follow the lead of colonial progress. Instead, the declaration of abolition destroyed the political and economic system of indirect rule over the whole valley through Datu Piang in Cotabato. The pronouncement of anti-slavery law became \\"radical\\" measure through prominent Taosug, Maranao, and Maguindanaw datus to launched rebellions against it. The first rebellion was led by Taosug Chieftain Panglima Hassan when the American ignored his two requests to return his twelve runaway slave who received protections from Americans troops in Jolo. The Moro's fled and the Americans burned the fort.Arnold, J.R. (2011).The Moro War, New York: Bloomsbury Press. p.92, p.99-100, p.110-112, p128-129 p.132-138, p.247- Hassan surrendered but then escaped, which led Wood to destroy every hostile cotta he encountered, resulting in the death of Datu Andung on Mount Suliman. Although never capturing Hassan, Wood did end up killing 1,500 Moros, which included women and children. The uprising ended in March 1904, when Hassan and two others were cornered by 400 men under Scott's command at Bud Bagsak. It took 34 gunshots to finally kill Hassan. Datu Ali on the other hand, who is the prominent moro chieftain and a raising leader of the north, pledge together with his allied moro datus to fight and obeisance that they would not submit to any interference with their slave trading and holding and who is trying to impose Christianity. In May 1904, Datu Ali ambushed seventeenth Infantry killing two officers and seventeen men.Vic Hurley (14 June 2011). Jungle Patrol, the Story of the Philippine Constabulary (1901-1936). Cerberus Books, 14 June 2011. p. 280–. Despite of Woods condemnation of Moros, he knew that the anti-slavery law will proved the flashpoint. It arouse a great deal of opposition among the Moro Datus especially Datu Ali and his brother Datu Djimbangan who's making a good deal of money in slave trading. The so-called anti-slavery law ignited their general contempt for American Authority. General Leonard Wood also reported that all of the Datus except Datu Piang is united to resist the American rule for the operation of the slave law. == The Battle of Fort Siranaya (The Capture of Datu Djimbangan) == In March 1905, a sizeable band of Datu Ali’s men was at the fort Siranaya (currently known as Sar-Raya) when U.S. troops attacked, killing many of the defenders and capturing Datu Djimbangan,Tan, S.K.(1977).The Filipino Muslim Armed Struggle. Filipinas Foundation.p.24. leader and brother of Datu Ali and held as hostage forcing Datu Ali to surrender. Datu Ali refuse to yield and was encourage to continue the resistance by datus of Upper Cotabato (Datu Ampatuan of Maganoy, Datu Mopuk of Dapitan, Datu Tambilawan of Libungan, Datu Manalintao of Madridagao, Datu Argao of Silag, and Datu Sansaluna).Beede, Benjamin R.(1898).The War of 1898 and U.S. Intervention 1898 - 1934. Encyclopedia. p.13. The extant records of prosecutions for slavery in the Cotabato District are suggestive of the politically sensitive enforcement of the anti-slavery law. Notably, Datu Djimbangan was captured after the fall of Datu Ali kota in March 1905 by Captain Thomas W. Darrah, at his Rancheria by a detachment under command of Major C. M. Truit, 23rd infantry, hiding his ponderous hulk behind a coconut tree when discovered by Captain Darrah, who leaped across a small stream and sprang upon the astounded Moro.McCallum,Jack(2005).Leonard Wood: Rough Rider, Surgeon, Architect of American Imperialism.

The Working Group is headed by former Finance Minister Sir Michael Cullen. ==Mandate and functions== The Tax Working Group was established on 20 December 2017 with the stated goal of \\"examine further improvements in the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system.\\" The Working Group will report to the New Zealand Government on the following matters: *Whether the tax system operates fairly in relation to taxpayers, income, assets and wealth. *Whether the tax system promotes the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy. *Whether there are changes to the tax system which would make it more fair, balanced and efficient. *Whether there are other changes which would support the integrity of the income tax system, having regard to the interaction of the systems for taxing companies, trusts, and individuals. The Tax Working Group's responsibilities includes: *Forecasting the economic environment for the next 5–10 years; taking into account demographic changes, changes in technology and employment practices, and their impact on business models. *Investigating whether a system of capital gains taxation or land taxation (excluding the family home or the land under it), or other housing tax measures would improve the taxation system *Investigating whether a progressive company tax (with a lower rate for small companies) would improve the taxation system and the business environment *Investigating what role the taxation system can play in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes over the longer term. Areas outside the purview of the Working Group include: increasing any income tax or the GST rate; inheritance tax; the taxation of the family home or the land under it; the adequacy of the personal tax system and its interaction with the transfer system; and technical matters such as international tax reform under the base erosion and profit shifting agenda and policy chances as part of the Inland Revenue Department's Business Transformation programme. ==History== Formation and membership Following the formation of a new Labour-led coalition government in the weeks after the 2017 general election, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that the incoming government would establish a Tax Working Group under its 100-day plan. On 23 November, it was announced that former Finance Minister Sir Michael Cullen would be heading the Working Group. While the Tax Working Group would have a mandate over New Zealand's taxation system, it was directed to look at specific areas including the Goods and Services Tax and alleviating the housing market. While the Working Group would not have the power to change the GST rate, it would be able to advise on removing or adding GST to certain goods such as female hygiene products, fruits, vegetables, and \\"basic food items.\\" On 20 December, the New Zealand Government announced that the Tax Working Group would consist of a mixture of individuals from various backgrounds including academics, tax experts, and people with private sector, union, and Māori community experiences. In addition to its Chair Sir Michael Cullen, other Working Group members would include: * Professor Craig Elliffe, University of Auckland * Joanne Hodge, former tax partner at Bell Gully * Kirk Hope, Chief Executive of Business New Zealand * Nick Malarao, senior partner at Meredith Connell * Geof Nightingale, partner at PwC New Zealand * Robin Oliver, former Deputy Commissioner at Inland Revenue * Hinerangi Raumati, Chair of Parininihi ki Waitotara Inc * Michelle Redington, Head of Group Taxation and Insurance at Air New Zealand * Bill Rosenberg, Economist and Director of Policy at the Council of Trade Unions * Marjan Van Den Belt, Assistant Vice Chancellor (Sustainability) at Victoria University of Wellington The Tax Working Group is due to hold its first meeting at the end of January 2018. Proposed capital gains tax In mid-February 2019, the Tax Working Group recommended that the New Zealand Government implement a capital gains tax (CGT) and use the revenue generated to lower the personal tax rate and to target polluters. This proposed capital gains tax would cover assets such as land, shares, investment properties, business assets and intellectual property. It proposed setting a tax rate of 33% at the income-earner's top rate level. The Tax Working Group also proposed raising social welfare net benefits to allow low-incomer earners to cope with to post-tax threshold adjustments. However, other assets such as family homes, cars, boats and art would be exempt from the CGT. Tax Working Group Chairman Cullen claimed that the capital gains tax would raise NZ$8.3 billion over the next five years. Finance Minister Grant Robertson and Revenue Minister Stuart Nash welcomed the Tax Working Group's recommendations. Robertson said that the Labour Party would seek to build a consensus with its coalition partners New Zealand First and the Greens. Nash also praised the Tax Working Group for identifying weaknesses in the country's taxation system and said that the report presented the government with options on tackling it. Government spokespersons also said that they would study the report and inform the public if they were introducing a capital gains tax by April 2019. Opposition Leader Simon Bridges of the National Party criticized the proposed capital gains tax as an assault on the \\"Kiwi way of life\\" and vowed to fight it every step of the way. Similarly, National's Finance Spokesperson Amy Adams claimed that the Tax Working Group was proposing a massive tax grab that would hurt the New Zealand economy and taxpayers. Businesses, landlords, and farmers have objected to the proposed tax while trade unions including the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions and environmental groups have expressed support for the proposed CGT. On 17 April, the Coalition government announced that it would not be introducing a capital gains tax. Members of the ruling coalition were unable to reach a consensus on the issue. Opposition Leader Bridges criticized the capital gains tax debate for wasting taxpayer funds and weakening the New Zealand economy by undermining business confidence. ==Notes and referencesExternal links== * Category:Government of New Zealand Category:Taxation in New Zealand Category:Working groups ","title":"Tax Working Group"},{"id":"56109903","text":"Michael Schmidt (6 October 1945 – 24 May 2014) was a German photographer.

During the colonial era, the Cameron Highlands was a haven for those who were homesick. At present, it is a stopover for those who want to escape from the heat of the lowlands. Over the years, there have been many improvements at the province. Here are some landmarks that have withstood the test of time. ==Agricultural Experiment Station (MARDI)== Established in 1925, the Agricultural Experiment Station was set up to determine the types crops that could grown at the tableland. All Souls' Church For a start, studies were carried out on Cinchona (C. pubescens and C. calisaya), tea (Dangri, Dhonjan, Rajghur, Charali Assam, Amulguri and Dutea), coffee (Mysore variety), orange, lemon, pomelo, tree tomato, guava, strawberry and three species of grass (Australian blue couch, carpet and Guinea grass). It was confirmed the uplands could support the growing of tea. This gave the British the impetus to develop the place. In 1971, the station became a part of the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (MARDI). Today, it still conducts research on a wide variety of crops that are grown at the district. ==All Souls' Church== Located in Taman Sedia, Tanah Rata, the plateau's little Church of England was once acknowledged by the early members of its congregation as The Cameron Highlands Church. All Souls’ Church. The history of this establishment can be traced back to the 1950s when its services were held at either the Cameron Highlands Hotel (now the Cameron Highlands Resort) or the former Slim School. Miss Anne Griffith-Jones, OBE (1890–1973). Photo credit: Tanglin Trust School, Singapore. In 1958, the church was offered a piece of land that used to adjoin the previous school. The plot, which was owned by Miss Anne Griffith-Jones (1890–1973), was transferred to the Diocese on the understanding that a church would be built on it. To get things going, the British Army donated a sum of RM$1,000 to the church. Further to this, they also gave it a dismantled Nissen hut. It has since served as its roof structure to this day. The construction of the church commenced in 1958. It was completed that same year. It was given the name “All Souls’ Church” during its consecration on Thursday, 30 April 1959. The Right Rev. Bishop H. W. Baines, the Bishop of Singapore and Malaya, conducted the services. ==Bala’s Holiday Chalet (former Tanglin Boarding School)== The inn is one of the oldest buildings at the resort. Built in 1935, it was previously occupied by the Tanglin Boarding School. Founded by Miss Anne Griffith-Jones, the school began with less than 20 pupils. Its curriculum was based on the British education system. Tanglin Boarding School: Miss Anne Griffith-Jones (back row, fifth from left) with her staff and pupils outside the school's main building (c. 1930s). Photo credit: Tanglin Trust School, Singapore. The school continued to grow until the outbreak of the Second World War. It ceased to function during the Japanese Occupation of Malaya. After the war, it reopened. During the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960), the school became a target for the Malayan National Liberation Army. It was eventually forced to close by the Federal Government for security reasons. In 1950, the property was sold to the British War Office. ==Cameron Highlands Golf Club== It began with a six- hole golf course in 1935. In the early days, the club was patronised by the wealthy. Back then, it was common to find tiger paw prints in the bunkers. Today, the club has changed a lot from what it once used to be. Apart from its improved facilities, it has also undergone a change in name. It presently operates as the Kelab Golf Sultan Ahmad Shah (SAS) Cameron Highlands. ==Chefoo School (Methodist Centennial Chefoo Centre)== The first Chefoo School was opened in China in 1881. It moved to the Cameron Highlands in 1952. Initially, the boarding school functioned from the Overseas Missionary Fellowship bungalow. In 1960, it relocated to a six-acre site at Jalan Sultan Abu Bakar. It remained here for four decades. Cluny lodge (Singapore House). In June 2001, the school had to close due to a drop in its student intake. The following year, the estate was sold to the Methodist Church in Malaysia. It is now known as the Methodist Centennial Chefoo Centre. ==Cluny Lodge (Singapore House)== The three-storied flat was built before the commencement of the Second World War. Located in Tanah Rata, it sits atop a knoll overlooking the town of Brinchang. The building was bought over by the Singapore Government in the early 1960s. Since then, it has been used by the employees of the Singapore Civil Service as their lodging house. ==Foster’s Lakehouse (The Lakehouse)== The inn was once the home of the late Colonel Stanley J. Foster. Constructed in 1966, it took Colonel Foster almost four years to complete it. Situated at the 30th Mile of Ringlet, the Lakehouse is perched on a hill overlooking the Sultan Abu Bakar Lake. Set in an area dubbed \\"The Valley of Eternal Spring\\", this establishment has a lush forest as its backdrop. ==HSBC Bank Malaysia Berhad== Previously identified as The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, HSBC Bank was the first financial institution to function at the Cameron Highlands. Malay: Jalan Kamunting). Prior to his disappearance from the Cameron Highlands, Jim Thompson was seen at this cottage at about 4pm. After taking a look at the garden, he left the place. In 1945, its banking services were carried out at the Cameron Highlands Hotel (now the Cameron Highlands Resort). Later, it moved to the British Military Hospital (now S.K. Convent). In 1947, it relocated to the Main Road at Tanah Rata. It has remained here to this day. ==Kamunting Road (Jalan Kamunting)== There are five houses located along the main corridor of Kamunting Road (Malay: Jalan Kamunting). They are “Moonlight” bungalow (A47), “Sunlight” mansion (A46), “Unit A43”, the “Lee Villa” (A44) and the Lutheran Mission Home (A45). The precinct was in the news when Jim Thompson disappeared from the Cameron Highlands on Sunday, 26 March 1967. More than 500 people came here to look for him. They included the police, the army, Orang Asli trekkers, Gurkhas, tourists, residents, mediums, scouts, missionaries, American school students and British servicemen convalescing at the retreat. After searching the area for days, Thompson was not to be found. ==Lutheran Mission bungalow== The manor was constructed before the outbreak of the Second World War. It was then known as “Jee Lim Villa”. Tudor-styled dwelling is located at A47 Kamunting Road (Malay: Jalan Kamunting). It was once the holiday home of Jim Thompson, the “Thai Silk King”. On his last visit to the Highlands, he left the bungalow at 1:30 pm. He failed to return before 6 pm. Tucked at the far end of Kamunting Road (Malay: Jalan Kamunting), the place gained prominence when Jim Thompson vanished from the Cameron Highlands on Sunday, 26 March 1967. The police were told he did stop by at the premises at around 4pm. While he was at the chalet, he did not speak to anyone. After taking a look at the garden, he left the site. Later, he was declared as lost. ==Moonlight bungalow (Jim Thompson cottage)== Located at A47 Kamunting Road (Malay: Jalan Kamunting), the mock Tudor-styled home is still a draw for the many who have had an interest in the life and disappearance of Jim Thompson. The pre-War unit was constructed in 1933 by Societe Francaise des Mines d’Etain de Takka, a French mining company based in Gopeng, Perak. During the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960), its name was changed from the \\"French Tekka\\" bungalow to “Moonlight”. After the Emergency, the land was sold to the Lings. Later, it became the property of an Ipoh lawyer. Over the years, the ownership of the bungalow has changed hands many times. Before the present owners moved in, \\"Moonlight\\" belonged to a Chinese businessman followed by a resident from Kuala Lumpur. It was later taken over by a Caucasian who then sold it to a hotelier. Today, the house is worth more than a million US dollars. It is now called the Jim Thompson cottage. ==Overseas Missionary Fellowship (OMF) bungalow== The lodge was built in 1933 to provide accommodation for Christians who were involved with the preaching of the gospel. From 1952 to 1960, it served as the campus for the former Chefoo School. Thereafter, it became a venue for Christians to gather for their church activities. ==Pensionnat Notre Dame (S.K. Convent)== The Convent Primary School was once a boarding school for the children of the resort’s expatriate community. Its history dates back to the time when the hill plain was first developed. In the late 1920s, the Bishop of Malacca, H.E. Monsignor Emile Barillon wrote to the British government seeking a grant of land at the constituency. His purpose was to oversee a Catholic post comprising a monastery, a convent (Pensionnat Notre Dame), a retreat (Father’s House) and a church. His request was granted on condition a European boarding school was included in the plan. The construction of the Pensionnat Notre Dame began in 1929. Mr. P.L.M. Nathan, was appointed the project’s architect and structural engineer. The structure was completed in 1934. H.E. Monseigneur Adrian Pierre Devals blessed the building’s foundation on Monday, 9 July 1934. The first Mass was celebrated on Sunday, 26 May 1935. The Hon. Mr. C. C. Brown, the British Resident of Pahang officially opened the complex on Saturday, 27 July 1935. Thereafter, the school continued to grow. In less than three months, the student intake grew from 18 to 70. By 1940, it had more than 240 pupils. This, however, came to a halt during the Second World War (1941–1945). The Japanese turned the place into a hospital. Sunlight bungalow: The unit is located at A46 Kamunting Road (Malay: Jalan Kamunting). It is about 50 meters from \\"Moonlight\\" bungalow. After the war, the school reopened but it functioned from huts within its compound. The British continued to use the site as a hospital. Known as the British Military Hospital, it was leased from the church to serve as a convalescent depot for the members of the British Army. When the British withdrew in 1971, the Gothic-styled building was returned to the Catholic community. It was renamed Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan (S.K. Convent). ==Sunlight bungalow== The double-storied mansion was once used by a British company to house its staff. The pre-War abode is located about from “Moonlight” bungalow. It is approximately three kilometres from Brinchang or about four kilometres from Tanah Rata. In 1967, the villa made news when Jim Thompson mysteriously disappeared from the Cameron Highlands. The home was visited by scores of searchers. For days, the wasteland near the unit was carefully checked. At the end of the hunt, Thompson was not to be found. ==Tanah Rata Post Office== Time Tunnel museum. The post office was officially opened by Tunku Abdul Rahman, the then Chief Minister of Malaya on Friday, 25 June 1956. Located on the Main Road (Malay: Jalan Besar), it is one of the few post offices in the area that provides its customers with a “Poste restante” service. ==Ye Olde Smokehouse Inn (The Smokehouse Hotel)== Built by William J. Warin in 1939, the mock Tudor-styled hotel is renowned for celebrating everything British. The inn is modelled on its namesake, the Smokehouse in Beck Row, Mildenhall, England, the United Kingdom. The interior is reminiscent of a typical English country house with open fireplaces and wood-panelled walls. Outside, the landscape would pass for an authentic English garden. The landmark overlooks the Sultan Ahmad Shah golf course on the Tanah Rata-Bringchang road junction. It is still a popular place for visitors to gather for their afternoon tea and scones. ==References== Notes Books * * Category:Buildings and structures in Pahang ","title":"Landmarks in Cameron Highlands"},{"id":"56110140","text":"Christopher Anthony Cayole (born January 1, 1985) is an American former professional basketball player who last played for Santos de San Luis in Mexico.

Harmon, and starred William Reynolds, Andra Martin, Gogi Grant, and Jeffrey Stone. It was shot in Eastmancolor, by Pathe, and was released on May 24, 1958 as a double bill with Summer Love.https://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-big- beat-v The story is about a young man fresh out of college named John Randall who tries to persuade his father, a record company own, to start signing up rock 'n' roll acts. This film is well-known to have featured many famous and popular singers, musicians, and musical groups of the 1950s, including Charlie Barnet, Buddy Bregman, Alan Copeland, The Del-Vikings, and Jeri Southern. ==Plot== In New York, Joseph Randall (Bill Goodwin), the owner of Randall Records, names his son John (William Reynolds) as the company's new vice- president, to the pleasure of A&R; man Danny Phillips (Jeffrey Stone). John immediately urges his father to eschew the company's middle-of-the-road love ballads in favor of newer musical genres, such as rock and roll, calypso or rhythm and blues, but Joseph refuses to deviate from the standards. For this reason, Danny's girlfriend, celebrated singer Cindy Adams (Gogi Grant), has decided not to sign a contract with Randall Records. John admires his new office and young secretary, singer Nikki Collins (Andra Martin), who is impressed by his persistence in pitching a more up-to-date record label to his father. At the end of John's first day, Danny is, as usual, too busy working to take Cindy out to dinner, and so encourages John to take his place. John and Cindy go to a nightclub to see George Shearing & the Quintet perform, and there Cindy admits that she is eager to marry Danny, who maintains an emotional distance while he builds his career. John then accompanies Cindy to her television show and, after watching her sing, enthusiastically offers the band, a beatnik rock combo called the Preston Trio, an audition at his office. The next day, however, Joseph refuses to record the group, and in frustration John turns to the sympathetic Nikki. She brings him to her apartment, where her neighbors, the Lancer family, May Gordon (Rose Marie), and sculptor Vladimir Skolsky (Hans Conried), entertain him with an impromptu show. Days later, before leaving for an eight-week trip to Europe, Joseph announces that he is incorporating a new company, Revue Records, as a test label for John. He gives half-ownership to John and forty percent to Danny, who is moved by the gesture. Over the next few weeks, Danny tries to groom John and teach him how to market his songs, but John is impatient and signs acts recklessly. At a launch party for the label, John is consumed with new ideas and research about the record business, prompting Nikki to use all her wiles to engage him in a kiss. Meanwhile, Cindy tells Danny that she no longer wants to perform, preferring the prospect of marriage, and he promises that if Revue is successful, they will wed. With that in mind, when John and Nikki urge Cindy to record a song for Revue, she agrees, hoping to spur on the label's success. Eight weeks later, however, the label is floundering, due to the huge, unsold backlog of records that John has produced. When Joseph returns, he is furious, warning John to sell the records or relinquish his share of the company. John, devastated that he has disappointed his father, goes to Nikki's to commiserate, but they are interrupted by Vlad, who insists on hearing about their dilemma. Although Nikki urges Vlad to leave, John seems inspired by his visit, and the next day gathers all his old textbooks in the certainty that there is valuable information somewhere in them. By nighttime, John has realized, from a photo in his economics books, that Vlad is in reality supermarket mogul B. J. Carson. Upon confronting Vlad, the executive drops his phony accent and admits that for six months of every year he lives a quiet life in disguise. The next day, John calls a meeting of Joseph, Danny, Nikki, Cindy, and the department heads. When Vlad enters, everyone is shocked, especially Nikki, who suspects the sculptor is tricking them. He explains, however, that John has convinced him to buy the back stock of records for sale in his supermarket chain. After Vlad orders thousands of albums per month, Danny turns to Cindy with a marriage proposal and Joseph exults that he trusted John all along. To prove his conversion, when the Preston Trio visits, Joseph boasts that he \\"digs them from down under to the polar cap.\\" ==Cast== * William Reynolds as John Randall * Andra Martin as Nikki Collins * Gogi Grant as Cindy Adams * Jeffrey Stone as Danny Phillips * Rose Marie as May Gordon * Hans Conried as Vladimir Skilsky (AKA B.

She founded or co-founded socially focused institutions within the Catholic Church and exercised a decisive influence on the church's approach to operating Kindergartens and to child welfare more generally. == Life == Maria Sophie Thekla Kiene was born in Schwäbisch Hall, a small long-established town in the hilly countryside to the northeast of Stuttgart. She was the third of her parents' five recorded children. Johannes Baptist von Kiene (1852-1919), her father, was a lawyer and politician of the Centre Party who towards the end of his career would serve in Stuttgart as Minister for Justice and president of the Württemberg regional court. The family was a deeply religious one. The nature of her father's work meant that the family relocated several times while she was growing up. Maria was initially educated at home, but after the family moved to Ravensburg attended junior school in the town, then moving on briefly to the Senior Girls' School before the family moved again, in 1899, to Stuttgart where, following what amounted to a \\"gap year\\" in an Ursuline convent near Ahrweiler, she concluded her school career, passing her school final exams (Abitur) as an \\"external pupil\\" at a boys' secondary school (Gymnasium). The Abitur normally opened the way to university-level education, but at this time it was very unusual for girls' education to be progressed this far. During her year at the convent she had resolved to pursue a religious life, albeit outside the convent walls. She next embarked on a study of applied aconomics (Volkswirtschaft) and philosophy, but fairly soon was obliged by serious illness to abandon that option. She recovered, but was unable to resume her studies in the turmoil that followed the war. Her father died during 1919 and for Maria there followed several unfulfilled years, living as her mother's spinster daughter (als \\"Haustochterdaseins\\"). It was in order to give her life greater meaning that shortly before reaching her thirtieth birthday she started work at the Stuttgart \\"Dames' School\\" (\\"Mütterschule\\") which had been established by Luise Lampert und Anna Lindemann for young infants in 1917, and which was the first institution of its kind in Germany. Kiene quickly identified the advantages she might obtain from professional training. She undertook a \\"Kindergarten workers' training course\\" with the \\"Kindergarten seminary of the Württemberg regional committee of the German Catholic Women's Association\\" (\\"Kindergärtnerinnen-Seminar des Württembergischen Landesausschusses des katholischen Frauenbundes Deutschlands\\") in Schwäbisch Gmünd. Next she undertook a training as a youth leader in Stuttgart with the so-called \\"Fröbel seminary of Schawbian Women's Associations\\" (\\"Fröbelseminar des Schwäbischen Frauenvereins\\"). That was followed by five months as a \\"house mother\\" at the Heuberg Holiday and Convalescence Institution in Stuttgart and nine months as training director in the Diocesan presidium for Child care in the Archdiocese of Cologne. In 1922 Benedict Kreutz, president at the time of the church's Caritas association, appointed her to work with Alexandrine Hegemann at the Caritas national headquarters in Freiburg. After Hegemann died in 1926 it fell to Kiene to take on the leadership role in respect of childcare activities. The priority was the establishment and development of child recreation and care provision, paying particular attention to service provision at the local level. As she later recalled, between approximately 1924 and 1926, recognising the essential connection between prevention and welfare, the Caritas association in the Stuttgart area created more than seven \\"forest recreation centres\\", operating primarily during the summer months, and made available for Kindergartens to use outside the holiday period. This meant that each Kindergarten involved benefited from a four-week stay in the forest recreation camps. From this experience, children already weakened or injured could be identified, along with the need for Caritas and its specialist agencies to provide additional help for children who enjoyed good health but whose home situations nevertheless provided insufficient space for a fully relaxing and strengthening holiday. There was also a perceived correlation between deprivation - cramped housing, lack of contact with parents who worked full- time - and spiritual deprivation, which meant an ongoing threat to children's physical development. On Kiene's initiative in 1927 a youth leadership seminary was established at Freiburg, subsequently merged into a precursor of today's Catholic University of Applied Sciences Freiburg. Kiene took on its headship. Young women with, if possible, several years of practical experience in day nurseries, Kindergartens or similar establishments were offered a one- year training in \\"social education\\" with official state recognition. In this respect the Caritas Association was responding to the needs of the time, whreby a large number of professionally trained catholic women employees were needed for leading hands-on roles in welfare and education. Keine later wrote that the young women must be capable of handling particular responsibilities and tasks in larger educational institutions and all types of homes for children and adolescents, providing remedial teaching and youth care. They must understand how to apply principles and values of holisric life-care, and a powerful ability to create a real home must form an important element in their repertoire of skills and abilities. The young women leaders must be vectors of professionalism in institutions such kindergartens, dames' schools and similar establishments. And their particular teaching responsibility must always be to give motherly guidance in the socio-educational context, through a wide range of working approaches to education and popular training. And she must bring to her work a broad and rich blend of experience and intuition. Kiene headed up the teaching at the institution till her retirement in 1966. The Nazi take-over at the start of 1933 was followed by a rapid transition to one-party dictatorship. Kiene responded to the new set of challenges with \\"Christian steadfastness and directness\\". Early on she railed against the \\"tactical acceptance strategies\\" of some senior churchmen. She was particularly outspoken to the Jesuit Caritas director, Constantin Noppel (1883–1945), over the Osnabrück bishop, Wilhelm Berning who expressed doubts over whether educating children could really be characterised as a \\"direct apostolic task\\", which implicitly questioned whether working in Cathilic kindergartens should be classified as church business. On 1 January 1934 the infamous \\"Law to prevent offspring with hereditary diseases\\" (\\"Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses\\") came into force. Kiene was appalled, and immediately wrote an impassioned letter to Constantin Noppel in Rome. Kiene's little 1939 book \\"Ein Kind ist uns geschenkt. Von der weihnachtlichen Verantwortung christlicher Kinderhilfe\\" (\\"A child is given to us. From Christmas season responsibilities Christian help for children\\") set out her Chrisian charitable approach with a directness that makes it hard to understand how she was able to get the book published at that time. In any case, after it appeared she suffered serious difficulties with the Gestapo who placed her under intensified surveillance.Breuer, D.: Marie Kiene (1889-1979). Leben und Werk einer bedeutenden Frau der (katholischen) Sozialpädagogik, Ulm 2001 (unpublished diploma dissertation) After war ended in the early summer of 1945, she sustained her commitment to educational qualification for Kindergarten workers and youth leaders, and also in respect of recuperative and curative care. She also committed intensively to rebuilding and extending the Kindergarten network. A particular case in point arose in 1946 when the Caritas Association took over Schloß Buchau, a former beguinage which under the Nazi regime had been used as a Kindergarten workers' seminary. Kiene built this into a model institution for restitutional and curative care for children and young people. In its day Kiene's book, \\"Das Kind im Kindergarten\\" (\\"The Child in the kindergarten\\", 1953) was widely recognised and distributed not merely in Catholic conservative circles, but more broadly. There were several editions, and it was even translated into Italian. In it, Maria Kiene presented the then mainstream belief that Kindergarten provision should not be a permanent need, and that the principal objective for Kindergartens should be to make themselves redundant. She wrote: :\\"It has always been at the heart of Caritas childcare to identify the Kindergarten simply as an institution that complements the family. Any evaluation of the Kindergarten proceeds from the basis that that it is no sort of a substitute for the family nor indeed the school, as necessary contexts for childhood... As Friedrich Fröbel put it after deciding to create separate Kindergartens, 'We are there to make ourselves no longer necessary'. This is the spirit in which every Kindergarten worker should see her task.\\" ==References== Category:Officers Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Category:1889 births Category:1979 deaths ","title":"Maria Kiene"},{"id":"56110310","text":"Irena Lasota (born 25 July 1945 as Irene Hirszowicz) is a Polish philosopher, publicist, publisher, social and political activist, and president/co-director of the Institute for Democracy in Eastern Europe. Lasota began her political activism as a student in Poland during the 1968 Polish political crisis, which pitted protesting students against the then-Communist government. Soon after the so called March events, Lasota would emigrate to the United States, eventually returning to Europe in the first half of the 1980s to settle down in France. Lasota is to this day a frequent commentator on Polish and American political affairs, and remains an outspoken supporter of freedom of speech and democratic institutions. == Early life == Born in France shortly after the conclusion of World War II in Europe, Lasota would return to Poland with her family in 1948 where they changed their family name from Hirszowicz to Lasota. In 1958 she became a member of the \\"Hufiec Walterowski\\" (Eng. The Walter Troop), a youth organization re-activated in 1956 under the mantle of the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association following the period of Stalinism in Eastern Europe. The Troop was led at the time by Jacek Kuroń, and would produce many other leaders of the democratic opposition in Communist Poland, including Andrzej Seweryn and Adam Michnik. == Political activism ==  Activism in Poland  Between 1962 and 1968 Lasota studied philosophy at the University of Warsaw. In 1964 she created a discussion group in cooperation with other students, among whom were Teresa Bogucka, Maciej Czechowski, Józef Dajczgewand, and Wiktor Górecki. The group's members also practised self- education in the area of social sciences, sharing a copy of the Parisian magazine \\"Kultura\\", organizing an emergency fund in case of government reprisals, and took part in open meetings of the Socialist Youth Association (ZMS), of which Lasota was a member for three months in 1964. Lasota's group would ideologically distance itself from another active student group headed by former Walter Troop member Adam Michnik. Kuroń later commented on this cooling of relations: \\"In accordance with the rules presented to them by Irena, they aimed at attracting youth living in the student dorms, youth from rural areas, those with a worker and peasant background. […] They accused Adam [Michnik] and his colleagues of elitism, of closing themselves off in their own circle, or lounge as they called it\\" (Wiara i wina, NOWA, Warsaw, 1990). Between 1966 and 1967 Lasota prepared for a role as debate leader at the open- entry ZMS meetings. During this time she became acquainted with Antoni Zambrowski and began aiding him in the distribution of transcribed illegal publications, i.e. translating banned political science writings. In 1987 and the following year, she would begin co-editing and disseminating pamphlets around the University of Warsaw and work as editorial assistant for the publication \\"Wiedza Powszechna\\". In January 1968 Lasota was party to the culminating events eventually leading to the March crisis and wave of student protests in Poland. On January 30, 1968, a student demonstration took place in Warsaw against the censuring and removal of the play \\"Dziady\\" from the National Theatre. Directed by Kazimierz Dejmek, the play had run for four nights before Dejmek was ordered that the show be limited to playing once a week, normal ticket sales for students capped at 100 seats, and the public's reaction noted down by the director. Though subject to confiscations and controls by Security Services and student members of Warsaw University's ZMS, Lasota was able to compile a petition of 3145 signatures sent by mail to the Marshal of the Sejm on February 16. During a pre-planned rally on March 8, she called for the return of Michnik and Henryk Szlajfer, both of whom had been expelled from the university, as well as for a halt to all other disciplinary action against Warsaw's students. Having presented their demands, Lasota met with the deputy rector of the university as part of a student delegation. Following the rally Lasota was arrested and tried by the misdemeanour board, receiving a two-month prison sentence on the grounds of \\"standing on a public bench in muddied boots\\". She was released in August 1968, but faced further prosecution the following year. In April 1969 she was tried and sentenced once again, this time for a year and a half for belonging to a secret organization. Over this same period Lasota, in cooperation with Jakub Karpiński, Grażyna Kuroniowa, Andrzej Zabłudowski, collected information to be sent abroad concerning the ongoing legal proceedings of individuals prosecuted for their involvement in the March events.  Activism and life abroad  In 1970 Lasota left Poland with her then-husband Zabłudowski, following his expulsion from the University of Warsaw. Under the pretext of emigration to Israel, the couple transited and officially emigrated to the United States that same year. Lasota resumed her studies, graduating from Temple University in Philadelphia in 1972 with a degree in special education. She would work as a child therapist for the next nine years until 1982. In 1975 she returned to school, this time completing a degree in political sciences with a specialization in International Communism at Columbia University in 1979. This led her to become a lecturer in this field at Fordham and Yale universities between 1980-81. Lasota remained politically active around events unfolding in Poland over this same period. Though banned from entering the country, she was able to attain a visa and return to Poland on four occasions, in 1975, 1977, 1979, and 1984, bringing with her and disseminating illegal publications among her friends. She worked to promote awareness of events in Poland by providing western mass media outlets with current information. She wrote for \\"The New Daily\\" in New York and cooperated with London's \\"Aneks\\". In 1975 Lasota became a publicist and permanent collaborator with Radio Free Europe and the BBC. From 1976 she was also in contact with US labour organization AFL-CIO, which she provided with information on the prosecution of workers in Poland as a primary consultant to its directorial board. In 1977 Lasota took part in an appeal by American intellectuals in defence of arrested members of the Polish Workers' Protection Committee. That same year, she would co-found Amnesty International's coordination group for Eastern European alongside Robert Sharlet and Irena Grudzińska. By 1981, Lasota had become an editor and publisher of numerous publications, including \\"Committee in Support of Solidarity Reports\\", \\"Solidarity Bulletin\\", and \\"Uncaptive Mind\\". Additionally, she wrote articles that appeared on the pages of Poland's underground newspapers. That same year in New York, Lasota, in cooperation with Eric Chenoweth, Karpiński, and Jerzy Warman, founded The Committee in Support of Solidarity. The Committee was active politically, organizing demonstrations, among others, at the United Nations' New York headquarters in 1982. During a session dedicated to the topic of disarmament, Lasota and Chenoweth managed to unfurl a banner they had smuggled into the building in front of Andrei Gromyko, Soviet Delegation Chief, which read \\"Disarm Brezhnev, disarm Jaruzelski\\", for which they were detained by building security. Through its money collection efforts, the Committee was able to procure various materials and equipment for freedom organizations in Poland. This included tape recorders, transistors, printing ink, silkscreens, all of which were smuggled with the help of hundreds of opposition activists travelling between Poland and the United States and France. One example of the organization's money collection efforts was a concert of violinist Wanda Wiłkomirska organized in New York, which brought in $8300 for the Polish opposition. By 1984, The Committee expanded to become the Institute for Democracy in Eastern Europe (IDEE). The organization broadened its activities to material support for anti-Communist opposition movements in Czechoslovakia and Hungary, in addition to Poland. It also served as a collection and transfer point for donations from American foundations supporting independent initiatives in these countries. By November 1989, at least 194 periodicals and underground initiatives received up to 143.760 US dollars in aid, transferred and billed under the names of various composers, artists, and poets. A full expense report was published by Lasota in \\"Kultura\\" (n4/1990). IDEE would also transfer over 250 thousand USD to the Consortium of Independent Publishers, along with additional sums for the Regional Executive Commission of NSZZ \\"Solidarity\\" Mazovia, underground Independent Student Collective, and Orange Alternative. In 1986 she oversaw a sum of 200 thousand USD provided by George Soros' Open Society foundation for short-term scholarships ranging between 500-1000 dollars. The scholarships benefited 177 individuals who were able to undertake study trips to London and Paris, and were aimed at grooming Poland's future academic and political elite. In 1985 Lasota moved to Paris. From there she continued to send thousands of books by mail to Poland with the help of her second husband, Jakub Karpiński. Together they published a Polish journal series titled \\"Konfrontacje\\" between 1985–91, which contained translated academic research on anti-Communist opposition efforts. The series comprised 14 tomes, frequently re-printed by independent Polish publishers, including \\"PoMost\\" and \\"Res publica\\". Since the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe after 1989, Lasota has focused on financial and organizational aid for independent initiatives in former Soviet Bloc states, opening the IDEE Foundation in Poland in 1992. == Writings ==  Editor  * Bulletin Solidarność * Biuletyn Informacyjny * Listy więźniów * Repression in Poland * Various Helsinki Committee Poland studies * Committee in Support of Solidarity Reports * Konfrontacje * Uncaptive Minds * World Affairs * Droga do Solidarności – selected texts of Marek Tarniewski and documents between 1956–81  Contributor  * New Daily * Aneks * Radio Free Europe * The New York Times * Kultura * Orientacja na Prawo * Tu, teraz * Przegląd Wiadomości Agencyjnych * Rzeczpospolita * Salon24 == Awards and honours == * Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (2008) * Honorary Member of the Republican Party of Georgia (1999) == See also == * Anti-communist resistance in Poland == References == Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:Columbia University alumni Category:Commanders of the Order of Polonia Restituta Category:Polish activists Category:Polish publicists Category:Polish publishers (people) Category:Polish women philosophers Category:Temple University alumni ","title":"Irena Lasota"},{"id":"56110311","text":"Mug () is a 2018 Polish drama film directed by Małgorzata Szumowska.

This forced him to leave school and to start working as a sailor. During the first forty years of his life he had a number of jobs. He served in the army in the French Foreign Legion and was sent overseas to Madagascar. He was also a fencing teacher and worked for the Douala customs, in Cameroon, of which he became a spokesperson. After some conflicts he was fired but in 1911 he was reinstated to his function. == Cameroon == In 1922, Ganty moved to Cameroon where he continued to have a series of odd jobs, as a masseur, amulet seller, magician and teacher of hypno-magnetism. In 1927 he set up the church La Science Chrétienne du Cameroun, associated with the Christian Science, which provided a shelter for black empowerment activities. This resulted in the formation of a series of groups like Comité de Défense de la Race Nègre and Group Ganty de Défense des Citoyens Nègres Camerounais et Amis des Nègres. In 1930 Ganty moved to Paris and became the self-proclaimed spokesperson for the Cameroonians there. He provided in his living by selling subscriptions of the newspaper, ′Cameroon Republic′ of which he was also the editor. == Politics == After World War II Front inter-coloniale, Comité philanthrope supérieur d’émancipation intégrale et d’initiative générale de la délégation en Europe des Camerounais, Comité philanthrope supérieur pour la défense du Cameroun were set up and sometimes disappeared soon after their foundation. He started sending many letters and petitions to the League of Nations, the precursor the United Nations. His correspondence, which was sometimes hard to follow, was never taken really seriously. But even if his role in independence was ambiguous, nowadays he is remembered as an important figure that paved the road to independence for Cameroon.

Billy Hughes was elected as his replacement. Menzies had become UAP leader (and thus prime minister) in 1939, following the death of Joseph Lyons. The UAP-Country Coalition lost its slender majority at the 1940 election, and depended on the votes of two independents to stay in office. On 29 August 1941, Menzies resigned the prime ministership after Labor turned down his offer to join a national unity government. He was succeeded by Country Party leader Arthur Fadden, who had been elected by a joint meeting of the Coalition parties. However, the Fadden Government lasted only 40 days before being defeated after the two independents joined Labor in defeating Fadden's budget. John Curtin's Labor Party formed a new government on 7 October, with the Coalition parties forced into opposition. On 9 October, Menzies called a meeting of the parliamentary UAP. He resigned the party's leadership, but not before calling for a vote to determine whether the UAP should form a joint opposition with the Country Party (with Fadden as opposition leader). After a long debate, a joint opposition was approved by 19 votes to 12, despite Menzies arguing against the proposal. As a result, he did not re-contest the party leadership. There were three candidates – former prime minister and attorney-general Billy Hughes, former army minister Percy Spender, and former external territories minister Allan McDonald. Spender was eliminated on the first ballot, and Hughes narrowly defeated McDonald on the second. The final tally of votes was not released, but some sources reported the margin to be only a single vote.NEW GOVERNMENT (Cont.), The Sydney Morning Herald, 9 October 1941.Mr. Hughes Replaces Mr. Menzies, Launceston Examiner, 9 October 1941.

In April 1936, he and his wife, Irene, founded Dargaud S.A. The publishing company focused on corporate communications and family magazines. In 1943, Dargaud began publishing comics, starting with Allo les jeunes. Two years later, he published comic albums of Bob et Bobette by Loys Pétillot (not to be confused with the French version of Willy Vandersteen's Suske en Wiske). In 1948, Dargaud was approached by Raymond Leblanc, the publisher of Belgian comic magazine Journal de Tintin. Leblanc had previously contacted numerous French publishers, all of whom had refused to publish Tintin on the grounds the eponymous comic’s creator, Hergé, had been accused of being a Nazi collaborator for drawing Tintin for a Nazi-controlled newspaper during World War II. Dargaud ignored the anti-Hergé rumors. In October 1948, in partnership with Editions du Lombard, he became the French publisher of Journal de Tintin, which he continued to print for 27 years. In December 1960, Dargaud purchased Pilote weekly comic magazine, which had been established the previous year by the Édifrance/Édipresse syndicate founded by Rene Goscinny, Albert Uderzo, Jean-Michel Charlier and Jean Hebrad. Although the magazine was successful, its funders had pulled out because of financial difficulties, resulting in Dargaud buying it for what was later described as \\"pour un franc symbolique\\" (\\"for pennies\\"). The magazine introduced Asterix and later featured Lucky Luke (which transferred from Spirou in 1967). The Asterix comic albums became best-sellers for Dargaud. Dargaud produced the first Asterix film, Asterix the Gaul, in 1967. In 1976, he produced The 12 Tasks of Asterix. Dargaud's relationship with Goscinny and Uderzo had become strained by the 1970s. When Goscinny died of a heart attack in 1977, the 24th Asterix book, Asterix in Belgium, had been written but not illustrated. Uderzo was unwilling to complete the book, so Dargaud took him to court and forced him to finish the book. The court ruled for Uderzo, but by that time the book had already been published. Uderzo once said that if he were to caricature Dargaud in an Asterix book, he would depict him as a vampire. In addition to children’s comics, Dargaud also published adult-oriented comics. Dargaud in 1982 bought publishing firm Les Éditions du Square and its comic Charlie Mensuel, which was merged with Pilote in 1986 under the name Pilote et Charlie. In 1988 the name was changed back to Pilote. In January 1989, Dargaud sold his publishing house to Media Participation (also known as Ampere group), a conservative Christian firm. Dargaud died on 18 July 1990 at the age of 79. In February 2006, his daughter auctioned his collection of comics through auction house Lasseron & Associés. ==References== Category:1911 births Category:1990 deaths Category:French publishers (people) ","title":"Georges Dargaud"},{"id":"56111315","text":"Roy Addison (born 17 February 1939) is a British boxer.

The state border between Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia runs about 50 metres northeast of the summit – roughly along the lower part of the eponymous rock formation. On the Rhineland-Palatinate side a tributary of the Daaderises in the west on an area called Am Zollstock and, on the North Rhine-Westphalian side, the Buchheller tributary, the Nenkersbach, rises in the east. Neighbouring mountains are: to the north, the Nenkersberg (610.3 m) and, to the south- southeast, the Lipper Nürr (616.9 m). According to the Deutsche Grundkarte, the summit of the Trödelsteine is 613.0 m; on the topographical maps a height of 612.8 m is given.

Ptolemaic coinage was struck in Phoenician weight, also known as Ptolemaic weight (about 14.2 grams). This standard, which was not used elsewhere in the Hellenistic world, was smaller than the dominant Attic weight. Consequentially, Ptolemaic coins are smaller than other Hellenistic coinage. In terms of art, the coins, which were made of silver, followed the example set by contemporary Greek currencies, with dynastic figures being typically portrayed. The Ptolemaic coin making process often resulted in a central depression, similar to what can be found on Seleucid coinage. The Ptolemaic dynasty introduced coinage to Egypt, where pre-existing native dynasties made only very limited use of coins. The first Ptolemaic mint was in Memphis and was later moved to Alexandria. Succeeding in monetizing the Egyptian society, largely due to efforts of king Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the Ptolemaic kingdom flourished. For most of its history, the kingdom vigorously enforced a policy of a single currency, confiscating foreign coins found on its territory and forcing its dominions to adopt Ptolemaic coinage. In the rare cases when these dominions were allowed their own currency, such as the Jewish community in Palestine, they still had to observe the Ptolemaic weight. These policies, along with inflation and increasing difficulty to obtain silver, caused monetary isolation of the Ptolemaic coinage. After Egypt was annexed into the Roman Empire and the Ptolemaic dynasty ceased to exist, its currency still remained in circulation. This was the case until the rule of Emperor Nero. Silver from the coins was reused for Roman tetradrachm. Denarii and aurei did not circulate in the former Ptolemaic Kingdom, so Egypt's monetary isolation continued. ==Design and symbolism== Ptolemy V Epiphanes' bronze coin. Depression in center of the coin can be clearly seen both on obverse and reverse sides. Reverse shows a common Ptolemaic symbol, the eagle standing on a thunderbolt. The Ptolemaic Kingdom used Phoenician weight instead of the more common Attic weight. Phoenician weight, also known as Ptolemaic weight, is about 14,20 grams. The more common Attic weight from other Hellenistic states is approximately 17,26 grams. Ptolemaic coinage was struck in different standard, and the kingdom sought to obtain full royal control on coinage in circulation. The largest denominations of Ptolemaic bronze coinage weighed up to 100 grams. Artistically, Ptolemaic coinage closely followed contemporary Greek currencies. A commonplace symbol of the Ptolemaic dynasty is an eagle standing on a thunderbolt, first adopted by Ptolemy I Soter. The more peculiar Ptolemaic coinage include so-called \\"dynastic issues\\". Ptolemy II Philadelphus married his sister Arsinoe II, possibly to gain legitimacy in eyes of the local Egyptian population. Egyptian rulers had traditionally married their sisters to signify a connection to sacred union between the deities Osiris and Isis. A medal-like coin with one side portraying Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II, and the other side portraying Ptolemy I and Berenice I was struck after the death of Arsinoe II. She had significant posthumous influence on Egyptian religious life, and the ruling Greek dynasty was deified. In the coin making process, there were similarities with Seleucid coinage. For instance, Ptolemaic coins often have a central depression from the coin making process. ==Mints== The first Ptolemaic mint was at Memphis. It was later moved to Alexandria. Tyre was the most important coastal city out of the five Ptolemaic cities with a mint in Syria. After the Seleucid Kingdom led by Antiochus III the Great conquered Coele-Syria Ptolemais in Phoenicia (Acre) was still allowed to strike coins using the Phoenician weight. The mint remained very prolific, and was among the most active ones in the Seleucid Kingdom. It is likely that the city struck silver coinage without an interruption after it changed hands, as it was a very important city in Phoenicia. However, the Seleucids discontinued a Ptolemaic mint in Jaffa. In Greece, Ptolemaic coinage mainly originates from the Peloponnese and Euboea. Corinth did not strike Ptolemaic coinage during its brief subordination to the kingdom. Cyprus had many important mints, and the island struck large amounts of Ptolemaic coinage from 200 BC to 80 BC. Cyprus was also richer in silver than Egypt. In the second century BC, most of the Cypriot coinage are easily identifiable and datable because they include abbreviations for mints and dates for both gold and silver coinage. Cypriot mints from this period include Salamis (abbr. ΣA), Kition (abbr. KI) and Paphos (abbr. Π, and later as ΠA). Meanwhile, at Crete, there was no royal coinage in use, and Cretan cities had a strong autonomy of minting their own coins. There are no evidence that Ptolemaic mints existed in Asia Minor. Furthermore, regions such as Cilicia and Lycia had no autonomous mints striking local currency. It seems that there was little circulation of Ptolemaic currency in Caria, Lycia, Pamphylia and Cilicia. Local Pamphylian silver coinage was discontinued under Ptolemaic control. It is likely that people in southern Asia Minor simply did not have a habit of using coinage in everyday economic transactions. ==History== Ptolemy II Philadelphus (front) and his sister-wife Arsinoe II Background Silver was scarcer than gold in Egypt, and the exact ratio of their value is unclear. Silver was however probably shipped in significant quantities from abroad. In addition, Ptolemaic Cyprus produced some silver for coinage struck locally. Coinage was not used in Egypt during pre-Ptolemaic native dynasties. It has been deduced from discoveries of ancient foreign coinage in Egypt that foreign currency was used as bullion rather than as money during the native dynasties. During Ptolemaic rule, Egypt transformed from a widely currency-free society to a largely monetized one by the course of the third century BC. King Ptolemy II Philadelphus had a marked influence in the process. Greek rule monetized Egyptian taxation, and this was one of the key reasons for the success of the Ptolemaic state. Before the Ptolemaic period, metals such as copper, and grain, were used as mediums of exchange. Ptolemaic rule brought, in addition to the coinage, banks and tax farming to the country. However, even centuries earlier, increasing trade with Greece seemingly had strengthened the process of monetization. Founding of the Greek trading colony of Naukratis had coincided with the strengthening trade relations. Monetary isolation The Ptolemaic Kingdom did not use the Attic weight, or Attic standard, which was very common in other contemporary Hellenistic states such as the Seleucid Kingdom. Instead, the Ptolemaic Kingdom used Phoenician weight, which was smaller than the Attic weight. Consequently Ptolemaic coinage was smaller than coins used by other Hellenistic states. The kingdom also briefly utilized Rhodian standard in the transition process to the Phoenician weight. A possible reason for this very brief usage of the Rhodian weight in coinage may have resulted from strong commercial ties with the island of Rhodes. However, it is important to note that the Rhodian standard was lighter than Attic but heavier than Phoenician weight. As a result, the process shows a clear downward scale in size of the coinage. Despite this coincidence, political reasons and trade partnerships are still offering better explanations than a proposed theory that value of silver was in appreciation during Ptolemy I's reign. During most of the Ptolemaic Kingdom's history, it was a policy that all foreign coinage within Egypt would be confiscated by the state and replaced with Ptolemaic currency. Parallels between Athens and the Ptolemaic Kingdom can be drawn as Athens attempted to introduce a sole currency in its empire. The Ptolemaic Kingdom forced its own monetary system to its foreign dominions. In rare cases, where cities under Ptolemaic dominion were allowed to keep their local currency, the cities were still forced to convert their currency to Phoenician weight. One such instance was the Jewish community in Palestine, as they were allowed to mint coins with the names of their magistrates. However, the local Jewish currency effectively disappeared by the third century. In comparison, neighboring Seleucid Kingdom's policy was less strict in imposing the royal control on mints. Cleopatra VII. 51–30 BC, 40 drachms, minted at Alexandria; obverse: diademed bust of Cleopatra VII. Reverse: inscription reading \\"ΒΑΣΙΛΙΣΣΗΣ ΚΛΕΟΠΑΤΡΑΣ\\", with an eagle standing on thunderbolt. During the reign of Ptolemy I Soter, the founder of the kingdom, diverse local currencies were allowed to exist. They may even have been encouraged. The exact date of elimination of non-Ptolemaic coinage varies by region. As early as during Ptolemy I's reign, the closed nature of Ptolemaic monetary system started to form. In Egypt and Syria, Ptolemy I discontinued local coinage, which had Alexander the Great's image struck in them, after feeling secure in power. Such coinage with Alexander on them were very common in the successor states of the Macedonian Empire. Cypriot coinage was eliminated when the local monarchies ceased to exist. In Cyrene it took even longer to eliminate municipal coinage. In Crete the local currency was never suppressed. Uniformity of the currency was sought flexibly, yet opportunistically. As it became increasingly difficult to obtain silver for the Ptolemaic kingdom, bronze coinage largely replaced silver in Egypt. Furthermore, monetary isolation was increased by other factors, like considerable inflation and the use of a unique standard to replace the Attic weight. Early Ptolemaic silver coinage was struck from pure silver, but by the time of Cleopatra VII it had suffered a very large degree of debasement. Despite of the economic difficulties in the Ptolemaic realm, economically notable debasement began in 136 BC. After Cleopatra VII's economic reform in 51 BC a type of stater that was only one third silver was issued. Roman era Tetradrachm of Cleopatra VII Philopator, the last ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom After the demise of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, and annexation into the growing Roman Empire, silver coinage struck by the Ptolemies still continued to circulate. The Ptolemaic silver coinage mostly disappeared by the time of Emperor Nero. It is assumed that by that time, in the first half of the first century, the Ptolemaic silver coinage was probably recycled into a new currency, Roman tetradrachms, struck at mints managed by the Romans. Roman Egypt remained monetarily as a closed system, like it had been under Ptolemaic dynasty. Roman denarii and aurei did not circulate in provincial Egypt. ==See also== *Egyptian gold stater *Rhodian coinage *Coinage of Side *Coinage of the Kingdom of Pontus *Seleucid coinage ==ReferencesBibliography== * * ==External links== *Digital Library of Classical Numismatics Works: Ptolemaic Coinage *Ptolemaic coins *Coins of the Ancient Egyptians - Ptolemaic Dynasty: 323 to 30 BC *The PtolemAE Project Category:Coins of ancient Greece Category:Currencies of ancient Africa Category:Ptolemaic Kingdom ","title":"Ptolemaic coinage"},{"id":"56111433","text":"Peter Adeberg (born 23 May 1968) is a German speed skater who also represented East Germany.

Rock formations in the vicinity  In the vicinity of the Trödelsteine are the basalt formations of Druidenstein near Herkersdorf, the Großer and Kleiner Stein near Burbach (two basalt blockfields), and the Teufelskanzel near Bad Laasphe. == Description and geology == The Trödelsteine form several small basalt crags and, below them, a column and blockfield of feldspar basalt, which was broken here during the Tertiary by the basement. : The Trödelsteine are basaltic, volcanic domes (lava domes). Unlike the Westerwald, where an unbroken basalt layer formed, here only individual lava domes formed (cryptodomes). From the type of rock groups one can clearly reconstruct three different eruptions (vulcanite) , which were pushed up by the underlying Devonian basement. On the northeastern slopes of the Trödelsteine there are several trees, the southwestern mountainside is completed forested. == Hiking == On the Trödelsteine is a narrow footpath, which is part of the Trödelstein Path (Trödelsteinpfad), a 10.2-kilometre-long branch of the Rothaarsteig.

Settlement here has ranged from as far back as the Romans, as seen by the once present Roman aqueducts (destroyed). There is also a small empty tomb cave to the east of the village cut out of the rock. The village also has the claimed tomb of a prophet, Nabi Nasser, however this is unknown if it is a prophets tomb at all. In the area around Nabi Nasser there used to be ruins of a city or town that could date to the 2nd century AD, with many clay pots, oil lamps, and roman coinage found around it. The main village was destroyed in an earthquake in 1952, so the villagers built south of the graveyard. There are three mosques in the village. The newest mosque was built in the 1960's, with two mosques up north in the old area old the village, the newest of them dating before 1952 and still standing with some use, and the oldest being in ruins. It is bordered from the south with a large valley which contains many caves and the river of Nahar Sainik, to the south east the village of Kfar Beit, further to the east is the village of Kfar Melki, to the north west is the village of Mjaydel, and by Hassaniyeh to the north. The village also has an 'ain, Ain al Nabi (Spring of the Prophet, referring to the Nabi Nasser) to the south. The village is split into three. To the west is 'Isoof (عسوف) the newer part of the village. Main Kfar Hatta is around the mosque, and Al-Krom (الكروم), to the east. Isoof was designed by the government after the earthquake. == Etymology == The original name of the village used to be Kfar Hiti (Arabic: كفر حتِي) but slowly evolved into Kfar Hatta due to it being easier to say. While it is unknown what Kfar means, it is speculated that it may mean \\"land of\\", meaning that the name means \\"land of Hiti\\" which Hiti is a family name, as it still is. 'Isoof comes from the Arabic Qisoof (Arabic: قعسوف) meaning an exposed place to wind, or a place where the wind blows. Al-Krom means the trellis they used to grow grapes. == Family Names == Rida, Mokbel, Nassar, Hamoush, Hamieh, Hamade, Jizzinie, ==References== File:Villagekfarhatta.jpgThe village as seen from the merged village of Isoof in the northwest File:Mosquekfrhatta.jpgThe Mosque of Kfar Hatta File:Graveyardkfarhatta.jpgThe Graveyard of Kfar Hatta, one of the oldest areas of the village File:Mapofkfarhatta.pngA labeled map of Kfar Hatta Category:Sidon District Category:Populated places in the South Governorate ","title":"Kfar Hatta"},{"id":"56111580","text":"Central Institute of Petrochemical Engineering and Technology, Raipur (Hindi: केंद्रीय प्लास्टिक अभियांत्रिकी एवं प्रौद्योगिकी संस्थान, रायपुर) is an autonomous higher education and research institute located in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, India.

In 1956, members of the Christian Social Party faction in the Catholic Conservative Party (now the Christian Democratic People's Party, CVP) formed a political party to be more receptive to workers' concerns than the CVP. The CSP Obwalden and the Conservative Party (later the CVP Obwalden) formed a parliamentary group in the Cantonal Council even after the CSP's founding. In 1960, a member of the CSP was elected to the Executive Council for the first time. After the CSP conducted an independent election campaign in 1982, the CVP terminated the parliamentary group; since then, the CSP has formed its own group. In 2002, the CSP Obwalden left the CVP, mainly due to tensions with the Obwaldner CVP. Att tha time, the CSP announced that it would focus on cantonal politics.

MOST's responsibilities include scientific research, technology development and innovation activities; development of science and technology potentials; intellectual property; standards, metrology and quality control; atomic energy, radiation and nuclear safety; and state management on public services in fields under the Ministry’s management as stipulated by law. ==Background== The origins of science and technology and Vietnam can be traced back to as early as 20,000 BC to the Sơn Vi culture, a late Paleolithic Age in Vietnam characterized by stone tools. Pebble tools similar to ones found around the world dating to this period have been found by archeologists in the Son La and Phu Tho provinces. Following the Stone Age, the Dong Sun Bronze Age culture dating from 1,000 BC-100 AD came about in the Red River Valley region of northern Vietnam. Dong Son culture is characterized by rice cultivation techniques, domestication of water buffalo and pigs, fishing and sailing via dugout canoe, and most notably expert bronze casting in the form of distinctive Dong Son drum decorated with geometric patterns, scenes of war, animals, and boats. Vietnam's relationship with its northern neighbor China is crucial to understanding the history and current status of science and technology in Vietnam. Following the Dong Son period, Vietnam came into an extended period of conflict with China beginning with the Baiyue-Qin War. The prevailing attitude in China during this period was that of the Sino–barbarian dichotomy, a concept in which Vietnamese were considered \\"wild tribes\\" or \\"barbarians\\" in relation to China. Fear of raids and conquests into China eventually did come true in the form of Vietnamese general Lý Thường Kiệt's raids into Song China in 1075. However, part of this some Sinocentric view came from the inventions of the Han Dynasty period, such as the Four Great Inventions of the compass, gunpowder, papermaking, and printing. These inventions, which were adopted by Vietnam in the coming years, would go on to impact civilization throughout the world. These and many other Han discoveries beyond the scope of this article (negative numbers in math, seismometers, advancements in metallurgy, junk ships, and wheelbarrows to name just a few) would make their way south to Vietnam as ethnic Chinese migrated into Vietnamese territories. Vietnamese medical discoveries employed native ingredients as well as incorporating practices from Chinese traditional medicine. Vietnamese over history have displayed immense ingenuity in spite of not sharing a language with its northern neighbor whose imperial examination system produced a scholar-bureaucrat class of scientific researchers and publications. Historically Vietnamese innovation has been best demonstrated during wartime, in which Vietnamese developed on top of Chinese and western war inventions and military tactics. Brave Vietnamese military leaders and warriors developed practical wartime strategies and technology to deal with Chinese intruders, for example at Battle of Bạch Đằng in 981 when Ngô Quyền developed an original technique of sinking Chinese navy fleets. The same original technique of sinking naval fleets developed by Ngô Quyền was later employed by Vietnamese generals to repulse failed invasions by the Mongol Empire, an empire that would later go on to ravage much of Russia, Europe, China and the Arab world. In the 15th century Vietnamese scholar Hồ Nguyên Trừng was known for his development innovations on firearms and cannons and helped transfer knowledge of Vietnamese firearm technology once living in exile in China. Firearm and cannon technology developed by the Vietnamese would prove vital to the conquest of Champa by the Đại Việt in the Cham- Vietnamese War of 1471 and overall Vietnamese matchlocks during this period were considered world-class not only with Ming China but also European observers of the Trịnh–Nguyễn civil war. In more recent history, Vietnamese (both domestic scientists and Overseas Vietnamese) inventors and scientists have produced world-class discoveries. Đàm Thanh Sơn, a theoretical physicist, Eugene H. Trinh, and Bui Tuong Phong, the creator of the Phong reflection model, are three examples of Vietnamese Americans doing great scientific work. Hung Nguyen Xuan, Đái Duy Ban, Hoàng Tụy (known for the Tụy cut in global optimization) are three examples of notable Vietnamese scientists in Vietnam. Ngô Bảo Châu, a dual citizen of Vietnam and France, was awarded a Fields Medal for his work in the mathematical theory of automorphic forms. ==Socio-economic context== Structure of the economy Viet Nam has become increasingly integrated into the world economy, particularly since its efforts to liberalize the economy enabled it to join the World Trade Organization in 2007. The manufacturing and service sectors each account for 40% of GDP. However, almost half the labour force (48%) is still employed in agriculture. One million workers a year, out of a total of 51.3 million in 2010, are projected to continue leaving agriculture for the other economic sectors in the foreseeable future. In manufacturing, Viet Nam is expected to lose some of its current comparative advantage in low wages in the near future. It will need to compensate for this loss with productivity gains, if it is to sustain high growth rates: GDP per capita has almost doubled since 2008. High-tech exports from Viet Nam grew dramatically during 2008–2013, particularly with respect to office computers and electronic communications equipment. A big challenge will be to implement strategies that increase the potential for enhancing technology and skills currently present in large multinational firms to smaller-scale domestic firms. This will require strategies to enhance technical capacity and skills among local firms that are, as yet, only weakly integrated with global production chains. Many foreign multinational firms have gravitated towards Vietnam in recent years but the number of patents nevertheless remains low: 47 were granted between 2002 and 2013. Even though 11% of Southeast Asia's high-tech exports came from Vietnam in 2013 (excluding the Republic of Korea and Japan), according to the Comtrade database, the majority of high-tech exports from Vietnam were designed elsewhere and assembled in Vietnam. Even if foreign firms change their behaviour and intensify their in-house R&D;, this will only boost R&D; in Vietnam if the multinationals can train a sufficient number of local personnel and work with skilled local suppliers and firms. Higher education Since 1995, enrolment in higher education has grown tenfold to well over 2 million in 2012. By 2014, there were 419 institutions of higher education. A number of foreign universities operate private campuses in Vietnam, including Harvard University (USA) and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (Australia). The government’s strong commitment to education (6.3% of GDP in 2012), in general, and higher education, in particular (1.05% of GDP in 2012), has fostered significant growth in higher education but this growth will need to be sustained to retain academics. The Law on Higher Education (2012) gives university administrators greater autonomy, although the Ministry of Education retains responsibility for quality assurance. ==Issues and difficulties in Science and Technology in Vietnam== According to a report on the role of science and technology in Vietnam (1999), “the issues and difficulties in S&T; in Vietnam are the following (i) policies are inconsistent and even contradictory, (ii) decision-making processes pertaining to the entire S&T; system are slow, burdensome, and bureaucratic, (iii) Vietnam does not have well-developed systems or capabilities for technical and economic forecasting or foresight, (iv) Vietnam has limited technology acquisition under existing arrangements, (v) Vietnam has a weakness in the assimilation of new technologies and underinvestment in assimilation following the purchase of new technologies, (vi) the national R&D; system in Vietnam is highly fragmented, (vii) Very serious underinvestment in technology management and systems engineering. ==Science, technology and innovation== Institutional context There are a large number of universities and an even larger pool of research institutions in Vietnam. This poses a challenge for ministries in terms of co-ordination. To some extent, market forces are likely to eliminate the smaller and financially weaker units. The autonomy which Vietnamese research centres have enjoyed since the mid-1990s has enabled many of them to operate as quasi-private organizations, providing services such as consulting and technology development. Some have ‘spun off’ from the larger institutions to form their own semi-private enterprises, fostering the transfer of public sector personnel employed in science and technology to these semi-private establishments. One comparatively new university, Ton Duc Thang (est. 1997), has already set up 13 centres for technology transfer and services that together produce 15% of university revenue. Many of these research centres serve as valuable intermediaries bridging public research institutions, universities and firms. 60% of the population in Vietnam is below 30 years old and more than 25000 eligible engineers graduate from college every year.  Policy developments  The Law on Higher Education (2012) offers university administrators greater autonomy and there are reports that growing numbers of academic staff are also serving as advisors to NGOs and private firms. The Strategy for Science and Technology Development for 2011–2020 drawn up by the Ministry of Science and Technology in 2012, builds upon this law by promoting public–private partnerships and seeking to transform ‘public S&T; organisations into self-managed and accountable mechanisms as stipulated by law’. The main emphasis is on overall planning and priority-setting, with a view to enhancing innovation capability, particularly in industrial sectors. Although the Strategy omits to fix any targets for funding, it nevertheless sets broad policy directions and priority areas for investment, including: * research in mathematics and physics; * investigation of climate change and natural disasters; * development of operating systems for computers, tablets and mobile devices; * biotechnology applied particularly to agriculture, forestry, fisheries and medicine; and * environmental protection. The Strategy foresees the development of a network of organizations to support consultancy services in the field of innovation and the development of intellectual property. The Strategy also seeks to promote greater international scientific co-operation, with a plan to establish a network of Vietnamese scientists overseas and to initiate a network of ‘outstanding research centres’ linking key national science institutions with partners abroad. Vietnam has also developed a set of national development strategies for selected sectors of the economy, many of which involve science and technology. Examples are the Sustainable Development Strategy (April 2012) and the Mechanical Engineering Industry Development Strategy (2006), together with Vision 2020 (2006). These dual strategies call for a highly skilled human resource base, a strong policy for investment in research and development, fiscal policies to encourage technological upgrading in the private sector and private-sector investment and regulations to steer investment towards sustainable development. Research trends In 2011, domestic research expenditure amounted to 0.19% of GDP, one of the lowest ratios in Southeast Asia. Women accounted for 41% of the country's researchers in 2012, one of the highest ratios in Southeast Asia. The number of Vietnamese publications in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science has increased at a rate well above the average for Southeast Asia but from a low starting point: Vietnamese scientists had 570 articles catalogued in international journals in 2005 and 2 298 in 2014. By 2014, Vietnam had a modest scientific publication density of 25 publications per million inhabitants. This places Vietnam behind Thailand (94), Vanuatu (74) and the Solomon Islands (30) but ahead of the Lao Peoples' Democratic Republic (19). Vietnamese publications catalogued in international journals focus mainly on life sciences (22%), physics (13%) and engineering (13%), which is consistent with recent advances in the production of diagnostic equipment and shipbuilding. Almost 77% of all papers published between 2008 and 2014 by Vietnamese scientists had at least one international co-author, which is common in developing countries. ==See also== *Ministry of Science and Technology (Vietnam) *Ministry of Health (Vietnam) *Vietnam Union of Science and Technology Associations *Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology *Hanoi University of Science and Technology *List of Vietnamese inventions and discoveries ==SourcesReferences== Category:Economy of Vietnam Category:Education in Vietnam ","title":"Science and technology in Vietnam"},{"id":"56111667","text":"The 1947 Tour de Suisse was the 11th edition of the Tour de Suisse cycle race and was held from 16 August to 23 August 1947.

The prominent features of the tax reform are lower personal income tax and higher consumption tax. Individual taxpayers with taxable income not exceeding ₱250,000 annually are exempted from income tax. The exemption for minimum wage earners is retained in the revised tax system. Tax rates for individual taxpayers still follow the progressive tax system with the maximum rate of 35%, and minimum rates of 20% (taxable years 2018 to 2022) and 15% (2023 onwards). On the other hand, consumption taxes, in the form of higher excise tax on tobacco products, petroleum products, automobiles, tobacco, and additional excise tax on sweetened beverages and non-essential, invasive cosmetic procedures were introduced. It also expanded the VAT base by repealing exemption provisions in numerous special laws. The TRAIN Act is aimed to generate revenue to achieve the 2022 and 2040 vision of the Duterte administration, namely, to eradicate extreme poverty, to create inclusive institutions that will offer equal opportunities to all, and to achieve higher income country status. It is also aimed at making the tax system simpler, fairer and more efficient. Regardless, contentions about the passing of this law has been present since the beginning and the subsequent reception by the people since its ratification has been controversial. In the first quarter of 2018, both positive and negative outcomes have been observed. The economy saw an increase in tax revenues, government expenditure and an incremental growth in GDP. On the other hand, unprecedented inflation rates that exceeded projected calculations, has been the cause for much uproar and objections. There have been petitions to suspend and amend the law, so as to safeguard particular sectors from soaring prices. ==Vision and goals of TRAIN== The TRAIN Act aims to address the reputed weaknesses of the Tax Code, specifically through the following objectives: * First, it intends to simplify the previous system to make it more straightforward and intuitive. * Second, it intends to create a more \\"just\\" taxation scheme, wherein taxation is staggered and distributed on the basis of financial capability and the underprivileged are able to reap more advantages. * Third, it intends to improve the efficiency by which tax is collected, particularly tackling issues of compliance. * Fourth, it increases the tax burden felt by the general population thus increasing the overall inflation rate. The changes instituted by the tax reform is expected to be able to increase revenue to finance the infrastructure, healthcare and education programs of the Duterte administration. The notion that the poor will be taxed less than the wealthy population is actually a propaganda widely spread by the government, the additional taxes imposed by the government will just be passed down through the lower and middle income class thus increasing the inflation. In the long term, TRAIN Act is just the first from a series of tax reforms, as part of the CTSP, which will be one of the principal means by which the 2020 and 2040 vision of the incumbent administration is to be achieved. The vision in 2020 is that poverty will be reduced from 21.6% to 14%, while 2040 sees the Philippines as having \\"eradicated extreme poverty\\", established \\"inclusive economic and political institutions where everyone has equal opportunities\\" and achieved \\"high-income country status\\". This can be achieved if economic growth can be sustained by at least 7% each year and if the source of growth can be shifted to investment from consumption. This means prioritizing investments on people through \\"health, education, life-long training, social protection, infrastructure, and research and development\\" and investments on infrastructure to boost productivity ==Legislative history== House of Representatives House Bill No. 4774 is credited as the original measure that led to the TRAIN Act. It was endorsed by the Department of Finance (DOF) to the Philippine House of Representatives on September 26, 2016 as the first package of a wider CTRP. It was filed before the legislature on January 17, 2017 by Congressman Dakila Cua of Quirino. Cua is also the chairperson of the Ways and Means Committee of the Congress which deals on taxation. After thirteen hearings which was done within the span of four months, the House Bill No. 7890 was consolidated with 54 other tax-related bills to come up with a House Bill 5636, a substitute bill which had \\"moderate\\" changes from House Bill 4774. The substitute measure was approved on May 8. The DOF requested President Rodrigo Duterte to declare the bill as \\"urgent\\" on May 29, 2017. Bills passed on the second reading by the Congress but are not certified \\"urgent\\" by the president could only be voted upon after copies of the given measure is provided to House of Representatives members three days before the day of the third and final reading. On May 31, 2017 just before the 17th Congress adjourn its first regular session, the bill passed the final reading with 246 voting for and 9 against the bill. Only one made an abstention. Most of those who opposed were from the Makabayan bloc. Senate A version of the bill was filed in the Senate in March 2017 by Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III. By May 2017 six public hearings were conducted by the senate. The Senate had to wait for the House of Representatives version to get pass before it could start plenary discussions like other bills on budget or tax and appropriations. The Senate voted 17–1 to approve the Tax Reform Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) bill, with Sen. Risa Hontiveros being the lone dissenter on November 28, 2017. On the succeeding voting for the TRAIN, the positive votes were cast by Senators Sonny Angara, Nancy Binay, Frank Drilon, JV Ejercito, Chiz Escudero, Win Gatchalian, Dick Gordon, Gringo Honasan, Loren Legarda, Joel Villanueva, Koko Pimentel, Grace Poe, Ralph Recto, Tito Sotto, Cynthia Villar and Migs Zubiri. The negative votes were cast by Senators Ping Lacson, Risa Hontiveros, Bam Aquino and Antonio Trillanes IV Duterte's certification of the TRAIN as \\"urgent\\" allowed the bill to get passed the second reading on November 28, 2017. Within the same day, the Senate bill passed the third and final reading with 17 senators voting for the bill. Only Risa Hontiveros voted against the bill. Bicameral Conference Committee The Bicameral Conference Committee consolidated the bills passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate. The committee then approved a bill which favored the Senate version on December 11, 2017 and prepared a report after for ratification of both chambers of the Congress and signing of the President. the House of Representatives and the Senate ratified the version of the bill prepared by the Bicameral Conference Committee on December 13, 2017.  Signing into law and partial veto  President Duterte exercised his veto power to void 5 provisions of the law. The provisions vetoed were the following: # Reduced income tax rate of employees of Regional Headquarters (RHQs), Regional Operating Headquarters (ROHQs), Offshore Banking Units (OBUs), and Petroleum Service Contractors and Subcontractors; # Zero- rating of sales of goods and services to separate customs territory and tourism enterprise zones; # Exemption from percentage tax of gross sales/receipts not exceeding five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00); # Exemption of various petroleum products from excise tax when used as input, feedstock, or as raw material in the manufacturing of petrochemical products, or in the refining of petroleum products, or as replacement fuel for natural gas fired combined cycle power plants; and # Earmarking of incremental tobacco taxes.  Summary of amendments  These were the revisions made to the Tax Code: {  - Amended Sections 5, 6, 24, 25, 27, 31, 32, 33, 34, 51, 52, 56, 57, 58, 74, 79, 84, 86, 90, 91, 97, 99, 100, 101, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 112, 114, 116, 127, 128, 129, 145, 148, 149, 151, 155, 171, 174, 175, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 186, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 232, 236, 237, 249, 254, 264, 269, and 288 - Created Sections 51-A, 148-A, 150-A, 150-B, 237-A, 264-A, 264-B, and 265-A -  Repealed Sections  35, 62, and 89 } == Complementary measures == There are four (4) complementary measures undertaken to ensure the income from the TRAIN Law will be properly allocated for the development of the Philippines as a nation. These are the Tax Administration, Ear Making, Infrastructure Projects, and Social Programs.  Tax Administration  Steps to modernize and refine the tax administration processes are undertaken to support the changes in tax policy so as to improve security against tax crimes and to ensure taxpayer compliance. On top of improving electronic systems (e.g. eBIR forms, Electronic Filing and Payment System, mobile payments) the following reforms are implemented: * Mandatory fuel marking * Provision for use of electronic receipts * Connection of cash registers and point of sale machines to BIR servers for real time reporting of sales and purchase data * Relaxation of bank secrecy laws and automatic exchange of information to allow for more effective prosecution of criminal cases  Ear Marking  For 5 years from the law's enactment, all revenues will be set aside for infrastructure and social programs only, with a 70% and 30% portion respectively.  Infrastructure Projects  Infrastructure projects that will receive priority funding include the Build, Build, Build Program that tackles the problem of congestion through the construction of public transport systems and road networks and the refurbishing and enhancing of military facilities. Additionally, part of the 70% will be allocated to the building of sports facilities in public schools as well as amenities that will allow access to potable water in public spaces.  Social Programs  The social programs that will receive priority funding from 30% of revenues include: *Programs for sugar farmers to increase productivity, provide livelihood opportunities, develop alternative farming systems, and enhance farmer's income *Social mitigating measures and investments in education, health, social protection, employment, and housing for poor and near-poor households *Unconditional cash transfer to the poorest 10 million households *Social benefits card to determine qualified beneficiaries (fuel vouchers for PUJs, fare discount for all public utility vehicles, discounted purchase of NFA rice, free skills training under TESDA)  Unconditional cash transfers (UCT)  In order to provide provisional protection for vulnerable households from the initial shock of the TRAIN Law, unconditional cash transfers are dispensed. On the first year, beneficiaries receive Php200 per month. In the succeeding 2 years, they receive P300 per month. The UCT is obtained from oil excise tax revenues. In addition to the UCT, social welfare cards are provided to aid in continuous conferring of benefits and subsidies to the poorest households. This includes subsidies for \\"medicine, transportation, rice, and vocational trainings\\". ==Key provisions==  Package One  The overarching goal of the first package of the TRAIN is to \\"create a simpler, fair, and more efficient system\\". Through this program, the richer tax payers of the Philippines will pay a greater contribution to enable the government to execute its programs and services targeted to the general improvement of the country, especially the less fortunate. There are six (6) main key provisions, three (3) additional excise taxes, and four (4) financial taxes. Income Tax  \\"The TRAIN lowers the Personal Income Tax (PIT)for all taxpayers except the rich\\". Effectively, personal taxes will be reduced for 99% of the Philippine tax payers. The new PIT is summarized in the table below {  - ! Annuable Income Tax !! Tax Rate !! Percent of Taxpayers -  ₱0–250,000  0%  83% -  Over ₱250,000–400,000  20% of the excess over ₱250,000  8% -  Over ₱400,000–800,000  ₱30,000 + 25% of the excess over ₱400,000  6% -  Over ₱800,000–2,000,000  ₱130,000 + 30% of the excess over ₱800,000  2% -  Over ₱2,000,000–8,000,000  ₱490,000 + 32% of the excess over ₱2,000,000  1% -  Over ₱8,000,000  ₱2,410,000 + 35% of the excess over ₱8,000,000  0.1% } Additionally, minimum-wage earners are still exempted from PIT. The Law also ensures a minimum wage earner who incurs a small raise will not have his overall salary (with the PIT deducted) less than minimum wage. Also, married couples where both parties are working may be exempted up to a total of ₱500,000. This does not include the exemption from the first ₱90,000 of their thirteenth month pay and additional bonuses. Finally, Self- employed and professionals with gross sales below VAT can only pay 8% flat tax instead of their income and personal tax.  Simplified Estate and Donor's Tax  The TRAIN aims to simplify property purchases, transfers and donations in order to make the land market more efficient thus ensuring the usage of properties is maximized. The estate tax is now reduced to 6% based on the net value of the property. It also has a standard deduction of ₱5 million as well as a ₱10 million exemption on the family home. The donor tax is also reduced to 6% of the net donations for gifts above ₱250,000 yearly.  Simplified Value Added Tax  The government's aim to elevate the less fortunate in the Philippines and drive development is exemplified as the TRAIN repeals 54 out of 61 of the non-essential VAT exemption. In order to protect these less fortunate persons, as well as small and micro businesses, they are exempted from VAT on goods and services of marginal establishments. VAT exempt tax payers now have the option to: * PIT schedule with 40% OSD on gross receipts or gross sales plus 3% percentage tax * PIT schedule with itemized deductions plus 3% percentage tax, or * Flat tax of 8% on gross sales or gross revenues in lieu of percentage tax and personal income tax. \\"TRAIN aims to clean up the VAT system to make it fairer and simpler and lower the cost of compliance for both the taxpayers and tax administrators\\". As such, VAT exemptions are now only limited to health, education and raw agriculture food. In 2019, medicines for hypertension, high cholesterol and diabetes will be exempted from VAT. Similarly, purchases from senior citizens and persons with disabilities. Housing that costs less than ₱2 million shall also be exempted starting in 2021.  Excise Tax of petroleum products  This tax aims to increase efforts towards decreasing the consumption of harmful fuel, and veering towards a healthier, more sustainable future. The price of fuel also varies due to the global inflation of oil. Listed below is the effect of the Petroleum Excise Tax (note: the additional excise tax is per liter)https://www.bir.gov.ph/images/bir_files/internal_communications_1/Full%20Text%20RR%202018/RR%20No.%202-2018/RR%20No.%202-2018.pdf {  - ! Excise Tax per Liter !! Current !! 2018 !! 2019 !! 2020 -  LPG  ₱0  ₱1.00  ₱2.00  ₱3.00 -  Diesel  ₱0  ₱2.50  ₱4.50  ₱6.00 -  Regular and unleaded premium gasoline  ₱4.35  ₱7.00  ₱9.00  ₱10.00 } Listed below are the new excise taxes for specific fuel products for the year 2018 {  - ! Petroleum Product !! Excise Tax per Liter -  LPG  ₱1.00 -  Bunker Fuels  ₱2.50 -  Diesel  ₱2.50 -  Petcoke  ₱2.50 -  Kerosene  ₱3.00 -  Aviation gas  ₱4.00 -  Gasoline  ₱7.00 -  Naphtha  ₱7.00 -  Asphalt  ₱8.00 -  Asphalt  ₱8.00 -  Lubricating oil  ₱8.00 -  Paraffin wax  ₱8.00 -  Refined fuels  ₱8.00 }  Excise Tax of Automobiles increase  The table below summarizes the excise taxes on automobiles. The second column illustrates the tax rate on vehicles based on their specific price range. The third column portrays the actual average effective tax rate. Because the TRAIN law increases the PIT of 99% of the population, their increase in net income will still be more than enough to compensate for the effects of the excise tax on automobiles. This means they still benefit from the TRAIN as they incur additional disposable income in the end. In addition, because richer tax payers tend to purchase more cars, the additional revenue from this tax will mostly come from them. {  - ! Automobile prices !! Tax Rate !!Average effective tax rate -  ₱600,000 and below  4%  3% -  ₱600,000 to ₱1,000,000  10%  8% -  ₱1,000,000 to ₱4,000,000  20%  15% -  ₱4,000,000 and above  50%  30% }  Excise Tax on Sweetened Beverages  \\"The SSB (Sugar-Sweetened Beverages) tax will promote a healthier Philippines\\". It achieves this by reducing the increasing number of diabetes and obesity cases, through raising awareness, promoting the consumption of healthier products and encourage companies to innovate healthier alternatives. TRAIN imposes new taxes of ₱6 per liter on drinks containing sweeteners and ₱12 per liter on drinks containing high-fructose corn syrup. Milk, 100% natural juice and 3-in-1 instant coffee drinks are exempt from the excise tax.  Additional Excise Taxes  There are three additional excise taxes, namely coal, cosmetics and tobacco.  Coal Excise Tax  Coal is a cheap source for power generation and has its uses in multiple industries such as the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. It is also a prime ingredient for activated carbon, carbon fibre and silicon metal. However, it remains a major source for air pollution in the Philippines. The aim of the excise tax is to shift towards renewable energies and generate additional income for building infrastructures and social services. The excise tax on coal will increase from its original ₱10/Metric Ton(MT) to ₱50/MT on both domestic and imported coal. ₱50/MT will be added each succeeding year until January when the rate would have reached ₱150/MT.  Cosmetics Tax  Starting 2018, all cosmetic surgeries, aesthetic procedures, and body enhancements intended to improve, alter, or enhance a person's appearance are now subject to a tax of 5%. However, procedures necessary to ameliorate a deformity arising from, or directly related to a congenital or developmental defect or abnormality, a personal injury resulting to an accident or trauma, or disfiguring disease, tumor, virus or infection are tax -exempted.  Tobacco Tax  The excise tax on cigarettes aims to reduce the amount of smokers and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases one can catch from the act, as well as generate additional revenue for health oriented programs and services. From its original excise tax of ₱30 in 2017, the tax on tobacco increased to ₱32.50 on January 1, 2018, ₱35 on July 1, 2018, will increase to ₱37.50 on January 1, 2019, and ₱40 on January 1, 2020. Afterwards, it will increase annually by 4% from January 1, 2024.  Financial Taxes  There are four taxes that were adjusted along with the TRAIN Law. Firstly, the documentary stamp tax was increased by 100% except on loans with only 50% increase, but not for savings, property, and non-life insurance. Secondly, the final tax on foreign currency deposit unit (FCDU) was increased from 7.5% to 15% of interest income. Thirdly, capital gains tax of non-traded stock was increased from 5% to 10% of final net gains. Finally, the stock transaction tax was increased from 0.5% to 0.6% of total transaction value.  Others  Finally, there are three additional taxes that do not fall under the aforementioned categories. These are the tax on lottery winnings and PCSO prizes, documentary stamp tax, and mining tax. With the implementation of the TRAIN Law, all PCSO lotto prizes are taxed at 20% if the prize exceeds ₱10,000. The documentary stamp tax has been doubled, resulting in stamp taxes ranging from ₱1.50 to ₱3.00. Finally, excise tax rates on all non-metallic minerals and quarry resources, and all metallic minerals including copper, gold and chromite, will be doubled, from 2% to 4%, as well as excise tax on indigenous petroleum, which will be doubled from 3% to 6%. == Projected effects == The three main categories the TRAIN Law affects with its first package are \\"Growth in the Economy\\", \\"Employment Generation\\", and \\"Effect on Inflation\\". The DOF projects the economy to grow by 1.3% by 2022 with a 0.42% inflation due to the excise tax increase (this is still within the 2–4% target inflation by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP); it also predicts to create half a million jobs over the next ten years, and eight million over the entirety of its life, as well as lift 250,000 Filipinos out of poverty. Through the increase in excise tax, Package 1 will be able to generate Php134 Billion. The actual effects in 2018 are elaborated below.  Economic growth  For the first quarter of 2018, the government was able to raise ₱619.84 billion. This represents a 16.4% growth in revenue compared to the first quarter of 2017. In monetary terms, the government was able to raise ₱87.44 billion more in this quarter of 2018 compared to the previous year. \\"The Philippine economy expanded by 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018, making it still one of the fastest-growing economies in the region even as rising inflation reduced consumption and productivity in some sectors.\\" DOF Secretary Carlos Dominguez III claimed tax revenues grew by 18.2%, \\"exceeding the 9.7 percent nominal gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\\" Departments that saw immediate benefits from Package 1 include the Bureau of Internal Revenue and Bureau of Customs, both with a 14.2% and 24.7% increase in revenue. This translates to a total of ₱423.1 billion and Php129.8 for both departments respectively. Other government departments were able to expand their investment and growths during the first quarter as well due to the increase in income. Insofar as expenditures go for the first quarter of 2018, the total amounted to ₱782.0 billion, growing by 27.1%, which also outstripped the 9.7% nominal GDP growth due to the estimated 40.0% increase in capital outlays. Dominquez also said that the expenditure effort also rose by 2.73%, which is the highest increase since 2003. This results in a larger contribution towards GDP growth. As such, revenue effort grew by 0.91%. In addition, public construction expanded by 25.1%, thus boosting GDP growth by 0.4%. On the other hand, government consumption increased by 13.6%, contributing an incremental 1.4% to the growth of the GDP.\\"'Strong macroeconomic fundamentals backed by tax reforms and the Build, build, build program will continue to boost economic growth to the optimum 7–8 percent level as the competitiveness of the economy rises and more jobs are created,' he said.\\"  Inflation  \\"The inflation rate in June—which exceeded both government and market expectations—was the fastest pace in at least five years. Year-to-date, inflation averaged 4.3 percent, above the BSP's 2–4 percent target range.\\"\\"It peaked at 5.2 percent for the same month. For the previous months, inflation was pegged at 4.6 percent and in the same period in 2017, 2.5 percent.\\"http://psa.gov.ph/statistics/survey/price/summary- inflation-report-consumer-price-index-2012100-june-2018 This was primarily due to the higher annual rate posted in the heavily weighted food and non- alcoholic beverages index at 6.1%. The country's food index went up by 5.8% in June 2018. It was 5.5% in the previous month and 3.1% in June 2017. The following annual mark-ups were also observed for the following food groups: * Rice (4.7%) * Corn (14.1%) * Other Cereals, Flour, Cereal Preparation, Bread, Pasta and Other Bakery Products (2.4%); * Meat (5.0%); * Vegetables (8.6%); * Sugar, Jam, Honey, Chocolate and Confectionery (3.9%); and * Food Products not Elsewhere Classified (3.1%). As for the rest of the food groups, they either slowed down or remained at their previous month's rate. Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia claims that the inflation will most likely peak on the third quarter of the year and start tapering off by October. == Reception == The TRAIN Law finally took effect in January 2018. Since its implementation, there have been numerous individuals for and against the new tax reform, such as Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno who has expressed support for the law as the additional revenues provide funds for government initiatives. Notable government figures in opposition of the current law, that is they are calling for amendments or suspensions to specific excise tax increases or to the law as a whole, include Sen. Risa Hontiveros, Sen. Bam Aquino and Sen. Grace Poe. Ultimately, President Duterte stated on June 2, 2018 \\"Well the law was enacted by Congress. I leave it to Congress to decide whether or not to amend, suspend or modify the law. Leave it to Congress\\", in a press briefing.  Support  The senators who voted for the bill were Senators Sonny Angara, Nancy Binay, Frank Drilon, JV Ejercito, Chiz Escudero, Win Gatchalian, Dick Gordon, Gringo Honasan, Loren Legarda, Joel Villanueva, Koko Pimentel, Grace Poe, Ralph Recto, Tito Sotto, Cynthia Villar and Migz Zubiri.  Appeal to foreign investors  One of the goals of the TRAIN law is to make the economic environment of the Philippines more appealing to foreign investors. The reforms being implemented by the Duterte administration have been recognized and lauded by international institutions, leading to strong investor confidence and better growth prospects for the economy. This is also being pushed forward by the Department of Finance by submitting its proposal for Package 2 of its tax reform program to congress which aims to reduce corporate income tax rates and rationalize fiscal incentives.  View from an economic stand point  According to the DOF's chief economist, Gil Beltran, the moderate rise in inflation is only temporary and remains manageable under a robust economy even with the implementation of the TRAIN law. It will be remedied by the increased spending on infrastructure and social services to keep inflation in check in the future which was what the president was hoping to achieve with the implementation of this law. TRAIN is seen as a long-term measure that would hope to push the economy to a much higher development path, create more jobs and improve the living conditions for our people. However this comes with the rising of inflation which would be mitigated by lower income tax rates and implementing cash transfers for the short-term, and; the health, education, social protection, and infrastructure programs in the medium- and long-term.  Opposition   Burden to the poor  One of the recurring problems that is being discussed when it comes to the TRAIN law is the burden that it will impose to the poor. As crafted, the TRAIN promises to let marginal earners and minimum salaried workers of smaller tax or even tax exemption. But critics are quick to point out that the alleged windfall of tax-free income will be blown away when basic commodities that the marginalized sector of society traditionally buy and consume every day will now be sporting increased price tags that are out of reach and beyond the imagination of poor families.  Makabayan bloc  There were objections made by the Makabayan bloc, a left-wing group whom filed a petition for a temporary restraining order (TRO) against the law. The petition is anchored on the argument that the tax law bill was invalid because there was no quorum when the House of Representatives ratified the joint bicameral conference report on the measure, and there was no voting involved. The petitioners provided links to official videos and photos that would show there was no quorum \\"with barely 10 people on the floor.\\" The petitioners also provided that another requirement was not met which was the majority vote. According to the petitioners, a vote whether viva voce or nominal, was not taken. The official video of the process shows Tinio and Zarate repeatedly objecting to the ratification, but Abu and Defensor continued with the process until the voices of the petitioners were no longer heard because the microphone had been turned off. Aside from the House rules, the petitioners said Section 16(2), Article VI of the Constitution that requires a quorum was also violated.  Call for suspension  Three senators called for the suspension of the implementation of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law as consumers and transport groups complained of soaring prices of commodities. These were on the grounds that the law was not beneficial to the majority of Filipinos, due to the increase in prices of oil products and commodities, a family has incurred an additional expense of ₱2,644 monthly for farmers and ₱3,640 for workers.  Amendments  Senator Bam Aquino wanted to pass a measure that seeks to amend TRAIN to protect Filipinos from soaring prices. Aquino explained that the Senate's version of the TRAIN law had a safeguard that would automatically suspend fuel excise tax if the forecast rate was exceeded and this amendment was to bring that sole safeguard back. According to the senator, this was a necessary step in order to protect the future well beings of the Filipino people.  Protests  Since Duterte signed the TRAIN Law, protests were sparked since January 2018. For the employees who worked under the minimum wage of , only will be spent just for the food in a day because of increasing goods. Other budget issues such as house rent, education, LPG, personal hygiene, etc. The militant groups feared that most of the Filipinos will face hunger since the increase of excise tax in the market. ==See also== *Taxation in the Philippines ==References== Category:Taxation in the Philippines Category:Philippine law Category:2017 in the Philippines Category:Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte Category:Protests in the Philippines ","title":"Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Act"},{"id":"56111716","text":"Higinio García Fernández (11 January 1956 – 17 December 2017) was a Spanish professional footballer who played for Valencia, Murcia, Recreativo de Huelva, Villarreal and Orihuela Deportiva, as a defender. ==References== Category:1956 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Spanish footballers Category:Valencia CF players Category:Real Murcia players Category:Recreativo de Huelva players Category:Orihuela Deportiva CF footballers Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda División players Category:Segunda División B players Category:Association football defenders ","title":"Higinio García Fernández"},{"id":"56111726","text":"The 1950 Tour de Suisse was the 14th edition of the Tour de Suisse cycle race and was held from 24 June to 1 July 1950.

However, after foreign brands were introduced and started to dominate the market, the brand gradually lost appeal to the Portuguese smoker. The original name of the brand was called \\"Português Suave\\" (literaly \\"Smooth Portuguese\\"), but the name was changed in 2001 to respect the anti-tobacco laws that prohibit the sale of cigarettes with names like \\"smooth\\", \\"light\\" or \\"mild\\". Português was one of the first unfiltered cigarettes in Portugal, and was one of the last to be discontinued in 2003, when the brand was sold with a filter only. As of 2011, the variants \\"Português Vermelho (Red)\\" and \\"Português Azul (Blue)\\" have been discontinued. ==Packaging== The packs feature various colour patterns (red, blue, yellow, etc.) but it is mainly distinguished by the Belém Tower on the top of the pack. The reason for this, is that in its origin, Português Suave was based on the architectural style with the same name, which marked the 1930s. The suave Portuguese style emerged from a chain of architects, at the beginning of the 20th century. Also known as the Estado Novo style, it sought to create a \\"genuinely Portuguese\\" architecture. The result was the creation of a style of architecture that introduced new engineering techniques, such as the use of concrete structures, which came to revolutionize not only the way of building but also the way of thinking about buildings. The style was a mixture of exterior aesthetic elements taken from the Portuguese architecture of the 17th and 18th centuries and the traditional houses of the various regions of Portugal. Various special edition versions have also been released over the years, containing other known Portuguese monuments on the packs. ==Controversy== Português cigarettes contain pesticides In November 2004, the newspaper Portugal Resident revealed that various Portuguese cigarette variants contained the toxin Dieldrin, which is a banned carcinogenic pesticide in Europe and the United States. A few variants of the SG brand were found to contain this pesticide, but this pesticide was not found in the Português cigarettes. ==See also== * Cigarette * Tobacco smoking ==References== Category:Philip Morris brands ","title":"Português (cigarette)"},{"id":"56111785","text":"20px Lead Nation Military Mobility is one of the initial projects launched under the European Union's (EU) Permanent Structured Cooperation in Defence (PESCO) facility. It is commonly termed a \\"Military Schengen\\" as it is inspired by the EU's Schengen Area, but designated to aid the free movement of military units and assets throughout Europe via removal of bureaucratic barriers and improvement of infrastructure.Call for ‘military Schengen’ to get troops moving, Politico.eu 4 August 2017 ==Background== The zone was proposed by Commander of United States Army Europe, Lieutenant General Ben Hodges who made some initial headway via NATO, but issues like passport checks and weaknesses in transport links that can't take large military vehicles persisted. In 2017 Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, Dutch defence minister, proposed a Schengen-inspired agreement for movement as part of the PESCO facility gaining ground as a result of Brexit and geopolitical pressures. Military mobility was selected as a PESCO project due to its low cost and relatively little political disagreement on the subject. Out of all PESCO projects at launch, nearly all PESCO states will participate in it. The agreement is one which is designed to work with both NATO and EU operations, to ensure \\"units and equipment are in the right place at the right time, regardless of whether they are deployed in an EU or NATO context.\\" The European Commission is to bring forward an action plan in 2018.EU launches work on 'military Schengen', EUObserver 10 November 2017 ==Aim== The project is inspired by Schengen, but faces very different challenges. It revolves around two main areas. The first is the removal of bureaucratic barriers such as passport checks and requirement of advance notice. While in the event of an emergency NATO can move troops faster, during peacetime advance notice is required for many movements; for example the movement of US troops from Poland to Germany requires 5 days' advance notice. The second area is infrastructure, there are roads and bridges that cannot take the weight of heavy equipment, tunnels which are too small and airstrips which cannot accommodate larger aircraft. On the official PESCO website, the aim of the project is described as follows: > \\"This project supports Member States’ commitment to simplify and standardize > cross-border military transport procedures in line with the Council > conclusions of 25th June 2018. It aims to enable the unhindered movement of > military personnel and assets within the borders of the EU. This entails > avoiding long bureaucratic procedures to move through or over EU Member > States, be it via rail, road, air or sea. Issues on which the project is > currently focussed are the sharing of best practises, implementing the > deliverables of the FAC-Defence Council conclusions of 25th June 2018 and > strategic communication.\\" ==Participants== As of PESCO's launch in December 2017, the Military Mobility project is the only project to count nearly every PESCO state as a participant (only France is absent, initially just observing). The project is led by Germany and the Netherlands. PESCO counts all EU states minus Denmark and Malta.http://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/32020/draft-pesco-declaration- clean-10122017.pdf ==See also== * Permanent Structured Cooperation *Common Security and Defence Policy * Enhanced cooperation * Schengen Agreement ==ReferencesExternal links== * Europe Needs a Military Schengen, European Defence Agency * Towards a ‘military Schengen’?, Institute for Security Studies * EC Proposes EU Military Schengen Plan, European Security Journal * A proposed CDSP evolution in the Eurocorps and ESDI in NATO *PESCO Europe, PESCO secretariat Category:Permanent Structured Cooperation projects ","title":"Military Mobility"},{"id":"56111786","text":"Egibacter rhizosphaeraea is a Gram-positive, obligately halophilic, facultatively alkaliphilic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium from the genus of Egibacter which has been isolated from the rhizosphere of the plant Tamarix hispida in Xinjiang in China. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Type strain of Egibacter rhizosphaerae at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Actinobacteria Category:Bacteria described in 2016 ","title":"Egibacter rhizosphaerae"},{"id":"56111814","text":"The 1955 Tour de Suisse was the 19th edition of the Tour de Suisse cycle race and was held from 11 June to 18 June 1955.

He is known for his collection of semi-autobiographical stories, which is entitled An Elegant Young Man. The stories are set in Liverpool, Australia, a suburb outside Sydney. He has been called a post-grunge lit writer, a reference to an Australian literary genre from the 2000s which emerged following the 1990s grunge lit genre. ==Career== An Elegant Young Man His first book, An Elegant Young Man, won the NSW Premier’s Literary Award for New Writing. An Elegant Young Man is a collection of short stories that are linked together, and which are semi-autobiographical. The stories have a protagonist whose name is also Luke and who lives in the author's hometown. Carman stated that he used Liverpool, Australia, as a setting because Australia's \\"western suburbs have been largely absent from the face of Australian fiction\\", with an effort to show the \\"...ugliness of working class suburbia and the pain of being an outsider\\" with \\"...authenticity, warts and all.\\" In one of the stories, a teen who \\"...dreams of fame fade[s] into an adulthood of blue collar work\\"; the narrator/author is described as a \\"...passive force, constantly in the midst of the action but solely as an observer who cannot save anybody\\", as if in \\"paralysis\\", until characters' lives are \\"quietly lost to monotony.\\" In another story, a female character who faces an abusive relationship becomes addicted to drugs. Carman used a \\"writers’ network\\" to hold discussions about draft versions of the book and perform the drafts, which helped him to develop his writing Neave, Lucy. \\"Revision, community and performance: the role of a literary network in the development of Michael Mohammed Ahmad’s The Tribe and Luke Carman’s An Elegant Young Man\\". New Writing: The International Journal for the Practice and Theory of Creative Writing. Volume 13, 2016 - Issue 2. Other activities and awards He is a Casual Academic at Western Sydney University's Writing And Society Research Centre. In 2014, the Sydney Morning Herald named him the Best Young Novelist. One of his stories, \\"Liverpool Boys\\", is used in the SBS podcast series entitled True Stories, which showcases what SBS calls \\"Australia’s best emerging and early-career writers.\\" He has published in HEAT, Westside and the Cultural Studies Review. Intimate Antipathies, a collection of his essays was published in July 2019 by Giramondo. Essay on Melbourne's literary scene In 2016, Carman's essay on the Melbourne literary scene attracted international attention. An article in The Guardian stated what while \\"Australian creative industries are in crisis...[,] Luke Carman’s galvanising and venomous essay has started the wrong conversation\\" with his essay, a \\"jeremiad against the Melbourne literary scene that was published in the journal Meanjin. Carman's essay criticizes \\"arts administrators at creative institutions – journals, festivals, funding bodies and hubs\\", who he states are \\"anti-artists\\". Ben Eltham states that top arts administrators may earn higher salaries than the poorly-paid writers. At the journal Overland, Emmett Stinson stated that the \\"response [to the essay] has been overwhelmingly negative\\"; however, he stated that for \\"...all of its hyperbolic rhetoric, the essay is a call for a limited form of underclass literary revolt – and the studied refusal of a creeping professionalisation\\" in the writing world. ==See also== *Grunge lit ==References== Category:Australian male short story writers Category:Living people Category:21st-century Australian short story writers Category:21st-century Australian male writers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Luke Carman"},{"id":"56111881","text":"Ti Shqipëri, më jep nder, më jep emrin Shqipëtar (English: You Albania, you give me honour, you give me the name Albanian) is the national motto of Albania. == See also == * National symbols of Albania * Culture of Albania Category:National symbols of Albania Category:National mottos Category:Albanian culture ","title":"Ti Shqipëri, më jep nder, më jep emrin Shqipëtar"},{"id":"56111908","text":"Day Kimball Hospital is an acute care teaching hospital located in the West End of Putnam, Connecticut.

It is Ings' second non-fiction book, the first being The Eye: A Natural History (2007). He had previously published eight novels. Stalin and the Scientists was longlisted for the 2016 Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction. ==Background== Ings' inspiration for Stalin and the Scientists came from Soviet psychologist, Alexander Luria's book Mind of a Mnemonist, about the life of Russian journalist and mnemonist, Solomon Shereshevsky. Ings said in 2016 interviews that Luria is often referred to as the founder of modern neuroanatomy and \\"the godfather of the literary genre we call popular science\\". \\"Luria's account more or less set the template for modern popular science and ... pretty much set me on the path I'm on now.\\" Ings had considered writing a biography about Luria, but felt that while Luria's achievements were \\"extraordinary\\", considering the climate of political repression he worked in, Ings was concerned that Western readers would consider his career too ordinary, and would miss the context in which it unfolded. Ings' passion for popular science and the need to explain the context within which Luria and other Soviet scientists worked, changed what would have been a one-year \\"modest biography\\" into a \\"five-year behemoth\\" that \\"burned through three editors\\" and, Ings added, \\"nearly killed me\\". Ings said, as a novelist, he was \\"absurdly under-qualified\\" to tackle a book like Stalin and the Scientists, but added that only a novelist could be so \\"ridiculously ambitious\\" and \\"naive enough to stick his or her neck out so far\\". Ings felt that given the kind of science prevalent in Russia at the time, perhaps this \\"really has to be the job of a novelist rather than a historian\\". Responding to statements that this is \\"the first history\\" of Soviet science, Ings said, \\"Certainly no-one's been foolish enough to attempt to tell the whole story of science under Stalin in a single volume, but be assured I didn't dig this entire thing single-handed from virgin ground.\\" ==Reception== In a review in The Guardian, David Holloway described Stalin and the Scientists as a \\"fascinating story\\" that reveals \\"the tragedy and the triumph\\" of Soviet science. He called it a \\"lively book\\" and complimented Ings on his \\"clear and simple\\" scientific explanations, and the way he highlighted the personalities of those involved: the \\"brilliant scientists\\", the \\"charlatans\\", the \\"visionaries\\" and the \\"careerists\\". A reviewer of the book in Publishers Weekly complimented Ings on the sensitive way in which he exposed the lives of the scientists and their experiences, and how he \\"ably documents the challenges, failures, and achievements of Soviet science\\". The reviewer commented that while Ings \\"can be long-winded\\", he \\"engagingly fuses history, science, and storytelling\\". British historian and author Simon Sebag Montefiore wrote in The New York Times that Ings \\"skillfully\\" portrays the lives of the scientists of this period. He called Ings \\"an entertaining storyteller who often captures the essence of things\\", and described the book as \\"lively and interesting\\" and full of \\"priceless nuggets and a cast of frauds, crackpots and tyrants\\". Montefiore added, however, that while Ings highlights the failures of Soviet science, he omits its successes, for example the Tupolev and MiG airplanes, and the T-34 tank. Montefiore was also critical of errors in the book, for example Stalin's birthday and Felix Dzerzhinsky's tenure as head of Cheka, the Soviet secret police. Writing in Socialist Review, John Parrington was also critical of flaws and omissions. While he described the book as \\"ambitious in scope\\", and called it \\"fascinating\\" and \\"important\\", Parrington said it is not without \\"elementary errors\\", like Ings' statement that \\"the Bolsheviks ... and the Mensheviks ... missed the 1905 revolution\\". Parrington also complained that Ings does not explain what it was that \\"destroyed the hopes and dreams\\" of Russian scientists in the 1920s when Stalin came to power. American science historian Loren Graham also criticised errors and omissions in the book. In a review in The Wall Street Journal, he said Ings is \\"a gifted writer\\", and called Stalin and the Scientists \\"a good single source\\" for readers new to Soviet science. But Graham felt that one of the book's shortcomings was that Ings only focuses on topics that interest him, like biology, physiology and psychology, while giving little attention to mathematics and theoretical physics. Graham also noted several \\"incorrect or exaggerated\\" statements in the book, for example: Alexei Gastev was a \\"leading architect of Russia's industrialisation programme\\"; Nikolai Bernstein \\"invented cybernetics\\"; and Stalin was \\"the last in a long line of European philosopher kings\\". Graham concluded that the book is the result of \\"an impressive amount of study\\" and \\"deserves attention\\", but \\"a very critical form of attention\\". According to the review aggregator Book Marks, Stalin and the Scientists received \\"positive\\" reviews, based on 4 reviews. ==ReferencesCited works== * Category:2016 non-fiction books Category:English non-fiction books Category:Popular science books Category:Books about scientists Category:Books about Joseph Stalin Category:Science and technology in the Soviet Union Category:Political repression in the Soviet Union Category:History of science Category:Faber and Faber books ","title":"Stalin and the Scientists"},{"id":"56111977","text":"Aenghus Ua hAenghusa (died 1029)\\"Fasti Ecclesiae Hibernicae: The succession of the prelates Volume 4\\" Cotton, H. p131.

She coached the College of Charleston women's basketball (CoC), the University of South Carolina women's basketball (SC), and the professional Seattle Reign of the American Basketball League (ABL). Wilson would establish the program records for the most wins as a head coach at both the College of Charleston and South Carolina, and still owns the career wins totals at CoC. Wilson led both programs to numerous conference championships as well as AIAW and NCAA tournament appearances. Wilson has spent 30 years as a college head coach, compiling a record of 542-365 == Early Years == Born in Lake City, South Carolina, Wilson attended Lake City High School, graduating in 1969. She attended Coker College in Hartsville, SC, graduating in 1973 with a bachelor's degree in Physical Education. She was a member of the college's first intercollegiate women's basketball team, and also competed in intercollegiate field hockey. She would later obtain her master's degree in Physical Education from The Citadel in 1982. == College of Charleston (first stint) == Soon after graduating from Coker College, Wilson was hired as an assistant coach for the College of Charleston women's basketball team in 1973. The team was then in the AIAW Division II. She worked for head coach Joan Cronan, and also coached the college's volleyball team. In 1976 Wilson succeeded Cronan as the head coach of the women's basketball program as Cronan focused more on her position as the Director of Women's Athletics. Wilson led the Cougars to quick success, leading the team to a 21-5 record her first season as head coach, and beginning with the 1979-80 season reached the AIAW Division II national championship game three years in a row. During this eight-season period at College of Charleston Wilson compiled a 193-64 record. Wilson was named the SCAIAW Coach of the Year three times, and shared National Coach of the Year honors in 1982. The success led Wilson to be offered the job to coach South Carolina in 1984. == University of South Carolina == Wilson spent 13 years as head coach at South Carolina beginning with the 1984-85 season. During the early years of Wilson's tenure when South Carolina was a member of the Metro Conference, Wilson built the program into a dominant presence within the conference, winning five regular season titles and three conference tournament championships. Wilson led the Gamecocks to five NCAA Tournament appearances, all during their Metro Conference years, including an appearance in the Sweet Sixteen in 1989-90. Wilson was named Metro Conference Coach of the Year in 1985 and 1991. When South Carolina joined the more competitive Southeastern Conference beginning with the 1991-92 season however, the success was harder to come by. Still by her final season of 1996-97, Wilson held the program's all-time wins record with a 231-149 showing, that remained SC's record until passed by head coach Dawn Staley on December 21, 2017 == Seattle Reign == Wilson joined the American Basketball League's Seattle Reign as the associate head coach in 1997 under Tammy Holder, Wilson's former assistant coach at SC. The Reign went 15-29 in Wilson's first season on the staff. They began to realize substantial improvements during her 2nd season, but the league was struggling to compete against the new Women's National Basketball League (WNBA), and in a surprising move declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the middle of the following season, on December 22, 1998. The Reign were 8-7 at the time. == College of Charleston (second stint) == After her time in the ABL, Wilson returned to South Carolina and took a job at the College of Charleston teaching physical education classes. While there she was persuaded in 2003 by a member of the administration to return as head coach of the women's basketball team, beginning with the 2003-04 season. Success did not come as immediately nor as consistently for her second tour as it did for her first, as she compiled a 118-152 over nine seasons. She did however lead the program to its best season in Division I basketball in 2008-09, when the team set program single-season records with 14 conference wins in the Southern Conference, and with 23 wins overall. Further, College of Charleston won a school-record nine consecutive games that season, and advanced to its first- ever Southern Conference Tournament championship game. 2008-09 was also the season that Wilson became the 24th active Division I coach at the time in NCAA history to reach 500 career victories, with a 63-43 win over Georgia Southern on Feb. 16, 2009. Wilson would lead CoC to another strong season in 2009-10 finishing 21-12 (13-7), but then the team would falter to 10-20 (7-13) and 7-23 (6-14) results in 2010-11 and 2011–12, respectively. Prior to the 2011-12 season, Wilson announced that she would be retiring from coaching at the conclusion of that season. == Head Coaching Record  References == Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:Coker College alumni Category:College of Charleston Cougars women's basketball coaches Category:South Carolina Gamecocks women's basketball coaches ","title":"Nancy Wilson (basketball)"},{"id":"56111988","text":"Capoeta coadi is a cyprinid fish endemic to the Karun River drainage in Iran. == References == coadi Category:Fish described in 2016 ","title":"Capoeta coadi"},{"id":"56111994","text":"Scleritodermidae is a family of sea sponges. == Genera == *Aciculites Schmidt, 1879 *Amphibleptula Schmidt, 1879 *Microscleroderma Kirkpatrick, 1903 *Pomelia Zittel, 1878 *Scleritoderma Sollas, 1888 *Setidium Schmidt, 1879 ==References== * Category:Tetractinellida Category:Taxa named by William Johnson Sollas ","title":"Scleritodermidae"},{"id":"56112005","text":"Murchadh Ua Beolláin (d1053)\\"Fasti Ecclesiae Hibernicae: The succession of the prelates Volume 4\\" Cotton, H. p131.

Pehrson, was an architect of the U.S. state of Washington. His work includes the Chronicle Building for the Spokane Chronicle, Rookery Building in Spokane, Washington (demolished in 2006), and other buildings in Spokane, several mansions, and the new design for a community serving the Hanford Nuclear plant, now part of Gold Coast Historic District (Richland, Washington). He also designed the Paulsen Medical and Dental Building (part of August Paulsen's Paulsen Center) in Spokane. ==Early life== Pehrson was born in Sweden. He attended Uppsala University and Oxford University, where he studied architecture. He immigrated to the U.S. in 1905, ultimately settling in Spokane, Washington. ==Career== He worked as a draftsman for Kirtland Cutter's firm Cutter and Malgren beginning in 1913. He established his own architecture business in 1917. Soon after a prolific building period in the 1920s that included his terracotta-adorned Art Deco design work for the Chronicle Building and Paulsen Medical Building in Spokane, the Great Depression hit and the staff at Pehrson's firm fell from 29 to two. He later found work designing the new community of Richland Village (Richland, Washington), where an agricultural town had been located. He designed government housing, schools and other buildings developed to serve the Hanford nuclear site. Washington State University has a collection of documents about his work. ==Works== Some of Pehrson's works are: * Western Union Life Building (1924) which later became the Chancery building, an Italian Renaissance style building, and now known as 1023 West Riverside Avenue in Spokane after being sold by the Catholic Diocese after being hit with sex abuse settlement costs. * Eldridge Buick dealership (1925) at Cedar Street and Sprague Avenue in Spokane was the largest dealership in the Pacific Northwest when it was built. * Paulsen Medical and Dental Building (1929), one of the last major buildings constructed in downtown Spokane before the stock market crash of October 1929.

When the regiment was redesignated on 9 July 1942 as the 25th Police Regiment, Police Battalion 65, Police Battalion 67, and Reserve Police Battalion 101 were redesignated as the regiment's first through third battalions, respectively.Arico, pp. 204, 214, 293; Tessin & Kanapin, p. 624 All of the police regiments were redesignated as SS police units on 24 February 1943.Tessin & Kannapin, pp. 557, 625 Together with the 22nd SS Police Regiment and other security forces, the regiment participated in Operation Harvest Festival (Aktion Erntefest) on 3–4 November, the massacre of 42,000 Jews imprisoned in the Majdanek extermination camp and several of its sub-camps.

Tiberius asked if anyone else was aware of the invention. When the inventor replied that he was the only person who knew the secret, Tiberius had him killed.

The company was founded in 2009 by Peter Besen, Don Shulsinger and Stephen Gordon. The company was initially started as Immedia Semiconductor Inc in 2009, but pivoted into a consumer electronics company. In 2014, the company had a Kickstarter campaign for their indoor security camera, which raised over US$1 million. Subsequently, Blink later announced an outdoor security camera, home security system, and video doorbell. Amazon announced in December 2017 that they had acquired the company. Immedia Semiconductor, LLC continues to operate as an independent subsidiary. It is anticipated that Blink's technology will be used for the Amazon Key service. In December 2019, Amazon rolled out patches in response to a research citing vulnerabilities in the Blink XT2 security camera systems found by vulnerability detection firm Tenable. == References == Blink Home Category:Home automation companies Category:American companies established in 2009 Category:Companies based in Boston Category:Amazon (company) acquisitions Category:Kickstarter-funded products Category:2017 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Blink Home"},{"id":"56112057","text":"Sung Hoon (Hangul: 성훈, born August 29, 1980), is a South Korean singer and member of Brown Eyed Soul, signed under in Next Music.

The area includes the city of Ketchum, Idaho which was separately designated a \\"Dark Sky Community\\" in 2017. Idaho State Highway 75 in the Sawtooth Valley between Redfish Lake and Pettit Lake roughly traverses the reserve's \\"core areas\\". Several sky quality meters are installed along State Highway 75 in this area. Local communities and federal authorities collaborated in the designation; the governments will take measures such as shielding street lights to preserve the area's dark sky; Ketchum has had a dark sky ordinance since 1999, and Sun Valley, also in the reserve, has its own local ordinance. The U.S. Forest Service, which manages much of the land in the area, will post informational signs about the dark sky reserve, and has said it will reduce light pollution from its buildings; compliance by individuals on Forest Service land will be voluntary.

Supposedly possessed of a voracious sexual appetite, the diarist Girolamo Priuli took unkindly to the fact that he still enjoyed the company of mistresses in old age.Thubron, pp. 113–115 His first victory came in late 1500 when, aided by a Spanish fleet under Gonzalo de Cordoba, he retook Cephalonia from the Ottomans. Later, in 1502, he met his cousin Jacopo Pesaro (who had thirteen papal galleys under his command) on the Greek island of Cerigo, and from there launched an assault on Turkish-controlled Santa Maura; the island fell on 30 August. However, when peace was agreed the next year, concessions were made; while Cephalonia was kept under Venetian control, Santa Maura was returned to the Turks.Setton, p. 523 Also worthy of note is Pesaro's ruthlessness in the field. In 1501, after capturing the notorious Turkish pirate Erichi, whose ship had run aground on Milos, he had him roasted to death.Crowley, p. 288 On another occasion, Pesaro ordered the beheading of Marco Loredan, a relative of Doge Leonardo Loredan, for his unseemly readiness to surrender his fort to the Turks.Thubron, p. 115 He died in August 1503 at Corfu, having fallen ill as he was making preparations to return home.Bembo/Ulery, p. 153 In his will he requested that he be interred in the Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari. His funerary monument, which stands there today, was constructed by the brothers Lorenzo and Giambattista Bregno. == Notes  Sources == * Thubron, Colin (1981). The Venetians.

A pair of objects, such as this pair of apples, is subject to comparison once points of similarity and difference can be identified. A chart showing a comparison of qualities of a variety of cooking oils, aimed at helping the reader decide which choices would be best for their health. Comparison or comparing is the act of evaluating two or more things by determining the relevant, comparable characteristics of each thing, and then determining which characteristics of each are similar to the other, which are different, and to what degree. Where characteristics are different, the differences may then be evaluated to determine which thing is best suited for a particular purpose. The description of similarities and differences found between the two things is also called a comparison. Comparison can take many distinct forms, varying by field: To compare things, they must have characteristics that are similar enough in relevant ways to merit comparison. If two things are too different to compare in a useful way, an attempt to compare them is colloquially referred to in English as \\"comparing apples and oranges.\\" Comparison is widely used in society, in science and in the arts. ==General usage== Comparison is a natural activity, which even animals engage in when deciding, for example, which potential food to eat. Humans similarly have always engaged in comparison when hunting or foraging for food. This behavior carries over into activities like shopping for food, clothes, and other items, choosing which job to apply for or which job to take from multiple offers, or choosing which applicants to hire for employment. In commerce, people often engage in comparison shopping: attempting to get the best deal for a product by comparing the qualities of different available versions of that product and attempting to determine which one maximizes the return on the money spent. In the twenty-first century, as shopping has increasingly been done on the internet, comparison shopping websites have developed to aid shoppers in making such determinations. When consumers and others invest excessive thought into making comparisons, this can result in the problem of analysis paralysis. Humans also tend to compare themselves and their belongings with others, an activity also observed in some animals. Children begin developing the ability to compare themselves to others in elementary school.Robert S. Siegler, Judy S. DeLoache, Nancy Eisenberg, How Children Develop (2006), p. 429. In adults, this can lead to unhappiness when a person compares things that they have to things they perceived as superior and unobtainable that others have. Some marketing relies on making such comparisons to entice people to purchase things so they compare more favorably with people who have these things. Social comparison theory, initially proposed by social psychologist Leon Festinger in 1954, centers on the belief that there is a drive within individuals to gain accurate self-evaluations. The theory explains how individuals evaluate their own opinions and abilities by comparing themselves to others to reduce uncertainty in these domains, and learn how to define the self. Following the initial theory, research began to focus on social comparison as a way of self-enhancement, introducing the concepts of downward and upward comparisons and expanding the motivations of social comparisons.Schachter, S. (1959). The psychology of affiliation: Experimental studies of the sources of gregariousness (Vol. 1). Stanford University Press. Human language has evolved to suit this practice by facilitating grammatical comparison, with comparative forms enabling a person to describe a thing as having more or less of a characteristic than another thing, or to describe a thing in a group as having the most or least of that characteristic relative to the group. The grammatical category associated with comparison of adjectives and adverbs is degree of comparison. ==Academic uses of comparison== Academically, comparison is used between things like economic and political systems. Political scientist and historian Benedict Anderson has cautioned against use of comparisons without considering the relevant framework of things being compared: Anderson notes as an example that \\"[i]n the jingoist years on the eve of the First World War, when Germans and Frenchmen were encouraged to hate each other, the great Austro-Marxist theoretician Otto Bauer enjoyed baiting both sides\\" by comparing their similarities, \\"saying that contemporary Parisians and Berliners had far more in common than either had with their respective medieval ancestors\\". Notably, the phrase \\"comparative studies\\" is generally used to refer to cross-cultural studies, within the fields of sociology and anthropology. Émile Durkheim, one of the founders of the field of sociology, said of this term that \\"comparative sociology is not a particular branch of sociology; it is sociology itself\\".Gordon Marshall, \\"comparative sociology, comparative method\\", The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Sociology (1994), p. 77. ==Literary uses of comparison== The primary use of comparison in literature is with the simile, a figure of speech that directly compares two things. Similes are a form of metaphor that explicitly use connecting words (such as like, as, so, than, or various verbs such as resemble), though these specific words are not always necessary. While similes are mainly used in forms of poetry that compare the inanimate and the living, there are also terms in which similes are used for humorous purposes of comparison. A number of literary works have commented negatively on the practice of comparison. For example, 15th century English poet John Lydgate wrote \\"[o]dyous of olde been comparsionis\\",John Lydgate, \\"The Hors, the Shepe, and the Gosse\\", line 204. which was reflected by many later writers, such as William Shakespeare, who included the line in Much Ado About Nothing, \\"comparisons are odious\\".William Shakespeare, Much Ado About Nothing (1598-99), Act III, scene 5, line 19. Miguel de Cervantes, in a passage in Don Quixote, wrote, \\"[i]s it possible your pragmatical worship should not know that the comparisons made between wit and wit, courage and courage, beauty and beauty, birth and birth, are always odious and ill taken?\\"Miguel de Cervantes, Don Quixote (1605-15), Part II, Chapter I. ==References== * ","title":"Comparison"},{"id":"56112450","text":"Plan of San Clemente as published by German explorer Karl Sapper in 1897. Note the structure numbering differs from that in later use. San Clemente is a ruin of the ancient Maya civilization in Guatemala. Its main period of occupation dates to the Classic period of Mesoamerican chronology (approximately 250 – 950 AD).Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 269. The ruins were first described in the late 19th century, before being visited by a number of investigators in the early part of the 20th century. ==Location== The site is situated in the Petén Basin, approximately from Flores, in the department of El Petén of northern Guatemala. It is north of the modern settlement of El Naranjo, within the municipality of Flores. The site occupies a deforested hilltop at an elevation of above mean sea level. San Clemente is located in the north of the Maya Biosphere Reserve.Morales 2005, p. 96. ==Name== The ruins were given the name San Clemente in the late 19th century by Karl Sapper, after a camp to the west of the site. Sylvanus Morley named the site Chinchantun (\\"small stone\\" in Mayan), but the earlier name was adopted by Frans Blom and later investigators. ==History== The site was first occupied during the Early Classic (c. 250–550 AD), when simple platforms were built directly upon the bedrock, around unsurfaced plazas. The city underwent a major construction phase during the Late Classic (c. 550–830), with the development of monumental platforms and the construction of two Mesoamerican ballcourts. The architecture visible today dates to the Terminal Classic (c. 830–950). Principal activity at the site has been dated according to ceramic evidence to the period running from c. 450 to c. 900.Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 270. Modern history San Clemente was first described by Karl Sapper in 1895, and was visited by various expeditions during the course of the 20th century, including by noted archaeologists Frans Blom and Sylvanus Morley. The site was rediscovered in 1992 by the archaeological rescue project of the Cultural Triangle Yaxha-Nakum-Naranjo National Park, and was investigated by archaeologists from 1995 to 2006, who carried out some restoration work in the northern sector of the site in 2006 and 2007.Muñoz Cosme et al 2010, p. 376. ==Site description== San Clemente was one of the most important Maya cities in the region immediately to the southwest of Yaxha;Morales 2005, pp. 97, 107. the site core covers an area of approximately and includes an acropolis,Morales 2005, p. 110. and two ballcourts, which are oriented north-south.Morales 2005, p. 108. The architecture of San Clemente is grouped into three principal sectors, the northern sector labelled the Palace, the central sector consisting of the Main Plaza, and the Elevated South Group.Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, pp. 269–270 The three architectural groups are aligned upon a north- south axis.Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 271. There are examples of range-type structures at San Clemente with masonry pillars supporting the facade.Quintana Samayoa 2017, p. 78. Structures were numbered by early investigators from north to south.Blom 1928, p. 94. The site core was accessed by a causeway that approached from the east to join the Main Plaza. In addition to the three main architectural groups of the site core, there are a number of smaller satellite groups. To the east of the Palace complex is a basal platform supporting a number of low platforms arranged around patios. Investigating archaeologists have suggested that this was the service complex associated with the palace. To the east of the South Plaza is a terrace (the Southeast Plaza), and to the west is the Southwest Plaza. Palace The Palace is laid out around two interior patios (the Upper Court and the Lower Court).Quintana Samayoa 2017, p. 93. The floor levels of the two patios differ by . Structures I through to IV surround the Upper Court, which is linked to the Lower Court by an internal stairway contained within Structure IV. Structure IV is built against the east side of the retaining wall separating the east side of the Upper Court from the west side of the Lower Court.Blom 1928, pp. 94–95. Structure III is a two-storey range-type structure in the palace, facing south onto the Main Plaza.Quintana Samayoa 2017, pp. 78, 93. Blom 1928, p. 95. It separates the Plaza from the Upper Court.Blom 1928, p. 95. Structure VII is a well-preserved building on the south side of the Lower Court, separating it from the Main Plaza.Blom 1928, pp. 95–96. Three chambers in the structure open directly onto the Lower Court. An interior room is accessed via the westernmost of these chambers. The east wall of the western chamber contains a niche, marked in antiquity with red hand-prints upon its stucco while it was still fresh.Blom 1928, p. 96. The Lower Court is linked to the Main Plaza by a narrow passage at the western extreme of Structure VII.Blom 1928, p. 94. The western wall of the passage was marked with ancient graffiti scratched into the stucco, very similar to graffiti found at Tikal. The graffiti includes crude figures ang geometric shapes.Blom 1928, p. 98. Structure V lies along the north side of the Lower Court, and Structure VI delimits its eastern side. Both of these are badly preserved.Blom 1928, p. 97. Main Plaza All the buildings arranged around the Main Plaza face towards it. The Plaza is rectangular and divided into two portions by Ballcourt 1. The northern portion of the Main Plaza measures ; it is bordered on three sides by buildings. The southern portion is open on the east side where the causeway provided the principal entrance to the site core, and is also bordered by the edge of Ballcourt 2. Structures IX and X close the west side of the Main Plaza. Structure IX, the northernmost of the two, is a platform that is likely to have supported a building. No traces of any building were found on top of Structure X, however three sculpted limestone stelae were raised at its base.Blom 1928, p. 99. Structure XIII is a long platform closing the east side of the Plaza;Blom 1928, pp. 95, 99. it supported a building upon its southern half. Four small stelae (Stelae 4–7) were raised at the base of Structure XIII. Altars were placed before Stela 4 and Stela 5.Blom 1928, p. 100. Structures XI and XII are low mounds in the southwestern portion of the Plaza. They were built from rough boulders and each stands between high.Blom 1928, pp. 95, 100. Structures XIV and XV are twin pyramids standing on the south side of the Main Plaza.Quintana Samayoa 2017, p. 81. These steep-sided, stepped pyramids were faces with cut limestone blocks, and each supported a summit shrine; they are similar is style to the principal pyramids found at Tikal and Yaxha. The summit structures were accessed via stairways on the north faces of the pyramids, which descended to the Main Plaza. Behind the eastern pyramid, a passage descends to the Southeast Plaza. South Plaza The South Plaza, sometimes referred to as the Elevated South Group, is immediately to the south of the Main Plaza. Its floor level is higher than that of the Main Plaza, and it is accessed via a stairway climbing between the twin pyramids (Structures XIV and XV). Structure XVI is a long mound closing the west side of the plaza; it is in a ruinous state and once supported a range structure.Blom 1928, pp. 95, 100. The east side of the plaza is formed by Structures XXII and XVIII. Structure XVIII supported an east-facing building with masonry walls and a perishable roof. In the 1920s, the entrance still supported a zapote-wood lintel. Southeast Plaza The Southeast Plaza is a terrace that extends southwards from the Main Plaza along the east side of the South Plaza. The terrace is higher than the Main Plaza, and had no apparent direct access to it. The north and south sides of the plaza were open. The western side of the plaza is delimited by an isolated range structure, with two chultuns (underground storage chambers) in front of it.Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 272. Ballcourt 2 The second of the ballcourts is located to the southeast of the site core. It is the larger of the two ballcourts and is well defined, forming a perfect 8px shape. On the north side, a low parapet separates the northern end zone of the ballcourt from the ramp ascending to the Main Plaza. The main playing area is flanked by two solidly-constructed buildings, and the southern end zone is marked by low but clearly-defined borders. At the western end of the southern end zone, the border is carved from the bedrock; its upper portion is at the same level as the South Plaza. This 8px-shaped ballcourt is the only known example of this form in northeastern Petén.Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, pp. 271–272. Monuments When Morley visited the site in 1922, he reported the presence of a series of small, heavily eroded stelae.Blom 1928, p. 93. Three stelae were raised at the base of Structure X on the Main Plaza, and four at the base of Structure XIII, also on the Plaza.Blom 1928, pp. 95, 99–100. Although they were sculpted, their poor state of preservation makes their design illegible. ==NotesReferences== *Blom, Frans (1928). \\"San Clemente Ruins: Peten, Guatemala (Chichantun).\\" Journal de la Société des Américanistes, Nouvelle Série, 20: pp. 93–102.

They are a type of regional planning organization that have responsibility to provide technical assistance to a broad multi-county area of the state, and their functions are similar to the metropolitan planning organization in urbanized areas. As their intent was to support local governments, they frequently provide a coordinating role and generally do not exercise any type of binding authority over local matters. ==History== As part of the Governorship of Harold LaVander, economic development became a significant policy directive with a strong desire to drive new businesses and focus on the needs of rural areas outside of metropolitan planning areas. During this time, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Commerce provided funding for economic development agencies across the United States. In response to this, the state legislature created an act for the development of regional development commissions in areas where existing planning organizations did not exist. Each area of the state was given time to offer their local support to be included in one or more regions. Each local government had to petition for the creation or inclusion in an RDC. The Arrowhead Region was the first to formally organize and be certified. Other areas soon followed. Over the years internal fighting between some areas of the state and anti-government sentiment led to the dissolution of some regional development commissions. These included Region 4 in western Minnesota, Region 7W near the center of the state and Region 10 which consisted of the 11 county area in southeastern Minnesota. Over the years there has been significant interest in developing new regional development commission in southeastern Minnesota as the lack of an RDC leaves local governments at a competitive disadvantage compared to areas that do have them or that have an MPO. In response to this the area in Region 4 designated the non-profit organization West Central Initiative to become their de facto Regional Development Organization in 1984 and it was designated as a federal development agency in 1985 for the same area. ==Functions== Common functions and services include urban planning, transportation planning, economic development assistance, emergency management coordination, training, outreach, community organizing and others. However, the RDCs work with a wide variety of functions and each may offer additional services based on the types of needs in the region. For example, all of the RDCs are designated by the United States Department of Commerce, Economic Development Administration as Economic Development Districts. As a result, they can accept and offer federal grants and economic development loans to local governments and businesses. Others include within the organization the federally designated Area Agency on Aging that focuses on the health and well being needs of the elderly in the region. Some of the transportation planning functions are handled by other organizations in areas where an RDC does not exist. For example, State Laws specifically request that the Minnesota Department of Transportation provide transportation planning for areas not covered by an RDC or MPO. In the Twin Cities Metropolitan area, the Metropolitan Council provides transportation planning at the regional level. ==List of Minnesota Regional Development Commissions== { class=\\" collapsible sortable\\" + List of RDCs - ! scope=\\"col\\"  RDC Name ! scope=\\"col\\" data-sort-type=\\"number\\"  RDC Number ! scope=\\"col\\"  Headquarters City ! scope=\\"col\\"  Designation Year ! scope=\\"col\\"  Counties - Northwest Regional Development Commission1Warren, MN1973Kittson, Marshall, Norman, Pennington, Polk, Red Lake, Roseau - Headwaters Development Commission2Bemidji, MN1971Beltrami, Clearwater, Hubbard, Lake of the Woods, Mahnomen - Arrowhead Regional Development Commission3Duluth, MN1969Aitkin, Carlton, Cook, Itasca, Koochiching, Lake, St. Louis - West Central Initiative4Fergus Falls, MN1985Becker, Clay, Douglas, Grant, Otter Tail, Pope, Stevens, Traverse, Wilkin - Region Five Development Commission5Staples, MN1973Cass, Crow Wing, Morrison, Todd, Wadena - Upper Minnesota Valley Regional Development Commission6WAppleton, MN1973Chippewa, Big Stone, Yellow Medicine, Lac qui Parle, Big Stone, Swift - Mid-Minnesota Development Commission6EWilmar, MN1973Kandiyohi, McLeod, Meeker, and Renville - West Central Development Commission (Dissolved in 1982)7WSaint Cloud, MN1973Kittson, Marshall, Norman, Pennington, Polk, Red Lake, Roseau - East-Central Development Commission7EMora, MN1973Chisago, Isanti, Kanabec, Mille Lacs, Pine - Southwest Regional Development Commission8Slayton, MN1973Cottonowood, Jackson, Lincoln, Lyon, Murray, Nobles, Pipestone, Redwood, Rock - Region Nine Regional Development Commission9Mankato, MN1972Blue Earth, Brown, Faribault, Le Sueur, Martin, Nicolett, Sibley, Waseca, Watonwan - Southeast Minnesota Regional Development Commission (Non-RDC Area Dissolved in 1982)10Rochester, MN1973Dodge, Fillmore, Freeborn, Goodhue, Houston, Mower, Olmsted, Rice, Steele, Wabasha, Winona - Metropolitan Council (Non-RDC Area, de facto)11Saint Paul, MN1967Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, Washington } ==See also== *Regional planning organization *Council of governments *Minnesota *Urban planning ==ReferencesExternal links== * http://www.mnado.org/ Category:Local government in Minnesota ","title":"Regional Development Commissions"},{"id":"56112655","text":"__NOTOC__ The Upland News was a weekly or semiweekly newspaper circulated in Upland, California, between 1901 and 1974. ==Family ownership== Ella L.

The Baldwins had moved from Durham, Connecticut to a new settlement in Durham, New York and later continued to move west, spending the end of their lives in Atwater, Ohio. The Baldwins were joined in Durham by Jonathan's brother Seth and his family, including future missionary Dwight Baldwin (1798-1886). Baldwin was admitted to Yale College in 1807; he took five years to complete his studies, taking time off to teach to help pay his way. After spending several years teaching at an academy in Fairfield, Baldwin was admitted to the Andover Theological Seminary in 1814 and was ordained September 10, 1817. He was initially employed by the Young Men's Society of New York City as a missionary in the area of Corlaer's Hook, then a neighborhood notorious for prostitution and drinking. By March 1818 he had founded the seventh Presbyterian church in New York City, meeting in that district, and by the time of Baldwin's death the congregation had grown to over 1900 members.The Biographical Annual: Containing Memoirs of Eminent Persons, Recently Deceased, ed. Rufus Wilmot Griswold, \\"Rev. Elihu W. Baldwin\\", Joseph H. Myers, New York: Linen and Fennell, 1841, p. 185 In 1835 Baldwin was asked to take up the presidency of a college to be erected in Crawfordsville, Indiana; he accepted and proceeded to raise funds for the new institution and move his family there. Baldwin presided over a difficult beginning; the college's first building burned down in 1838 and needed to be rebuilt. Baldwin fell ill during a trip taken for the college and died October 15, 1840. ==Publications== Baldwin published several short works published as religious tracts: \\"On Fashionable Amusements\\" (New England Tract Society, 1815) and \\"Universalism Exposed\\" (New England Tract Society, 1823). He also published works aimed at use in Sunday schools - a book of moralizing stories, \\"The Five Apprentices\\" (1828)The American Sunday School Magazine, vol. 6, March 1829, p. 92 and \\"The Young Freethinker Reclaimed\\" (American Sunday-School Union, 1829). Two of Baldwin's sermons were published in the publication \\"The National Preacher\\" in the December 1827 issue. His inaugural speech was published as \\"An Address Delivered in Crawfordsville, Indiana, July 13th, 1836: On Occasion of His Inauguration as President of Wabash College\\", and also his \\"Address on the encouragement of emulation in the education of youth : delivered before the Education Convention of Indiana\\" (1837). ==Family== Baldwin married Julia C.

It is also the name of a traditional folk music project run by Jon Wilks – a blog on which he explores the traditional songs of the British Isles by interviewing key musicians from the contemporary folk scene. == The Grizzly Folk (band) == The Grizzly Folk formed in 2008 in Fukuoka, Japan, when Jon Nice and Jon Wilks performed British sea shanties to Japanese audiences. As a duo, with the occasional help of other musicians (including Em Kuntze and Dai Evans), they recorded their first two EPs ('5-Weight', 2008; 'Electric Grizzle', 2009) which were ultimately released as a digital-only compilation album, 'Gurning at the Moon' (2013). These recordings were mainly of original songs, although occasionally they would feature traditional songs from the UK. The latter featured their recording of 'The Wassailing Song' (also known as the 'Gloucestershire Wassail'), which is perhaps their most recognized recording. In 2015, they released their second full-length album, 'Lairy Through the Town', which incorporated the writing and singing talents of Richard Lines, as well as contributions from musicians Stephen Field, Richard Banks and Dave Borgeson. == Grizzly Folk (blog) == In late 2016, Wilks set up a blog called 'Grizzly Folk', intending to explore traditional folk songs via their storylines (hence the tagline, 'Folk songs explored one story at a time'). His interest in traditional British folk music came via the discovery that his grandparents had met and courted at Cecil Sharp House. Initially wary of trying to explain a genre he didn't fully understand, he decided to use his journalistic experience to interview a series of prominent folk singers, performers and scholars, hoping that by doing so he might be able to communicate their passion for the genre to his audience. Interviewees included Eliza Carthy, Jon Boden, Paul Sartin, Martin Simpson and many more. By the end of 2017, he had interviewed and documented conversations with over 25 folk luminaries. The project also saw Wilks explore some of the traditional songs that he discovered, nine of which ended up on an accompanying album, Songs From The Attic. A follow-up album, using the same concept but focusing on traditional, music hall and industrial folk songs from Birmingham, was released in 2018 under the title Midlife. During the course of the project, Wilks also resurrected the Whitchurch Folk Club in the company of Paul Sartin. The club had been popular in the 1970s and 1980s, but had ultimately closed due to a lack of funding. The club relaunched on October 13th, 2017, with a performance by the British folk band, Faustus.

He was the founder-chairman and later President of the Rodewald Concert Society in Liverpool. ==Family background== Robert Erenest Bryson (known as a composer more often as just Ernest Bryson), was born in Milton, Glasgow, Scotland on 30 March 1867Scotland Select Births and Baptisms, 1564–1950 and died 16 April 1942 in St Briavels, Gloucestershire.Probate Bristol 12 August 1942 Some sources record his death as 20 April, but this in fact was the date of his burial He was the only son of Robert Bryson (1831–1886), a cotton merchant, and Margaret Bryson (née Young, 1839–1936), but was brought to Tranmere, Birkenhead (then part of Cheshire, England) at an early age. He appears to have lived much of his life at what became the family home, 1 Chetwynd Road, Oxton, Cheshire (now part of Birkenhead, Wirral), where he remained with his three sisters, Jessie Frew Bryson (1862–1954), Sarah Ferguson Bryson (1864–1932) and Margaret Edith Bryson (Medical Missionary, 1865–1950) after their fathers’ death. He purchased Yew Tree Cottage at St Briavels, Gloucestershire, in 1907The Lydney Observer, 8 May 1942. as a country residence and was registered there as a voter from 1910, but does not appear to have lived there until he retired in 1942. He, and his three sisters all died there unmarried, along with their widowed mother. ==Early years== Bryson was educated at Birkenhead School (1877–81) where he is thought that he obtained much of his musical education, although this may have been extra curricula as the school records show that he was only studying Greek, Latin and French in his final year. No record has been found indicating that he went on to any sort of higher education, but it was another three years before he commenced his apprenticeship. ==Professional career== Bryson joined his father's firm of Bryson, Cooper & Co, cotton brokers, of Liverpool as an apprentice at the age of 17. He became a partner on his father's death.The Lydney Observer, 8 May 1942. As there are several errors in this obituary we cannot be sure of this. ==Musical career== Very little information about Ernest Bryson's musical life is currently available. He has not been included in Grove's dictionary of music since 1954.Bryson, (Robert) Ernest,Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 1954 v 1, p 990. Eaglefield-Hull (Source 2) is only available in specialist libraries. Scottish Composers (Source 4) only mentions his opera and symphonies. Most of the information we have comes from obituaries which are not always reliable. Bryson appears to have studied music with William H. Hunt, a local music teacher, along with Hunt's nephews, Frederic and Ernest Austin who both became composers, much neglected after their death. He was organist of Christ Church, Birkenhead and St Saviour Church, Oxton and spent most of his spare time in composition. His earliest known composition was Allegro Moderato in D minor for organ, which was published by Reeves in 1889. His first big success was probably his Symphony No 1 which was performed in Liverpool by the Liverpool Orchestral Society under Bantock in 1908 and published by Breitkopf & Härtel, It has more recently been reviewed by Jürgen Schaarwächter.Jürgen Schaarwächter, Two Centuries of British Symphonism from the beginning to 1945, Chapter 5 p 278 Unfortunately, like other English Symphonies at that time, it was rather over-shadowed by Elgar's Symphony No 1. There were further performances in Bournemouth under James Lyon (1872–1949)James Lyon was one of the founders of the Rodewald Concert Society in Liverpool, not to be confused with the American composer of the same name in February 1912.The Times 11 November 1811 p 10 and in Manchester by the Hallé OrchestraThe Times 27 September 1926 Unfortunately his Symphony No 2 appears to be lost, although it was performed in Manchester on 1 January 1928 by the Hallé Orchestra under Sir Hamilton Harty and broadcast.The Times 12 January 1928 It was also awarded a prize by the Carnegie Music Trust. Both Symphonies were reviewed in detail by Leigh Henry.Musical Opinion, April and May 1923 As part of the Musical League Festival, Bryson's Idylls of a Summer's Day was performed in 1909.The Times, 27 September 1909 p 11 His next big success was Voices, a study for orchestra premièred by Sir Henry Wood at the Promenade Concert, London on 15 September 1910.The Times 15 and 17 September 1910 p 10 Next came The Stranger for Baritone, chorus & small orchestra, which was premièred by the Liverpool Philharmonic Choir and Orchestra in 1917. His part-song Drum-taps was reviewed as a new publication in 1918.The Times 7 December 1918 His Fanfare for an Adventure was published in 1921 as a piano version but the original version has not been found, nor has the occasion for which it was written been identified. It may have been a national eventThere were two major expeditions at about that time: the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition to the Antarctic, where Ernest Shackleton died and the 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition. Whilst no evidence for a link has been found, it is perhaps not a coincidence that both George Mallory and Sandy Irvine lived in the same Parish as Bryson. or a local, perhaps Boy Scout, event. The peak of Bryson's composing career was probably his opera The Leper's Flute with libretto by Ian Colvin. It was premièred in Glasgow on 15 October 1926 by the British National Opera CompanyThe Times 16 October 1926 p 10 and subsequently toured to Edinburgh, Manchester, Liverpool and London.The Times 12 Sep and 14 November 1927 Also that year Bryson's song cycle The Unfading Garden was introduced by Hugh Campbell at the Grotriau Hall.The Times 26 November 1926 A song cycle, A Last Harvest was played at the Reid Concert at the University of Edinburgh on 19 November 1927. The Radio Times shows that on 27 August 1937 Bryson's The Field of Boliauns was broadcast; performed by the BBC Orchestra conducted by Clarence Raybould with Parry Jones (tenor), but no other record of this work has been found. Bryson claimed that he had been the confident of William J Ridley in the design of the organ at Liverpool Cathedral.Bryson, Ernest, Liverpool Cathedral Organ, Musical Opinion, 1924. Ridley was an amateur organist and an enthusiastic member of the organ committee, who was determined that the organ at Liverpool Cathedral would be the biggest and best organ in the World. He probably drew up the original conceptMeybrick-Roberts, R, The Organ of Liverpool Cathedral, Musical Opinion, London 1926. but the detailed specification would most likely have been drawn up by F H Burstall (1851–1916), the incumbent organist of the already-constructed Lady Chapel in consultation with the organ builder Henry Willis II. Following Burstall's death Henry Goss-Custard, became the incumbent organist, and took Burstall's place on the Committee. Rising costs after the war required some modifications of the design for which Goss-Custard would have been responsible.Programme for the dedication week, Liverpool Cathedral 1926 However, Ridley was still credited with the inception of the project.Goss-Custard, H The Organ of Liverpool Cathedral, Liverpool Cathedral, 1940. Ridley may have had maintained some influence on the design throughout as he held the trump card – he had a rich aunt who was prepared to donate the money needed. Sadley he died before the organ was completed. Ridley left a legacy to Bryson which he used to found an organ fund to replace the little antiquated organ at St Briavels, Gloucestershire, where he was organist in his retirement.Sheraton, Jean, A Country Church Organ and Robert Ernest Bryson, pp. 22–23, Gloucester Cathedral News, April 2016. He is commemorated by a plaque on the organ. The claim that the Liverpool Cathedral organ was modelled on the organ at St Briavels is clearly incorrect as the Cathedral organ was designed first. The suggestion that the design of the St Briavels organ was based on the specification for the Cathedral is also unlikely because of the vastly different scale of the two organs and their locations. However, an expert on organ design might find some similarities in specifications of the two instruments. It was after his retirement to St. Briavels in 1924 that Bryson was invited to become the President of the Rodewald Concert Society. He accepted only after Elgar had declined the honour.Liverpool Record Office, RCS archives, ref 780 RCS/1/5/3-5.Kelly, John E., Elgar's Best Friend: Alfred Rodewald of Liverpool, Carnegie Publishing Ltd, Lancaster, 2013, , p 128. Attempts to find Bryson's manuscripts have so far failed. His sister, Jessie Bryson (1862–1954), is known to have been collecting them together after his death,Musical Times, December 1942 so it seems likely that she deposited them somewhere for safe custody. ==Compositions== Operas *Opera The Leper's Flute (Goodwin & Tab, 1925) Orchestral *Fantasia-Overture (1894) *Idylls of a Summer's Day (1909) *Voices, a study for orchestra (1910) *Symphony No 1 in D (Breitkopf & Härtel,Currently available from mph 1909) *Symphony No 2 in C (1928) *Vaila, fantasy for string orchestra (Breitkopf & Härtel, 1909) Cantatas and Oratorios *The Stranger for Baritone, chorus & small orchestra (Stainer & Bell, 1917) *The Field of Boliauns for tenor and orchestra (1937) Songs *A Last Harvest, a song cycle for voice and orchestra *Nae sae bad as it micht hae been for one or two baritones (Larway, 1927) *So, the Year's done with (Oxford University Press, 1927) *A song of long ago (Weekes & Co, 1890) *The Unfading Garden (1926) *What the People Tell Old Büsen (Stainer & Bell, 1911) Part Songs *Drum-taps, seven part songs for chorus with side-drum (J Curwen & Sons, 1918) *Grey, Canzonetta for female voices (Stainer & Bell, 1914) *Simple as a Daisy for male voices (Curwen, 1930) *Six Silly Songs for sensible children, (with Ernest Austin), (J.

He used his wealth as a patron of the arts, becoming one of the leading collectors of contemporary British art. Elhanan Bicknell ==Early life== Elhanan Bicknell was born 21 December 1788, in Blackman Street, London, the son of William Bicknell, serge manufacturer, and Elizabeth Bicknell, née Randall, of Sevenoaks, Kent. His father had attended John Wesley's school at Kingswood, Bristol, and entertained Wesley in Blackman Street when he came to preach at Snow's Fields in Southwark. Another minister who was a family friend was Elhanan Winchester, author of Universal Restoration; after whom the son was named. William Bicknell bought the copyright of this work in the year of his son Elhanan's birth, and on finding that he had made money on the deal, gave it back to the author in 1789. Elhanan Bicknell was educated by his father, who, having established a school at Ponder's End in 1789, when Elhanan was an infant, removed it to Tooting Common in 1804; and there among Elhanan's schoolfellows, was Thomas Wilde, afterwards Lord Chancellor Truro. In 1808 Bicknell was sent to Caus, near Shrewsbury, to learn farming; but at the end of a year this project was abandoned. ==In business== Sperm whale with whalers, 1839 illustration Bicknell returned to London late in 1808 and soon after he joined a business run by his uncle, John Walter Langton (1746-1822). Langton had established himself as a tallow chandler at Newington Butts , about a mile south of London Bridge, by 1788.London Gazette, 23 December 1788, Issue No.13054, p. P.638. Bicknell became a partner in the business about 1809 and the following year he married his cousin, Langton's daughter Hannah.Selby Whittingham, “Bicknell, Elhanan (1788-1861) art patron and businessman,” Oxford Dictionary of National Biography She was the first of his four wives with whom he had a total of thirteen children. The business partnership was also productive and saw the firm become the leading oil merchants and spermaceti refiners in London by 1835. Bicknell was also part-owner of a number of South Sea whaling ships. There were setbacks along the way. In 1820 a major fire broke out in the boiling works and destroyed much of the building, causing £2,000 in damages.The Gentleman's Magazine and Historical Chronicle, from July to December 1820 p.176. A severe thunderstorm in 1846 produced large hailstones that smashed the windows in the buildings in the compound. It was reported in the press, \\"the extensive premises of Langton and Bicknell have scarcely a pane left.\\"Glasgow Herald, 7 August 1842. The business was located opposite St Mary's Church near Elephant and Castle. A friend and close business associate there at Newington Butts was fellow oil merchant and shipowner, Thomas Sturge. About 1835 Bicknell anticipated agitation for the repeal of the navigation laws would injure his business interests, yet he magnanimously supported the movement, together with the abolition of all protection; and when the crippling of his undertakings and his income came, he accepted it. Langton & Bicknell, as a business, continued to operate till 1907, long after the death of the original partners.Valerie Lester, Marvels: the life of Clarence Bicknell, botanist, archaeologist, artist, Matador, Knibworth Beauchamp, 2018, p.188. ==Collector== Eve at the Fountain by Edward Hodges Baily, was displayed with Elhanan Bicknell's collection Bicknell occupied a large house at Herne Hill, Surrey, from 1819. In 1828 he began what became a major collection of pictures by contemporary or recent British artists. By 1850, he had collected some of the works of Thomas Gainsborough, J. M. W. Turner and numerous others including David Roberts, Edwin Landseer (such as Doubtful Crumbs), George Clarkson Stanfield, Thomas Webster, William Collins, William Etty and Augustus Wall Callcott.Dianne Sachko Macleod, “Art collecting and Victorian middle- class taste,” Art History, 10 (3) September 1987, pp.336-7 He became personally acquainted with most of the artists, entertained them in his home and paid them well. The house did not have a Long gallery, so Bicknell placed these works, with pieces of sculpture such as Edward Hodges Baily's Eve at the Fountain, throughout the rooms, and opened his house to art connoisseurs. Gustav Friedrich Waagen published a description and listing by room in his Treasures of Art in Great Britain. A visitor who came to see the collection in 1857 said, \\"It could not have been formed in better taste.\\"”Visits to private galleries of the British School - The collection of Elhanan Bicknell, Esq., at Herne Hill,” The Art-Journal, 1857, Vol III, p.10. This may have been John Ruskin who lived nearby and made regular visits to see the paintings of, \\"my always kind neighbour.\\"John Ruskin & Sir Edward Tyas Cook, Turner at the National Gallery and in Mr Ruskin’s Collection, G. Allan, London, 1903, p.390. Published comments by Ruskin and other art experts made Bicknell's collection well known and may have contributed the high prices it fetched when broken up after his death. A contemporary writing about the high prices paid for fine art in the 1860s said, \\"the fancy prices quoted are nearly all for pictures from famous collections; and some for the Bicknell pictures, for example, would almost suggest that as much was due to the name of the collector as the merit of the picture.\\"\\"Art in the auction room - Prices,\\" London Society, An illustrated magazine of light and amusing literature for the hours of relaxation, Vol IX, London, 1866, p.258. Bicknell bought many of Turner's finest works before Ruskin's advocacy brought the artist to public prominence. In 1841 he paid Turner £250 for a painting of gondolas in Venice. That painting, Guidecca, La Donna Della Salute and San Giorgio (1840), changed hands in 2006 for US$35.8 million, setting a new record for a British work of art sold at auction.The Times, 7 April 2006, p.25. ==Unitarianism== In politics and in theology Bicknell was an advanced liberal. He supported Unitarianism, was a principal contributor to the building of the Unitarian chapel at Brixton, and gave to the British and Foreign Unitarian Association. (The chapel on Effra Road was destroyed in the Blitz in 1941.) He was a member of the committee for the erection of, and a substantial donor to, the 1820s campaign for South Place Unitarian Chapel under William Johnson Fox, which evolved into today's Conway Hall Ethical Society. He was a member of the Worshipful Company of Vintners, one of the oldest Livery Companies in London, serving at various times as Warden and Master. ==Later life== One of his minor business ventures was a partnership with London print dealer Joseph Hogarth. The association began in the 1830s and continued into the early 1850s. During that time Hogarth transitioned from a print retailer to a publisher of high- quality art prints. His business acumen and reputation saw Bicknell being invited to become a partner in the major engineering firm Maudslay; but he turned down the offer. In 1859 his health began to fail, and he retired from business. He passed the rest of his time at Herne Hill, where he died 27 November 1861, aged 72. He was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. ==Legacy== Bicknell's will was proved under £350,000. Among the executors were two of his sons, Henry Sandford and Percy. While Bicknell had wanted to leave his collection to the nation, the family decided otherwise. His pictures, which numbered 122 at his death, were sold at Christie's auction rooms, realising a sum of nearly £80,000. Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford bought about one-third for his own gallery. ==Family== The six children of Elhanan Bicknell Esq, 1842 group portrait by Stephen Poyntz Denning In 1829 Bicknell married Lucinda Browne, a sister of Hablot Knight Browne (aka Phiz, the illustrator of Charles Dickens). He left a large family by his various marriages, and some of his sons (one of whom married the only child of David Roberts, R.A.), in succeeding to his fortune, made names for themselves in the arts, archaeology, botany, travel, and reform. *Elhanan Bicknell, the eldest son, died in 1860 at age 46. *Herman Bicknell (1830–1875), orientalist, was the third son.s:Bicknell, Herman (DNB00) *Algernon Sidney Bicknell (1832-1911) soldier, traveller and writer.“The memoirs of Algernon Sydney Bicknell at The Keep (East Sussex archives)” *Clarence Bicknell (1842-1918), vicar, botanist, archaeologist and author. *Henry Sanford BicknellBritish Library manuscript collection catalogue entry (1818-1880) *Mrs Ada Berry (née Bicknell) (1831-1911)Marcus Bicknell, “Margaret and Edward Berry” *Edgar Bicknell (1834-1886) *Percy Bicknell (1836-1911) *Matilda Bicknell (1838-1858) *Lucinda Constance Bicknell (1840-1902) ==NotesExternal links== ;Attribution Category:1788 births Category:1861 deaths Category:English businesspeople Category:English art patrons Category:English art collectors Category:British people in whaling Category:Companies based in the London Borough of Southwark Category:Whaling firms ","title":"Elhanan Bicknell"},{"id":"56112905","text":"The 2017–18 Elon Phoenix women's basketball team represents Elon University during the 2017–18 NCAA Division I women's basketball season.

The film features Deepak, Nicole and Karthika Mathew in lead roles, with Ganja Karuppu, Sudheer Sukumaran, Rajesh, Ponvannan, Sriman and Anand playing supporting roles. The film, produced by K. S. Rajan and R. S. Valsala Rajan, had musical score by Srikanth Deva and was released on 31 July 2009. ==Plot== The film begins with Vaithi (Deepak) running to save his elder brother Moorthy (Sriman) from goons. Upon his arrival, Moorthy is seriously wounded and covered with blood. Vaithi lived with his father Arunachalam (Rajesh), a retired teacher, his mother and his brother Moorthy. Moorthy was a successful CPWD engineer and the pride of Arunachalam while Vaithi was a kind-hearted auto-driver and was hated by Arunachalam. Moorthy, being an incorruptible engineer, attracted the anger of Ratnavel (Sudheer Sukumaran) and Rajadurai (Ponvannan) who were constantly trying to bribe him to get his approval for a project. In the meantime, Vaithi and Anandhi (Nicole), sister of Ratnavel and Rajadurai, fell in love with each other. The circumstances forced Moorthy to get married with Thenmozhi (Mythili) but he didn't like her. Back to the present, Moorthy dies in the arms of Vaithi but before dying he pronounces the name Kadambari. Vaithi suspects Ratnavel and Rajadurai for killing his brother. A few days later, a woman (Karthika Mathew) with a baby introduces to Vaithi as Kadambari and reveals that she was Moorthy's secret wife. By pity, Vaithi accommodates them in Moorthy's outhouse. The whole village talks ill about Kadambari and Vaithi's relationship, but Vaithi keeps the secret and takes the insults of the village. Vaithi is now disowned by his father Arunachalam and his girlfriend has broken up with him. One day, Periyasamy (Ganja Karuppu) who witnessed his brother's murder reveals that the killer was Kadambari's brother Boopathy (Anand), a criminal.

Marketed as the \\"world’s first multi-playhead piano roll,\\"\\"Fugue Machine\\". Alexandernaut Official Website. Retrieved December 21, 2017. Fugue Machine allows the user to sequence a melody and have up to three variations of it play all at the same time. The application was originally released on October 8, 2015 for iOS, and quickly garnered notability for its intuitive methods of making complex pieces and for being the first app to be developed from the \\"Cultural Incubator\\" program by the Gray Area Foundation for the Arts. ==Summary== Fugue Machine is a \\"multi-playhead\\" sequencer where the user creates a melody sequence for one playhead to perform it and up to three other \\"playheads\\" simultaneously to play it at different tempos, directions, and pitches. In programming the melody, there's \\"two-finger panning,\\" which allows the user to change the position of multiple notes, and \\"three-finger panning\\" which alters the velocity and length of MIDI notes.\\"Details Fugue Machine\\". Alexandernaut Official Website. Retrieved December 22, 2017. The melody can last for up to eight measures. There are seven parameters that control the performance of the playheads: \\"style,\\" which determines the direction of the playhead including forward, reverse, forward- reverse, and reverse-forward, tempo, which determines how fast or slow the playhead moves in relation to the \\"master tempo,\\" \\"start,\\" which determines when a playhead begins moving, \\"invert switch,\\" which inverts the pitches of the notes from the melody, \\"octave,\\" which changes the pitch of the entire melody by whole octaves, \\"pitch,\\" which changes the pitch of the melody by single notes, and \\"velocity,\\" how loud the playhead performs the notes. Fugue Machine allows for the easy creation of polyrhythmic music by having the \\"tempo\\" parameters be in multiplied or divided numbers, such as a playhead being performed eight times slower than the \\"master tempo\\" when set at ÷8. The app also has a \\"shift slider\\" that moves the pitches of all the playheads up and down. Up to 128 pieces can be saved in Fugue Machine. ==Development== Randon studied the works of Johann Sebastian Bach, a composer who popularized the fugue compositional technique, while in college. He became obsessed with how fugue involved using mathematical operations, something that would later become a major part of his compositions.Shamoon, Evan (October 14, 2015). \\"Interview: Fugue Machine's Alexandernaut\\". XLR8R. Retrieved December 21, 2017. In applying math in his works, Randon, composing in a digital audio workstation, would have to copy and paste a melody he sequenced and manually program variations of it in different pitches, speeds, and directions, which took a very long time to do. This give Randon the idea of developing a machine that could compose variations of a single theme automatically. He explained, \\"I was a main-track engineering student, so the idea of combining something I was good at (math) to something I wanted to be good at (music), seemed obvious.\\" Randon spent years programming multiple drafts of Fugue Machine, but failed due to problems of coming up with a proper user interface. Randon then decided, out of desperation, to focus on the back end of the program first: \\"I quickly realized that the most eloquent technical design was to have one music sequence being read multiple times. Then it hit me: That's a piano roll with multiple playheads! I seriously jumped up and down, alone in my music studio, for far too long.\\" This became the basis for making the final product of Fugue Machines, which took eight months to program. Randon made Fugue Machine as part of a program fostered by the Gray Area Foundation for the Arts named \\"Cultural Incubator\\", where participants are committed to develop an app that combines elements of art and technology to impact society. Lamb, Leah (October 8, 2015). \\"Compose Like Bach (with Help from This App)\\". The Creators Project. Vice Media. Retrieved December 22, 2017. Fugue Machine became the first application to be produced as part of Cultural Incubator. The most complicated part of programming the application was coding the \\"Note On\\" messages it sends to external synthesizers when one note is being played simultaneously by more than one playhead. Randon had to do this since many external synthesizers vary in terms of how they handle more than one message performing the same note at the same time: some make a second voice perform the second message or replace the first one, and some even crash. ==Reception and release== On October 8, 2015, Alexandernaut released Fugue Machine for iOSCutler, Kim-Mai (October 8, 2015). \\"The Mission District’s Gray Area Incubates Fugue Machine, A Multi- Playhead Sequencer\\".

He received Chile's National Prize for Plastic Arts in 1999. ==Biography== Balmes in his studio in Santiago, 2013 Balmes in his studio with Spanish painter Javier de Villota, 2013 José Balmes was born in 1927 in the town of Montesquiu in Catalonia, where he spent his childhood until the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936. Three years later, after the Nationalist victory, Balmes with his family was forced to leave Spain due to the militancy of his father, Damià Balmes, who was mayor of the town for the Republican Left of Catalonia. He traveled to Chile on the SS Winnipeg, after the aid of that country's government to the Spanish Republicans. In what would become his new homeland, Balmes completed secondary education at the , and in 1943 he entered the School of Fine Arts of the University of Chile. There he had Pablo Burchard and Camilo Mori as teachers. In 1947 he obtained Chilean nationality. At the university, he interacted with other artists, including future National Arts Prize winner Gracia Barrios, whom he would marry in 1952. The couple had a daughter, Concepción Balmes, who is also a painter. Balmes would continue to be linked to the University of Chile as an academic (1950–1973) and dean of the Faculty of Arts (1972–1973). Among his disciples is , who was his student of painting, as well as Francisco Brugnoli, , , and Eugenio Téllez. Along with Gracia Barrios and other artists, he would form the informalist group Signo, with whom he would present works in Barcelona, Madrid, and Paris. Of known communist militancy, and having been for several periods a member of the Communist Party's Central Committee, a large part of Balmes' career was linked to political life, actively supporting the Popular Unity government led by Salvador Allende, and having to leave for exile in France after the 1973 coup d'état. There he continued developing his artistic career as a professor at Pantheon-Sorbonne University. In 1986, Balmes returned to Chile, after which he received multiple awards, such as the 1999 National Prize for Plastic Arts and the 2002 Altazor. In 2012 the Chilean filmmaker Pablo Trujillo Novoa shot a documentary about the life of the artist entitled Balmes: El doble exilio de la pintura (Balmes: Painting's Double Exile). José Balmes died on 28 August 2016 at the , where he had been hospitalized for pneumonia since the beginning of that month. ==Awards== * Prize of Honor at the Salon of Alumni of the School of Fine Arts (1946) * Second Honorific Prize for foreigners of the Official Salon of Santiago (1948) * First Prize of the Official Salon, National Museum of Fine Arts, Santiago (1951) * Prize of Honor of the Official Salon of Santiago (1958) * Award of the 2nd Biennale of Mexico (1960) * Honorable Mention at the 2nd Paris Biennale dedicated to young artists (1961) * First Prize, Mention in Painting, CRAV contest of Valparaíso (1963) * Special Award, Esso contest (1964) * First Prize, Mention in Drawing, American Art Biennale of Cali, Colombia (1971) * First Prize for Engraving, International Intergrafik Exposition of Berlín, Germany (1977) * Critical Award, Santiago (1984) * First Prize of the Ibero- American Biennale for art on paper in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1986) * Named Professor Emeritus of the Faculty of Architecture and Fine Arts of the Catholic University of Chile (1993) * Professor Emeritus of the University of Chile (1996) * Gabriela Mistral Order of Teaching and Merit granted by the government of Chile (1997) * Michoacán Award, Mention in Painting, granted by the National Culture Commission of the Communist Party of Chile (1997) * National Prize for Plastic Arts, Santiago, Chile (1999) * Altazor Award, Santiago, Chile (2002) ==References== Category:1927 births Category:2016 deaths Category:20th-century Chilean painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:Art Informel and Tachisme painters Category:Chilean communists Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Exiles of the Spanish Civil War Category:Naturalized citizens of Chile Category:University of Chile alumni Category:University of Chile faculty Category:Chilean male painters ","title":"José Balmes"},{"id":"56113124","text":"Aburia is a genus of bugs in the family Fulgoridae. == References == Category:Auchenorrhyncha genera Category:Poiocerinae ","title":"Aburia"},{"id":"56113127","text":"A Regional Planning Organization is a government body that guides the development of public and private resources in a manner that ensures public safety, well being and livability.

In autumn he was sent to race in the United States where he was fatally injured in the Hollywood Derby in November. ==Background== Fatherland was a bay colt bred at the Ballydoyle Stud in County Tipperary and trained by stud's founder and owner Vincent O'Brien. During his racing career Fatherland carried the colours of O'Brien's wife, the writer and photographer Jacqueline O'Brien. He was ridden in all but one of his European starts by Lester Piggott. He was from the fifth crop of foals sired by Sadler's Wells, who won the Irish 2000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes in 1984 went on to be the Champion sire on fourteen occasions. Fatherland's dam Lisadell was a Kentucky-bred mare who was trained by O'Brien in Ireland and won the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot in 1974. She was a full-sister to both Thatch and to Special, whose descendants include Sadler's Wells and Nureyev. Lisadell herself was the female-line ancestor of El Condor Pasa, Gossamer and Bachelor Duke. ==Racing career== 1992: two-year-old season On his first appearance Fatherland started 5/4 favourite for a maiden race over seven furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourseon 25 July in which he was ridden and Pat Gilson he won by a length from the Jim Bolger Scribe. Piggott took over the ride on 15 August when the colt was stepped up in class for the Listed Tyros Stakes over the same distance at the Curragh. Starting the 4/6 favourite he came home one and a half lengths clear of Frenchpark, a colt who went on to win the Beresford Stakes later that year. Two weeks later, over the same course and distance, he took the Group 3 Futurity Stakes at odds of 4/7, beating the British challenger Newton's Law by one and a half lengths. At the Curragh on 19 September Fatherland was made the 4/5 favourite for the Group 1 National Stakes. The best fancied of his opponents was the British challenger Maroof whilst the other three runners were Ivory Frontier (winner of the Railway Stakes), Khoraz (from the John Oxx stable) and the 25/1 outsider Rondelli. Piggott restrained the colt at the rear of the field as Maroof set the pace, before making progress in the last quarter mile. He caught Maroof 50 yards from the finish and won by half a length. On his last run of 1992 Fatherland was sent to England for the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket in October. He was made the 5/1 second choice in an eleven-runner field, but never looked likely to win and finished fifth behind the French- trained Zafonic. 1993: three-year-old season Fatherland began his second season by finishing second to Massyar on the Leopardstown 2,000 Guineas Trial on 17 April, conceding seven pounds to the winner. In the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh on 15 May he started at odds of 11/2 in an eleven-runners field and produced what was probably his best performance. After being restrained towards the rear by Piggott he produced a strong late but went down by a head to the British-trained favourite Barathea. When moved up in distance for the 1993 Epsom Derby over one and a half miles on 2 June he was made the 8/1 third choice in the betting but made no impact in the race, coming home ninth of the sixteen runners, more than twenty lengths behind the winner Commander in Chief. The colt was equipped with blinkers when he was sent to France in July and finished fourth to Revelation in the Prix Eugène Adam over 2000 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse. After the Prix Eugène Adam, Fatherland was sent to race in California where he entered the ownership of Robert B. Lewis and joined the training stable of Gary F. Jones. On his American debut he was ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye and started favourite for the Grade II Del Mar Derby on 6 September. He was last of the twelve runners for most of the way before producing a strong late run to finish fifth, beaten just over two lengths by the winner Guide. Adalberto Lopez took the ride when Fatherland was moved up to Grade I class for the Hollywood Derby on 20 November. After running half a mile the colt was towards the rear of the field when he broke down injured and was pulled up by his jockey. A veterinary examination revealed a \\"shattered\\" pastern and he was immediately euthanised. ==Pedigree== *Fatherland was inbred 2 × 4 to Forli and Thong, meaning that these horses appear in both the second and fourth generations of his pedigree. ==References== Category:1990 racehorse births Category:1993 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Thoroughbred family 5-h ","title":"Fatherland (horse)"},{"id":"56113187","text":"Grupo Desportivo e Recreativo Crisgunza, is an Angolan semi-professional basketball team.

Construction in housing industry started to improve since the late 1990s, as the result of the Presidential decree (1997), which eliminated state monopoly of construction sector. == Types of housing == Two types of residence are predominant in Azerbaijan: the single-family detached home and multi-family residential. Additional kinds of housing include dormitories, communal apartments, and summerhouses. Housing stock of Azerbaijan is divided into 2 groups as existing and recently built. Existing houses are also classified by the period of their construction: * Housing properties built prior 1920s – they are situated mostly in the historical parts of cities. This type of estates requires reconstruction and renovation in order to meet present-day housing standards; * Housing properties constructed before World War 2 – in 1920-1940 – they are situated mostly in rural areas. Kitchens and bathrooms of this type of houses built in urban areas are shared. * Housing properties built after World War 2 – in the 1960s construction of prefabricated houses increased and new districts were planned to be filled with this type of houses. * Housing properties built after gaining independence. Due to social-economic, political situation of the country, construction of houses decreased in 1990s. During this period, cottage-type private properties were built mostly. Building multifamily complexes in the larger cities became more widespread after 2000. == Housing construction == Multi-family apartments in Baku Construction sector of the country improved significantly while the economy of the country was developing in early 2000s. Initially, construction process was going on rapidly in city centers and touristic areas throughout the country. Housing sector became one of the main parts in the economic development of Azerbaijan. Rising demand for modern new housing required development of multi-story apartment buildings. Consequently, many private companies constructing apartment buildings were formed and became the main supplier of commercial buildings. New projects for residential and non-residential buildings were increasing. In 2003, residential construction enjoyed a growth from 803,000 square meters in 2002 to 1339 million square meters in new house construction. The average figure for 2003-2008 was 1 million square meters. == Government agencies == Regulations and standards on construction required to be modified after Azerbaijan regained its independence, as previously they were applied throughout USSR without decently customized to local conditions. Therefore, several actions were taken to address this issue. Ministry of Housing and Communal Services of the Republic of Azerbaijan managed housing issues before 1993. Then, the Ministry was transformed into Committee of Housing and Communal Services under the Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan in May 1993. The Committee was eliminated and its functions was transferred to the State Committee for Construction and Architecture in 2001. It was abolished in 2006 and State Committee for City Building and Architecture was established instead of the previous agency in February 2006. In addition, State Agency of Control on Security in Construction and the Ministry of Emergency Situations was established on December 29, 2006. The State Committee on Property Issues of the Republic of Azerbaijan was established according to the Decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan on May 19, 2009. The Committee is the central executive organ exercising implementation state policy and regulation on real estate management and its privatization, as well as is responsible for involving investments, controlling use and protection of lands, and conducting state registration and cadaster of real estate in Azerbaijan. leftthumb405x405pxHousing conditions of the population, Housing Fund Data extracted from [https://www.stat.gov.az/source/healthcare/?lang=en www.stat.gov.az] == Privatization == thumb394x394pxHousing conditions of the population, Privatization of housing fund Extracted [https://www.stat.gov.az/source/healthcare/?lang=en www.stat.gov.az] In order to promote private ownership, the Government of Azerbaijan adopted the Law on Privatization of the Apartment Stock in 1993, The State Program of Privatization in the Republic of Azerbaijan for 1995–1998, and The Second State Program on Privatization of State Property in the Republic of Azerbaijan in 2000. Privatization rate has increased to 85% of the entire housing stock until 2010. In comparison with early 1990s, privatization process is steady now. This law simplified the privatization process of flats and canceled the requirement of paying nominal value of the house for the privatization. == Public housing == Social policy of the Government used to focus mainly on housing problems of certain vulnerable groups, as refugees, IDPs, the war disabled or injured. There are several government agencies that are dealing with this issue, like State Committee on Affairs of Refugees and IDPs, The Ministry of Social Protection, Mortgage Fund. State Committee on Affairs of Refugees and IDPs are handling housing issues of specific susceptible groups, especially IDPs, whose number was 603251 (120650 families) in 2009. Most of IDPs live in roughly 360 collective centers of Baku and Sumgayit. These collective centers are generally overcrowded and does not meet the need of people living there, as there are problems with kitchen, individual bathrooms. That is why; the Government have started to establish new settlements for IDPs since 2000. More than 17000 IDP families were provided with houses in 61 newly constructed settlements between 2004 and 2008. People injured during the conflict with Armenia, supported by the government have also been provided either with flats in multi-family residential buildings or with separate cottage-type houses. Moreover, the Government promotes teaching in rural areas in order to fill the gap of schoolteachers in those areas. Small houses have been constructing as part of specific programs for teachers. There is also an ongoing process to support young families who need better living conditions. In order to cover this issue, a specific section entitled “The improvement of living conditions for young families” was created in State Program in the Sector of Demography and Development of Population approved by the President of Azerbaijan in 2004. According to this program, responsible institutions were defined in order to create a system of discounted loans to make better the living conditions of young families in need. Mortgage Fund under National Bank of Azerbaijan formed by the decree of the President, to develop living condition of population, create more effective housing finance mechanism, started to handle the allocation process of loans since 2005. The Fund offers mortgages as low as 4% interest to specific groups.  Company housing  A few Azerbaijani companies maintain their own apartment building for employees in need. For instance, SOCAR established \\"Neftchi\\" Housing Construction Cooperative in 2010 in order to improve housing conditions of its employees. Membership in this Cooperative is carried out based on the applications of the employees who have registered in SOCAR housing system. SOCAR reimburses some part of the cost of the house, and the rest is paid by the employee to the Cooperative.“Neftchi” Cooperative is also constructing new residential buildings, as one of the buildings was put into operation in 2016 in Khatai district of Baku. Ministry of Communication and Information Technologies, and Azerbaijan Railways CJSC have also provided their employees with houses. == Affordable housing == The State Agency for Housing Construction under the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan was established according to the Decree No. 858 on 11 April 2016 with the purpose to meet requirements of citizens in housing, improve their living conditions, and build multi-family residential. Besides, “MIDA” LLC has been established under State Agency for Housing Construction in order to promote the construction of multistoried residential buildings in the country and to ensure that the citizens are enjoying subsidized apartment sales, and to effectively use the funds allocated for the construction of multistoried residential buildings.  Projects  * Yasamal Residential Complex – the first project of the State Agency for Housing Construction is planned to build 29 multifamily apartments with 1843 flats on an area of 11.6 ha in Yasamal district of Baku. The construction process of the first building in the complex was started in December 2016 and is planned to be commissioned in summer 2018. * Hovsan Residential Complex – on February 2017, an area of 20 ha in Surakhani region of Baku was allocated for constructing multifamily apartments based on the decree of Cabinet of Ministers. the construction process of the first building inn this complex started on 24 December 2017. The residential complex with 2962 apartments was inaugurated on March 24, 2020 by the President and Vice- President of Azerbaijan. thumb442x442pxHousing conditions of the population, Improvement of the housing fund Data extracted from [https://www.stat.gov.az/source/healthcare/?lang=en www.stat.gov.az] == Utilities == Local governments are responsible for providing utilities in buildings. Suppliers of electricity, gas and sanitation are state companies, while waste management is provided by either public or private companies. In order to improve the quality of utilities, Asian Development Bank, as well as the World Bank was involved in supplying water and sanitation services. == See also == State Property Issues Committee (Azerbaijan) == References == Category:Azerbaijani society Category:Economy of Azerbaijan Category:Buildings and structures in Azerbaijan ","title":"Housing in Azerbaijan"},{"id":"56113230","text":"Mario Miglietta (25 January 1925 – 17 January 1996) was an Italian Roman Catholic archbishop. He served as the Bishop of Nusco, as Archbishop of Conza- Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi-Bisaccia, and then as Archbishop-Bishop of Ugento- Santa Maria di Leuca. == Biography == Miglietta was born on 25 January 1925 in Leverano, a comune in Apulia, southern Italy. His father was from the town of Trepuzzi, on the Salento peninsula, where Mario Miglietta spent his holidays. Giuseppe Miglietta, the uncle of Mario and his father's brother, was the archpriest of Leverano and was an influence on Mario's decision to enter the priesthood. As a boy, he entered the minor diocesan seminary and eventually completed his theological studies.  Priestly ministry  Miglietta was ordained a priest Archbishop Francesco De Filippis and incardinated in the Archdiocese of Brindisi-Ostuni on 10 August 1947. He was named to the position of vice-rector of the Pius XI Pontifical Regional Seminary of Puglia in Molfetta in 1947. On 25 October 1949, he was made prefect of philosophical studies and a professor of religion in the seminary. From 1951 to 1952, he lived in Rome to study at the Pontifical Lateran University, where he earned a degree in dogmatic theology. In October 1953, he was made vice-rector of theological studies of the Puglia seminary and a professor homiletics.

He was known to repeat \\"If they knock on the walls of the Molfetta seminary, the walls will reply 'Don Mario!'.\\"  Episcopal ministry  In 1978, Miglietta was appointed Bishop of Nusco. He was consecrated a bishop in the Molfetta Cathedral on 14 January 1979 by Cardinal Corrado Ursi with Cardinal Giuseppe Caprio and Bishop Aldo Garzia as co-consecrators. He held this position until 1981. Miglietta would recount that on the day he was to be appointed Archbishop of Conza-Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi-Bisaccia, Pope Paul VI died. Therefore, his appointment had to be postponed until the election of Pope John Paul I, who was then unable to sign the appointment due to his sudden death. Finally, on 18 November 1978, Pope John Paul II appointed him to the archbishopric. Shortly after being made archbishop, Miglietta suffered a heart attack, which was followed by the devastating Irpinia earthquake of 1980. His time as archbishop involved ministering to the victims of the earthquake. Cardinal Sebastiano Baggio, then Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, proposed that he be transferred to the Diocese of Ugento-Santa Maria di Leuca. He was eventually appointed Archbishop-Bishop of Ugento-Santa Maria di Leuca in 1981 (archbishop being conferred as a personal title), a position he held until 14 November 1992 when he resigned for health reasons. While Archbishop-Bishop of Ugento-Santa Maria di Leuca, one of the priests from his diocese, Fr. Antonio Bello, was appointed Bishop of Molfetta-Ruvo-Giovinazzo-Terlizzi. Miglietta died on 17 January 1996 after an emergency hospitalization in the Regina Apostolorum hospital in Albano Laziale. It was his desire to be buried in the Basilica of Santa Maria di Leuca. After his funeral mass was celebrated in Ugento on 19 January, he was buried in a cemetery in Levarano. His body remained there for 13 years until Vito De Grisantis, the Bishop of Ugento-Santa Maria di Leuca, presided over the rite of transfer of the body and had it exhumed and buried beneath the altar of St. Francis of Paola in the Basilica of Leuca, in accordance with Miglietta's wishes. == References  External links == * Profile on Catholic-Hierarchy.org * Archdiocese of Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi- Conza-Nusco-Bisaccia * Diocese of Ugento-Santa Maria di Leuca Category:20th- century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:20th-century Italian people Category:Roman Catholic archbishops in Italy Category:1925 births Category:1996 deaths Category:People from the Province of Lecce Category:Bishops appointed by Pope John Paul II Category:Pontifical Lateran University alumni Category:Archbishops of Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi-Conza- Nusco-Bisaccia ","title":"Mario Miglietta"},{"id":"56113258","text":"Prism Genesis is an extended play by American electronic and vaporwave artist Vektroid under the alias Fuji Grid TV released on August 2, 2011.

He is known for research on the relationships between the structure and mechanical properties of polymers and composites. A particular focus of his work has been the study of how materials such as carbon fibres and spider silk deform at the molecular level. He has also studied carbon- fibre composites, carbon nanotubes and the deformation of graphene — a one- atom thick sheet of carbon. In his research, Young made a novel use of Raman spectroscopy. In this technique, laser light is shone onto a material and the wavelength and intensity of the resulting scattered light is measured and analysed. The changes in the light relate to changes in bond length between the atoms of the molecules in the material when the material is deformed.

It was the tenth event under the Sacrifice chronology. Unlike the previous events, this event was not included on pay- per-view (PPV) and instead, was featured as a special edition of TNA's weekly broadcast of Impact Wrestling on Pop TV. Five matches were contested at the event. The main event was a no disqualification match between Ethan Carter III and Mike Bennett, which Bennett won. In other prominent matches on the undercard, Bram defeated Eric Young in a falls count anywhere match to win the King of the Mountain Championship and Decay (Crazzy Steve and Abyss) defeated Beer Money, Inc. (Bobby Roode and James Storm) to win the World Tag Team Championship while Drew Galloway retained the World Heavyweight Championship against Tyrus. The event notably featured the last matches of longtime TNA veterans Bobby Roode and Eric Young for the promotion who lost their respective titles at the event and also marked the first loss of Ethan Carter III, thus marking the end of his undefeated streak in TNA. ==Storylines== Eric Young wrestled his last match in TNA at Sacrifice and was the defending King of the Mountain Champion heading into the event. On the January 26 episode of Impact Wrestling, Bram formed an alliance with Eric Young. On the April 12 episode of Impact Wrestling, Bram and Young failed to win the World Tag Team Championship from Beer Money, Inc. in a four-way match also involving The BroMans and Decay after Young accidentally hit Bram. The following week, on Impact Wrestling, Young insulted the fans and vowed to leave TNA with his King of the Mountain Championship and ordered Bram to leave with him but Bram refused and said that he would no longer be Young's lackey and the title belt would look better around Bram's waist, which led to Young attacking him and ending their alliance, which set up a match between Bram and Young for the King of the Mountain Championship at Sacrifice. Drew Galloway was the defending TNA World Heavyweight Champion heading into Sacrifice. On the March 15 episode of Impact Wrestling, Mike Bennett attacked Ethan Carter III during his three-way match against Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy for the World Heavyweight Championship, thus costing EC3, the title. The following week, on Impact Wrestling, EC3 eliminated Bennett from a gauntlet match to determine the #1 contender for the title and then Bennett interfered, causing EC3's elimination.> Bennett would wrestle EC3 on numerous occasions over the following weeks, which set up a no disqualification match between the two at Sacrifice. On the March 15 episode of Impact Wrestling, Decay attacked The Wolves member Eddie Edwards, on which the World Tag Team Champions Beer Money, Inc. confronted Decay. This led to several matches between the two teams over the following weeks. On the April 19 episode of Impact Wrestling, Decay member Rosemary attacked Gail Kim during a ladder match and then kidnapped her and held her hostage throughout the show before bringing her to the ring where Abyss threatened to Beer Money that Rosemary would snap Gail's neck if Beer Money did not give Abyss and Crazzy Steve, a title shot at the World Tag Team Championship and Decay demanded a Valley of Shadows match for the title at Sacrifice, which Beer Money accepted. On the April 5 episode of Impact Wrestling, Tyrus confronted Drew Galloway and hinted that he wanted a shot at Galloway's World Heavyweight Championship, just like Galloway cashed in his Feast or Fired briefcase for a title shot and Tyrus had won the Bound for Gold at the 2015 Bound for Glory, so he would be cashing in the title as well. On the April 12 episode of Impact Wrestling, Tyrus and Matt Hardy defeated Galloway and Jeff Hardy in a tag team match, during which Galloway and Tyrus brawled with each other and then Galloway was injured by Bobby Lashley after the match. On the April 19 episode of Impact Wrestling, Tyrus declared his intention to cash in his Bound for Gold opportunity against Galloway, which Galloway accepted for next week, when he would be perfectly fine to wrestle and then Tyrus attacked McIntyre, setting up their title match for the World Heavyweight Championship at Sacrifice. ==Event== Preliminary matches Bobby Roode wrestled his last TNA match at Sacrifice as one half of the defending World Tag Team Champions. The event kicked off with Tyrus demanding a title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship against Drew Galloway, who accepted the challenge to begin the match. Tyrus dominated much of the match by taking advantage of Galloway's rib injury but Galloway managed to hit a superplex and a Future Shock to retain the title. This was followed by the new Knockouts Commissioner Maria Kanellis cutting a promo about rebuilding the Knockouts division but was interrupted by Gail Kim and Kanellis then put Kim in a match against Rosemary. An interference by Crazzy Steve and a distraction by Kanellis allowed Rosemary to hit a fireman's carry facebuster to Kim for the win. It was followed by the debut of Eli Drake's new interview segment \\"Fact of Life\\", in which he called Jeff Hardy, Drew Galloway and his guests The BroMans dummies. Later, Beer Money, Inc. (Bobby Roode and James Storm) defended the World Tag Team Championship against Decay (Abyss and Crazzy Steve) in a Valley of Shadows match. After Steve knocked Storm off the top rope, Rosemary hit a low blow to Roode and Abyss chokeslammed him onto the thumbtacks to win the title. In the penultimate match, Eric Young defended the King of the Mountain Championship against Bram in a falls count anywhere match. The two brawled throughout the arena during the match. Near the end of the match, Bram hit a low blow to Young on the apron and nailed a Brighter Side of Suffering off the apron through a table at ringside to win the title. The match was followed by a segment, in which Jeff Hardy discussed the incidents of his \\"I Quit\\" match with Matt Hardy the previous week until he was confronted by Rockstar Spud and Reby Sky, during which Spud attacked Hardy but Hardy countered by hitting a Twist of Fate to Spud. Main event match Mike Bennett ended Ethan Carter III's undefeated streak in TNA by defeating him in the no disqualification main event of Sacrifice. The main event was a no disqualification match pitting Ethan Carter III against Mike Bennett. Near the end of the match, EC3 hit a One Percenter to Bennett but Bennett's wife Maria Kanellis interfered in the match and prevented the referee from counting the pinfall, which led to EC3 repeatedly hitting Bennett with a chair and then applied a cobra clutch on Bennett, who kicked off the corner and pinned EC3 for the win, thus ending EC3's undefeated streak in TNA by handing him his first pinfall loss. ==Reception== Sacrifice received mixed reviews from critics. Jason Powell of Pro Wrestling Dot Net said that the event \\"closed on a high note\\" and praised most of the matches while criticizing the Fact of Life segment, the Falls Count Anywhere match and the Valley of Shadows match. Larry Csonka of 411Mania rated it 6.0, considering it \\"another overall fine show from TNA, playing off of the previous week’s show well enough and changing the titles they needed to with the departures of (Bobby) Roode and (Eric) Young.\\" He criticized most of the show, with the exception of the Fact of Life segment. According to Garrett Kidney of Voices of Wrestling, the event was among the \\"long string of solid enjoyable Impacts that rarely rise above good but are pretty much never bad.\\" Graham Matthews of Next Era Wrestling criticized the inclusion of three hardcore matches into Sacrifice due to it being the theme of Hardcore Justice event but considered it \\"an entertaining edition of Impact Wrestling on the whole\\". ==Aftermath== Sacrifice marked the last appearance of both Bobby Roode and Eric Young in TNA, who left the promotion after the event. Both men would go on to join WWE as members of NXT. Young would return to TNA in 2020. Ethan Carter III demanded a rematch from Mike Bennett on the May 10 episode of Impact Wrestling, which Bennett accepted on the condition that EC3 must win three of his matches. EC3 would go on to win the matches, a steel cage match against Rockstar Spud, a last man standing match against Tyrus and a singles match against Matt Hardy by disqualification. As a result of EC3's disqualification win over Hardy, Bennett refused to give EC3 a rematch. However, on the May 31 episode of Impact Wrestling, EC3 was made in charge of the show and made a match official between Bennett and himself at Slammiversary. ==Results== {  !No. !Matches !Stipulations !Times - 1 Drew Galloway (c) defeated Tyrus Singles match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship 07:55 - 2 Rosemary defeated Gail Kim Singles match 06:08 - 3 Decay (Crazzy Steve and Abyss) (with Rosemary) defeated Beer Money, Inc.

At the summit is the Köppel viewing tower. == Name == In the Westerwald dialect Köppel is the general name for a hill or mountain, possibly related to the Alemannic word Kapf meaning a mountain or hill with a good view. It probably goes back to the original Frankish term for high points in the terrain and means \\"small head\\". == Geography ==  Location  The Köppel is located within the Nassau Nature Park. Its summit is on the boundary between the parish of Dernbach, whose village is 4 km to the northeast, and the borough of Montabaur, whose town is 5.7 km to the east. The majority of the summit region is on the Dernbach side. To the west- southwest, the terrain transitions to the hill of Alarmstange, 1.5 km away. On the north flank of the hill rises the Masselbach; on the northeast side, the Schabebornbach and Waldbach. The Biebrichsbach, a headstream of the Stadtbach which rises on the Alarmstange, flows past to the south. The headstreams of the Brexbach, the Vorderste Bach and Hinterste Bach, rise to the west- northwest and northwest of the summit.  Natural regions  The Köppel is located within the natural region major unit group of the Westerwald (no. 32), the major unit of the Lower Westerwald (324) and the subunit of the Montabaur Heights (324.1). == Conservation == The Köppel is covered by beech, mixed forest and conifers. Part of the Montabaur Heights Special Area of Conservation lies on the mountain (no. 5512-301; 28.11 km²). == Köppel viewing tower == On the summit region of the Köppel in the parish of Dernbach is the Köppel viewing tower which was built from 1964 to 1966 from reinforced concrete and which is 37.48 m high. It has a covered viewing platform 28.8 metres above the ground offering views over the Westerwald and the volcanoes in the Pellenz and as far as the Eifel, Taunus and Hunsrück. It has transmitters for the D2 mobile network.

The card was split between both the January 16 and the January 23 broadcasts of Impact Wrestling on Spike TV. Four matches were contested on the January 16 broadcast, featuring the main event between Sting and Ethan Carter III while the undercard featured Gail Kim defending the Knockouts Championship against Madison Rayne and Mr. Anderson taking on Bully Ray in a No Disqualification match. The January 23 broadcast featured five matches as Magnus defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Sting in a no disqualification title vs. career match. Prominent matches on the undercard were Kurt Angle versus Bobby Roode in a steel cage match, Chris Sabin versus Austin Aries for the X Division Championship and Gunner defended the World Heavyweight Championship Feast or Fired Briefcase on a pole match against James Storm. ==Storylines== Magnus defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Sting in a no disqualification title vs. career match in the main event of Genesis night two. On the December 5 episode of Impact Wrestling, Rockstar Spud prevented Sting from meeting Kurt Angle in his locker room as per Dixie Carter's orders as she wanted Sting out of the arena. The following week, on Impact Wrestling, Sting confronted Carter's kayfabe nephew Ethan Carter III and gave him the ultimatum of either facing Sting or enter the Feast or Fired and Carter chose to enter the Feast or Fired. On the December 26 episode of Impact Wrestling, Sting and Hardy lost to EC3, Spud and The BroMans in a handicap match made by Dixie Carter. On the January 2 episode of Impact Wrestling, Sting accused EC3 of being Dixie's lapdog and challenged him to a match at Genesis, which EC3 accepted. At Final Resolution, Bobby Roode defeated Kurt Angle in a two out of three falls match. The feud continued as Angle demanded a steel cage match against Roode on the January 9, 2014 episode of Impact Wrestling but he was put in the match instead against Roode's partners Bad Influence, whom Angle defeated. Roode would then be put in a steel cage match against Sting, which Roode won with the outside interference by Rockstar Spud. It was later announced that Angle would take on Roode in a steel cage match at Genesis. Gail Kim defended the TNA Knockouts Championship against Madison Rayne at night one of Genesis. At Turning Point, Mr. Anderson defeated Bully Ray in a No Disqualification match to end Ray's faction Aces & Eights and save his TNA career. On the November 28 episode of Impact Wrestling, Anderson held a mock funeral of the Aces & Eights. Ray gained revenge on Anderson on the December 12 episode of Impact Wrestling by piledriving Anderson on the stage during Anderson's Feast or Fired match. On the January 2, 2014 episode of Impact Wrestling, Ray was about to burn Joseph Park with a lighter after covering him with the lighter fluid until Anderson made the save and Ray sprayed fluid on him. The following week, on Impact Wrestling, Anderson and Ray decided to settle their differences by agreeing to a no disqualification match at Genesis. At Turning Point, Gunner threw in the towel for James Storm during his Florida Death match against Bobby Roode to prevent Roode from tossing Storm into the barbed wire board. Storm confronted Gunner on costing him the match, which caused dissension between the two. On the December 12 episode of Impact Wrestling, Gunner retrieved a Feast or Fired briefcase which was revealed to contain a World Heavyweight Championship title shot. On the December 26 episode of Impact Wrestling, Gunner demanded a title shot against the new champion Magnus but Storm demanded that Gunner put the title shot against Storm on the line and Dixie Carter made the match, which ended in a double count-out. On the January 9 episode of Impact Wrestling, Storm challenged Gunner to put the briefcase on the line in a Briefcase on a pole match. At Final Resolution, Madison Rayne and ODB defeated Gail Kim and Lei'D Tapa in a tag team match. On the December 26 episode of Impact Wrestling, Kim helped Tapa in defeating ODB in a match and sent the match as a message to Rayne. The following week, on Impact Wrestling, Rayne defeated Kim in a non-title match. This led to a match between Kim and ODB for Kim's Knockouts Championship at Genesis. At Bound for Glory, Chris Sabin defeated Manik, Austin Aries, Jeff Hardy and Samoa Joe in an Ultimate X match to win the X Division Championship. On the December 12 episode of Impact Wrestling, Aries defeated Sabin to win the X Division Championship after a distraction by Velvet Sky backfired. However, Sabin regained the title from Aries, with Sky's help on the January 2 episode of Impact Wrestling. It was announced that Sabin would defend the title against Aries in a rematch at Genesis. ==Event== Madison Rayne defeated Gail Kim to win the TNA Knockouts Championship at Genesis. Night 1 Preliminary matches The opening match was a twelve-person tag team match pitting Samoa Joe, James Storm, Gunner, Eric Young, Joseph Park and ODB against The BroMans (Jessie Godderz and Robbie E), Zema Ion, Bad Influence (Christopher Daniels and Kazarian) and Lei'D Tapa. After a back and forth action between both teams, Joe made Daniels submit to the Coquina Clutch for the win. Next, Mr. Anderson took on Bully Ray in a no disqualification match. Anderson attacked Ray before the match during Ray's entrance. After hitting a Mic Check on Ray, Anderson sprayed lighter fluid on a table and was about to light it but Ray hit a low blow and a piledriver to Anderson for the win. Gail Kim was scheduled to defend the Knockouts Championship against Madison Rayne in the penultimate match of the episode but Kim and Lei D'Tapa attacked her before the match. Rayne competed in the match despite the assault. Rayne hit a facebreaker knee smash to Kim and pinned her to win the Knockouts Championship. After the match, The Wolves (Davey Richards and Eddie Edwards) made their TNA debut in a segment with Dixie Carter, informing her that they had signed their TNA contracts as full-time wrestlers. Main event match In the main event, Sting took on Ethan Carter III, with Rockstar Spud serving as the special guest referee. Sting hit a Scorpion Death Drop to EC3 and forcefully used Spud's hand to count the pinfall but the World Heavyweight Champion Magnus broke the pinfall count and revealed a referee shirt underneath, which allowed EC3 to take advantage of the distraction and pin Sting with a roll-up for the win. Night 2 Sting competed in the main events of both nights of Genesis; his match against Magnus at night two for the World Heavyweight Championship turned out to be his final match in TNA. Preliminary matches The opening match was a Briefcase on a pole match, in which Gunner defended his World Heavyweight Championship Feast or Fired contract against James Storm. Storm and Gunner brought the briefcase down from the pole after Storm got his hands on it and Gunner attacked him and then Gunner hit a headbutt to Storm, who fell down and Gunner retrieved the case for the win. Next, Chris Sabin defended the X Division Championship against Austin Aries. Sabin handed over a bag to Velvet Sky containing a teddy bear and a lead pipe but once he got the bag, it only contained a teddy bear which rendered him unable to use the lead pipe on Aries. It allowed Aries to hit a double axe handle from the apron to Sabin followed by a missile dropkick and a brainbuster to win the X Division Championship. Later, Kurt Angle took on Bobby Roode in a steel cage match. After a back and forth action between the two, Angle climbed out of the cage first to win the match. The penultimate match of the event pitted Rockstar Spud against Samoa Joe. Joe quickly won the match by hitting a muscle buster and making Spud submit to the Coquina Clutch. Main event match The main event was a no disqualification match, in which Magnus defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Sting and the match stipulated that if Sting lost then he would have to leave TNA.

Next, Zema Ion and The BroMans interfered as Sting hit a Scorpion Death Drop to Magnus and then Kurt Angle and Bobby Roode interfered in the match as well. The interference allowed Magnus to hit a Mag Daddy Driver to Sting and Dixie Carter brought Earl Hebner to count the pinfall, resulting in Magnus retaining the title and Sting being forced to leave TNA. ==Aftermath== On the January 30 episode of Impact Wrestling, Kurt Angle and Samoa Joe confronted Magnus on the retirement of Sting and his ill behavior since being inducted into the Main Event Mafia and it led to a tag team match pitting Angle and Joe against Magnus and Ethan Carter III, which stipulated that if Angle or Joe lost then they would be forced to retire and if any of them scored the pinfall or submission then the winner would receive a World Heavyweight Championship title match against Magnus at Lockdown. Joe made Magnus submit, thus becoming the #1 contender for the title at Lockdown.

It took place on November 21, 2013 at the Impact Zone in Orlando, Florida. Unlike the previous events, this event was not aired on pay- per-view (PPV); instead, like Destination X, Hardcore Justice and No Surrender, it was featured as a special edition of TNA's weekly broadcast of Impact Wrestling. Five matches were contested at the event. The main event was a no disqualification match between Mr. Anderson and Bully Ray, which stipulated that if Anderson won the Aces & Eights would be forced to disband and if Bully Ray won, Anderson would have been required to leave TNA. Anderson won, forcing Aces & Eights to disband. The event also featured two matches in the first round of the tournament for the vacant TNA World Heavyweight Championship including a Falls Count Anywhere match between Magnus and Samoa Joe and a Florida Death match between Bobby Roode and James Storm. The event also featured the TNA re-debut of former Gut Check contestant Sam Shaw as Samuel Shaw. ==Production== Background TNA discontinued most of its pay- per-view events in 2013 in favor of the pre-recorded One Night Only events and began running pay-per-view events on a quarterly basis per year. Turning Point had been produced as a TNA pay-per-view between 2004 and 2012 and was dropped as a pay-per-view event in 2013 and instead resumed as a special episode of TNA's flagship television program Impact Wrestling in 2013. Storylines The TNA World Heavyweight Championship was vacated after reigning champion A.J. Styles \\"quit\\" TNA and a tournament was set up to crown the new champion. Mr. Anderson and Bully Ray's friendship began to suffer when Anderson questioned Ray on adding Tito Ortiz into Aces & Eights without even discussing the matter with Anderson and Ray said that Anderson better not be sensitive and care about his business at Hardcore Justice. On the September 5 episode of Impact Wrestling, Anderson quit Aces & Eights by costing Ray, a no disqualification match against Sting. Ray defeated Anderson in a last man standing match to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at No Surrender. After the match, Ray delivered a piledriver to Anderson on the entrance ramp, putting him out of action. Anderson returned to TNA on the October 24 episode of Impact Wrestling by rescuing A.J. Styles from an assault by Bully Ray. Dixie Carter got Anderson arrested. However, later that night, Anderson showed up during the World Heavyweight Championship match between Styles and Ray, during which he attacked Ray, costing him the title shot and then assaulted Ray after the match. Anderson then declared his intention to end Aces & Eights and gain revenge on Ray. On the November 7 episode of Impact Wrestling, Anderson demanded a match against Ray to be a no disqualification match at Turning Point, which Ray accepted and then Aces & Eights attacked Anderson. A stipulation was added into the match that if Anderson won then Aces & Eights would disband and if Ray won then Anderson must leave TNA. At Bound for Glory, A.J. Styles defeated Bully Ray to win the World Heavyweight Championship. After retaining the title against Ray in a rematch on the October 24 episode of Impact Wrestling, Styles refused to sign Dixie Carter's new contract and opted to leave TNA with the title belt. The following week, on Impact Wrestling, Carter announced that she did not recognize Styles as her champion and a new eight-man tournament would take place to crown a new champion with Bobby Roode, James Storm, Kurt Angle, Chris Sabin, Samoa Joe, Jeff Hardy and Austin Aries announced as participants in the tournament, with the eighth man being determined via a gauntlet match later in the night, which Magnus won. Carter announced that all of the matches would have special stipulations that would be determined by her spinwheel called \\"Wheel of Dixie\\". Hardy defeated Sabin in a Full Metal Mayhem match on the November 7 Impact Wrestling and Angle defeated Aries in a submission match on the November 14 Impact Wrestling in the first round matches of the championship tournament. On the November 14 episode of Impact Wrestling, it was determined via the Wheel of Dixie that Roode and Storm would compete in a Bullrope match and Magnus and Joe would compete in a Falls Count Anywhere match in the World Heavyweight Championship tournament at Turning Point. ==Event== Preliminary matches The first match of Turning Point was a Falls Count Anywhere match between Magnus and Samoa Joe in the first round of the tournament for the vacant TNA World Heavyweight Championship. After fighting back and forth throughout the backstage area and then through the ringside, Joe tried to charge onto Magnus on a chair but Magnus ducked and Joe ran face-first into the chair, getting knocked out and allowing Magnus to pin him for the victory. Next, Gail Kim took on Candice LeRae. Kim executed an Eat Defeat on LeRae for the win. Mr. Anderson defeated Bully Ray in the main event to secure his job in TNA and permanently end Aces & Eights. Next, James Storm took on Bobby Roode in the final match of the first round of the World Heavyweight Championship tournament. The match was originally scheduled to be a bullrope match but Storm requested Dixie Carter to change the match to a Florida Death match. Near the end of the match, Roode hit Storm with various weapons and was about to assault him with a barbed wire until Storm's partner Gunner threw in the towel for Storm, thus awarding the win to Roode. After the match, a video package aired promoting the re-debut of former Gut Check contestant Sam Shaw, where he was interviewed by Christy Hemme at his house and he demanded that he be called Samuel Shaw from then onwards. In the penultimate match, Shark Boy took on Ethan Carter III. EC3 nailed a One Percenter to Shark Boy for the win. Main event match The main event was a No Disqualification match between Mr. Anderson and Bully Ray, which stipulated that if Anderson won, then Ray's group Aces & Eights must disband and if Ray won then Anderson must leave TNA. Near the end of the match, Brooke tried to toss a hammer into the ring for Ray but Anderson caught the hammer and hit Ray with it and then delivered a Mic Check for the win, thus saving his career and forcing Aces & Eights to disband. ==Aftermath== The World Heavyweight Championship tournament continued after Turning Point as Magnus defeated Kurt Angle in a last man standing match and Jeff Hardy defeated Bobby Roode in a tables match in the semifinals on the December 5 episode of Impact Wrestling. At Final Resolution, Magnus defeated Jeff Hardy in a Dixieland match to win the tournament and his first World Heavyweight Championship, and thus turning into a villainous character by joining Dixie Carter's alliance. On the November 28 episode of Impact Wrestling, Mr. Anderson held a funeral for Aces & Eights faction. The feud between Anderson and Bully Ray would continue after Ray attacked Anderson during his entrance during the Feast or Fired match and executed a piledriver on Anderson on the stage. The two continued their feud as Ray defeated Anderson in a no disqualification match at Genesis. Dissension began between James Storm and Gunner as Storm confronted Gunner on throwing in the towel for Storm during his match against Bobby Roode, which led to Storm's loss. On the December 12 episode of Impact Wrestling, Storm and Gunner competed in a Feast or Fired match, where Gunner prevented Storm from retrieving the briefcase and retrieved it himself, which was revealed to contain a future TNA World Heavyweight Championship opportunity. This led to Gunner defending his briefcase against Storm on the December 26 episode of Impact Wrestling, which ended in a double count-out. The two would then compete in a Briefcase on a Pole match at Genesis, where Gunner retained the contract. Samuel Shaw made his in-ring debut as a member of the TNA roster on the January 2, 2014 episode of Impact Wrestling, where he defeated Norv Fernum in his first match. ==Results== Tournament brackets The tournament brackets for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship are: ==See also== *2013 in professional wrestling *List of Impact! special episodes ==ReferencesExternal links== *Turning Point 2013 at Pro Wrestling History Category:TNA Turning Point Category:Professional wrestling in Orlando, Florida Category:2013 in professional wrestling Category:2010s American television specials Category:2013 in Florida Category:2013 American television episodes Category:November 2013 events in the United States ","title":"Turning Point (2013 wrestling)"},{"id":"56113585","text":"This is a list of German football transfers in the winter transfer window 2017–18 by club.

Directed by George B. Seitz, Buried Loot stars Robert Taylor in his first leading role for MGM, although he and the rest of the cast and crew are uncredited during the film's presentation. ==Plot== The film's story is a contemporary one, set in New York City in the 1930s. It recounts the crime of Al Douglas (Robert Taylor), a bank employee who embezzles $200,000 from the city's Seacoast National Bank.For a historical perspective regarding the amount of money embezzled by Al Douglas, the buying power of $200,000 in 1935 was equivalent to $3,600,000 in 2017. \\"CPI Inflation Calculator\\", Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor, Washington, D.C.; retrieved December 22, 2017. He then carries out his plan to confess his deed to the bank's president, telling him that he has squandered all the money, mostly through reckless gambling. In reality, though, Douglas has not spent any of the cash; he buried it in a suitcase at a remote spot \\"across the river in Jersey\\". As part of his plan too, Douglas quite willingly goes to prison after his trial and conviction for grand larceny. There he intends to be a model inmate and expects to serve only the minimum term of his five-to-ten-year sentence. Upon his release, he will then retrieve the hidden loot and enjoy a rich lifestyle. Once Douglas is in prison his resolve to stay there, even for the minimum term, begins to wane. His cellmate Louie (Al Hill) continues to talk about how things always change while people are behind bars and how outside prison \\"nothing stays put\\". Such comments cause Douglas to worry that someone will find his ill-gotten treasure, so he agrees to participate in Louie's scheme to sneak out of prison by disguising themselves as a priest and as another regular visitor. The scheme succeeds and the two men escape. Following their getaway, the former cellmates separate to make it harder for authorities to track them. Louie goes to an undisclosed location in New York while Douglas flees to Canada, knowing that he would be easily recognized in the United States and might be followed if he tried to dig up his buried loot too soon after his escape. In Toronto, Douglas decides to alter his physical appearance permanently before returning to New Jersey. He stages an accident and deliberately burns his face with nitric acid. His self-inflicted burns prove to be so severe that he is hospitalized and has to undergo extensive surgeries, which leave his face horribly scarred from skin grafts and numerous stitches. Now confident that he will not be recognized in the United States, Douglas leaves Canada after his release from the hospital and retrieves the suitcase, still full of money. He then proceeds to New York City to book passage on a ship to Europe.Al Douglas following his surgeries and recovery from severe acid burns In New York, while walking along a street with his suitcase, Douglas is spotted by two men he had befriended in Canada. The two are the same friends who had taken him to the hospital after his burn injuries and had visited him during his recovery. They invite him to share a taxi ride. He declines, but they cheerfully insist, and he goes with them. The taxi soon stops in front of the Seacoast National Bank, his former employer. Now quite nervous, Douglas refuses to go into the building, so his friends suddenly put handcuffs on him, take his suitcase, and escort him at gunpoint to the office of the bank's president. Douglas is surprised to see Louie there, along with other men. The bank president now informs Douglas that his escape from prison had been an elaborate ruse, that he was allowed to escape. He also tells Douglas that officials for the bank's bonding company never believed his claim that he had spent all of the stolen cash, so in an effort to recover the money the company had organized his escape and had its agents follow him constantly since then. Those agents included some prison staff, his Canadian \\"friends\\", and even Louie. The film ends with the disfigured Douglas staring at the camera as he is being told he will now return to prison to serve his maximum sentence with no hope for early parole. ==Cast== * Robert Taylor as Al Douglas * Al Hill as Louie Rattig * Richard Tucker as Bank President * George Irving as Edward Swain * Robert Livingston as Bob * Brooks Benedict as Man in Getaway Car * James Ellison as Detective * Frank O'Connor as Court Clerk * Shirley Ross as Girl in Canadian Apartment * Henry Otho as Prison Guard * Monte Vandergrift as \\"Death House\\" Guard ==Production and premiere== Five years before the release of Buried Loot, MGM produced the feature-length prison drama The Big House and staged the film on huge sets constructed by studio crews, who had meticulously reproduced the cellblocks, mess hall, and high-walled prison yard of San Quentin State Prison in California.\\"The Big House (1930)\\", TCM; retrieved December 22, 2017.

Wan-Bissaka began his career with Crystal Palace and was named as the club's Player of the Year for the 2018–19 season. In 2019, he moved to Manchester United for an initial fee of £45 million, with another £5 million due in potential bonuses. He is of Congolese descent and made one appearance for DR Congo under-20s in 2015. He has gone on to represent the country of his birth, England, at under-20 and under-21 levels. ==Early life== Wan-Bissaka was born in Croydon, Greater London and grew up in New Addington, Croydon, where he attended Good Shepherd Catholic Primary School. ==Club career== Crystal Palace Wan- Bissaka playing for Crystal Palace in 2018 Wan-Bissaka was a member of the Crystal Palace academy from the age of 11, where he started out as a winger. He signed a professional contract with the club in December 2016. On the 2017 pre-season tour, Wan-Bissaka began to feature with the Palace first team under new manager Frank de Boer, playing in a number of friendlies. The Dutchman played a formation with wing-backs, and this new role emphasised Wan-Bissaka's defensive capabilities, eventually leading to him moving from a winger to a full-back. However, he saw chances limited in the first half of the season as De Boer showed a preference to play Timothy Fosu-Mensah or Martin Kelly at right-back, then new manager Roy Hodgson favoured Joel Ward. He was an unused substitute a few times under the new manager, while also starring for the Eagles U23 side. On 25 February 2018, Wan-Bissaka made his first-team debut for Crystal Palace, in the midst of an injury crisis, in a Premier League match against Tottenham Hotspur at Selhurst Park which resulted in a 1–0 defeat. He played all but two minutes of the four Palace matches in March, and won the club's Player of the Month award with 65% of the supporters' votes. On 20 August 2018, Wan-Bissaka was sent off in a 2–0 loss to Liverpool for denying Mohamed Salah a clear goalscoring opportunity. He was named the club's Player of the Month for August, September, October and March. On 30 April 2019, Wan-Bissaka was named the Crystal Palace Player of the Year for his displays throughout the season. Manchester United On 29 June 2019, Wan- Bissaka signed a five-year contract with fellow Premier League club Manchester United. Crystal Palace would receive an initial fee of £45 million, with another £5 million due in potential bonuses. Upon signing for Manchester United, Wan-Bissaka became the sixth-most expensive defender of all time and the most expensive English player who was uncapped by the national side at the time of transfer. On 11 August 2019, he made his Manchester United debut, playing the full 90 minutes in a 4–0 league victory over Chelsea. On 17 October 2020, as United won 4–1 at Newcastle United, he scored the first goal of his professional career. ==International career== Wan-Bissaka was born in England and is of Congolese descent. Wan-Bissaka made a single appearance for DR Congo U20s in an 8–0 friendly loss to the England U17s on 7 October 2015.

He was sent off during his debut against Poland, although England still won 1–0. Wan-Bissaka was called up to the England U21 squad for the first time in September 2018 and made his debut for them on 6 September, playing 90 minutes in a 0–0 draw with the Netherlands at Carrow Road. On 27 May 2019, Wan-Bissaka was included in England's 23-man squad for the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.

The formerly independent parish has been part of the municipality of Nettersheim in the district of Euskirchen since 1969. Marmagen is the oldest village in the former district of Schleiden and goes back to the Roman vicus of Marcomagus on the Roman road from Trier to Cologne which is recorded in Roman itineraries of the 2nd to 4th centuries. After a 700-year history as an abbey village owned by the nearby Premonstratensian Abbey of Steinfeld since the early 1900s Marmagen has developed a distinct culture of trades in the building sector. Today Marmagen sees itself as a 'nature experience village' and is the site of the well known clinic, Eifelhöhenklinik AG Marmagen. == References  Literature == * Friedrich Milz: Eifeler Dorfgeschichten.

It has a single tubular, green leaf and up to thirty greenish-brown flowers with a white labellum. It is only known from a single population of about fifty plants, its numbers having been reduced by land clearing. ==Description== Prasophyllum robustum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf which is long and wide near its dark red to purple base. Between fifteen and thirty greenish-brown to brownish flowers are loosely arranged along a flowering spike which is long reaching to a height of . The flowers are long and wide and as with other leek orchids, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped to egg-shaped, about long, about wide and has about four dark brown striations. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are linear, long, about wide and whitish with a brown line along the centre. The labellum is white, egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long, about wide and turns sharply back on itself near its middle. The edges of the outer part of the labellum have crinkled or wavy edges and there is a raised, fleshy, green, channelled callus in its centre and extending to the bend. Flowering occurs in November and December. ==Taxonomy and naming== The robust leek orchid was first formally described in 1940 by William Henry Nicholls who gave it the name Prasophyllum patens var. robustum from a specimen collected at Smithton. The description was published in The Victorian Naturalist. In 1998, Mark Clements and David Jones raised the variety to species status. The specific epithet (robustum) is a Latin word meaning \\"hard and strong like oak\\". ==Distribution and habitat== Prasophyllum robustum grows with shrubs and grasses in forest. It is only known from a single population of about fifty plants and the Smithton population appears to be extinct. Other populations have been lost due to land clearing for agriculture. ==Conservation== The only remaining population of P. robustum is on private property with the current owners taking steps to preseve the species. Potential threats include land clearing, grazing by horses and inappropriate fire regimes. ==References External links == * robustum Category:Flora of Tasmania Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Plants described in 1940 ","title":"Prasophyllum robustum"},{"id":"56113919","text":"Gosogliptin (INN; trade name SatRx) is a drug for the treatment of type II diabetes.

It is located at 576 Concord Road and is an active worship center. ==History== Marker depicting the southeast corner of the church built in 1702 St. John's Church was founded in 1702 when John Hannum donated land and a log building was erected. John Hannum was a successful farmer and tavern owner who was baptized by the former Quaker, George Keith, who was known to conduct services in the Hannum home in Concord. St. John's Church was originally part of the St. Paul's Church in Chester, Pennsylvania parish along with St. Martin's Church in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania. In 1704, Reverend Henry Nichols was sent by The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts as a missionary to work in all three churches. In 1707, Reverend Evan Evans, the first Rector at St. John's, travelled to England and returned the same year with a pewter Holy Communion Service, a gift from Queen Anne to the parish. Missionaries were sent from Philadelphia to preach to the congregation, however problems arose due to the distance the preachers had to travel and the church began to have ministers from the Swedish Church in Wilmington, Delaware preside over the congregation. Israel Acrelius, the noted Swedish Lutheran missionary and priest is known to have preached at St. John's Church during his travels in America in 1749. In 1773, a western end laid with bricks was added to the frame church. In 1790, an eastern end of the church was added laid with stone and replaced the original structure that the congregation had worshipped in for almost a century. In 1837, another addition to the church was made, however it was decided that a new church was needed since the previous structure had been added to several times and was no longer sufficient to meet the needs of the congregation. On October 27, 1844, a new church was consecrated and still stands today. In 1884, a chancel window was added as a memorial to Henry Onderdonk, the second Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. ==Notable burials== *William Garrigues Powel - Pennsylvania State Representative ==External links== * *DelawareCountyHistory.com - St. John's Episcopal Church Cemetery Records == References == Category:1702 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:18th-century Episcopal church buildings Category:Anglican congregations established in the 18th century Category:Cemeteries in Delaware County, Pennsylvania Category:Churches in Delaware County, Pennsylvania Category:Religious organizations established in 1702 ","title":"St. John's Church (Concord, Pennsylvania)"},{"id":"56114114","text":"Sheikha Maha Mansour Salman Jasim Al Thani is a Qatari judge.

His driving was so erratic that members of the public called the police, who discovered Williams had a blood alcohol level of 0.122. \\"Shame on you, Mr Williams,\\" Magistrate Jennifer Giles said at sentencing. She said the \\"community does not feel safe with you with a licence; you are exceptionally lucky you did not hurt or kill someone, or yourself.\\" Williams also has handed a 2-week suspension by the club. Corey Norman drinking fine In May 2018, Corey Norman was handed a breach notice by Parramatta and fined $20,000 for drinking alcohol and posting pictures of himself drinking on Instagram despite being on the injured list which is against team protocols.

The latter had an exceptionally high status under the ruling queen Hatshepsut (about 1507–1458 BC). Senimen is known from several sources. A funerary cone preserves a number of titles, that make it possible to reconstruct his career. On the cone he appears as child of the harem (kap) of Nebpehtyre.N. de Garis Davies, edited by M. F. Laming Macadam: A corpus of inscribed Egyptian funerary cones, Oxford 1957, no. 120 Nebpehtyre is the throne name of king Ahmose. The title indicates that Senimen grew up under this king. On the cone, three further titles are listed. They all relate to his position as teacher or tutor of Neferure. Senimen was called teacher of the god's body of the god's wife Neferure, nurse of the daughter of the god's wife Hatshepsut and steward of the king's daughter. Senimen was evidently at one point in his career appointed to become the teacher of Neferure. He was also administrator of Neferure's domains. The timing of this appointment is unclear. There are two other officials that were tutors of Neferure too. These are Ahmose Pen- Nekhebet and Senenmut. Senimen must have been quite old in the reign of Hatshepsut, so it has been suggested that he was appointed already before Hatshepsut became ruling queen and when Thutmose II was still king.JJ Shirley: The Power of the Elite: The Officials of Hatshepsut's Regency and Coregency, in: J.

The owner of a small real-estate company, Hemminger previously served on the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools Board of Education and the Orange County Board of County Commissioners. In the town's 2015 mayoral race, Hemminger was endorsed by a new local political action committee that advocated for a change in the town's vision for property development. She unseated Mark Kleinschmidt with a 9-point margin. During Hemminger's mayoral tenure, the town council gave itself more power in development discussions while seeking to attract developers, recommitted to climate change mitigation, and planned the renovation of public housing, among other things. She won reelection in 2017 and 2019. ==Education and personal life== Pamela Somers Hemminger graduated from Vanderbilt University in 1982 with a bachelor's degree in economics and German. Her husband, Bradley Mark Hemminger, is an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) School of Information and Library Science. They met at Vanderbilt and have four children, who all attended Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools and three of whom graduated from UNC. In 2004, Indy Week wrote: \\"You could call Pam Hemminger a power soccer mom\\", noting a decade of involvement with a local soccer league. According to her online town biography, Hemminger regularly hikes and plays tennis. ==Early political career (2004–2015)== In 2004, Hemminger unsuccessfully ran in the Democratic Party primary election for the Orange County Board of County Commissioners; after the election, in July, she said the campaign \\"was a really positive experience\\". The defining issue of the campaign was the possibility of merging Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools and Orange County Schools; the group NoMerger.org, seeking to oust incumbent Moses Carey, endorsed Hemminger and Valerie Foushee; it did not endorse incumbent Margaret Brown, for perceived unwillingness to pick a side. With 21% of the vote, Hemminger placed fourth of five candidates; the nominees were Foushee and Carey. Hemminger was a member, from 2004 to 2008, of the Chapel Hill-Carrboro Board of Education, on which she served as both vice chair and chair. Elected along with Foushee in 2008, Hemminger served as an Orange County Commissioner until 2012. She also served in Chapel Hill's Greenways Commission, the town's Parks and Recreation Commission, and the Upper Neuse River Basin Authority, chairing the latter two. At the time of her first election as mayor, in 2015, Hemminger had lived in Chapel Hill for 29 years. She was owner of Windaco Properties LLC, a real-estate management company. In 2018, Lauren Talley of The Daily Tar Heel reported that Hemminger's company managed five properties: \\"She does the bookkeeping — mainly on evenings and weekends — while another employee maintains the properties.\\" ==Mayoral tenure (2015–present)== Elections With 54% of the vote, Hemminger won the 2015 mayoral election in Chapel Hill against incumbent Mayor Mark Kleinschmidt (45%) and Southern Village resident Gary Kahn (0.9%). Marked by debate over the future of development in the area, this was the first election in five decades in which an incumbent mayor in Chapel Hill was defeated. Hemminger raised $24,974 before the early voting period, while Kleinschmidt had raised $30,480. In late September, a Public Policy Polling survey found Kleinschmidt leading by 12 percentage points, but by early November, Hemminger led by 6 points. In 2015, only one town councilor (of the four up for reelection) was reelected. The Chapel Hill Alliance for a Livable Town (CHALT) political action committee, which endorsed Hemminger, also supported two of the three new candidates who won election to the town council. CHALT, established in 2015, advocated a \\"more deliberate pace of growth\\" along with affordable housing, environmental protection, and energy efficiency. A former town council member said of the organization, \\"I think basically they advocate for slower or no growth ... They would argue that they're not against growth, they just want a different kind of growth.\\" Indy Week reporter Billy Ball wrote: \\"This campaign has been unusually venomous by Chapel Hill standards, with malicious attacks, Internet trolling and a bitter wave of anti-incumbent sentiment, all in a town that, historically, tends to agree with itself more than it doesn't.\\" During the campaign, as CHALT members criticized certain developments in town and certain people in government, Hemminger distanced herself from the group, saying, \\"I'm not for polarization.\\" Hemminger confirmed her first reelection bid during her weekly appearance on WCHL's The Aaron Keck Show in May 2017, and then she made a formal announcement in June. She was reelected to a second term on November 7, 2017, with 92.51% of the vote; former Chapel Hill-Carrboro NAACP leader Eugene Farrar challenged her in a write-in campaign. Hemminger focused on diversifying the tax base to fund affordable housing, community space for teenagers, parks and recreation, and additional cultural activities. As she later explained, \\"The longer view is changing and diversifying commercial space. We can't keep depending on residential property taxes and business property taxes to keep us going.\\" She was endorsed by Indy Week, CHALT, Equality North Carolina, and the Sierra Club. Four new council members were elected, all endorsed by CHALT. On July 8, 2019, Hemminger filed for reelection, seeking a third term as mayor. Facing a single challenger, 34-year-old ACLU canvasser and yoga and math teacher Joshua Levenson, she was again endorsed by CHALT, the Sierra Club, Equality North Carolina, and Indy Week, as well as The Daily Tar Heel and the local advocacy group NEXT. She won the election with 89% of the vote. Tenure Hemminger was sworn in as mayor of Chapel Hill on December 2, 2015. Her second term began on December 6, 2017. Development In April 2017, the town council rezoned parts of Chapel Hill to attract business development; Hemminger said she wanted the change because \\"we're not able to react fast enough for some of these projects that we would most likely like to have\\". In December 2017, the town council voted to allow \\"conditional zoning\\" so that the council, in Hemminger's words, would \\"have more latitude for turning [development projects] down just because [council members] don't like it, or for asking for more conditions\\". Saying she wanted the town to be a \\"regional foodie destination\\", Hemminger worked to bring new retailers to Chapel Hill, such as by approving construction of a Wegmans supermarket with $4 million in tax incentives. The town council also gave $2 million in tax incentives to a Charlotte development company to make new office buildings; Hemminger said the incentives were an unfortunate necessity, explaining, \\"We haven't had any office buildings; nothing else we tried has worked. In order to move forward, this is what the developer said it would take to be able to get them out of the ground, because it is very risky and speculative when you're building office in our community.\\" Hemminger supported the eventually scrapped Durham–Orange Light Rail Transit project, arguing that it would help with growth in town. She has called one instance of clearcutting \\"heartbreaking\\" and said that she preferred selection cutting. In 2017, the town bought a property from the American Legion, which Hemminger said would eventually become a park, though the organization was leasing it from the town while the town paid off the $7.9-million property over three installments. Energy In a candidate questionnaire in 2015, Hemminger wrote: \\"I vow to continue Chapel Hill's strong track record of protecting our streams, encouraging energy-efficient building, and maintaining natural green spaces to balance the growing density of our built environment.\\" In June 2017, the town council passed a resolution recommitting Chapel Hill to its goals for climate change mitigation as part of the Paris Agreement. Hemminger also signed a petition pledging to uphold the agreement after President Donald Trump announced the country's withdrawal from it. In January 2018, she signed a petition against the repeal of the Clean Power Plan announced by Scott Pruitt, the EPA administrator at the time. \\"To ignore climate change is ridiculous,\\" she wrote. \\"To repeal things or go backwards makes no sense.\\" Later in 2018, David Boraks reported for WFAE that despite the announced national withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, some state and local governments had made their own efforts on climate change mitigation. Chapel Hill was among those governments; Hemminger said that \\"there's a great possibility of being successful no matter what the federal government's dictating\\". She said the town was reducing energy use, buying electric buses, building charging stations, installing LED lights in public buildings, and planting trees. And, she said there were further things that could be done before the town council adopts a new climate action plan in June 2020. She also said Duke Energy could do more to save energy. Housing In April 2017, Hemminger said the town had hired more staff to look into affordable housing. She said the town, in 2017, spent $6 million on affordable housing, and had set a goal of adding 400 units and renovating existing units in the coming four years. She also said she didn't want \\"any more [UNC] student housing downtown\\". In 2018, she said, \\"We really, really want to find ways to keep affordable housing in our communities and to create more affordable housing that doesn't come under constant pressure of this nature,\\" referring in particular to a proposed redevelopment of a mobile home property, over which she said the town had no control. Also that year, the town council approved a $10 million bond for affordable housing, which voters approved. The next year, the council updated the town's public housing plan, calling for several kinds of renovations in all 336 of the town's public units (at the time housing 2 percent of the town's population). Hemminger also said \\"it's time to do something\\" regarding the construction of new public housing. Immigration While Chapel Hill is not a sanctuary city, Hemminger argued in February 2017 that \\"we just have a community value that says, 'Yes, we're open for everyone'.\\" Later that year, Hemminger claimed that the General Assembly might try to legislate for \\"intent\\" instead of \\"policies\\" in order to force municipalities to comply with federal law enforcement, saying, \\"It's hard to talk about [welcoming refugees] and not have state lawmakers come at us.\\" In September, she spoke and signed a letter in support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. In 2018, Chapel Hill started an initiative trying to get foreign-born residents more involved in local government. In April 2019, along with Lydia Lavelle, the mayor of neighboring Carrboro, Hemminger signed a letter opposing a bill (eventually vetoed by Governor Roy Cooper) that would have required county law enforcement to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Silent Sam In August 2017, Hemminger wrote to Carol Folt, UNC chancellor at the time, to ask for the Silent Sam statue on campus to be put into storage because it presented a \\"clear and present danger\\" to students if something happened during a protest. Shortly after the Charlottesville rally in August, she said the town was working with the university to protect students during protests. The next year, she said, \\"The statue belongs somewhere it can be referenced, used as a teaching tool and thought of in the correct context.\\" On August 20, 2018, protesters toppled Silent Sam. Hemminger said town staff and police were working with the university to investigate the toppling, and added, \\"I encourage everyone to remember that our freedom of expression does not come at the expense of safety and public order.\\" She also said the statue \\"doesn't represent our town values\\" and was \\"a public safety nightmare, as far as we're concerned\\", arguing that some people stayed away from downtown businesses when protests were held. She thanked police for their response to the toppling and said she wished UNC had gotten the statue removed earlier. The next year, as Folt stepped down, Hemminger said, \\"Our biggest concern has been that someone was going to get hurt.\\" Other issues Hemminger developed the Food for the Summer program, based on an election promise; since 2016 and through 2019, it has served meals to food-insecure children throughout the summer, five days a week. Because \\"she helped create\\" Food for the Summer, Hemminger was recognized by WCHL as its weekly Hometown Hero on June 17, 2019. In March 2016, the town council passed a resolution condemning the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act (widely known as HB2). The next year, Hemminger said that the compromise bill partially repealing it \\"does not go far enough to address discrimination\\". In 2017, Hemminger created the Historic Civil Rights Commemorations Task Force, which researched and recommended ways to commemorate the town's involvement in the civil rights movement, in particular the history of Chapel Hill Nine. When the project finished, Hemminger said, \\"We finally get to tell our whole story, and that's just a wonderful gift this task force has put together for the entire community.\\" Hemminger endorsed Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, in the 2016 presidential election. Hemminger has said she supports gun control measures such as stricter background checks and extended waiting periods. At a rally against gun violence on UNC's campus in 2018, she said, \\"The mayors across the nation are with you.\\" Hemminger also supports limits on campaign donations in local municipal races; in her first mayoral election in Chapel Hill, the cap was $353 for individuals. In April 2016, Chapel Hill hosted a delegation from the Israeli Knesset. Some community members criticized the visit, and a town councilor walked out of a meeting with the Israelis. Hemminger defended the decision to host the group, saying, \\"While you may not agree with everything – or any or part – it's always a good learning experience, and it's also a better opportunity to have change come when you bring people to the table and have the discussion rather than shutting them out.\\" In June 2018, the town hosted officials of the Dutch embassy, who were visiting every \\"Orange County\\" in the United States; Hemminger said that in a meeting with the Dutch she discussed, among other things, \\"being a 'blue bubble in a red sea'.\\" ==Electoral historySee also== * List of mayors of Chapel Hill, North Carolina * List of commissioners of Orange County, North Carolina ==ReferencesExternal links== * Mayor Pam Hemminger at Town of Chapel Hill Category:Living people Category:1960 births Category:Mayors of Chapel Hill, North Carolina Category:North Carolina Democrats Category:American real estate businesspeople Category:School board members in North Carolina Category:County commissioners in North Carolina Category:Vanderbilt University alumni Category:Women mayors of places in North Carolina ","title":"Pam Hemminger"},{"id":"56114335","text":"Crassotornoceras is genus of ammonoids that lived during Upper Devonian period, from the base of Frasnian age until the base of Maenecoceras subvaricatum zone.

Hanna Jr. was a Great Lakes freighter that had a lengthy, 75-year career on the Great Lakes of Canada and America. Hanna was a product of the Cleveland Shipbuilding Company of Cleveland, Ohio. The ship was commissioned by the Richardson Transportation Company to haul iron ore, coal and grain. She had a cargo capacity of 9,200 tons of bulk cargo, or 323,000 bushels of grain. ==1913 storm== On 8 November 1913 the Hanna was laden with a cargo of coal bound from Lorain, Ohio, to Fort William, entered Lake Huron in the early hours of November 9. The crew of Hanna had no idea that in a few hours, they would encounter the worst storm in Great Lakes history. While much larger ships sank, such as James Carruthers, the Hanna was caught in the trough of a large wave, rolled over, and was tossed ashore near Port Austin, Michigan. The Hanna sustained a lot of damage including smashed windows and various topside damage. The ship's hull cracked at the 17th hatch, was flooded aft, and the smokestack came crashing down over the aft deckhouse. All 25 crew members on board survived and were later rescued. The bad weather that winter made it impossible to refloat the ship until the following year. ==After the storm== In 1914 the Hanna was taken to Collingwood then to Midland for major repairs. She did not sail until 1915 when she was purchased by the Great Lakes Transit Company and resumed service as SS Glenshee. On 13 October 1916 the ship grounded in the St. Mary's River. On 1 October 1926 the ship joined the Canada Steamship Lines fleet and was renamed Marquette. The following spring the vessel was renamed Goderich, and she continued to haul bulk cargoes. ==Collisions== On 5 June 1943 Goderich had a collision with the long American grain carrier (the Armstrong was on her maiden voyage) in the St. Mary's River. Both ships were badly damaged and needed a lot of repairs. On 25 July 1945, Goderich collided with W.W. Holloway on Lake Superior. ==Final years== In 1962 Goderich was tied up in Quebec awaiting scrapping in Europe. Eventually the Algoma Central and Hudson Bay Railway Company bought the ship and renamed her Agawa in April 1963. Agawa sailed until 1967, when she was laid up in Goderich full of grain. In 1968 Agawa was sold to the Goderich Elevator Company for use as a storage barge. Renamed Lionel Parsons, the ship was used for another 15 years until it was no longer needed. The tug W.J. Ivan Purvis escorted her from Goderich, to Thunder Bay, Ontario. She arrived in the scrapyard on 3 June 1983. ==References== Category:1908 ships Category:Maritime incidents in June 1943 Category:Maritime incidents in July 1945 Category:Ships built in Cleveland Category:Great Lakes freighters Category:Merchant ships of the United States Category:Maritime incidents in 1913 Category:Ships powered by a triple expansion steam engine ","title":"SS Howard M.

In the 10th paper, he predicted that the purely electron stellar atmosphere emits a polarized light using Thomson law of scattering. The theory predicted that 11 percent polarization could be observed at maximum. But when this is applied to a spherical star, the net polarization effect was found to be zero, because of the spherical symmetry. But it took another 20 years to explain under what conditions this polarization can be observed. J. Patrick Harrington and George W. Collins, II Harrington, J. P., & Collins, G. W. (1968). Intrinsic polarization of rapidly rotating early-type stars. The Astrophysical Journal, 151, 1051. showed that this symmetry is broken if we consider a rapidly rotating star (or a binary star system), in which the star is not exactly spherical, but slightly oblate due to extreme rotation (or tidal distortion in the case of binary system).

It was played from 1902 to 1931, although the match lapsed between 1913 and 1921. The match continued after 1931 but as part of the Men's Home Internationals in which Ireland and Wales also competed. Until 1931 it was played in connection with the Amateur Championship, on the Saturday either before or after the championship. ==History== The 1902 match was decided by holes. After the morning round Scotland led in 5 matches, England in 4 with one level. At that point Scotland led by just one hole 14–13. In the afternoon rounds Scotland led in 6 matches, England in 3 with one level. In the afternoon matches alone Scotland won by 6 holes, 18–12. Over the 36 holes Scotland had won 6 of the 10 matches, England winning the other 4, Scotland winning by 28 holes in their 6 wins, England by 21 in their 4 wins. Some sources give the result as 32–25, the sum of the morning and afternoon results, while others give 28–21. Either way, Scotland won by 7 holes. The event lapsed after 1912. A match was planned for 1921 but was cancelled because a match between Britain and America had been arranged, the forerunner of the Walker Cup matches. Starting in 1927 Scotland and Ireland had played an annual match. In 1927 and 1929 this was held in Ireland, before the Irish Amateur Open Championship, while in 1928 and 1930 it was held in Scotland, just before the England–Scotland match. The 1931 Amateur Championship was held at Royal North Devon. On the previous occasions that it has been held there, there were far fewer Scottish entries than normal and as a consequence the Scottish team was not fully representative. It was therefore decided to hold the England–Scotland match at a different time and on a different venue, being played at Royal Liverpool in August. In addition it was decided to play a match between England and Ireland on the day before. Ireland and Scotland had already decided to hold their match in Ireland in September. It was later arranged that a Welsh team should attend, playing matches against Scotland and Ireland on the days when England were playing Ireland and Scotland. England beat Ireland 10–4 while Wales lost 2–12 to Scotland and 2–11 to Ireland. England did not play Wales. With Scotland winning both their matches and then beating Ireland the following month, they were the unofficial champion country. The Men's Home Internationals, in which all four countries play each other, started in 1932. In 1952 Raymond Oppenheimer, an ex-England and Walker Cup captain, presented a trophy for the tournament, known as the Raymond Trophy. ==Format== The 1902 match had teams of 10, who played singles matches over 36 holes. All 36 holes were played and the overall result was decided by holes won. From 1903 the teams were reduced to 9-a-side and the result was decided by matches. Extra holes were played if necessary to achieve a result. The format was changed for 1912, the main consisting of 5 foursomes matches rather than 9 singles. When the event was revived in 1922 the format was changed. There were teams of 10 playing 5 foursomes matches in the morning and 10 singles in the afternoon. Matches were over 18 holes with halved matches not counting. ==Results== {   center\\" ! Year !! Date !! Venue !! Winners !! Score !!

() is a Soviet 1988 romantic comedy directed by Gerald Bezhanov. ==Plot== Talented engineer Pavel Fedorovich Golikov who works at a research institute in a team comprised purely of females, is surprisingly timid and inexperienced in his relationships with women considering that he is more than forty years old. He is still single and lives with his parents who have long dreamed of having grandchildren. They unsuccessfully introduce him to unmarried daughters of friends in the hope that Pavel will finally marry. But suddenly cheerful and reckless Gena comes to Moscow for furniture - Pavel's cousin. At the request of Pavel's parents, Gena decides to stay in Moscow until he finds a wife for his brother. First, Gena disguises Pavel in a new suit, then they get acquainted with various girls using the pick-up line \\"Where is the nophelet?\\" (\\"Nophelet(e)\\" is an ananym — the word \\"telephone\\" pronounced in the reverse order). But in his quiet fantasies of family life and children, Pavel sees an unknown female passenger, with whom he travels on a daily bus. Later Gena's wife arrives who is troubled by his lengthy absence - she is an imperious and commanding woman, and as Pavel's parents look at her they even begin to doubt the need to marry off their son.

This set off the Revolution Controversy, an exchange of arguments via pamphlet between those supporting or opposing the idea of the French Revolution. ==The Controversy== In 1789, moral philosopher and dissenting minister Richard Price was watching the French Revolution, and felt that it was fulfilling prophecies of his millennialist belief, that a great change was going to transform humanity. To express this, he wrote a speech, which he delivered to the Revolution Society on 4 November of that year. The Revolution Society was formed in support of overthrow of King James II a century earlier, the \\"Glorious Revolution\\", and on that date was celebrating the birthday of William III, who had displaced him. Price compared the French Revolution to that event, much as he had previously defended the American Revolution, despite living in the country at war against it.Thomas Paine Versus Edmund Burke He starts out by establishing that he believes in patriotism, love of one's own country. Because the revolution was overthrowing the French rulers, which was seen as a dangerous example by the English political class, this was an important distinction. But Price says that one's country is not necessarily its rulers, nor even its geography, but is the principles and people that are identified with it, that love for country is a love for one's community and ideals. That it's one's duty to love their country only in that way. He also notes that this is not an obligation to believe in an unrealistic idea of a nation's superiority or righteousness. A nation's goodness or greatness depends on holding it to high standards, not pretending it achieves them automatically. He also states that this obligatory patriotism is not the same as a desire to dominate and even conquer other countries, which he describes in negative, pejorative terminology. Price then goes on to establish the groundwork for supporting the right to overthrow a repressive State. He says it's one's patriotic duty to enlighten one's countrymen, who otherwise seem willing to suffer under repressive rule, the world over. Liberty is a great blessing to be advocated with patriotic zeal, essential to the prosperity of any nation, to be defended both from external aggression and internal oppression. He states that \\"if you love your country, you cannot be zealous enough in promoting the cause of liberty in it.\\" ==Natural rights== Price also establishes the basic tenor of the entire Revolution Controversy, identifying natural rights as fundamental to patriotism, and listing the three he considers most essential: :First; The right to liberty of conscience in religious matters. :Secondly; The right to resist power when abused. And, :Thirdly; The right to chuse our own governors; to cashier them for misconduct; and to frame a government for ourselves. The Glorious Revolution, he says, was founded on those three principles (the English Bill of Rights came from that event), and that without them it would not have been legitimate, a rebellion (implicitly bad) instead of a revolution. He goes on to, mostly implicitly, associate both the French and American revolutions with this idea, in a celebratory way. As with the rest of his narrative, he sprinkles religious terminology in this conclusion, saying of this time of revolution: > What an eventful period is this! I am thankful that I have lived to it; and > I could almost say, Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for > mine eyes have seen thy salvation. I have lived to see a diffusion of > knowledge, which has undermined superstition and error—I have lived to see > the rights of men better understood than ever; and nations panting for > liberty, which seemed to have lost the idea of it.—I have lived to see > Thirty Millions of people, indignant and resolute, spurning at slavery, and > demanding liberty with an irresistible voice; their king led in triumph, and > an arbitrary monarch surrendering himself to his subjects.—After sharing in > the benefits of one Revolution, I have been spared to be a witness to two > other Revolutions, both glorious.—And now, methinks, I see the ardor for > liberty catching and spreading; a general amendment beginning in human > affairs; the dominion of kings changed for the dominion of laws, and the > dominion of priests giving way to the dominion of reason and > conscience.Richard Price, A Discourse on the Love of Our Country ==Impact== This speech was quickly picked up by pamphleteers, printed in London and Boston, spurring responses both by supporters and critics in a flurry of debate known as the Revolution Controversy. Edmund Burke criticised Price's ideas and defended the British constitution, converting a short text of his own into a longer response, Reflections on the Revolution in France. William Coxe opposed the premise that one's country is principles and people, not the State itself. Conversely, two seminal political pieces of political history were written in Price's favour by members of his congregation at Newington Green Unitarian Church, Rights of Man by Thomas Paine, and A Vindication of the Rights of Men by Mary Wollstonecraft, who followed this with what is sometimes described as the first feminist text, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. In 1792 Christopher Wyvill published Defence of Dr. Price and the Reformers of England, a plea for reform and moderation.Graham, pp. 297–98. This exchange of ideas has been described as \\"one of the great political debates in British history\\". Even in France, there was a varying degree of agreement during this debate, English participants generally opposing the violent means that the Revolution bent itself to for its ends.On the French reception of Price's Discourse and the Revolution Society, see ==References== Category:1789 events of the French Revolution Category:Philosophy books Category:1789 non-fiction books Category:Books about the French Revolution Category:Counter-Enlightenment ","title":"A Discourse on the Love of Our Country"},{"id":"56114827","text":"Ryan Knight (born 1966) is a former American football running back.

Kendall in 1957, in attempting to solve the force-free magnetic fields. The results were independently derived by both, but were agreed to publish the paper together. If the force-free magnetic field equation is written as abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{H}=\\\\lambda\\\\mathbf{H} with the assumption of divergence free field ( abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{H}=0), then the most general solution for axisymmetric case is :\\\\mathbf{H} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda} abla\\\\times( abla\\\\times\\\\psi\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n}) + abla \\\\times \\\\psi \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n} where \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n} is a unit vector and the scalar function \\\\psi satisfies the Helmholtz equation, i.e., : abla^2\\\\psi + \\\\lambda^2\\\\psi=0. The same equation also appears in fluid dynamics in Beltrami flows where, vorticity vector is parallel to the velocity vector, i.e., abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{v}=\\\\lambda\\\\mathbf{v}. ==Derivation== Taking curl of the equation abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{H}=\\\\lambda\\\\mathbf{H} and using this same equation, we get : abla\\\\times( abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{H}) = \\\\lambda^2\\\\mathbf{H}. In the vector identity abla \\\\times \\\\left( abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{H} \\\\right) = abla( abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{H}) - abla^{2}\\\\mathbf{H}, we can set abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{H}=0 since it is solenoidal, which leads to a vector Helmholtz equation, : abla^2\\\\mathbf{H}+\\\\lambda^2\\\\mathbf{H}=0. Every solution of above equation is not the solution of original equation, but the converse is true. If \\\\psi is a scalar function which satisfies the equation abla^2\\\\psi + \\\\lambda^2\\\\psi=0, then the three linearly independent solutions of the vector Helmholtz equation are given by :\\\\mathbf{L} = abla\\\\psi,\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{T} = abla\\\\times\\\\psi\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n}, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{S} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda} abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{T} where \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n} is a fixed unit vector. Since abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{S} =\\\\lambda\\\\mathbf{T}, it can be found that abla\\\\times(\\\\mathbf{S}+\\\\mathbf{T})=\\\\lambda(\\\\mathbf{S}+\\\\mathbf{T}). But this is same as the original equation, therefore \\\\mathbf{H}=\\\\mathbf{S}+\\\\mathbf{T}, where \\\\mathbf{S} is the poloidal field and \\\\mathbf{T} is the toroidal field. Thus, substituting \\\\mathbf{T} in \\\\mathbf{S}, we get the most general solution as :\\\\mathbf{H} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda} abla\\\\times( abla\\\\times\\\\psi\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n}) + abla \\\\times \\\\psi \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n}. ==Cylindrical polar coordinates== Taking the unit vector in the z direction, i.e., \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n}=\\\\mathbf{e}_z, with a periodicity L in the z direction with vanishing boundary conditions at r=a, the solution is given by :\\\\psi = J_m(\\\\mu_jr)e^{im\\\\theta+ikz}, \\\\quad \\\\lambda =\\\\pm(\\\\mu_j^2+k^2)^{1/2} where J_m is the Bessel function, k=\\\\pm 2\\\\pi n/L, \\\\ n = 0,1,2,\\\\ldots, the integers m =0,\\\\pm 1,\\\\pm 2,\\\\ldots and \\\\mu_j is determined by the boundary condition a k\\\\mu_j J_m'(\\\\mu_j a)+m \\\\lambda J_m(\\\\mu_j a) =0. The eigenvalues for m=n=0 has to be dealt separately. Since here \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n}=\\\\mathbf{e}_z, we can think of z direction to be toroidal and \\\\theta direction to be poloidal, consistent with the convention. ==See also== *Poloidal–toroidal decomposition *Woltjer's theorem == References == Category:Astrophysics Category:Plasma physics ","title":"Chandrasekhar–Kendall function"},{"id":"56115068","text":"\\"Oui oh oui\\" is a song by the Belgian Eurodance singer Kim Kay.

After the election, the party joined PSC's parliamentary group. The party renewed their alliance with the PSC for of the upcoming 2019 Spanish local elections. Concurrently, it joined the Coalition for a Solidary Europe alliance together with the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), Canarian Coalition (CCa) and other regionalist political parties in Spain ahead of the 2019 European Parliament election.

Around 1859 Yonge created a literary group made up of younger girl cousins in order that they could write essays and gain advice from Yonge on their writing. Together they created a private magazine called \\"The Barnacle\\" and this collaboration continued until about 1871. This was valuable as this may have been the last generation of girls to be educated at home. Alice was unusual in that she was getting \\"a boy's education\\". Alice contributed under the name of \\"Gurgoyle\\". From the first issue she drew the covers and she contributed translations, articles, riddles and verses. Alice read many of Yonge's novels.

He was forcibly taken into exile in Germany in 1944. He continued to serve as Archbishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia in exile (later officially known as The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia in Exile, and after that as The Latvian Evangelical Lutheran Church Abroad) at which post he served until his death. ==Biography== Grīnbergs was born into a family of farmers in Ģibzdes manor in \\"Mazlejas\\" (now Valdgale Parish) of Dundaga parish. He studied in Pope, Ģibzde,Talsi and Jelgava. From 1891 to 1896 he studied Theology at the University of Tartu. He became a member of the oldest Latvian student corporation Lettonia. From 1899 to 1932 he served as a pastor in Lutrīne and Ventspils. Along with his duties in the church he also worked as a teacher in Ventspils and even as Chairman of the City Council. In 1929 the Faculty of Theology of the University of Latvia awarded Grīnbergs an honorary doctorate, and in 1932 he was elected as an external professor. In the same year he was elected Archbishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia, the first prelate with this title. His predecessor, Bishop Kārlis Irbe, was known as the bishop in charge of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia. However, due to an ongoing dispute concerning the ownership of the Rīga Dom. which prompted the resignation of his predecessor in 1932, Grīnbergs was not consecrated as Bishop, but rather inducted by his fellow pastors. Archbishop Eidem of Uppsala wished Kārlis Irbe to take part in the consecration that was planned, but he refused. For this reason Archbishop Eidem never performed the consecration. Grīnbergs retained the title of archbishop in 1944 when he went into exile. During his term in office, a new Hymn Book and a new edition of the New Testament were issued. In July 1938, an agreement for intercommunion with the Anglican Church of England was achieved . In the second half of 1944, the occupying German authorities exiled the archbishop, along with the leaders of other churches to Germany. Archbishop Grīnbergs continued to lead the church in exile until his death at Esslingen am Neckar in West Germany on 14 June 1962.\\"Teodors Grīnbergs\\", LELB.

Nuitka initially was designed to produce C++ code, but current versions produce C source code using only those features of C11 that are shared by C++03, enabling further compilation to a binary executable format by modern C and C++ compilers including gcc, clang, MinGW, or Microsoft Visual C++. It accepts Python code compatible with several different Python versions (currently supporting versions 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3–3.8) and optionally allows for the creation of standalone programs that do not require Python to be installed on the target computer. Nuitka was discussed at the 2012 EuroPython conference, and serious development began at the end of the same year. It now supports virtually all of the features of the Python language. Additional compile-time optimizations are planned for future releases, including avoiding the use of Python objects for additional variables whose type can be inferred at compile time, particularly when using iterators, which is expected to result in a large performance increase. == Limitations == Currently it is not possible to cross-compile binaries (e.g. building the executable on Windows and shipping it to Mac OS X). Standalone binaries built using the \`--standalone\` command line option include an embedded CPython interpreter to handle aspects of the language that are not determined when the program is compiled and must be interpreted at runtime, such as duck typing, exception handling, and dynamic code execution (the \`eval\` function and \`exec\` function or statement), along with those Python and native libraries that are needed for execution, leading to rather large file sizes. Nuitka's design heavily relies on the internals of the CPython interpreter, and as a result other implementations of the Python language such as PyPy, Jython, and IronPython cannot be used instead of CPython for the runtime interpreter and library. == Usage == Nuitka can be installed from the repositories of many Linux distributions. It can also be installed through \`pip\` and \`pip3\`, respectively. Compilation is done either with \`nuitka program.py\` or with Python itself (\`python -m nuitka program.py\`). == Web links == * Nuitka Project Website * Source code and manual on Github == Sources == Category:Source-to-source compilers Category:Software using the Apache license Category:Python (programming language) implementations ","title":"Nuitka"},{"id":"56115380","text":"Diana Frida Arón Svigilisky (February 15, 1950 – November 18, 1974) was a Chilean journalist and a member of the Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria party.Memoria Viva caso Diana Arón She was kidnapped, tortured and forcibly disappeared by agents of the Pinochet dictatorship. ==Biography== She studied at the Hebrew Institute and then journalism at the Catholic University, developed her professional practice on Canal 13, belonging to the same university.

It claims to be the oldest law enforcement agency in Maine. ==History== In 1867 Maine first employed \\"commissioners of fisheries\\", law enforcement officers charged with enforcement of fishing regulations in the state. By 1870 the title of this office had been changed to \\"fisheries warden\\"; over the next 60 years the number of fisheries wardens employed by Maine increased to more than 30. Following World War II the title of the office was again changed, to \\"coastal warden\\". Coastal wardens were organized into the Coastal Warden Service. In 1978 the force was reconstituted under its current name of Maine Marine Patrol. The Maine Marine Patrol is responsible for enforcement of state and federal fishing regulations in coastal and tidal areas of Maine, providing maritime security inside Maine territorial waters, and coordinating maritime search and rescue operations. It also supports the Maine State Police in \\"tactical boardings of vessels at sea or in port\\". Through an agreement with the United States Customs and Border Protection, the Maine Marine Patrol assists in border protection in the \\"grey zone\\", an area including Machias Seal Island which is the object of a two-century old territorial dispute between the United States and Canada. Since 2015 it has quadrupled the number of officers assigned to the grey zone due to a perceived increase in the potential for violence in the area. ==Organization and training== As of 2019, the Maine Marine Patrol is Commanded by the Colonel. His command staff is made up of, 1 Major who supervises the operations of the law enforcement bureau, and 1 Captain who supervises special services for the Bureau. Operationally, the Maine Marine Patrol is divided into six geographic sections that comprise two separate divisions. Division 1 covers the coast and inland areas from Kittery to Belfast Maine. Division 2 covers the coast and inland areas from Belfast to Calais/Lubec Maine areas. The divisions are commanded by a Lieutenant with three Sergeants that supervise a section staffed by one specialist (large boat operator) and seven marine patrol officers. Maine Marine Patrol Officers go through a stringent selection and hiring process. Once hired, a new officer must attend the Maine Criminal Justice Academy for 18 weeks of the Basic Law Enforcement Training Program. Upon graduation from the Academy, the officers first year on the job is spent completing his or her field and advanced training. Rank Structure of the Maine Marine Patrol Title: Colonel Major Captain Lieutenant Sergeant Specialist Officer ==Resources== The Maine Marine Patrol deploys a number of different types of equipment for patrol functions. These are 1 fixed wing aircraft for patrol and search and rescue functions. The aircraft is piloted by a licensed pilot who is a Marine Patrol Sergeant. Six large patrol Vessels made up of 2 46' high powered diesel patrol boats, 2 42' high powered diesel patrol boats, and 1 38' high powered diesel patrol boat as well as 1 35' high powered diesel patrol boat. These large patrol vessels, are operated by Specialists. This is a marine patrol officer that has been promoted to this position and has completed boat operators training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. Upon successful completion of this training the specialist has become a US Coast Guard licensed Boat Captain. Each Marine Patrol Officer is issued a marked extended cab 4 wheel drive pickup for patrol as well as a 21' high speed patrol boat for use with in their individual assigned patrol areas. ==See also== * Maine Warden Service ==References== Category:State law enforcement agencies of Maine ","title":"Maine Marine Patrol"},{"id":"56115421","text":"Sarah Shelton (1738–1775), was the first wife of Patrick Henry, the first Governor of Virginia. == Early life and marriage == Shelton was born and raised in her family's home of thirteen rooms in Rural Plains, in Hanover County, Virginia. In 1754 at age sixteen, Sarah and Patrick were married. Almost a year later, Sarah gave birth to her first child Martha and by 1771, the couple had six children together. == Mental illness == Sarah Shelton started to show signs of mental illness after the birth of her last child, Edward (whom many called Neddy). Patrick Henry's mother sent a letter to his sister which stated, \\"We feel Sarah is losing her mind after the birth of little Neddy\\". We know today that she was probably suffering from postpartum depression or puerperal psychosis. It is unknown when Sarah's private doctor strongly suggested that she be sent to the new Eastern State Hospital in Williamsburg, Virginia. However, her husband disagreed and did not want to send her to an asylum. He likely wanted to keep her home due to the horrible conditions and treatments. Patrick was politically active when he decided to keep his wife in confinement in the cellar of their home. Because of her husband's money and resources, she was able to avoid suffering the consequences of the poor laws. It was said that her behavior was so unmanageable that \\"she was confined in a cellar room, bound in a straightjacket, and attended by a servant.\\" According to research, it is believed that a female slave took care of Sarah in the cellar. There are very few documents about the confinement of Sarah likely due to the fact that her husband became the governor of Virginia and this secret was kept from society. After three or four years in confinement, Sarah died in the spring of 1775.

In 1897, the progressive women's Pioneer Club was due to move to 15 Grosvenor Crescent, but there was a split in membership after its founder Emily Massingberd's death that January, and many remained at the old location. The new location became the Grosvenor Crescent Club, which by 1900 was describing itself as \\"purely social\\". 3-10 Grosvenor Crescent is a Grade II* listed terrace of eight houses on the north/west side of the crescent, built after 1836 by Seth Smith, that were originally individual houses, before becoming offices and are now 15 flats, with underground parking. In November 2017, four of the residents, including Iouri Chliaifchtein, a financier, who bought his apartment for £18 million, and Oleg Smirnov who paid £15.7 million, were suing the management company (of which Chliaifchtein is a director) for alleged inadequate levels of concierge staff. They were opposed by Simon Arora, whose family own three of the flats, who said that Chliaifchtein was being \\"completely unreasonable\\". Judge Nigel Gerald ruled in favour of Chliaifchtein, and agreed that two staff members should be on duty at all times (as had been the case until April 2015), and that the management company would have to pay the £320,000 legal bill.

Members of this gens are first mentioned toward the end of the second century BC, and several were distinguished as soldiers, but none of them ever attained the consulship.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, pp. 213, 214. ==Origin== The nomen Petreius belongs to a large class of gentilicia ending in -eius, many of which were Oscan or Umbrian, and derived from place names and cognomina originally ending in -as or -aes. However, in this instance it seems more likely that Petreius is a patronymic surname, derived from the Oscan praenomen Petrus or Petro.Chase, pp. 120, 121, 143. Since the first of the Petreii mentioned came from Atina, in Samnium, it seems likely that the family was of Samnite origin.Pliny the Elder, xxii. 6. ==Praenomina== The only praenomina used by the Petreii appearing in history are Gnaeus and Marcus. In inscriptions, Marcus, Gaius, Lucius, and Quintus are regularly found, while other names are hardly used. ==Branches and cognomina== None of the Petreii mentioned under the Republic bore any surname. Numerous cognomina appear in inscriptions, most of which are from imperial times, but none of them seem to represent distinct families. ==Members== * Gnaeus Petreius, a native of Atina, was a senior centurion serving in the army of the consul Quintus Lutatius Catulus during the Cimbrian War in 102 BC. He was decorated for his skill and bravery, which saved his legion from destruction.PW, \\"Petreius\\", No. 4. * Marcus Petreius, praetor in an uncertain year, commanded the Republican forces during the decisive battle against Catiline in 62 BC. He was legate under Pompeius in Hispania from 55 until defeated and captured by Caesar during the Civil War.

He served two tours during the Vietnam War, flying the F-105 Thunderchief and F-100 Super Sabre. He retired from the Air Force in 1979 after a career total of 286 combat missions. ==Early life and education== Buttelmann was born to German immigrants on June 26, 1929, in Corona, a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens. His first introduction to aviation was when he had a neighbor who was an American Airlines pilot. He began attending the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut in 1948, and he also served as a private in the 514th Troop Carrier Group of the Air National Guard, after having worked as a lifeguard to save for flying lessons. In 1950 he was called to active duty when the Korean War broke out. He then went to Big Spring Air Force Base in Texas and then Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada for three months of advanced gunnery training. ==Military career== Korean War alt=An F-86 fighter jet in flight He joined the 25th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Group in November 1952, where he had to be trained in air-to-air combat because he had only learned air-to-ground at Nellis. He was sent to Suwon Air Base, South Korea, on December 23, where he completed several check flights in the F-86 Sabre before doing his first combat mission on January 15, 1953. He flew in \\"MiG Alley\\", the nickname given to the area around the border between North Korea and China near the Yalu River where American pilots fought Chinese, Soviet, and North Korean MiG-15 planes. The war was winding down into a stalemate by the time Buttelmann arrived, so there were few MiGs in the skies. Because of this, he flew aggressively, venturing north of the Yalu, into Chinese territory, but he still only saw MiGs twice during his first five months, when he was a wingman. On his 50th mission, he came across a formation of MiGs but had to break off because he had reached \\"bingo\\" state, which meant he was below the minimum of fuel needed to get back to base safely. The airstrip was covered in clouds when he returned, and Buttelmann said he was lucky to have been able to land in those conditions while low on fuel. On June 19, his 55th mission and first as an element leader (which meant he was in the shooting position), he made his first kill. His fifth victory came on June 30, 1953, making him a flying ace. He was the USAF's 36th ace and the youngest ace of the war at 24 years and 4 days. On July 19, he was in a flight of four F-86s led by future astronaut John Glenn that ran into a group of MiGs. In the ensuing skirmish, Glenn, Buttelmann, and Glenn's wingman were each credited with a victory. Glenn said that \\"the MiGs' tactics were so poor I could only imagine it was a training flight, or they were low on fuel, but we were unbelievably lucky\\". In another flight with Glenn three days later, he scored his seventh and final victory—also the last day of aerial combat in the war. After coming home from Korea with 65 combat missions, Buttelmann returned to Nellis to serve as an instructor. Vietnam War Buttelmann was stationed at McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas when he was sent to Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand in April 1965, after the outbreak of the Vietnam War. As part of the 562d Tactical Fighter Squadron, he logged 46 missions in the F-105 Thunderchief during his four-month deployment. In May 1969, he returned for a twelve-month second tour of duty. In the F-100 Super Sabre, he flew 232 combat missions while commanding the Misty Forward Air Controllers and the 308th Tactical Fighter Squadron. He retired from the Air Force in October 1979 as a lieutenant colonel, having flown 286 combat missions over the two wars. ==Later life== Buttelmann (left), along with fellow aces Cecil G. Foster and Charles G. Cleveland, at Nellis Air Force Base in 2013 In May 2015, he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal by Nevada Senator Dean Heller for \\"his role as an American Fighter Ace during the Korean and Vietnam Wars\\". Buttelmann died on September 16, 2019, at the age of 90. He died in Frankfort, Illinois, where he and his wife, Audrey Buttelmann, moved in 2018. Buttelmann was one of two surviving Korean War aces when he died; the other is Charles G.

Multi-disciplinary architecture firm William Kaven Architecture proposed the complex as a potential part of the Broadway Corridor redevelopment project. The twin-towered skyscrapers would reach in height and would have become the tallest building in Oregon, the tallest twin towers in the Western Hemisphere and fifth-tallest in the world. A significant obstacle to the proposal was that current zoning at the site limits building heights to . The proposal was not among the list of three finalists chosen by Prosper Portland (formerly known as the Portland Development Commission) in March 2018. == Background == In 2016, the Portland Development Commission, commissioned the redevelopment of the Broadway Corridor in the Pearl District of downtown Portland, Oregon. Included in the Broadway Corridor is the 14-acre USPS Portland Main Post Office site, bordered by Northwest 9th Avenue, Northwest Hoyt Street, Northwest Broadway and Northwest Lovejoy Street, which the city bought for $90 million dollars in 2016. The Broadway Corridor also includes Union Station. Portland-based architectural firm William Kaven Architecture, helmed by brothers Daniel Kaven and Trevor William Lewis, proposed a twin-towered skyscraper complex to replace the to-be-demolished postal building, potentially including a new high-speed rail system hub. The complex features two neomodern glass skyscrapers that would have reached a height of 970 feet and been connected by a sky-bridge that would be 680 feet high, featuring an observation deck and botanical garden. A significant obstacle to the proposal was that current zoning at the site limits building heights to just 400 feet, and the city council would have had to approve a major change to that element of the zoning for the proposal to be able to move forward. If built, the skyscrapers would have become the tallest buildings in Oregon, surpassing the Wells Fargo Center. In addition, it would have become one of the tallest buildings in the western United States, as well as the tallest by roof height, and the tallest twin towers in the Western Hemisphere. The architecture firm that designed the proposed towers hoped that it could become the proposed second headquarters of Amazon and stated that \\"[t]he towers are large enough to serve as a headquarters for a Fortune 100 company\\". The complex would have featured of space. However, Portland was not included in Amazon's shortlist of candidate cities for its planned second headquarters, announced in January 2018. In March 2018, Prosper Portland (the Portland Development Commission) revealed its selections for the three finalist candidates for redevelopment of the Post Office site, and William/Kaven Architecture's twin towers proposal had been eliminated. As a result, there was no need for the city council to consider the question of whether to approve the more-than-doubling of the maximum building height limit that the Twin Towers proposal would have required if pursued as proposed. == Notes  See also == *Architecture of Portland, Oregon *List of tallest buildings by U.S. state *List of tallest buildings in Portland, Oregon *List of tallest twin buildings and structures == References  External links == *Twin towers proposal for the USPS site redevelopment – William/Kaven Architecture Category:Pearl District, Portland, Oregon Category:Proposed skyscrapers in the United States Category:Residential skyscrapers in Portland, Oregon Category:Skyscraper hotels in Portland, Oregon Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Portland, Oregon Category:Twin towers ","title":"Broadway Corridor Twin Towers"},{"id":"56115750","text":"Cobblebank Station viewed from Coach Street, Cobblebank.

It has smooth, greyish bark, glossy green, linear to narrow oblong adult leaves, flower buds in clusters of up to fifty that are fused at their bases, greenish flowers and fruit in spherical masses.fruit cluster ==Description== Eucalyptus mcquoidii is a single-stemmed, shrub-like marlock or stunted mallee that typically grows to a height of or a tree to , but does not form a lignotuber. It has smooth pale grey and whitish bark. Adult leaves are linear to narrow oblong, the same shade of glossy green on both sides, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in clusters of between about twenty and fifty, the buds joined at the base on a cylindrical peduncle long. The individual buds are about wide, each with a narrow, more or less straight operculum long. Flowering has been recorded in April, October and November and the flowers are greenish yellow. The fruit form a spherical mass, each fruit with three valves that remain joined at the tip. ==Taxonomy and naming== Eucalyptus mcquoidii was first formally described in 2002 by Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper from a specimen collected by Brooker near Quoin Head in the Fitzgerald River National Park. The description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (mcquoidii) honours Nathan McQuoid, former Fitzgerald River National Park head ranger, for his assistance to the authors. Eucalyptus mcquoidii belongs in Eucalyptus subgenus Symphyomyrtus, section Bisectae, subsection Hadrotes because of its coarsely bisected cotyledons, erect stamens and larger, thick- rimmed fruits. The subsection Hadrotes contains ten species of which eight do not have oil glands in the branchlet pith. Together these eight species form series Lehmannianae, a group that has fruit with exserted valves that have fused tips even after the seeds are lost, a feature also shared with the distantly related Eucalyptus cornuta. Of the eight species in series Lehmannianae, four species (E. mcquoidii, E. conferruminata, E. lehmannii and E. arborella) have the buds in each axillary cluster, fused basally. ==Distribution and habitat== The Quoin Head marlock is found on coastal slopes, creeklines and cliff tops where it is only known from a small area at the type location near Quoin Head . ==Conservation status== This eucalypt is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and from only one or a few locations. ==See also== *List of Eucalyptus species ==References== mcquoidii Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Eucalypts of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 2002 Category:Taxa named by Ian Brooker Category:Taxa named by Stephen Hopper ","title":"Eucalyptus mcquoidii"},{"id":"56115821","text":"Wang Panyuan (; c. 1908 – 22 December 2017, aged 109) was a Chinese-Taiwanese painter.

He played every position on the school's football team, but was primarily a lineman. After his playing career he served as a line coach under Lou Little at Georgetown Hoyas from 1926 to 1929. From 1930 to 1933, DaGrosa was an assistant coach at Temple and attended the Temple School of Law. In 1936 he was an assistant with the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles. ==Holy Cross== In 1944, DaGrosa became the line coach and chief assistant at Holy Cross, succeeding Lud Wray. Due to head coach Anthony J. Scanlan's war work, DaGrosa led the team five days a week while Scanlan was only able to coach on the weekends. In 1945, DaGrosa was named head coach and given a three-year contract. That year, DaGrosa led Holy Cross to an 8–1 record, including a 46 to 0 defeat of rival Boston College at Fenway Park. Holy Cross received an invitation to the 1946 Orange Bowl, but lost to Miami 13 to 6. The following year, the team went 5–4, including a 13 to 6 upset of Boston College in the season finale. In 1947, Holy Cross started training camp with only ten players due to graduation and transfers. By October, injuries forced DaGrosa to ask a member of the school's baseball team who had never played football before to join the team. On November 5, 1947, DaGrosa stated at a testimonial dinner that \\"this would be the last year I shall be away from my family\\" (DaGrosa's family resided in Atlantic City, New Jersey while he coached at Holy Cross). On November 24, the school announced that DaGrosa would resign following the final game against Boston College. The Crusaders defeated Boston College 20 to 6 in his final game as head coach to finish the season 4–4–2. On March 7, 1948, Temple University announced that DaGrosa would serve as lead assistant to head football coach Ray Morrison. DaGrosa also served on the coaching staff of the northern team in the 1948 Blue–Gray Football Classic. ==Pennsylvania Athletic Commission== In 1949, DaGrosa was appointed to the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission. During his tenure he served as the commission's primary spokesperson. On May 9, 1950, DaGrosa announced that the Commission had stripped Jake Lamotta of his middleweight championship because Lamotta had failed to defend his title in 11 months and refused to defend it against top contenders Sugar Ray Robinson or Robert Villemain. The commission instead chose to recognize Robinson after he defeated Villemain on June 5 at Municipal Stadium. On April 2, 1951, DaGrosa announced the suspension of Ike Williams following Williams' failure to appear at a scheduled bout. On February 2, 1952, the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission chose not to go along with Indiana's suspension of World Heavyweight Champion Jersey Joe Walcott after Walcott failed to appear at an exhibition. DaGrosa called the suspension \\"unfair and arbitrary\\", as he had recommended to the Indiana commission that the fight be canceled due to Walcott's ill health. ==Death== In February 1953, DaGrosa suffered a heart attack which left him bedridden. He died on April 23, 1953, at his home in Philadelphia after suffering another heart attack. He left a wife, Mary Bennett DaGrosa, and two children, John and Ruth.John Ox Da Grosa Dies at Age of 51, Hanover Evening Sun, April 24, 1953 ==Head coaching recordReferencesExternal links== * Category:1902 births Category:1953 deaths Category:Colgate Raiders football players Category:Colgate University alumni Category:Georgetown Hoyas football coaches Category:Holy Cross Crusaders football coaches Category:Lawyers from Philadelphia Category:Pennsylvania State Athletic Commissioners Category:Philadelphia Eagles coaches Category:Sportspeople from Atlantic City, New Jersey Category:Sportspeople from Philadelphia Category:Temple Owls football coaches Category:Temple University Beasley School of Law alumni ","title":"Ox DaGrosa"},{"id":"56115876","text":"Xiaoyuan station () is a station on Line S1 of the Beijing Subway, it was opened on 30 December 2017. == Station Layout == {cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" rowspan=4 width=1003F style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;\\" colspan=2Side platform, doors open on the right - style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" width=100Westbound style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" width=350← towards Shichang (Terminus) - Eastbound  towards Jin'anqiao (Liyuanzhuang) → - style=\\"border-right:solid 2px black;border- left:solid 2px black;border-top:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" colspan=2Side platform, doors open on the right - style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"2F style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Concourse style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Faregates, Station Agent - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"G style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Entrances and Exits style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Exits A-B } == Exits == {  !rowspan=3 \\" !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:100px;\\"Exit !Destination - 30px5px20px5px 30px Longlin Rd., Zijin Rd., Jingxi Zijin Xinyuan Community - 30px5px20px5px 30px Longlin Rd., Zijin Rd., Jingxi Zijin Xinyuan Community } == References == Category:Beijing Subway stations in Mentougou District Category:Railway stations in China opened in 2017 ","title":"Xiaoyuan station"},{"id":"56115885","text":"Liyuanzhuang station () is a station on Line S1 of the Beijing Subway, it opened on 30 December 2017. == Station Layout == {cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" rowspan=4 width=1003F style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;\\" colspan=2Side platform, doors open on the right - style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" width=100Westbound style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" width=350← towards Shichang (Xiaoyuan) - Eastbound  towards Jin'anqiao (Shang'an) → - style=\\"border-right:solid 2px black;border- left:solid 2px black;border-top:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" colspan=2Side platform, doors open on the right - style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"2F style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Concourse style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Faregates, Station Agent - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"G style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Entrances and Exits style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Exits A-B } == Exits == {  !rowspan=3 \\" !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:100px;\\"Exit !Destination - 30px5px20px5px 30px Yongan Rd., Lianshihu West Rd. - 30px5px20px5px 30px Yongan Rd., Lianshihu West Rd. } == References == Category:Beijing Subway stations in Mentougou District Category:Railway stations in China opened in 2017 ","title":"Liyuanzhuang station"},{"id":"56115899","text":"Noklak is the youngest and the 12th District of Nagaland, located in the easternmost part of India.

It is the 25th overall episode of the series and is written by Greg Plageman & Patrick Harbinson and directed by Jon Cassar. It aired on CBS in the United States and on CTV in Canada on October 4, 2012. ==Plot== Root (Amy Acker) brutally interrogates Denton Weeks (Cotter Smith) over the location of the Machine, accusing him of having what she calls \\"bad code\\". To prove that Denton is \\"bad code\\", she allows Finch (Michael Emerson) to help Denton temporarily escape and pretends to be subdued. Once Denton realizes that Finch was involved with the creation of the Machine, he tries to kill Finch, but Root kills Denton instead after he reveals the Machine's location to be somewhere in Salt Lake City. Meanwhile, Reese (Jim Caviezel) continues to follow the trail of the missing girl supplied by the Machine in \\"The Contingency\\". Her name was Hanna Frey, a girl abducted outside a library. The one witness to the crime was Hanna's friend Samantha Groves, who informed the librarian (Margo Martindale) what she saw, only for the librarian to accuse Sam of lying, because she was in love with the man that Sam had accused. The experience started Sam down a path that would ultimately lead to her becoming Root. In the present, Reese and Carter (Taraji P. Henson) are able to locate Hanna's body and ensure a proper burial, learning that Root arranged to have her killer murdered. Using a book Root sends to the librarian each year, Reese is able to track Root to a cabin in Maryland. He arrives in time to find Weeks dead and Root gone, having taken Finch with her to Union Station. Finch leaves a clue to where he is being taken by using a tap code on a telephone handset. While Reese searches for Finch, Fusco (Kevin Chapman) investigates Alicia Corwin's murder. Fusco is able to steal some of Corwin's belongings and learns from a tapped conversation between Hersh and his boss of their search for Denton. Fusco alerts Reese with the information he discovers on Denton helping Reese to locate the cabin. Reese decodes the clue in order to follow and save Finch, but Root is able to escape before Reese can apprehend her. She later calls him to thank Reese for finding Hanna, but warns she will be back someday for Finch. ==Reception== Viewers In its original American broadcast, \\"Bad Code\\" was seen by an estimated 14.58 million household viewers and gained a 3.0/8 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a slight increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 14.28 million viewers with a 2.9/8 in the 18-49 demographics. With these ratings, Person of Interest was the third most watched show on CBS for the night, beating Elementary but behind Two and a Half Men, and The Big Bang Theory, second on its timeslot and fifth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind The X Factor, Two and a Half Men, Grey's Anatomy, and The Big Bang Theory. Critical reviews \\"Bad Code\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Phil Dyess-Nugent of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"A-\\" grade and wrote, \\"In its first season, brains were sometimes Person Of Interests problem. In its determination to be sophisticated and elliptical, the show was often too spare and cold. It's warming up a bit; Reese and his helpmates inside the police department get together and even yuck it up a little, and Bear, the Dutch-comprehending dog introduced last week, appears to now be a series regular. It's often a bad sign when a show that wants to be hard and tough softens its edges like this, with or without a dog. But for right now, the balance feels just about right. Considerable credit has to go to Michael Emerson, an actor so magnetic yet so heroically self-effacing that he can make self-sacificial nobility look sort of creepy.\\" Keysha Couzens of TV Overmind wrote \\"Thankfully, Person of Interest didn't decide to make the hunt for Harold into a cross-country road trip that lasted more than a couple of episodes. Finch is clearly both grateful and deeply touched that Reese decided to go after him even though he wasn’t supposed to.\\" Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.5 star rating out of 5 and wrote \\"Person of Interest really does a great job in giving a certain level of serialization of story while neatly coinciding with the case of the week. The blend of elements makes for a compelling treat to watch.\\" == References External links== * \\"Bad Code\\" at CBS * * \\"Bad Code\\" at TV Guide * Category:Person of Interest (TV series) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ","title":"Bad Code"},{"id":"56116190","text":"\\"Maple\\" is a song recorded by Japanese singer Shizuka Kudo for her fifteenth studio album, Jewelry Box.

The company was started in 1836 as the Ytteborg Brewery (Ytteborgs Bryggeri) and was located on Hausmanns gate (Hausmann Street). In the 19th century, the water in the lower part of the Aker River became too contaminated to brew beer, and the brewery needed more space. Therefore in 1897 the brewery relocated to new premises further upriver, above the town's Grünerløkka district at Upper Falls (Øvre Foss)—one of two waterfalls forming Vøyen Falls (Vøyenfallene, Vøyenfoss). The company also changed its name to Foss Bryggeri (literally, 'Falls Brewery') to reflect the new location. ==Ytteborg Brewery== The Ytteborg Brewery was founded by Nils Jensen Ytteborg in Christiania i 1836, with cellars below Old Aker Church. The Ytteborg Brewery was especially well-known for its Bavarian beer. After the operations were relocated upriver in 1897, the old cellars were used for various purposes, including vegetable storage during the Second World War. The cellars started deteriorating in the 1950s, when the cemetery at the church was expanded. ==New operations== In 1897, the brewery built a large factory at Vøyen Falls, where a brick factory (Øvre Foss teglverk or Foss teglverk) had been located, at what is today the level area and parking space between the old Ringnes Brewery and the Aker River. At the same time, the company changed its name to Aktieselskabet Foss Bryggeri. The address of the company was Thorvald Meyers gate (Thorvald Meyer Street) no. 9. The new brewery continued to use the old cellars at Old Aker Church, but later built its own cellars next to the new factory. The Foss Brewery was headed by Carl Theodor Ytteborg, who was the son of the original brewery's founder. The Foss Brewery produced the brands Bayersk Øl and Pilsener Øl, as well as Lands Øl, Bok Øl, Malt Øl, Vørter Øl, Kulmbacher Øl, Lager Øl, and Salvator Øl (launched on March 14, 1899). The brewery was very successful, and it expanded its production facilities. In 1899 it purchased the venue on Oslogate (Oslo Street) where the restaurant Oslo Spiseforretning is now located, and in 1900 it built the Hotel Continental and Theatercaféen restaurant, which the brewery leased to various restaurateurs. The Foss Brewery won a gold medal for its beer at the Paris world's fair in 1900. The company was the leading brewery in Christiania when Haakon VII became king in 1905. Haakon followed the Danish tradition by issuing royal warrants of appointment; the Foss Brewery was selected for royal appointment to supply beer, for which it received an exclusive right. With this, the brewery obtained the prestigious right to print the Norwegian royal crown on its labels and to add the term eneberettiget 'exclusive privilege' to its brands Bayersk Øl and Pilsener Øl. The Foss Brewery was very successful until it had economic problems during the First World War (1914–1918), when the raw materials used for brewing, some of which came from Germany, were rationed and the brewery was unable to obtain regular deliveries. As a result, the Foss Brewery was sold to the Schou Brewery in 1917 for NOK 1.5 million. The Schou Brewery had more product lines and was therefore able to manage better under wartime rationing. The Schou Brewery stopped using the Foss label in 1922. The brewery buildings at Vøyen Falls were torn down in the 1960s. ==References== Category:Breweries in Norway Category:Defunct companies of Norway Category:Grünerløkka Category:Companies established in 1836 Category:Companies disestablished in 1922 Category:1836 establishments in Norway Category:1922 disestablishments in Norway Category:Food and drink companies established in 1836 ","title":"Foss Brewery"},{"id":"56116397","text":"Bryce Brothers diamond optic, multi knob blown crystal stemware Bryce Brothers, also known as Bryce Brothers Company and Bryce Brothers Company Inc., was a glass manufacturing company originating in 1850 at Birmingham, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania that changed names and partnerships until being purchased by the Bryce family when it was moved to Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania, where they continued to produced blown crystal glassware until 1965. ==Origins== James Bryce, founder and patriarch of Bryce Brothers James Bryce had been working in the glass industry since he was ten years old when his father, who was dying of lead poisoning as a result of his own work with glass, asked his employer, Mr. Bakewell, owner of the Bakewell Glass factory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to apprentice his son, James with his company, Bakewell, Page and Bakewell. After working his way up to become one of several glassblowers, he would then spend 18 years as a journeyman.

The event was organized to address a 30-year rift between the Shabazz family and the Nation of Islam.https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/06/nyregion/after-30-year-rift- farrakhan-s-meeting-with-dr-shabazz-stirs-hope.html In 1988, he was named the National Student Minister of the Nation of Islam and assigned to New York City and Harlem's Mosque Number Seven. In 1991, he was named Minister of the legendary Mosque, from that base he became a leading Minister in the nation, lecturing at over 100 colleges and universities, frequently representing the NOI at churches, meetings rally's and on radio and television. In 1993 he settled a rap war between A Tribe Called Quest and Wreckx-N-Effect. He provided tremendous diplomacy during the East Coast, West Coast rap wars during the 1990s. In 1996 after the murder of rapper Tupac Shakur, Conrad who was at the time was known within the Nation of Islam as the 'Hip-hop minister', A Tribe Called Questorganized \\"Day of Atonement\\", to address issues of violent themes in hip-hop music. The Rappers summit invited key rappers. Its goal was to initiate a truce a peace summit between East Coast-West Coast rap rivalry. Invited were Rap group A Tribe Called Quest, Chuck D with Public Enemy (group), Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, model Bethann Hardison, and actor Malik Yoba. Bad Boy Records president Sean Combs, and his protege, rapper The Notorious B.I.G., so was rapper Tupac Shakur.http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/rappers-pe aceThe Notorious B.I.G.-summit-article-1.748414 In 1997 he studied at the Harvard Divinity School the theological writings of Howard Thurman. Thurman was an African- American theologian, civil rights advocate, author, philosopher, and educator. In the 1990s he started (CHHCHANGE), A Movement for Change, was said to focus on “conscious hip hop activism\\", and social empowerment for black youth. Conrad also hosted a popular radio talk show in the late 90s into the new millennium on New York City's African-American owned Inner-City Broadcasting, owned by one of his mentors Percy Ellis Sutton. He hosted New York Roundtable daily on WLIB and on the weekends Sunday Night Live on the networks flagship station WBLS. May 2001 -Conrad organized a hip-hop summit in Harlem at the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building on 125th Street to address critical and negative issues with Hip-Hop and to find ways to clean up rap music. Music industry executives were invited such as; Elektra, Motown, and rappers included was Fat Joe and Afrika Bambaata. Conrad was outraged when he felt that Reverend Al Sharpton had taken his idea, and that Al Sharpton the leader of the National Action Network in Harlem along with David Mays of The Source magazine were to \\"use the moral cover of the civil rights movement\\", said to divert from criticizing that rap is not in good taste, and lacks decency. Taking the Rap an article written by Peter Noel for the Village Voice on January 9, 2001 stated that Conrad was infuriated that Sharpton and the other black leaders did not address Sean Combs or Shyne Barrows both who were at the time symbols of gangsta rap. Conrad stated that the Hip hop summits organized by Al Sharpton were shams. Combs, Barrow and Anthony \\"Wolf\\" Jones were about to go on trial in New York supreme court in Manhattan for a shooting at Club New York in New York City that took place in December 1999. Conrad is quoted as saying \\"I'm challenging the civil rights establishment, who essentially have become hired guns\\". Muhammad is also quoted as saying \\"Is the civil rights movement for rent, for sale, to the highest bidder?\\"https://www.villagevoice.com/2001/01/09/taking-the-rap-2/ Russell Simmons did not support Conrad Muhammad's Hip-Hop summit. He organized a counter-summit hosted by Louis Farrakhan. Farrakhan who had ousted Conrad from Mosque No. 7 in Harlem. Russell Simmons at the time was considered to be rap's premier mogul. Simmons was quoted as saying, “I urge that you do not support open and aggressive critics of the hip-hop community (i.e. C. Delores Tucker, Bob Dole or Conrad Muhammad)\\". Conrad Muhammad is quoted as saying a New York Post article, “It is our community,” says Muhammad, “that is most hurting from the excesses of this music\\". “Contemporary rap has brought back ‘pimp’ style,” Muhammad told The Post. “Contemporary rap has brought back ‘pimp’ style,” Muhammad told The Post. He was outspoken against the use of the \\"N word\\" and quoted as saying Second, he decries the ubiquitous use of the “N”-word in commercial rap. “We have reinstitutionalized a word that the black community had fought to make persona non grata. Today, it is more popular than ever\\". In 2002, he ran for Congress, challenging veteran Democrat Congressman Charles Rangel, predicting that Harlem was becoming unaffordable for its longtime residents. Also in 2002, Conrad returned to his birth name Conrad Tillard. that same year, deeply influenced by Baptist theologian, Howard Thurman and several influential Christian ministers, including Bishop Frank M. Reid of the AME Church, Rev. William James, a legendary Harlem United Methodist Minister and Dr. Calvin o. Butts III, Tillard returned to Christianity.He is currently working on a book about his early life and ministry, his memoir, \\"In My Father's House: The Spiritual and Political Memoir of the Man Once Known as the Hip Hop Minister, Conrad Muhammad\\". He says about his book, \\"It was the golden age of Black Hip Hop. All the groups and things the youth like now I was right there in the middle of it and I can't wait to share my story through this book,\\" said Rev. Tillard. Conrad co-wrote and hosted Culture Shock a one- hour television program for WPIX channel 11 in New York City. A program that addressed negative imagery in the media in youth programming. The program won various awards, the National Council on Family Relations First Place Media Award, Platinum Best “Show Award”, and the “Aurora Award\\". In Bedford Stuyvesant, Conrad was a very socially and community-oriented Minister. As the Senior Minister, at The Nazarene Congregational United Church of Christ, he served on the Community Advisory Board, for the historic Boys and Girls High School. He funeralized police brutality victim Kiel Coppin, a Bedford Stuyvesant teenager with developmental issues, who was shot to death by police holding a hairbrush. He also worked to end violence among youth in the central Brooklyn, fair wages for NYC workers and in 2013 he made a spirited run for New York City Council in the 36th Council District. He was a key early clergy supporter of Barack Obama's historic 2009 campaign for president. During his tenure at Nazarene, the pulpit featured nationally renown Ministers, politicians, civil rights leaders and cultural icons. Dick Gregory, Wynton Marsalis, Harvard Law School professor Charles Ogletree, NAACP President Ben Jealous, Howard University Divinity School Dean, Yolanda Pierce and journalist George Curry are some of the individuals who came to Nazarene, during Conrad's tenure. He constantly said to his members, \\"I want to expose my people to the best minds, I want the youth of Bedford Stuyvesant to see that they can be rappers, but they can also be anything they want to be, they can be the best\\" ==Films== * 2017 – appeared in Digging for Weldon Irvine * 2006 – appeared in Hip-Hop: Beyond Beats & Rhymes ==Honors== * 2015 - 100 Outstanding African- Americans of 2015; * 2015 - received the Ecumenical Leadership Award by the Community Council of Medgar College CUNY * 2015 - Culvert News's Humanitarian Community Leadership Award * 2014 - From the Heart: Gift of Legacy National Philanthropy Day * 2013 - Distinguished Public Service Award KBOL Radio and Social Action Inc. * 2009 - \\"Pastor of the Year\\" in Brooklyn, New York by Church Women United * 2005 & 2006 by Beliefnet.com noted as one of “Leaders”, in the United Stateshttps://www.apbspeakers.com/speaker/conrad- tillard/https://iamcriticalmass.com/conference-2/speakers/ * 2005 & 2006 by Beliefnet.com noted as one of “Leaders”, in the United States * 2007 NAACP Community Service Award * 2009 - \\"Pastor of the Year\\" in Brooklyn, New York by Church Women United * 2009 - KBBG Citizen of the Year Award * 2009 - Iowa Legislature Community Service Award * 2009 Koob Collaboration Award Winner * 2007 NAACP Community Service Award * 2005 & 2006 by Beliefnet.com noted as one of “Leaders”, in the United States ==ReferencesExternal links== * *The Impact of Popular Culture - Tillard on C-Span *Student Minister Conrad Muhammad Tillard *Reverend Conrad B.

It is dated to the second half of the 7th-century, and is in part one of the oldest surviving wooden temples in India. The temple is the oldest surviving structure of the former capital of Bharmour, also referred to as Bharmaur, Barmawar, Brahmor or Brahmapura in historic texts. Its roof and walls have been repaired over the centuries and it looks like a hut, but the Himachal Hindu community has preserved its intricately carved wooden entrance, interior and ceiling that reflects the high art of late Gupta style and era. The design and a late Gupta script inscription below the brass metal goddess statue in its sanctum confirms its antiquity. The wooden carvings include Shaivism and Vaishnavism motifs and themes. ==Location== The Lakshana Devi temple is in southern part of Bharmour town, and is one of a cluster of Hindu temples built between 7th and 12th-century. It is set in the Himalayas, along the Ravi River and Dhaola dhar range.Reports of the Archaeological Survey of India: 1878-79, Alexander Cunningham, ASI, pages 109-112, It is about northwest of Shimla, about east of Pathankot (nearest airport, IATA: IXP), and about from Dalhousie. The town is on Indian Railways network at Bharmar (BHMR) station. ==History== Bharmour was the capital of Hindu mountain kingdom of Champa, also spelled Chamba. There is no known documented ancient history of the region, and the earliest records appear in the form of inscriptions and legendary texts dated to the second half of the 1st millennium CE. Another source that mentions pre-12th century Champa is the Kashmir text Rajatarangini. The capital was founded by Meru Varman, and a number of inscriptions in the town and elsewhere in the Chamba valley attest to his rule. The script used and other palaeographic evidence, states Hermann Goetz, dates him to around 700 CE. With the founding of a new capital, Meruvarman commissioned and inaugurated the Lakshana Devi temple. Bharmour is set in secluded mountain valley, one that was difficult to invade and raid. Remote areas such as Bharmour, states Ronald Bernier were \\"largely spared from the Muslim invasion\\". According to Goetz and other scholars, this lack of religious persecution may be the reason why Lakshana Devi temple and others in Bharmour have preserved for well over 1,000 years. Alexander Cunningham was the first archaeologist to visit the Lakshana Devi temple in 1839, who published his comparative analysis in Archaeological Survey of India report. Cunningham remarked, that \\"the pillars, architraves and the pediment of the doorway are all of wood, most elaborately and deeply carved\\". The door carvings have weathered and difficult to discern. In contrast, wrote Cunningham, the vestibule inside is well preserved and was \\"beautifully carved\\". Jean Vogel visited the Chamba state in the 1900s, and wrote about the temple in his Antiquities of Chamba State in 1911.J. Ph. Vogel (1911), Antiquities of Chamba State, Archaeological Survey of India, Vol. XXXVI, Superintendent Government Printing, India Date The Lakshana Devi temple is dated to around 700 CE based on the temple architecture, plan, artwork, style and the inscription found on the brass statue pedestal in its sanctum. The inscription states: The inscription mentions Meruvarman and three of his ancestors attested by other texts found in Himachal Pradesh. The reign of Meruvarman is generally dated to have begun in 680 CE. This, traced with other epigraphic and textual evidence, has helped date this temple to be either from late 7th-century or the early 8th. ==Description== The temple shows the Gupta era architecture and artwork in wood. It faces north and it currently has a rectangular plan with about external length and width. The temple sits on a square wooden jagati, about above the ground. The earlier versions of the temple had a combination of weight bearing wood and non-weight bearing stone walls. The external wall of the temple was later plastered with mud, reaching a current thickness of about . The entrance and the facade of the temple have been cleaned by the Archaeological Survey of India after 1950s, revealing the finer details that were not visible to Cunningham, Vogel or Goetz. It is similar to the late Gupta style, with three parallel panels surrounding the doorway flanked by river goddesses Ganga and Yamuna. Each band is separated by a thin carving of a floral scroll carved on a convex wood surface. The outer wooden band consists of reliefs of single females standing in tribhanga posture and of amorous couples. The middle wooden band features Ganga standing on makara on left and Yamuna standing on tortoise on right, with their attendants. Above them are a series of Hindu deities, including Shiva with Nandi, Vishnu Vaikunthamurti, four armed Vishnu and Skanda (Kartikeya). A goddess and god in this panel are not identifiable because their iconographic signs are too eroded. The inner panel forms the door frame of the entrance. The inner panel is carved with natural motifs such as leaves and flowers, two peacocks with their beak joined, and a pair of amorous couples in a mithuna scene. Lakshana Devi temple's mukhya-mandapa and sanctum door. Above the Gupta era-style carved temple entrance doorway, is a triangular pediment. This is notable for its intricately carved triangular pediment highlighting Vishnu and Garuda. This challenged the colonial era assumption that Shaktism, Shaivism and Vaishnavism may have been competing denominations in Indian history. The Lakshana Devi temple, along with other temples in Chamba valley, attest to all of these traditions being revered together in a Panchaupasana or Panchayatana style. The triangular pediment includes niches containing amorous couples in a range of courtship and intimacy (kama and mithuna) scenes. The temple interior currently has a sandhara plan found in the Hindu texts on architecture. It has an ardha-mandapa, a mukhya-mandapa, a circumambulation path and a rectangular sanctum, about by . The mukhya-mandapa is a gathering zone in front of the sanctum and marked by six square pillars, each with side. The pillars are in height. The roof is pitch gabled, topped with slates. The original roof extended up to the main entrance. A roof projection to act as a canopy was added by the Archaeological Survey of India to protect the Gupta era style wood carvings. According to Handa, the original plan of the temple may have been an open twin-tiered hansakara plan. The snow and weather may have led the community to add structure to protect the temple, modifying it first into a nirandhara plan of Hindu temple architecture, and therefrom to the current sandhara plan. The sanctum contains a 7th-century brass statue of Durga, locally called Lakshana Devi. She is shown with four arms, holding a trishula in one hand, a sword in another and a bell in third. Her left front hand holds the tail of the shape shifting deceptive buffalo-demon (Mahishasura). Her right foot is on the head of the buffalo-demon, as she kills the evil demon. ==See also== *Masrur Temples *Nachna Temple ==NotesReferences== Category:Durga temples Category:Tourism in Himachal Pradesh Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in India Category:Hindu temples in Himachal Pradesh Category:7th-century Hindu temples Category:Buildings and structures in Chamba district ","title":"Lakshana Devi Temple, Bharmour"},{"id":"56116481","text":"The Memorial Cup All-Star Team is an annual selection of the best players at the Memorial Cup tournament.

It was launched to the public at the April 2018 Auto China. The Terra is currently positioned in size between the X-Trail/Rogue compact crossover and Patrol/Armada full-size SUV. The car fills the position left by the third generation Pathfinder that sold between 2005 and 2012. It also replaces the Paladin in China. The name \\"Terra\\" is Latin for \\"earth\\". == Overview ==  Development  In 2011, when the development of the D23 Nissan Navara started, Nissan was considering to develop an SUV based on the Navara as the successor for the Nissan Paladin. At the early phase of the development, Nissan executives aimed the car for the growing Chinese and Middle East market. However, the development was halted between 2014 and 2015 as executives were undecided with the new SUV position in the segment, with the popular X-Trail sitting very close to the aimed segment. Terra had been planned to be launched in 2016. However there were several constraints in the development of the car which contributed to a delayed launch. In 2015, segment competitors Toyota Fortuner, Mitsubishi Montero Sport/Pajero Sport, Ford Everest, and the Isuzu MU-X had their new generation launched. Nissan's engineering team were surprised as the new iterations from the competitors were more advanced than they had expected. The development team had to stop the progress to evaluate and improve the details of the Terra to be able to compete. The development was also constrained by a new excise tax structure based on emissions introduced by the Thailand government, which forced Nissan to engineer the cleaner YS23DDTT diesel engine from Renault to the Terra. As a result, the Terra release was delayed by two years. The official details of the vehicle were eventually revealed in 15 March 2018 and was unveiled in the following month. According to Pedro Deanda, chief product specialist that supervised the development of the car, the Terra shares the front door panels, front hood bonnet and the door handles with the D23 Navara. The chassis and suspension was re-engineered to be shorter for comfort and maneuverability.  Engines  The Terra has three engine options: a 2.5 L QR25DE I4 petrol engine that produces at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm, a 2.3 L twin-turbocharged YS23DDTT or 2.5 L YD25DDTi I4 diesel engines that both produce at 3,600 rpm or 3,750 rpm and of torque at 2,000 rpm or 1,500–2,500 rpm respectively. The engines are mated to a 6-speed manual or 7-speed automatic transmission. The ground clearance is measured at .  Markets  On 28 May 2018, the Terra was launched in the Philippines. It gets a 2.5-liter diesel engine option. Compared to the Chinese version, it is wider, longer and seats 7 (compared to 5). It is offered in five trim options. The Terra was launched in Indonesia on 2 August 2018 at the 26th Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show. It has the similar specs as the Philippines version. The Terra was launched in Thailand on 16 August 2018. It uses the 2.3 L diesel engine option to comply with Thailand excise tax structure. The 2.3 L engine, YS23DDTT produces less CO2 pollution than the 2.5 L YD25DDTi engine, precisely 196 g/km which is lower than the 200 g/km limit regulated by the Thai government to get a 5% tax incentive. In Brunei market, the Terra was launched in early 2019, and offered in Mid, High and Premium models.

The West Midlands Green Belt is a statutory green belt environmental and planning policy that regulates the rural space within the West Midlands region of England. It is contained within the counties of the West Midlands, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire. Essentially, the function of the belt is to more rigorously manage development around the cities, towns and villages in the large West Midlands conurbations centred around Birmingham and Coventry, discouraging convergence. It is managed by local planning authorities on guidance from central government. ==Geography== Land area taken up by the belt is 224,954 hectares, 0.5% of the total land area of England (2010). Tracts of belt lie within the West Midlands county itself, notably Solihull borough, however the vast coverage of the belt completely envelops the county. The belt stretches from Stafford and Telford through to Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwick, and Rugby. There is a small isolated portion of belt separating Droitwich Spa and Worcester. The Stoke-on-Trent and Burton upon Trent/Swadlincote belts lie around 10 miles to the north. Due to the West Midlands belt lying across several counties, responsibility and co- ordination lies with the many local district councils whose land covers the belt, as these are the local planning government bodies. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Interactive map of green belt land Category:Green belts in the United Kingdom Category:Environment of the West Midlands (county) Category:West Midlands (region) ","title":"West Midlands Green Belt"},{"id":"56116533","text":"Lawrence Wallace \\"Litz\\" Rusness (June 14, 1891 – October 14, 1967) was an American football coach.

Opinion was divided, with some chiefs calling for a delay in legalization to allow them to make plans, while others were enthused about the economic advantages they expected to come with legalization. There was, however, broad consensus that cannabis regulations on Indian reserves should be left to the members of the community, rather than default to following the province's regulations. ==Specific nations== Oneida Nation In December 2016, the chief of the Oneida Nation of the Thames in Ontario stated that his community was applying for a cannabis cultivation licence.

He created the Warrior Dog Foundation, to provide care to dogs that have ended their service in battle front, and the Team Dog Online Training Community. == Career == Ritland joined the US Navy in 1996 and served 12 years as a US Navy SEAL. During that time, he saw action in Operation Iraqi Freedom and numerous special operations missions. A nearby marine mission in particular, had a detailed account of an explosive-detector dog alert to a grenade booby trap hidden in a doorway, saving the lives of the Marines assigned to the mission. Ritland then decided to work with similar dogs, and harness their abilities to defeat the tools of modern warfare. Due to that, Ritland became a Navy SEAL Multi-purpose canine trainer. After his service, Ritland served as the West Coast Navy SEAL Multi-purpose canine trainer. After his time on the west coast, he started Trikos International, which specializes in providing working K9s to celebrities, private individuals, and government agencies. He has over 15 years experience in importing, breeding, raising, and training multiple breeds of working dogs.

He has been asked to work with various pet companies like Dogtra, Oma's Pride Raw Dog Food, and TEFCO. He and his personal K9 collaborated in 2013 with Xbox to create Call of Duty: Ghosts, contributing to the creation of the character of the dog.  Online presence  In addition to its presence in social networks, Ritland provides online training to dog owners through the Team Dog Online Training Community. He is credited in helping mainstream the \\"Epstein didn't kill himself\\" internet meme at the end of an interview with Jesse Watters on Fox News. Ritland asked if he could give a \\"PSA\\". After being told that he could, he stated, \\"If you see the coverage [about combat dogs] and you decide I want one of these dogs, either buy a fully trained and finished dog from a professional or just don't get one at all. That, and Epstein didn't kill himself.\\" Ritland later stated his purpose for suddenly mentioning the phrase was to keep the Jeffrey Epstein story alive. According to The Washington Post, the meme gained a large amount of attention in the immediate aftermath of this interview. == Books and publications == Mike Ritland is a New York Times Best Selling author: * Trident K9 Warriors, Publisher St. Martin's Paperbacks, * Navy SEAL Dogs, Publisher St. Martin's Griffin, * TEAM Dog, Publisher G.P.

The federal Cannabis Act, legalizing cannabis for recreational use, came into effect on October 17, 2018. Each province and territory set its own laws for various aspects, such as the legal age, whether householders can grow cannabis and the method of retail sales. In 2017 the New Brunswick provincial government announced that crown-run NB Liquor would take charge of opening up to 20 cannabis stores in the province. Proposed new laws in the province included limiting adults to carrying 30 grams of cannabis (with no limit inside the home), and requiring that cannabis in the home be stored in a locked container or room. Smoking cannabis would be banned in public places. All of the plans and rules had been finalized for New Brunswick by early October 2018. (The rules for medical cannabis were not modified in any way.) The minimum age to use, buy, grow or possess cannabis for recreational use is 19. Cannabis must not be consumed in a public place or in a motor vehicle, whether it’s moving or not. Adults may buy up to 30 grams of cannabis from a Cannabis NB retail store, and possess no more than this amount in public, but there is no limit on the amount that may be possessed at an adult's home. Hotels and campgrounds can restrict the smoking and vaping of cannabis but not ban other methods of consumption. A household may grow up to four plants. Purchases may be made only through Cannabis NB, whether a store or e-commerce site; no advertising of the product is allowed. ==Usage== In 2013, 11 percent of residents reported that they consumed cannabis in the past twelve months, the third lowest in the country. In 2017, Statistics Canada reported that the province had the fifth highest per capita usage in the country of 20.46 grams per person. ==Privatization== On November 14, 2019, Finance Minister Ernie Steeves announced that due to a continually losing money since opening, the government has issued an RFP to find a private operator to take over Cannabis NB. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Report of the New Brunswick Working Group on the Legalization of Cannabis June 2017, Government of New Brunswick ","title":"Cannabis in New Brunswick"},{"id":"56116646","text":"The Klamath Theater Complex Fire, also known as the Bear Wallow Complex Fire, was the largest wildfire of the 2008 California wildfire season.

After moving to California to work at UC Berkeley in 1993, influenced by the West Coast landscape photography tradition, he learned to use large format cameras, and in the process created the website largeformatphotography.info. His growing interest for large format photography and the exhilaration of discovering the diversity of the U.S. national parks inspired him to try to photograph each of them with a large format 5x7 film camera. He made his permanent home in California.

On 17 October 2018, cannabis was legalized in Canada for recreational purposes. It was already legal for medicinal purposes, under conditions outlined in the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (ACMPR) issued by Health Canada, and for seed, grain, and fibre production under licence by Health Canada. The legalization for recreational purposes was achieved by the House of Commons passing Bill C-45, the Cannabis Act, which was then passed by the Senate on 19 June 2018. Legalization was effective on 17 October 2018. Persons aged 18 or older can possess up to 30 grams (1 oz) of dried or “equivalent non-dried form” in public. Adults are also allowed to make cannabis-infused food and drinks \\"as long as organic solvents are not used to create concentrated products.\\" == Summary == Although the Cannabis Act allows for legal use of cannabis, provinces and territories are allowed to enact restrictions and regulations regarding sale, distribution, and use of cannabis. For example, each province and territory set its own procedures for retail sales, and these vary as to ownership or retail outlets (by the provincial government or private enterprise) but all include an option for online sales. While each household is allowed to grow up to four cannabis plants from \\"licensed seed or seedlings\\", Quebec chose to be excluded from this aspect of the legislation so it is not legal in the province. Manitoba permits home growing only with a medical licence. While specific regulations vary among provinces and territories, there are some general rules regarding promotion, packaging, and advertising. Adult-use cannabis can only be sold in packages of a single colour without graphics other than the logo and a health warning. Cannabis companies in Canada are not allowed to promote themselves through TV commercials, billboards, or glossy magazine ads, sponsor people or events, or put their names on sports and cultural facilities. {  + !Province !Minimum age for use !Allows growing at home for personal use only !Home storage limit !Plants per household !Allows use in public !Sold by private retailers (under provincial government oversight) !Sold by public retailers (under provincial government oversight) !Sold by government run retail locations !Physical stores !Online sales !Transporting -  18 Yes None Four Only where tobacco may be smoked.

The minimum age to use cannabis is 18 (the federal minimum) which Alberta shared with Quebec until 2020, with all other provinces setting the age at 19. Alberta also planned to allow public smoking of cannabis, to fall under the same restrictions as public smoking of tobacco. The recreational use of marijuana was legalized Canada-wide on 17 October 2018. As expected, the minimum age in Alberta is 18 and sales are made at private enterprise stores licensed by Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis or from the government's web site. Retail stores licensed to sell cannabis must not also sell alcohol, tobacco or pharmaceuticals. The product available includes dried flower, milled flower, plant seeds, oil, capsules and pre-rolls. Edibles will not be legal until late 2019 at the earliest. The rules as to where cannabis can be consumed vary from city to city, but typically, Albertans can do so in their homes and in some public spaces where cigarette smoking is allowed, but cannabis use is banned in cars. Specific laws about driving under the influence of cannabis are in place. As of 10 January 2019, there were 17 (private enterprise) retail stores in operation. ==British Columbia== After public consultation, British Columbia released a provincial regulatory framework for the sale and use of cannabis for recreational use. The framework proposed the minimum age to possess, purchase and consume cannabis will be 19 years old, which is the same age to buy alcohol. There would be a government- run wholesale distribution model and for on-line sales, although private and publicly run retail stores would operate. Cannabis consumption would be allowed in any public area where vaping and smoking is permitted, however, if the area is frequented by children, cannabis would be banned. Drug impaired driving would continue to be illegal. In early October 2018, BC released its final set of rules and plans, replacing the July 2018 Interim Licensing Regulation. The new release provides specifics as to the licensing of stores and marketers, background checks, and enforcement methods and penalties for non-compliance by companies which have a license. The regulations include a maximum household possession limit of 1,000 grams (2 lb 3¼ oz) but only 30 grams (1 oz) in public, no smoking or vaping in indoor public places (except in designated rooms), provincial parks, near schools, in vehicles, on boats, near bus stops, and within six meters of any doorway, window or air intake. (There are fewer restrictions as to where cannabis for medical use may be consumed.) Cannabis products that are allowed to be sold include oils, such as capsules tinctures and topical products cannabis plants or cannabis seeds, cannabis products marketed for pets and soap or bath products containing cannabis. Initially, there was only one cannabis store in B.C. (Kamloops) operated by the government, but over than 100 private retailers had applied for licenses. Stores will require municipal consent prior to approval. As of 10 January 2019, there were only a few private enterprise retail stores in operation, in addition to the provincial cannabis store in Kamloops. ==Manitoba== In December 2017, Manitoba introduced the Safe and Responsible Retailing of Cannabis Act, detailing their plans for cannabis use and sales. The age for use would be set at 19, and communities would be allowed to opt- out of cannabis sales by plebiscite. Home-growing of cannabis would be prohibited. Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries would source all cannabis to retailers, where it will be sold in private-sector stores.Manitoba to ban home grown cannabis - Lift News By the time recreational marijuana was legal in Canada, Manitoba had firmed up its rules. The minimum age is 19, cannabis must not be smoked or vaped in public, home growing is not legal and individuals may carry up to 30 grams (1 oz) of cannabis while in public. Purchases can be made on-line or at the provincially licensed retail stores operated by private enterprise companies. In October 2019, Premier Brian Pallister announced plans to ban consumption of edibles in public in Manitoba by December. https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/pallister-pot-edibles-public-1.5309636 As of 10 January 2019, there were 16 (private enterprise) retail stores in operation. ==New Brunswick== In 2017 the government announced that home-run New Brunswick Liquor Corporation would take charge of opening up to 20 cannabis stores in the province. Proposed new laws in the province included limiting adults to carrying 30 grams (1 oz) of cannabis (with no limit inside the home), and requiring that cannabis in the home be stored in a locked container or room. Smoking cannabis will be banned in public places. All of the plans and rules had been finalized by early October 2018. (The rules for medical cannabis were not modified in any way.) The minimum age to use, buy, grow or possess cannabis for recreational use is 19. Cannabis must not be consumed in a public place or in a motor vehicle, whether it's moving or not. Adults may buy up to 30 grams (1 oz) of cannabis from a Cannabis NB retail store, and possess no more than this amount in public, but there is no limit on the amount that may be possessed at an adult's home. Hotels and campgrounds can restrict the smoking and vaping of cannabis but not ban other methods of consumption. A household may grow up to four plants. Purchases may be made only through Cannabis NB, whether a store or e-commerce site; no advertising of the product is allowed. As of 10 January 2019, there were 20 (government- run) retail stores in operation, but, apparently due to a shortage of product, had recently laid off some staff. ==Newfoundland and Labrador == In contrast with other Atlantic provinces, NL planned to allow cannabis to be sold by licensed private retailers, though distribution and regulation will be run by the province's crown corporation Newfoundland and Labrador Liquor Corporation. The purchase age will be set at 19. By October 2018, all of the plans and rules for recreational marijuana had been finalized. The province approved 22 retail stores, all privately operated, including ten by Dominion stores, but fully controlled and regulated by the NLC. Additional stores will be added after they are approved and licensed. The minimum age for use is 19. Cannabis is sold in dried flower, oil, and capsule form, in economy, midstream and premium quality levels. A maximum of 30 grams (1 oz) may be purchased at one time. Edibles will be legalized within one year. Although medical marijuana may be smoked or vaped in public where tobacco smoking is allowed, recreational cannabis may be consumed only inside private dwellings, or in yards attached to those dwellings, never in a public place or in a vehicle. An RV being used as a residence qualifies as a private dwelling but is subject to any rules placed by the campground operator. Adults may grow up to four marijuana plants per household. ==Northwest Territories== NWT planned set the legal age for cannabis use at 19. Smoking would be allowed on private property, and public smoking will be \\"restricted in certain areas\\". The plan was for the Northwest Territories Liquor Commission to manage all import and distribution of cannabis, through retail outlets and by-mail. Similar to alcohol regulations, communities would be able to hold plebiscites to opt-out of cannabis sales in their jurisdiction. By mid October 2018, the plan and rules for the NWT had been finalized. A full eight to 10 products are offered and this is expected to increase significantly over time. Initially, five liquor stores were selling marijuana and also bongs and other accessories. The Liquor and Cannabis Commission regulates all pot sales in the territory. Online orders from the government web sites can also be made, with the cannabis delivered by Canada Post. Stores operated by private enterprise companies will be licensed in future. There are restrictions as to where marijuana may be smoked. As of 10 January 2019, there were five (government- run) retail stores in operation. ==Nova Scotia== Legal purchase of recreational cannabis in thumb The province's plan was for cannabis to be sold alongside alcohol at current stores run by the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation. The age of purchase is set at 19. As expected, the legal age is 19 in Nova Scotia and only the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation (NSLC) is allowed to sell marijuana; all but one of the 12 stores are selling both marijuana and liquor products; there is a single store that sells cannabis products exclusively. On-line sales are also available through the NSLC web site. Each household may grow up to four marijuana plants. The limit on possession at any give time is 30 grams (1 oz). Just as locations for cigarette smoking are restricted by the Smoke Free Places Act, smoking or vaping of cannabis is also restricted, prohibited in many locations. Nova Scotia will also prohibit the use of cannabis in vehicles. As of 10 January 2019, there were 20 (government-run) retail stores in operation, but they were experiencing a shortage of product. ==Nunavut== Due to delays caused by the October 30th territorial election in 2017, Nunavut was expected to be the last territory to announce its legal cannabis framework. Sales are being made online, by phone and through agents of the Nunavut Liquor and Cannabis Commission (NULC). All of the product was initially provided by Tweed which offers 10 different strains of marijuana and lines like Leafs by Snoop. For some time, no stores will sell marijuana but private enterprise stores may be licensed in future. Communities will not be allowed to declare a prohibition on marijuana use but can refuse to accept a cannabis store. The minimum age for possession or use is 19. Restrictions on smoking the product are the same as for tobacco smoking. The NWT government was considering the legalization of lounges where cannabis may be consumed in a format other than smoking. No more than 30 grams (1 oz) may be bought at one time by an individual or carried in public. As of 10 January 2019, the only method of purchasing cannabis was the on-line provincial store. No announcement had been made about the plan for storefront operations. ==Ontario== A sign in Niagara Falls, Ontario reminding travellers en route to the Rainbow Bridge that cannabis cannot be taken across the Canada–United States border. The Ontario Cannabis Store (OCS), a Crown corporation of the Government of Ontario, is the sole legal wholesaler and online retailer for cannabis in Ontario. OCS was initially planned to open a network of retail stores across the province, with several key cities having at least one store open in time for legalization, but the plans were shelved after the 2018 provincial election by new Premier Doug Ford in favour of allowing licensed private retailers. The minimum legal age to purchase and use cannabis in Ontario is 19, and adults can carry up to 30 grams (1 oz) in public. Cannabis edibles are available for commercial sale, and homemade food and drinks can be made. Ontario's cannabis legislation allows for vaping and smoking the product in public wherever tobacco may be smoked. Home-growing is permitted, with up to four plants per household. In 2019, the government initially issued 25 retail licenses for brick-and-mortar stores to sell recreational cannabis; the selection was based on strict criteria and a lottery system. An additional 50 licenses were subsequently issued. By April 2020, the government planned to eliminate the lottery system and to begin issuing roughly 20 new permits per month to increase availability as part of the plan to combat sales by black market dealers.Ontario will scrap lottery system, move to expand retail cannabis market in 2020Ontario removing cap on number of pot shops, opening up market for retailers Retail on-line sales of recreational cannabis remained in the hands of the Ontario Cannabis Store, operated by the provincial government.Welcome to OCS ==Prince Edward Island== In December 2017, PEI announced preliminary regulations for the 2018 federal legalisation of cannabis. Per the plan, the Prince Edward Island Liquor Control Commission will administer all cannabis shops, which will be standalone stores, and the purchasing age will be fixed at age 19. A public survey was held in August and September 2017, asking residents their opinions on legal age, commerce, etc. The survey received over 3,000 responses. By early October 2018, all of the plans and rules for recreational cannabis had been finalized for PEI. The legal age for possession or use is 19 and there are many locations where cannabis consumption is prohibited, including in any vehicle or boat. Adults may also grow marijuana plants, up to four per household. The Highway Traffic Act will be amended to include cannabis intoxication in a motor vehicle, similar to alcohol. Adults may possess up to 30 grams (1 oz) of cannabis away from home but there is no limit to the amount kept in the home, if it is secure from access by those under age 19. The government's Prince Edward Island Cannabis Management Corporation, will operate four cannabis retail stores in 2018 in addition to their online store, selling dried cannabis, cannabis oil, seeds and seedlings. Additional stores may be added in future. No other entity is licensed to retail recreational cannabis in the province. Cannabis for medical use is still sold only by licensed producers; no change in this aspect has been made. ==Quebec== During the planning stages, the Société québécoise du cannabis was to be the only legal entity to transport or sell cannabis at the retail level. In contrast to the common age minimum of 19 in most provinces, in Quebec the age limit would be 21. Also home-growing would not be permitted. Under the newly elected Coalition Avenir Québec government, the Deputy Minister for Health in October 2018, Lionel Carmant announced that the Government will tighten the rules on cannabis consumption, including increasing the legal age to consume to 21 from 18. The age raise will take effect from January 1, 2020. In 2019, CAQ announced Quebec will also ban the sale of cannabis candies and desserts, including chocolate, because they believed that federal cannabis regulations didn't go far enough in protecting children from accidentally consuming the drug through these means. https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/cannabis-regulations-quebec- legal-1.5223723https://globalnews.ca/news/5679335/quebec-to-ban-sale-of- cannabis-candies-in-effort-to-protect-kids/ Twelve Société québécoise du cannabis stores opened on 17 October, and another three were expected to open within weeks. A full 150 different products are sold, in dried, fresh or oil format, but not edibles, as well as accessories such as vaporizers. On-line sales from the SQDC web site also commenced on 17 October. Adults may possess up to 30 grams (1 oz) of dried cannabis, the maximum allowed per purchase, but a full 150 grams (5¼ oz) may be kept in a household, regardless of the number of adult residents. While allowed under federal law, Quebec prohibits the growing of marijuana plants even for personal use. Under Quebec's law, it is prohibited to cultivate cannabis for personal use. The consumption of cannabis is heavily restricted; it cannot be used wherever tobacco smoking is prohibited, as well as in a long list of other locations. Some municipalities have restricted smoking in some or all public spaces, but this does not include Montreal. Impairment under the influence of drugs is illegal as it is for drunk driving. As of 10 January 2019, there were 12 (government-run) retail stores in operation, but due to a shortage of product, were open only Thursday to Sunday. ==Saskatchewan== In March 2018, the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority released its framework for distribution, sale and use of cannabis. This framework includes setting the minimum age for non-medicinal cannabis consumption at 19 years of age. Legislation is being considered to prohibit the possession by a minor. Consuming cannabis in public spaces will be prohibited and drug-impaired driving will continue to be illegal. The province will adopt the federal minimum standards around home production, including a limit of four plants per household. By October 2018, the rules and plans had been finalized. Under provincial cannabis legislation, the minimum legal age for purchase or use is 19, and recreational cannabis may not be consumed in public spaces or in any vehicle; other restrictions apply as to where the product may be consumed. An adult may carry up to 30 grams (1 oz) of cannabis. Driving while impaired is illegal, whether the cannabis is used for medical or recreational purposes. Adults may grow up to four marijuana plants per household for personal use; restrictions may be placed by landlords or condo corporations. Only six cannabis stores were open initially operated by private enterprise companies and licensed by the province; on-line purchases could also be made from the provincial web site. As of 10 January 2019, there were 17 (private enterprise) retail stores in operation, with 34 others still in the approval process. ==Yukon== For Yukon's proposed framework, the territory planned to have one government-owned physical store in the main city of Whitehorse, and online sales to reach more distant communities. The minimum age for cannabis use would be 19. By 17 October 2018, the Cannabis Yukon store in Whitehorse and the territory's ecommerce retail site were operating. They stocked \\"over 30 strains and 120 unique products including dried flower, milled flower, pre-rolled, oils and capsules\\". Product ordered on-line is delivered by Canada Post. The Yukon Liquor Corporation planned to set up a cannabis licensing board by spring 2019 to accept applications from private companies to operate retail stores. As of 10 January 2019, there was only a single (government-run) retail store in operation. ==First Nations Reserves== While various First Nations communities have differing approaches to the prospect of a legal cannabis economy, First Nations leaders have called for more local control of the cannabis economy on their reserves. ==See also== *Legal history of cannabis in Canada * Cannabis Act *Medical regulations in Canada * Canadian Criminal code (Cannabis) *Legality of cannabis by U.S. jurisdiction *Legality of cannabis by country == Notes References== Cannabis Laws by province and territory *Laws Category:Cannabis-related lists ","title":"Cannabis laws of Canada by province or territory"},{"id":"56116765","text":"Aasaram Lomate, () is a Marathi-language writer.

The year-riddle is one of the most widespread, and apparently most ancient, international riddle-types in Eurasia. This type of riddle is first attested in Vedic tradition thought to originate in the second millennium BCE. == Research == Studies have surveyed the exceptionally wide attestation of this riddle type.August Wünsche, 'Das Rätsel vom Jahr und seinen Zeitabschnitten in der Weltlitteratur', Zeitschrift für vergleichende Literaturgeschichte, Ser.

L. West, Indo-European Poetry and Myth (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007), pp. 370-74. . The riddle is conventionally thought to been eastern in origin,Archer Taylor, 'The Riddle', California Folklore Quarterly, 2.2 (April 1943), 129-47 (p. 135). though this may simply reflect the early date of writing in the east. A variety of guiding metaphors appear in the Year-riddle, and it can be helpful to analyse its variants on these lines.Archer Taylor, 'The Riddle', California Folklore Quarterly, 2.2 (April 1943), 129-47 (p. 132). It has been argued that 'versions usually express the conventional tropes of a given culture or society and indicate regional sources'.Živilė Gimbutas, The Riddle in the Poem (Dallas: University Press of America, 2004), p. 23. Year-riddles are numbered 984, 1037 and 1038 in Archer Taylor's English Riddles from Oral Tradition.Archer Taylor, English Riddles from Oral Tradition (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1951), pp. 370-73, 412-21. As a folktale motif, the riddle is motif H721 in the classificatory system established by Stith Thompson's Motif-Index of Folk-Literature.Hasan M. El- Shamy, Folk Traditions of the Arab World: A Guide to Motif Classification, 2 vols (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1995), p. 164 [H720]. ==Examples== Most year-riddles are guided by one (or more) of four metaphors: wheels, trees, animals (particularly human families), and artefacts (particularly architecture). The first three all make an appearance in the year-riddle that appears in several versions of the Tale of Ahikar. This story seems to have originated in Aramaic around the late seventh or early sixth century BCE.Ioannis M. Konstantakos, 'A Passage to Egypt: Aesop, the Priests of Heliopolis and the Riddle of the Year (Vita Aesopi 119–120)', Trends in Classics, 3 (2011), 83-112 (p. 84), DOI 10.515/tcs.2011.005. The relevant passage is lost from the earliest surviving versions, but the following instance, from a later Syriac version, is thought likely to represent the early form of the text: > [The king] said to me, “Aḥiḳar, expound to me this riddle: A pillar has on > its head twelve cedars; in every cedar there are thirty wheels, and in every > wheel two cables, one white and one black.” And I answered and said to him, > “(...)

Wheels and wheeled vehicles Ancient Indian sources afford the earliest attestations of the year-riddle: examples in the Rigveda are thought to originate c. 1500×1200 BCE. Their use of metaphors of wheels reflects the prominence of the concept of the wheel of time in Asian culture.Archer Taylor, English Riddles from Oral Tradition (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1951), p. 418. Hymn 164 of the first book of the Rigveda can be understood to comprise a series of riddles or enigmas.Martin Haug, 'Vedische Räthselfragen und Räthselsprüche (Uebersetzung und Erklärung von Rigv. 1, 164)', Sitzungsberichte der philosophisch-philologischen und historischen Classe der Köngl. bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu München (1875), 457–515.

Likewise, in the Mahabharata, the riddles posed to Ashtavakra by King Janaka in the third book begin with the year-riddle: what has six naves, twelve axles, twenty-four joints, and three hundred and sixty spokes?Annikki Kaivola-Bregenhøj, Riddles: Perspectives on the Use, Function, and Change in a Folklore Genre, Studia Fennica, Folkloristica, 10 (Helsinki: Finnish Literature Society, 2001), pp. 11–12; .Ioannis M.

A later Indic example using a similar metaphor is from the riddles ascribed to Amir Khusrau (1253–1325): Here the three hundred and fifty-five days of the year correspond to the twelve lunar cycles of the Islamic calendar year.Amir Khusro: The Man in Riddles, ed. and trans. by Ankit Chadha (Gurgaon: Penguin, 2016), notes. Trees and other plants A large number of variants (numbered 1037-38 in Archer Taylor's English Riddles from Oral Tradition) compare the year to a tree; indeed, 'riddlers rarely use the scene of a tree and its branches for other subjects than the year and the months or the sun and its rays'.Archer Taylor, English Riddles from Oral Tradition (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1951), pp. 412-21 (quoting p. 416). The tree is also the metaphor usually found in Arabic folktales.Hasan M. El-Shamy, Folk Traditions of the Arab World: A Guide to Motif Classification, 2 vols (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1995), p. 164 [H720]. The popularity of tree-imagery is thought to echo the widespread popularity of trees as a metaphor for the world or life in Eurasian traditions.Archer Taylor, English Riddles from Oral Tradition (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1951), p. 412. Most year- riddles of this kind can be thought of as containing some or all of the following components:Archer Taylor, English Riddles from Oral Tradition (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1951), p. 413 (citing Sigismund Szendrey, Ethnographia, 32 (1921), 71-73). {  + !code !component !alternative component !solution - A the tree  year - B twelve branches  months - C fifty-two flowers four nests weeks/seasons - D 365 or 366 leaves seven eggs days of year/week - E three or six eggs  Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost (one or two days each) - F twenty- four young birds  hours - G their sixty steps  minutes } Versions containing only parts of the tree occur across Eurasia, whereas the versions with the nests occur only in Europe.Archer Taylor, English Riddles from Oral Tradition (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1951), p. 413. Examples include this verse from the early eleventh-century Shahnameh: What are the dozen cypresses erect In all their bravery and loveliness, Each one of them with thirty boughs bedeckt-- In Persia never more and never less?.The Sháhnáma of Firdausí, trans. by Arthur George Warner and Edmond Warner, 9 vols (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner, 1905-25), I p. 308 [V.208.6-9]. To which Zāl responds First as to those twelve cypresses which rear Themselves, with thirty boughs upon each tree: They are the twelve new moons of every years, Like new-made monarchs, throned in majesty.

One Icelandic example is preserved in three early-modern manuscripts of the riddle-contest in the medieval Heiðreks saga and runs: 'Hvert er það þingið sem er með tólf blómstrum en í hvorju blómstri eru fjögur hreiður? En í hverju hreiður eru sjö fuglar og er sitt nafn sér. Hverjum getið? Tólf mánuðir, sex vikur, sjö dagar' ('what is that assembly which has twelve flowers, and in each flower are four nests? And in each nest are seven birds and each has its own name? How are they guessed? 12 months, 4 weeks, 7 days').Text and translation adapted from Jeffrey Scott Love, The Reception of 'Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks' from the Middle Ages to the Seventeenth Century, Münchener nordistische Studien, 14 (Munich: Utz, 2013) (with normalisation of the Icelandic to modern spelling). Love cites MSS AM 167b 8vo, AM 738 4to, and Lbs 1199 4to. Animals Human families Human families provide a guiding metaphor for a number of year riddles (numbered 984 in Archer Taylor's English Riddles from Oral Tradition), though almost never in English-language tradition.Archer Taylor, English Riddles from Oral Tradition (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1951), p. 370. Although only first attested in the roughly tenth-century CE Greek Anthology, the following Greek riddle is there ascribed to Cleobulus (fl. C6 BCE); even if it is not that ancient, the attribution to him would suggest that the riddle was thought of in Ancient Greek culture as itself being very old: Another example of the family metaphor is this French riddle, first published in 1811: The only English-language example of this kind of year-riddle found by Taylor was from Saba Island in the Antilles: 'A fader had twelve sons, de second one de younges'. — 'Twelve months of the year, de second one February'.Archer Taylor, English Riddles from Oral Tradition (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1951), p. 373. Other animals Eastern Europe and Asia exhibit a range of other animal metaphors for the year, usually involving a team of twelve oxen pulling one plough or gatherings of different species of birds.Archer Taylor, English Riddles from Oral Tradition (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1951), pp. 416-18. Artefacts A number of year-riddles use man-made objects as their controlling metaphor. For example, a modern Greek riddle invokes a cask made with twelve staves, and a Parsi riddle the contents of a chest. But most often these riddles draw on architecture,Archer Taylor, English Riddles from Oral Tradition (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1951), pp. 418-20. as in the following mid-twentieth-century example from central Myanmar: > Ein-daw-thar-lan: > set-nhit khan: > ta khan: thone gyait > ah phay eit > phwiṇ hlet ta gar: > lay: paut htar: > win bu twet bu bar yẹ lar: > Hnit > It is a beautiful house with twelve rooms and thirty people can sleep in > each room. There are four doors left open. Have you ever passed through > these doors? > A year.Maung Than Sein and Alan Dundes, 'Twenty-Three Riddles from Central > Burma', The Journal of American Folklore, 77 [no. 303] (January-March 1964), > 69-75 (p. 71). ==References== Category:Riddles ","title":"Year-riddle"},{"id":"56116849","text":"Ammayi Pelli ( Daughter's Marriage) is a 1974 Telugu-language comedy film, produced and directed by Bhanumathi Ramakrishna under the Bharani Pictures banner.

These include characteristic designs in neo-Russian style from major architects including Andrei Pavlovich Zenkov, Paul Gourdet, and others. Almaty is referred to as “The garden city” on account of its green plantations. During the 19th century, a large number of theatres, museums and apartment houses were built. The city’s apartment houses are called “Khrushchyovka” and “Stalinka” due to the peculiarities of architectural approaches in their construction. Vernogo ==History== Zenkov Cathedral, a 19th-century Russian Orthodox cathedral located in Panfilov Park, is the fourth tallest wooden building in the world.Ness, Immanuel. Encyclopedia of World Cities. M E Sharpe Reference, 1999. . Page 19. In 1854, the Tsarist government built a military fortification on the left bank of the Almaty river. The construction was supervised by Major Peremyshelsky and engineer-lieutenant Aleksandrovsky. By the autumn of the same year, construction work was completed. From 1855, Russian settlers began to arrive to the city. With their arrival, the area of Almaty began to develop rapidly, and a few prominent buildings were constructed during this time including the Little Stanitsa and the Tatar Slobodka. In 1856, the \\"State Garden\\" (now the Central Park of Culture and Rest) was built. In 1857, the first water mill was built in the area of the Tatar Sloboda. Almaty also began to develop industry and crafts, including breweries, and wool factories. On May 28, 1887 a major earthquake destroyed 1798 brick houses and killed 322 people. After the earthquake, numerous notable buildings were constructed including the House of the Regiment of Military Assembly, the Cathedral, the House of Public Assembly, and others. Старая Алма-Ата: ветер перемен In 1896, the Kyzyl Tan building was commissioned by the merchant Verny Iskhak Gabdulvaliev. The building is currently well known in Kazakhstan. Located on Zhibek Zholy Avenue, its structure is made up of lacy wooden cornices, figured columns on pediments, and scaly covering the dome crowned by a small spire. Its construction was concluded in 1912. The building was designed by architect Paul Gourdet, who is credited for most of Almaty’s urban architecture of the time. His approach to architecture involved a “new-Russian” style, which is evident in some of his designs including the Medical College, the Voznesensky Cathedral, the merchant Shakhvorostov's house, the former Women's College, the former City Orphanage, and numerous other buildings. Кто и когда построил «Кызыл тан» Andrei Pavlovich Zenkov is another prominent architect and major contributor to some of Almaty’s most notable buildings. He is credited to building Ascension Cathedral, the House of Gabdulvaliev (Tulebayev-Pasteur), the church house (on the north side of the Cathedral). He is also credited for redesigning the Men’s Gymnasium of Verny after it was destroyed by the 1887 earthquake. At the time, Zenkov was in charge of the construction projects of the Semirechye regional government. He developed the building’s wooden extensions. Professor of Architecture VA Nilsen noted that \\"... their architecture differs from the Tashkent original using stucco facades with a more subtle drawing of details carried out under the guidance of architect Gourde.” Нереализованные проекты А.Зенкова The Pugasov Manor The Pugasov Manor in Almaty is located on Kirov and Kalinin Street. In 2000, it became a restaurant under the same name. In 2004, the historic building burned down. In its place, a new building was erected preserving the original Pugasovka layout. French Consulate Almaty’s French Consulate was originally the house of the merchant dynasty of Shahvorostov. It is located on 99 Furmanov Street. The building was previously used as the commissariat of the Turkestan Territory, the Semirechensky sponge of the RCP (b), the medical school, the children's infectious hospital, the hospital, the medical museum and the US Embassy in Kazakhstan.

Teddy A and Nina received the most votes therefore immune from the next round of nominations. * : On Day 43, housemates nominated individually. The Head of House was not allowed to save and replace nominated housemates. *: On Day 49, the host, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, announced that two of the eleven evicted housemates will have the opportunity to return to the house (the following week) by having the majority of public votes. *: On Day 50, the host, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, announced that no housemate will be put up for the public vote. *: On Day 64, the Head of House was made to add another housemate for possible eviction. The Head of House added Miracle. *: On Day 71, Housemates were subjected to a challenge and then ranked according to their performance. Alex ranked 1st place, making her the Head of House and putting other housemates up for possible eviction. Thereafter, Alex randomly picked a chance card empowering her to save one housemate of her choice, as well as the housemate that ranked 4th place in the day's challenge. Nina was automatically saved because she ranked 4th in the challenge, and Alex chose to save Tobi *: On Day 78, Housemates voted Nina as Head of House - flouting Big Brother's directive to choose a housemate with the least experience as Head of House. On Day 79, Big Brother appointed Cee-C who then had the least Head of House experience, as Head of House. On Day 80, Big Brother made housemate select the Head of House of their choice, then Alex emerged the new Head of House ==Repechage== On Day 49, the Host, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, announced that two of the eleven evicted housemates will have the opportunity to return to the house (on Week 9) by having the majority of public votes. {  - !

Almost all the surviving medieval Scandinavian riddles occur in one section of the Icelandic Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks, in which the god Óðinn propounds around 37 riddles (depending on the manuscript),Alaric Hall, \\"Changing Style and Changing Meaning: Icelandic Historiography and the Medieval Redactions of Heiðreks saga\\", Scandinavian Studies, 77 (2005), 1–30, at pp. 9–10. though a riddle also appears in Þjalar-Jóns saga,'Þjalar-Jóns saga', trans. by Philip Lavender, Leeds Studies in English, n.s. 46 (2015), 73–113 (p. 79).See further Laurits Bødker, Brynjilf Alver, Bengt Holbek, Leea Virtanen, The Nordic Riddle: Terminology and Bibliography (Copenhagen: Rosenkilde and Bagger, 1964). and three medieval riddles about birds are known, first attested in a part of the manuscript Reykjavík, Stofnun Árna Magnússonar AM 625 4to from around 1500.Íslenzkar gátur, skemtanir, vikivakar og þulur. I. Gátur, ed. by Jón Árnason and Ólafur Davíðsson (Copenhagen: Møller, 1887), p. 29; for a facsimile see http://handrit.is/is/manuscript/view/AM04-0625.H. M. Burrows, 'Anonymous gátur' in Poetry from Treatises on Poetics, ed. by KE Gade & E Marold, Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages, 3 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2017), pp. 631-35. Unlike the Old English riddles, the riddles in Hervarar saga have a fairly tight stanzaic form, often with formulaic phrases like \\"hvat er þat undra, er ek úti sá  fyrir Dellings durum?\\" (\\"what wonder is that, which I saw outside, before the doors of Dellingr?\\"). The riddles in Heiðreks saga are well integrated into the genre of Eddaic poetry,Aurelijus Vijūna, 'On the Old Icelandic Riddle Collection Heiðreksgátur,' Scandinavistica Vilnensis, 9 (2014), 167-80; . and provide insights into Norse mythology, medieval Scandinavian social norms, and rarely attested poetic forms.Burrows, Hannah, \\"Wit and Wisdom: The Worldview of the Old Norse- Icelandic Riddles and their Relationship to Eddic Poetry\\", in Eddic, Skaldic, and Beyond: Poetic Variety in Medieval Iceland and Norway, ed. by Martin Chase (New York: Forham University Press, 2014), 114–35; Hannah Burrows, \\"Enigma Variations: Hervarar sagas Wave-Riddles and Supernatural Women in Old Norse Poetic Tradition\\", JEGP: Journal of English and Germanic Philology, 112 (2013), 194–216, , . They were also the subject of a seventeenth-century commentary by Björn Jónsson á Skarðsá.Philip Lavender, \\"Oedipus industrius ænigmatum islandicorum: Björn Jónsson á Skarðsá's Riddle Commentary\\", Gripla, 26 (2015), 229–73. The topics of the riddles in Heiðreks saga (in the order and with the solutions given in the R-manuscript, and with the numbering of the verses as given in Christopher Tolkien's 1960 edition) are: 44. ale, 45. bridge over a river under birds, 46. dew, 47. hammer, 48. bellows, 49. spiders, 50. leek, 51. obsidian, 52. nesting swans, 53. angelicas, 54. a dead snake on a dead horse on an ice floe floating down a river, 55. chessmen, 56. hnefatafl, 57. fire, 58. fog, 59. the húnn in hnefatafl, 60. shield, 61. ptarmigans, 62. daughters of Hlér (waves), 63. waves, 64. women of Ægir (waves), 65. duck nesting in the skull of an ox, 66. anchor, 67. waves, 68. piglets suckling a sow, 69. sow and unborn piglets, 70. cow, 71. falcon carrying an eider-duck to its mountain, viewed from a wall, 72. Óðinn riding Sleipnir, 73. 'What did Óðinn say in the ear of Baldr before he was carried onto the funeral-pyre?' _The Saga of King Heidrek the Wise_ , ed. and trans. by Christopher Tolkien (London: Nelson, 1960). The H-manuscript includes riddles on the following further themes: raven, dew, fish, waterfall; hail and rain; dung-beetle; arrow; sun; weaving; embers. The riddle of the sow with an unborn litter has a precursor in the Anglo-Saxon poet Aldhelm's enigma 84, 'De scrofa pregnante'.The Saga of King Heidrek the Wise, trans. by Christopher Tolkien (London: Nelson, 1960), pp. xix, 43 [verse no. 70], 90. But only two of the Heiðreks saga riddles seem to reflect the stock of folk-riddles known from more widely in Europe. One is an example of the famous cow-riddle:Cf. Antti Aarne, Vergleichende Rätselforschungen, 3 vols, Folklore Fellows Communications, 26–28 (Helsinki/Hamina: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 1918–20), II 60–172. The cow has four udders, four legs, two horns, two back legs, and one tail. The other is the so-called \\"Óðinn riddle\\", which is a variant of the international Rider-and-horse riddle:Archer Taylor, 'The Riddle', California Folklore Quarterly, 2.2 (April 1943), 129-47 (p. 142).Cf. Antti Aarne, Vergleichende Rätselforschungen, 3 vols, Folklore Fellows Communications, 26–28 (Helsinki/Hamina: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 1918–20), II 173–216. Becoming more widely known in the early modern period through printed editions of the saga, this riddle entered oral tradition. A modern Swedish children's variant of the same runs \\"vad har tre ögon, tio ben och en svans?\\" (\\"what has three eyes, ten legs and a tail?\\").Annikki Kaivola-Bregenhøj, Riddles: Perspectives on the Use, Function, and Change in a Folklore Genre, Studia Fennica, Folkloristica, 10 (Helsinki: Finnish Literature Society, 2001), pp. 13–14; . Indeed, the whole riddle-contest in Heiðreks saga seems to have become the basis for a Faroese ballad, Gátu ríma ('riddle ballad'), first attested from nineteenth-century oral tradition.Kershaw, Nora, Stories and Ballads of the Far Past (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1921), pp. 212-16. ==Modern period== With the advent of print in the West, collections of riddles and similar kinds of questions began to be published. A large number of riddle collections were printed in the German-speaking world and, partly under German influence, in Scandinavia.Frauke Rademann-Veith, Die skandinavischen Rätselbücher auf der Grundlage der deutschen Rätselbuch- Traditionen (1540–1805) (Frankfurt am Main: Lang, 2010) (PhD thesis, Münster University, 2004).

It was released by Pony Canyon as the album's second single on April 27, 2005. The song was featured as the theme song on the first installment of the Pretty Cure anime film series, Futari wa Pretty Cure Max Heart the Movie (2005), for which she also voiced the character of the Queen of the Garden of Hope. A separate edition of the single including an alternate version of the song, as well as another song from the movie performed by Mayumi Gojo, was released by Marvelous Entertainment on May 25, 2005. The coupling song, \\"Urunda Heart\\" served as theme song to the CX variety show, F2 Smile. ==Background and composition== \\"Kokoro no Chikara\\" was released two months following “Lotus (Umareshi Hana)”, Kudo's comeback single to Pony Canyon. It is a personal favorite of Kudo's; she regards the song as a blessing and lists the song's recording as a key moment in her rediscovery of her love for music. The song, described as an uplifting strings-heavy R&B-influenced; midtempo track, was written by Takahiro Maeda and composed, arranged and produced by H-Wonder. It was composed in the key of F major and Kudo's vocals span from G3 to C5. Lyrically, the song is about finding happiness from within.

Kremin was one of the awardees of The Taras Shevchenko National Literary Prize in 1999, for the book of poems called Pectoral. == Biography == Dmytro Kremin was born on 21 August 1953 in the village of Suha in the Irshava district of Transcarpathia (Zakarpattia region), Ukraine. He graduated with degree in Philology from the Uzhhorod National University in 1975. After graduation, he went to work in the town of Kazanka in the Mykolaiv region as a school teacher of Russian Language and Literature, and then of Ukrainian Language and Literature. Later, he worked for the Kazanka district newspaper. In 1979, Kremin moved with his wife Olga and a one-year-old son Taras to the city of Mykolaiv, which became a second home to the poet. There, he took a position of a professor for the Ukrainian Literature Department at the V.G.Belinskii National Pedagogical Institute of Mykolaiv (1979–1981). At this time, he served as the head of the Regional Literary Studio Dzherela (\\"Sources\\"). From 1981–1990 he was one of the department heads for the region’s biggest youth newspaper Leninske Plemia (\\"Lenin's Young Followers\\"). From 1991–2008, he was the editor second to the editor-in-chief as well as the head of the Culture and Spirituality department for the newspaper Ridne Prybuzhzhia (\\"Native Prybuzhzhia\\"), the main newspaper of the Mykolaiv regional government. From 2010 to the present he has been the head of the Mykolaiv Branch of the National Writers' Union of Ukraine and the editor-in-chief for the magazine Soborna Vulytsia (\\"Cathedral Street\\"). Kremin's poetry debut was in his student years on the pages of the literary journal Vitryla (\\"Sails\\") in 1970-1971. Later, there were publications in the magazine Ranok (\\"Morning\\") and in the Zakarpathian Komsomol press, and active participation in the work of a literary group at the Zakarpathian Branch of The National Writers' Union of Ukraine, membership in the editors' committee for this group as an editor in the poetry publications department, and contact and friendship with well-known figures in Transcarpathian literature who were central to the artistic life of the region—Petro Skunts, Ivan Chendei, and Felix Kryvin. At that time, Dmytro Kremin was acquainted with Vasyl Gusti, who introduced him to the poets' circles of the University, and to Mykola Matola, Ivan Petrovtsii, Petro Keshelia, Yosyp Kleiman, V. Demydov, A. Stepanian, Y. Zhelitski, and G. Fodor. Kremin is holder of the honorary title The Honored Worker of Arts of Ukraine (2016), a member of The National Writers' Union of Ukraine (1979), a member of The Association of Ukrainian Writers (1997), a member of The Association of the Pop Art Professionals of Ukraine (1999), the head editor of the literary magazine Soborna Vulytsia (\\"Cathedral Street\\"). He was the father of Taras Kremin, formerly a Ukrainian politician in the Mykolaiv regional government and currently the People's Deputy of Ukraine in the Verkhovna Rada. == Years of resistance == Artistic activism was subsequently curtailed during the Brezhnev era. When the government of the time took its search for those critical of the Soviet regime to Zakarpattia, Ivan Chendei was mocked and harassed for his book Bereznevyi Snih (\\"The March Snow\\") and his ingenious movie script for film director Serhii Parajanov's Tini Zabutyh Predkiv (\\"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors\\"). Petro Skunts was criticized for his poem Rozpiattia (\\"Crucifixion\\"). The publication of new books by Mykola Matola was cancelled. All printed copies of Felix Kryvin’s novel Podrazhanie Teatru (\\"Imitation of Theatre\\") were destroyed. According to D. Kremin, the arrests of members of the intelligentsia was purposeful and targeted; however, radical youth remained undeterred. Kremin’s appreciation of student volnytsia (\\"freedom\\"), his trips to Lviv with Ivan Chendei, acquaintanceships with Gryhorii Chubai, Mykola Riabchuk, Oleh Lysheha, Viktor Morozov, Volodymyr Ivasiuk, and Roman Bezpalkiv—all this positioned Kremin for resistance against the political system. When Kremin and Mykola Matola started their own press, they used an old typewriter to type the issues of their literary journal Skrynia (\\"Chest\\") and, later, a series of chapbooks. It was in this period that copies of Skyrnia came into the hands of the punitive departments of the government. As a result, the government brought criminal charges against both Kremin and Matola, and government repression of Kremin began. In early 1974, when Kremin’s first book was ready to be published, and among other texts the symphony-style pieces \\"Garden\\", “Paranoiac Zone ‘A’\\", “A Dance of the Travelling Fire\\", \\"Adam's Horses\\", and the poem \\"Memorandum of Gershtein\\" were included, a form of criticism popular at the time called \\"creative report\\" was organized for the student Kremin by the head of the Yurii Hoyda University Literary Studio and docent of the university at a special gathering of the Studio. The result was that the works by Dmytro Kremin were put under \\"microscopes\\" of criticism, and Kremin was accused of free-spirited thinking, being unclear, misunderstanding the use of imagery, and so on. The police subsequently threatened Dmytro Kremin with expulsion from the university. Kremin was saved by Dmytro Chepur, the president of the university.Uzhhorod National University: In Memory of Dmytro Chepur, October 30, 2013 Chepur admitted that Kremin's sources for his \\"incomprehensible writing\\" were in fact the poetic lyrics of the eminent Ukrainian poets Taras Shevchenko, Bohdan-Ihor Antonych, and Pavlo Tychyna, poetic figures Kremin admired and considered his literary teachers. == Books of poetry == * Travneva Arka (\\"May Arch\\") 1978 * Pivdenne Siayvo (\\"Southern Splendour\\") 1982 * Tanok Vohniu (\\"Dance of Fire\\") 1983 * Burshtynovyi Zhuravel (\\"An Amber Crane\\") 1987 * Shliah po Zoriah (\\"Pathway Beneath the Stars\\") 1990 * Skifske Zoloto: poezii (\\"Scythian Gold: poems\\") 1996 * Pektoral (\\"Pectoral\\") 1997 * Elehiya Troianskoho Vyna (\\"Elegy For Trojan Wine\\") 2001 * Litopys: Vybrane (\\"Chronicle: Selected Poems\\") 2003 * Atlantyda Pid Verboiu: Vybrani Poeziyi (\\"Atlantis Under the Willow Tree: Selected Poems\\") 2003 * Synopsys (\\"Synopsis\\") 2005 * Poliuvannia na Dykoho Vepra (The Hunt for the Wild Boar\\") 2006 * Litnii Chas (\\"Summertime\\") 2007 * Vybrani Tvory (\\"Selected Works\\") 2007 * Lampada nad Syniukhoiu (\\"A Candlelight Above Syniuha\\" in co-authorship with Andrii Antoniuk, the People's Artist of Ukraine) 2007 * Skifske Zoloto (\\"Scythian Gold\\") 2008 * Dva Bereha (\\"Two Shores\\") 2008 * Zamurovana Muzyka (\\"Walled-up Music\\") 2011 * Medovyi Misiats u Karfaheni (\\"Honeymoon in Carthage\\") 2013 * Lito Hospodnie (The Year of the Lord\\") 2016 * Skrypka z Toho Bereha (\\"A Violin on the Other Shore\\") 2016 * Sliozy Suhoho Fontanu (\\"Tears of the Dry Fountain\\") 2016 == Works of translation == Dmytro Kremin’s translations into Ukrainian: * from Russian, the poetry of Borys Pasternak, Andrii Voznesenskii, Eugen Evtushenko, A.

The federal Cannabis Act, legalizing cannabis for recreational use, came into effect on October 17, 2018. Each province and territory set its own laws for various aspects, such as the legal age, whether householders can grow cannabis and the method of retail sales. ==Legalization for recreational use== Canada's federal legislation enabling the sale of cannabis fixes the legal possession limit for adults at of dried cannabis, but permits the provinces to set the legal age for possession and regulations for distribution and retail sales of cannabis. A public survey was held in August and September 2017, asking residents their opinions on legal age, commerce, etc. The survey received over 3,000 responses. In December 2017 the PEI government announced preliminary regulations for cannabis in the province, with plans and rules for recreational cannabis finalized by October 2018. The legal age for possession or use is 19 and there are many locations where cannabis consumption is prohibited, including in any vehicle or boat. Adults may also grow marijuana plants, up to four per household. The Highway Traffic Act will be amended to include cannabis intoxication in a motor vehicle, similar to alcohol. Adults may possess up to 30 grams of cannabis away from home but there is no limit to the amount kept in the home, if it is secure from access by those under age 19. No other entity is licensed to retail recreational cannabis in the province, and cannabis for medical use is still sold only by licensed producers. The Prince Edward Island Cannabis Management Corporation (PEICMC, or PEI Cannabis) opened three retail outlets in Charlottetown, Summerside, and Montague on October 17, 2018, with a fourth in O'Leary opened January 25, 2019 due to construction delays. PEI Cannabis also operates an e-commerce site offering online sales with direct home delivery. In the first six weeks of legalization, Prince Edward Island topped per-capita spending on legal cannabis nationwide, with residents spending an average of $13.83 compared to the national average of $2.65.

In September 2018 PEI Cannabis announced that eight more suppliers had signed agreements with the provincial retailer. ==Usage== In 2013, 10.4 percent of residents reported that they consumed cannabis in the past twelve months, the second lowest in the country. In 2017, Statistics Canada reported that the province had the sixth highest per capita usage in the country of 18.95 grams per person. ==Criticism== The government's plan to operate only four retail outlets with only three suppliers was criticized by consumer groups, saying the plan would not provide enough access to legal marijuana to deter consumers from continuing to purchase from the black market. ==See also== *Legal history of cannabis in Canada ==ReferencesExternal links== *PEI Cannabis *Cannabis, Government of Prince Edward Island Category:Prince Edward Island law Prince Edward ","title":"Cannabis in Prince Edward Island"},{"id":"56117795","text":"During the 2009–10 English football season, Tranmere Rovers F.C. competed in Football League One. ==Season summary== Jamaica manager John Barnes was appointed as Tranmere manager in mid-June, but only lasted until October.

They achieved prominence first in Pisa, then in Sardinia, where they became rulers of Gallura. ==History== The first Visconti of note in Pisa was Alberto, who bore the title patrician. Alberto's son, Eldizio, bore the titles patrician and consul from 1184 to 1185. It was Eldizio's sons, Lamberto and Ubaldo I, who brought the family to the height of its influence in Pisa and Sardinia. Both of them carried the title of patrician and each served a term as podestà. In 1212, various factions (pro- and anti-Visconti) clashed for control over Pisa. In mid-January 1213, William I of Cagliari led a coalition of anti-Visconti forces to victory in battle near Massa over the combined forces of Lucca and the Visconti under Ubaldo. Afterward, Pisa divided power between four rectores, one of which was a Visconti. The Visconti of Sardinia continued to take a part in Pisan politics to the end of the century, but their influence there was greatly diminished after 1213. In Sardinia, Eldizio had married a daughter of Torchitorio III of Cagliari, who became the mother of Lamberto and Ubaldo. In 1207, Lamberto married Elena, the heiress of Barisone II of Gallura, thus securing control over the northeastern corner of Sardinia with his capital at Civita. In 1215, he and Ubaldo established their hegemony over the Giudicato of Cagliari in the south of the island as well. Through advantageous marriages, Lamberto's son, Ubaldo II, secured power in Logudoro for a time. By mid century, Pisan authority was unopposed in Sardinia, thanks to intermarriages between the Visconti family and the other great families of Pisa (Gherardeschi and Capraia) and Sardinia (Lacon and Bas-Serra). ==Visconti rulers of Gallura== *Lambert (1207–1225) *Ubaldo (1225–1238) *John (1238–1275) *Nino (1275–1298) – his wife Beatrice d'Este (d. 15 September 1334) married secondly on 24 June 1300 to Galeazzo I Visconti (1277–1328), Lord of Milan *Joanna (1298–1308), stepsister of Azzone Visconti of the Milan line ==References== * ","title":"Visconti of Pisa and Sardinia"},{"id":"56118080","text":"Hilbrand is both a given name and a surname.

The Regina Police Service noted that cannabis dispensaries are illegal nationwide, and clarified: \\"The fact that we have not laid charges (yet) with respect to marijuana dispensaries in Regina doesn't make them legal.\\" ==Regulations for recreational cannabis== After the passing of the federal Cannabis Act, the government of Saskatchewan released a framework for cannabis legalization in March 2018. The Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming (SLGA) was given the responsibility of overseeing retail and wholesale sales of cannabis, through a permitting process. The framework, quoted below, outlined how the province would regulate distribution, sale and use of cannabis, including the following: * Minimum age for non-medicinal cannabis consumption will be 19 years of age; * Zero tolerance for all drug-impaired drivers in the province; * Consuming cannabis in public spaces will be prohibited for public health considerations. Consumption will also be prohibited in schools and daycares. * Saskatchewan is introducing legislation to prohibit the possession of any amount by a minor. Possession of smaller amounts, by a minor, will be addressed primarily through ticketing and seizure of the cannabis, in accordance with the provincial Act. Possession of more than five grams will be a criminal offence subject to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. * The province will adopt the federal minimum standards around home production, including a limit of four plants per household. By October 2018, the rules and plans Saskatchewan had been finalized. Under provincial cannabis legislation, the minimum legal age for purchase or use is 19, and recreational cannabis may not be consumed in public spaces or in any vehicle; other restrictions apply as to where the product may be consumed. An adult may carry up to 30 grams of cannabis. Driving while impaired is illegal, whether the cannabis is used for medical or recreational purposes. Adults may grow up to four marijuana plants per household for personal use; restrictions may be placed by landlords or condo corporations. Only six cannabis stores were open initially operated by private enterprise companies and licensed by the province. ==Usage== In 2013, 10.1 percent of residents reported that they consumed cannabis in the past twelve months, the lowest in the country. In 2017, Statistics Canada reported that the province had the third lowest per capita usage in the country of 16.36 grams per person. ==References== Category:Saskatchewan law ","title":"Cannabis in Saskatchewan"},{"id":"56118111","text":"Cannabis in the Northwest Territories became legal when the national Cannabis Act went into force on 17 October 2018.

The main reasons for criticism is that Grudinin is a businessman, that he is representative of the \\"bourgeois class\\" which Communism is ideologically opposed to, and that Pavel Grudinin previously was a member of United Russia. Grudinin faced overwhelming criticism from the Russian state media as his campaign was proving to be more successful than other challengers to the sitting President, as indicated by an Electoral Preference Poll, conducted by VCIOM Research Center three weeks before the results of the election, where Grudinin was placed firmly as a distant runner-up to Putin. Primarily, the media focused on his foreign monetary assets not being disclosed to the public, which, given his already established reputation as a wealthy businessman, hinted at the fraudulent nature of his Communist beliefs and ideology. Some segments directly accused him of lying and trying to hide his assets from the nation. Research undertaken by the Communist Party indicated that 80% of all TV coverage of Grudinin was negative. One Man Show: TV and Russian Internet Observation Diary of Russian Presidential Elections 2018 Commenting on the nomination of Pavel Grudinin, the leader of the party of Communists of Russia, Maxim Suraykin, who also intends to participate in the elections, said:КПРФ совершает огромную ошибку: Сурайкин о выдвижении Грудинина Sergey Mironov, leader of the social democratic party A Just Russia (which did not nominate any candidate for election, but supported Vladimir Putin) also criticized the nomination of Grudinin:Миронов считает выдвижение Грудинина на выборы политической ошибкой Foreign Bank accounts The reason for the criticism of Pavel Grudinin was the existence of his foreign accounts which he has not specified when submitting documents to the CEC for participation in election. Namely, 5 accounts in an Austrian Bank, one of which was 14,390,000 rubles, and securities for a total value of 7.5 billion rubles. However, when applying for registration as a candidate, he pointed out that these accounts have already been closed.ЦИК: Грудинин избавился от иностранных ценных бумаг стоимостью 7,5 млрд рублейПолитолог: Почему Грудинину пришлось лично ехать в Австрию, чтобы закрыть «транзитный счет»? However, this caused criticism Grudinina. So, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, commenting on the reports said the Communists finally turned in the direction of capitalism, as nominee on presidential election candidate–billionaire.Жириновский прокомментировал данные о зарубежном счете Грудинина в 5 млрд рублей Chairman of the Board of deputies of Leninsky District of Moscow Oblast Valery Ventsal sent a letter to Prosecutor General Yury Chaika, asking to check the availability of the foreign accounts of the candidate in presidents of the Russian Federation Pavel Grudinin, when he ran for Moscow Oblast Duma and the District Council of Deputies. Ventsal asks \\"to undertake a review in relation to Mr. P.Grudinin the fact that he had accounts in foreign banks at the time of the election campaigns in the Moscow Oblast Duma in 2016, and in 2017, to representative bodies of local self-government of urban and rural settlements of the Leninsky municipal district\\". He also requests to check on the fact of provision by Grudinin to the tax office information about the presence of his accounts and other assets in foreign banks, and in the case of any, verification of payment of the accounts of taxes in the budget of Russia.Генпрокуратуру РФ попросили провести комплексную проверку Павла Грудинина The Communist party explained that Grudinin in foreign accounts opened in the period from January to December 2017 for the treatment of relatives, was 37 million roubles, not 7.5 billion, as previously reported by some media.В КПРФ утверждают, что Грудинин не имел ценных бумаг на 7,5 млрд рублей On 2 February, CEC reported that Pavel Grudinin has 4 outstanding accounts with foreign banks, which were not informed by the Federal Tax Service: 2 accounts in Austria and 2 in Switzerland. Because of what Grudinin was summoned to the Central Election Commission. At the same time, according to the Deputy Chairman of the CEC Nikolay Bulaev, these are problems that are not unsolvable, and Pavel Grudinin said that he has no problems with Bank accounts.ЦИК: у Павла Грудинина есть четыре не до конца закрытых счёта вне РФ On 12 February, Nikolay Bulaev said that the still not resolved issues with the 2 accounts in Swiss banks. Accordin to article 37 of the Federal Law on Elections of the President of the Russian Federation, stating that \\"candidates must submit a written notice to that do not have accounts, store cash funds and valuables in foreign banks located outside the Russian Federation, does not possess or use foreign financial instruments\\". According to Nikolai Bulaev, Pavel Grudinin on 8 January 2018, presented such a document to the CEC, as well as another document, which was written on 4 February. But due to the fact that there are contradictions between the documents submitted by Pavel Grudinin and the information provided by the Federal tax service, the CEC may re-apply to the Federal Tax Service on issues related to Pavel Grudinin's accounts. At the same time, the Chairman of the Central election Commission Ella Pamfilova called on Pavel Grudinin to independently provide the CEC with information on the closure of all its foreign accounts. According to her, this issue is \\"extremely unpleasant\\", as Pavel Grudinin's opponents in this regard demand to cancel the decision on its registration and to withdraw his candidacy from election, and Grudinin's supporters accuse the CEC of excessive severity to him.У ЦИК остаются вопросы к швейцарским счетам Павла Грудинина: еще два? On 5 March, it became known that at the request of the Russian Federal Tax Service, the Swiss authorities reported 11 more Grudinin accounts in Swiss banks, one of which was opened in the form of precious metals, namely gold.Золото, но не партии After the appearance of information about these accounts, the CEC announced the holding of a special meeting on March 7, to address the issue of the revealed facts of false information filed by Grudinin during the registration of the candidate. Initially it was assumed that it was to withdraw from the election. However, at the meeting the CEC decided not to remove Grudinin, but at the same time, to add information about established facts of unreliability of data on accounts on the special information poster devoted to the candidate. Each candidate has such posters, they should be hung at polling stations on the election day, they contain information about the candidate, including information about the money.Избирателям укажут на зарубежные счета и золото Грудинина большой красной плашкой на плакатахЦИК отказалась добиваться снятия Грудинина с выборов Real estate in Spain On 2 February, appeared in the media information about the acquisition of family Pavel Grudinina home in Spain.

Born in Sant'Elia Fiumerapido, a small town in the Lazio region south of Rome, he spent most of his career in the north of Italy, primarily Turin and Bergamo. After initial musical studies in his native town, Bozzelli won a scholarship to the San Pietro a Maiella Conservatory in Naples where he specialised in composition. One of his earliest published works was an Ave Maria for orchestra, tenor soloist, and choir. His 1868 composition set to the poetry of Giovanni Prati was performed at the wedding of Umberto I of Italy and Margherita of Savoy in Turin on 22 April of that year. He later became deputy director of the Institute of Musical Studies in Bergamo and in 1871 moved to the Teatro Scribe in Turin as its resident conductor and composer. In 1873 he was commissioned by the Ministry of the Interior for the music for a funeral mass in memory of Charles Albert of Sardinia. Bozelli's three-act opera Caterina di Belp to a libretto by Orlando Ciani was performed at the Teatro Balbo in Turin in 1876. Bozzelli died in Turin and was buried in Naples.Petrucci, Giovanni (2011). \\"Giuseppe Bozzelli: il celebre musicista santeliano\\". Studi Cassinati, Anno 2011, No. 3.

After the war her father took part in the 1918 Kiel mutiny. She passed her school final exams (Abitur) in 1933, which at least for a man would have been expected to open the way to a university level education. Auer embarked on an apprenticeship in the book trade in which she then, till 1943, worked. On the day the war broke out, by which time she was working in a Berlin bookshop, she met the Austrian author and translator Eduard Zak whom she subsequently married. In 1943 she was conscripted for work in the munitions industry. War ended in 1945, leaving the western two thirds of Germany administered as four large military occupation zones. The easternmost of these, including the eastern half of Berlin itself, was administered as the Soviet occupation zone: it was in this eastern half of Berlin that Auer and Zak settled and made their life together. Directly after the war, however, it was not immediately apparent that the political division of the city implicit in the military divisions would become permanent and that, by the early 1950s, Berliners would no longer be able to move freely between the eastern half of the city and the other sectors. Between 1947 and 1948 Auer worked as a radio producer and broadcaster for RIAS, a radio station established and supervised by the US Information Control Division after it had become apparent that Berlin's existing radio station (in the part of the city administered by the Soviets) would be monopolised by Soviet broadcasters. In September 1948 Auer was asked to conclude a programme on John Steinbeck's novel, The Grapes of Wrath by pointing out to listeners that the social criticism which features prominently in Steinbeck novels was \\"possible only in the west\\". Unhappy at being caught up in the politics of the emerging east:west \\"culture wars\\", she refused and left her job, transferring to Berliner Rundfunk which was the principal radio station in Berlin's Soviet sector, remaining till 1950. In October 1949 the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched and rebranded as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic. Between 1950 and 1953 Auer was employed by the (East) German Academy of Arts in East Berlin where according to one source she was a \\"Section leader in the Poetry department\\" (\\"Fachgruppenleiter der Sektion Dichtkunst\\"). In 1953 she embarked on a degree course in German studies at Berlin's Humboldt University, but she was obliged to break off for health reasons. In or before 1964 she became a contributing editor with \\"neue deutsche literatur\\", a monthly literary newspaper. From 1966 she supported herself in East Berlin as a freelance writer. In her later years Auer became best known for her published essays, generally on literary themes. She also produced narrative works and worked as an editor. She became a member of the East German branch of PEN International in 1972. By this time, however, her life was not going well. She felt that she and her husband were increasingly targeted by the Ministry for State Security (Stasi). There was a sense in some quarters that despite having been generously funded by state stipends, she was not always aligned with the political establishment, and she was also finding herself ostracised by elements within the country's literary establishment. In a review of Christa Wolf's 1976 quasi-autobiographical book, \\"Kindheitsmuster\\" (\\"Patterns of Childhood\\"), Auer accused Wolf (who at this time enjoyed iconic status among many in East Germany) of \\"self-pity, self-importance, self-obsession\\" and, worse than any of these, \\"a deficient class perspective\\". Some said they detected inconsistency, disloyalty or misdirected personal ambitions on Auer's part. During her final decades Auer became increasingly isolated and lonely. There were nevertheless some friends and admirers who remained loyal and devoted to the end, most notably the writer Elfriede Brüning and, while he still lived, the cartoonist-satirist Herbert Sandberg. One of Auer's lifelong friends was Ella Kube Nomland, who visited her periodically over the years. Nomland immigrated to the United States in 1939, where she married noted architect Kemper Nomland, Jr. Most notably, Nomland was involved in a ground- breaking court case that enabled her to obtain her U.S. citizenship despite being both an atheist and pacifist.

Known for his studies on the therapeutics of Glioblastoma, Somasunderam is an elected fellow of all the three major Indian science academies namely, the National Academy of Sciences, India, the Indian Academy of Sciences and the Indian National Science Academy. The Department of Biotechnology of the Government of India awarded him the National Bioscience Award for Career Development, one of the highest Indian science awards, for his contributions to biosciences in 2006. == Biography == Madurai Kamaraj University-front view Kumaravel Somasundaram, born on 8 October 1962 in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu, graduated in veterinary medicine from the Madras Veterinary College and did his post-graduate studies at the Madurai Kamaraj University to earn an MSc in biotechnology. He continued at the university for his doctoral studies under the guidance of Kuppamuthu Dharmalingam and after securing a PhD, he moved to the US for his post- doctoral work which he did, first under Bayar Thimmapaya at the Northwestern University Medical School during 1993–95 and later, at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute of the University of Pennsylvania, working on DNA tumor viruses and tumor suppressor genes, supervised by Wafik El-Deiry from 1995 to 1999. On his return to India, he joined the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) as a member of faculty at the division of biological sciences, subsequently became an associate professor at the Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology and continues his association with IISc, serving as a professor. He also heads the research group, popularly known as Prof. Kumar Somasundaram's Lab. Somasundaram resides in IISc housing colony in Bengaluru, Karnataka. == Legacy == Glioblastoma - MR coronal with contrast Somasundaram's work is centered around the studies of oncoviruses, tumor suppressor genes, gliomas and microRNAs and he has done advanced research on glioblastoma, an aggressive form of cancer affecting the brain. The group led by him is engaged in work concerning the determination of the role of cellular tumor antigen p53 in glioma, regulating the protein, p73 in cervical cancer patients, using Adenovirus early region 1A, a tumor suppressor gene, the analytical study of BRCA1 gene in breast cancer and the analysis and regulation of SV2A, a synaptic vesicle protein. He demonstrated that glioblastoma spreads rapidly by producing macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) in large quantities which in turn stimulate the growth of blood vessels in the tumor. He proposed that the MCSF interacted with the anti-tumor microglial cells of the human body and induced them to produce Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1), thereby impairing the capacity of microglial cells to fight the tumor cells, a process he called befriending. The discovery of this new molecule, IGFBP1 and its role in glioma angiogenesis, led to a collaborative investigation which involved four research institutions namely National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Medical Sciences and Institute for Functional Genomics (INSERM) of the University of Montpellier, apart from the IISc. The research team led by Somasundaram and Phillipe Marin of INSERM validated the earlier findings and proposed a new therapeutic protocol for glioblastoma which targeted IGFBP1, rather than Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which earlier treatment methods attacked. The researchers, later, released their findings through a paper, Glioblastoma-derived Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (MCSF) Induces Microglial Release of Insulin-like Growth Factor-Binding Protein 1 (IGFBP1) to Promote Angiogenesis, published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. Work is in progress at his laboratory for developing biomarkers (twenty genes of which is named gene X, have already been discovered) for which detailed study is being conducted on microRNA, DNA methylation, modifications of chromatin and gene fusions. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and ResearchGate, an online repository of scientific articles has listed 178 of them. He has also conducted workshops including the Workshop on Next Generation Sequencing organized by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research in November 2013 and has delivered invited or plenary speeches at various conferences and seminars and the 5th annual meeting of the Proteomics Society, India held in September 2013 was one among them. Somasundaram is credited with the establishment of the first laboratory for molecular oncology at the IISc and his contributions are also reported in the establishment of a facility for genomics at the institute. He has undertaken many research programs in cancer biology which included the IISC initiative on Cancer Biology and Therapeutics. He serves as the principal investigator of the Genomics Programme of the IISc in collaboration with the New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative (NMITLI) of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and is the co-convener of the DBT - IISc Partnership Program for Advanced Research in Biological Sciences and Bio Engineering. He is a member of the DBT Neurobiology Task force of the Department of Biotechnology, sits in the editorial board of the ' journal published by Taylor & Francis and is a former member of the senate of the Indian Institute of Science. == Awards and honors == Somasundaram received the International Senior Research Fellowship of the Wellcome Trust in 2004. The Department of Biotechnology of the Government of India awarded him the National Bioscience Award for Career Development, one of the highest Indian science awards in 2006. The Indian Academy of Sciences elected him as a fellow in 2007 and he received the elected fellowship of the National Academy of Sciences, India, the same year.

He is best known for winning the 1983 running of the Cheltenham Gold Cup, when his trainer Michael Dickinson trained the first five runners home.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/2836223.stm == Background == Bregawn was foaled in 1974 in Ireland. His sire, Saint Denys, finished second in the 1962 running of the Irish 2,000 Guineas. His dam was unraced.http://www.pedigreequery.com/bregawn == Early career == Bregawn went into training with Chris Kinane in Ireland. He won a bumpers event in early 1979, then a maiden hurdle race at Limerick in December of the same year. On his sixth and final start of the 1979/80 season, he was sent over to Aintree, where he finished second in an amateur riders' handicap hurdle. After that run he remained in England and was transferred to the stables of Michael Dickinson. == 1980/1981 season == Switched straight to fences, Bregawn ran twelve times during this season, winning on six occasions. The victories came at Market Rasen, Catterick, Wetherby, Warwick, Newcastle and Aintree. He did however fail to complete the course on four occasions, and when he won at Warwick the Raceform representative reporting on the day, Ivor Markham, noted that \\"he is still inclined to go right at his fences and makes hard work of jumping.\\"Chaseform Note Book 1980/1981 Published by Raceform Ltd Bregawn had progressed enough to take his chance in the Ritz Club Handicap Chase at Cheltenham in March. He was leading in that event when falling three fences from home. The Timeform organisation stated that, \\"in our opinion Bregawn would have won had he stood up.\\"Chasers & Hurdlers 1980/81 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd In his final race of the season he won the Siematic Kitchens Novices Chase at the Aintree Grand National meeting. Bregawn did not have a regular rider during the season and was partnered by a different rider for each victory. == 1981/1982 season == Bregawn developed into a high class chaser during this season. He won four of his six starts and in his last run he finished runner up to his stable companion Silver Buck in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Bregawn's winning reappearance in a small handicap chase at Market Rasen was his only start before Christmas. He next appeared in the Peter Marsh Chase at Haydock Park, where he took advantage of the 19 lb in weight he received from Night Nurse, to beat that rival by five lengths. Bregawn ran again a week later in the Great Yorkshire Chase at Doncaster. On his previous two starts he had been ridden by Graham Bradley and Robert Earnshaw, who were both attached to the Dickinson yard. At Doncaster John Francome was aboard. Bregawn started the 11/8 favourite on the strength of his victory the previous weekend. He led four fences from home and won by two and a half lengths from Megan's Boy. With a growing reputation, Bregawn made another quick reappearance seven days later in the Freshfields Holidays Handicap Chase at Sandown. With Robert Earnshaw back on board, Bregawn started the 3/1 favourite, went into the lead five fences form home and beat Saint Fillans by five lengths. Night Nurse, who was concededing 20 lb in weight to Bregawn, was a further two lengths back in third. Bregawn was next seen in the Greenall Whitley Chase at Haydock Park in early March. Starting the 11/10 favourite, he failed by a length to concede 9 lb to the winner Scot Lane, running on strongly late on after being interfered with by a faller two fences from the finish. The Raceform representative was of the opinion that Bregawn, \\" must be considered an unlucky loser\\".Chaseform Note Book 1981/1982 Published by Raceform Ltd Bregawn's final appearance of the season came in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. This was the stiffest task of his career so far and he started at odds of 18/1 in a twenty two runner field. With Graham Bradley in the saddle, Bregawn was prominent all the way and he and his stable companion Silver Buck fought out the contest from two fences out. Silver Buck eventually came out on top by two lengths, with a twelve length gap back to the third horse home, Sunset Cristo. Bregawn finished the season with a Timeform rating of 174, one pound behind his stable companion Silver Buck, who was voted National Hunt Horse of the Year.Chaser & Hurdlers 1981/82 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd == 1982/1983 season == Bregawn ran seven times during this season, winning on five occasions, finishing the season with victory in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. After beginning the season with victory in a minor event at Newton Abbott in October, Bregawn was not hard pressed to win the four runner Rehearsal Chase at Chepstow in early November. Bregawn then lined up for the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury on the final Saturday of November. Ridden by his now regular rider Graham Bradley, Bregawn carried the second top weight of 11 stone 10 lb, 2 lb lower than the top weight, Night Nurse. Starting the 9/4 favourite, he fought out the later stages of the race with his stable companion Captain John, to whom he was conceding 10 lb. In an exciting finish, Bregawn made a bad mistake at the final fence, nearly unseating Bradley, and started the run-in three lengths behind his rival. He then found extra reserves to chase down and pass Captain John and passed the line three lengths ahead. Describing the performance, Timeform stated,\\" the closing stages of the Hennessy underlined Bregawn's battling qualities and his tremendous zest for racing.\\" Bregawn was beaten in his next start, the Tommy Whittle Chase at Haydock Park by his sole rival, the 1981 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Little Owl . Bregawn was said to have pulled a muscle and this would keep him out of the King George VI Chase. Bregawn was next seen on 24 February in the Jim Ford Challenge Cup at Wincanton. In a seven runner event, he started the 6/5 favourite and was beaten half a length by Comb's Ditch. The Timeform representative at the course reported that Bregawn was , \\" very much in need of the race - he looked quite distressed afterwards and blew very hard.Chasers & Hurdlers 1982/83 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd\\" A field of eleven lined up for the 1983 Cheltenham Gold Cup run on soft ground. Bregawn went off the 100/30 favourite ahead of Comb's Ditch at 9/2. Then came two of Bregawn's stable companions Silver Buck and Wayward Lad at 5/1 and 6/1 respectively. The Fred Winter trained pair of Fifty Dollars More and Brown Chamberlin came next in the betting followed by the other two Dickinson runners, Captain John and Ashley House. In a race famous for Michael Dickinson training the first five home, Bregawn went to the front at the fifth fence and remained ahead from then on, seeing off the strong challenges of stable companions Captain John and Wayward Lad in the later stages of the race. Bregawn passed the post five lengths ahead of Captain John, with a further length and a half back to Wayward Lad in third. There was then a large gap back to the other two Dickinson runners, Silver Buck and Ashley House. Bregawn ended the season as Timeform's best staying chaser, with a rating of 177, behind only the two-mile champion Badsworth Boy, another Michael Dickinson trained horse who received a rating of 179. Bregawn would never repeat the level of the form shown during this season. In referral to the Gold Cup performance, Graham Bradley is on record as saying, \\" I firmly believe that he was so brave that day and put in so much effort that he was totally exhausted. It blew his mind and, a bit like a boxer who wins a championship but gets badly beaten doing it, Bregawn just didn't want to go through the pain barrier again.'The Wayward Lad' Autobiography of Graham Bradley Greenwater Publishing 2000\\" == 1983/1984 season == Bregawn ran seven times during this season without winning. He often showed signs of temperament and even refused during the Jim Ford Chase at Wincanton. On other occasions he dropped himself out of contention and tried to pull himself up when tried in blinkers in the 1984 Cheltenham Gold Cup. The Timeform organisation, commenting on Bregawn's season, said that he, \\" fell from grace faster than Icarus\\", and their advice to punters was, \\" Bregawn is best left severely alone nowadays.Chasers & Hurdlers 1983/84 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd\\" == 1984/1985 season == Bregawn was trained in Ireland during this, his last season racing. His first run of the season was from the stable of Martin Cullinane, and the remaining three runs after being moved to the yard of Paddy Mullins. He won a handicap hurdle at Limerick in March, then was sent to England to run in the 1985 Cheltenham Gold Cup in which he was tailed off when refusing at the last. This was to be his final race. == Retirement == Bregawn enjoyed a long retirement at his owner's stud in Mylerstown, Ireland, spending much of his time out at grass with the owner's foals and yearlings. He passed away in 2007.https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Bregawn%2C+first+of+the+%27famous+five%27%2C+is+dead+at+the+age+of+34.-a0169530500 == References == Category:1974 racehorse births Category:National Hunt racehorses Category:Cheltenham Gold Cup winners Category:2007 racehorse deaths ","title":"Bregawn"},{"id":"56118499","text":"Thomas Gordon Walker was Dean of Achonry from 1907 until his death on 9 May 1916.

In 1993 he won a maiden race on his debut and then produced by far his best performance when he won the Group 1 National Stakes by ten lengths. In the following spring he won the Leopardstown 2,000 Guineas Trial but then ran poorly in the Irish 2,000 Guineas. He was then retired to stud and exported to New Zealand, where he had some success as a sire of winners. ==Background== Manntari was a brown horse with a white coronet on his left hind foot bred in Ireland by his owner Aga Khan IV. He was trained during his track career by John Oxx and ridden in all of his races by Johnny Murtagh. He was from the second crop of foals sired by Doyoun who won the 2000 Guineas and finished third in the 1988 Epsom Derby before becoming a successful breeding stallion whose other progeny included Daylami, Kalanisi and Margarula. Manntari's dam Manntika showed modest racing ability,winning one minor race fromseven starts. She was descended from the French broodmare Makada (foaled 1936) who was the female-line ancestor of many major winners including Danseur (Grand Prix de Paris), Top Ville and La Sega (Prix de Diane). ==Racing career== 1993: two-year-old season Manntari made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse on 8 August in which he started at odds of 4/1 and won by a length from the Dermot Weld- trained Peace Role. The colt was then stepped up sharply in class for the Group 1 National Stakes over the same distance at the Curragh on 18 September. The British-trained State Performer started the 4/9 favourite after winning the Chesham Stakes and the Rose Bowl Stakes, with Manntari next in the betting alongside Peace Role on 6/1. The other three runners were Musical Insight (also from the Oxx table), City Nights (third in the Futurity Stakes) and the Jim Bolger-trained Clifdon Fog. Manntari dominated the race, leading soon after the start and drawing right away in the last quarter mile to win by ten lengths from City Nights. The Independent's Richard Edmondson described the colt's win as \\"perhaps the single most devastating\\" performance seen in Europe that year, while Oxx admitted to being surprised by the colt's victory, given that Manntari had never been particularly impressive in training. Manntari was scheduled to end his season in the Beresford Stakes at the Curragh in October but was withdrawn from the race owing to the soft ground. He nevertheless went into the break as the betting favourite for the following year's 2000 Guineas. 1994: three-year-old season On his first run as a three-year-old Manntari contested the Leopardstown 2,000 Guineas Trial over one mile on 16 April and started the 8/11 favourite against six opponents. He took the lead from the start and kept on well in the closing stages to win by one and a half lengths and a head from Kly Green and Artema. The form of the race was boosted on 7 May when Artema won the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial. On 15 May, in the Irish 2,000 Guineas on heavy ground at the Curragh, Manntari started the 5/1 third choice in the betting behind the British challengers Turtle Island and Grand Lodge. He led from the start as usual but faded badly in the straight and came home last of the nine runners. ==Stud record== At the end of his racing career Manntari was exported to become a breeding stallion in New Zealand, where his last foals were born in 2004. The best of his offspring was probably the filly Shizu who won The Thousand Guineas in 1999. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1991 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Thoroughbred family 8-i ","title":"Manntari"},{"id":"56118585","text":"Jeanne Joulain in Lille in April 2008 Jeanne Joulain (22 July 1920 – 1 February 2010) was a French organist, concertist and music educator. == Biography == Born in Amiens, Joulain's first contact with music was made thanks to her musician parents. Her father, a teacher in Paris, played the violin and her mother was a piano teacher. So it's only natural that she should start playing the piano with her mother. In 1934, after a decisive meeting with the great pianist Raoul Koczalski, Jeanne Joulain entered the conservatory of Amiens. During her studies, she followed the classes of solfeggio, piano (class of Maurice Coze), cello (class of Mario Camerini, pupil of Paul Bazelaire), chamber music, orchestra, harmony, counterpoint, musical composition (classes of Pierre Camus, the director, himself a pupil of composition of Charles-Marie Widor, and organ when the class was created in 1936 (class of Colette Ponchel, one of the last pupils of Louis Vierne) where she won the first prizes. It was during this period that her pedagogical activity began, as she had to make several replacements for teachers of music theory, piano, cello, harmony and organ. In 1938, the grand organ of Amiens Cathedral was restored. After the inauguration concert given by Marcel Dupré, a small orchestra was formed to accompany Salvation. Jeanne Joulain was a member of this orchestra as a cellist and it was on this occasion that she was introduced to Marcel Dupré by Pierre Camus, the director of the conservatory. In 1943, after her first training at the Conservatoire d'Amiens, her desire to go further prompted her to enrol at the École César Franck, where she perfected in the same disciplines and obtained diplomas of piano (class of Jean Batalla), cello (class of Edwige Bergeron-Brachet), organ (class of Édouard Souberbielle and Abel Decaux) after two years. In addition, she won the diploma of musical composition (class of Guy de Lioncourt) after five years. In 1945, Jeanne Joulain decided to write to Marcel Dupré with the intention of taking private lessons. The latter, after having assessed her level, offered to prepare her to enter the conservatory. For two years, she attended the \\"petit cours\\" in Meudon and in 1947 she passed the entrance exam for the Conservatoire de Paris. where whe obtained the First prize of organ and musical improvisation in 1952 (class of Marcel Dupré).
