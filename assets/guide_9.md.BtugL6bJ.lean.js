The term generally applies to popular music, especially rock, R&B;, hip hop, dance, and pop. In these genres, the hook is often found in, or consists of, the chorus. A hook can be either melodic or rhythmic, and often incorporates the main motif for a piece of music.Davidson, Miriam; Heartwood, Kiya (1996). Songwriting for Beginners, p.7. Alfred Music Publishing. . ==Definitions== One definition of a hook is \\"a musical or lyrical phrase that stands out and is easily remembered.\\"Monaco and Riordan (1980, p. 178). Cited in Burns, Gary (1987). \\"A Typology of 'Hooks' in Popular Records,\\" Popular Music, Vol. 6, No. 1. (Jan., 1987), pp. 1‚Äì20 Definitions typically include some of the following: that a hook is repetitive, attention-grabbing, memorable, easy to dance to, and has commercial potential and lyrics. A hook has been defined as a \\"part of a song, sometimes the title or key lyric line, that keeps recurring.\\"Hurst and Delson 1980, p.58. Cited in Burns, Gary (1987) \\"A Typology of 'Hooks' in Popular Records,\\" Popular Music, Vol. 6, No. 1. (Jan., 1987), pp. 1‚Äì20. Alternatively, the term has been defined as and can be something as insubstantial as a 'sound' (such as da doo ron ron) but While some melodic hooks include skips of an octave or more to make the line more interesting, a hook can be equally catchy by employing rhythmic syncopation or other devices. A hook may also garner attention from listeners from other factors, such as the vocal timbre or instrumentation, as in the case of the Beach Boys' use of an Electro-Theremin in \\"Good Vibrations\\". Some hooks become popular without using any unusual elements. For example, in the song \\"Be My Baby\\", performed by The Ronettes, the hook consists of the words \\"be my baby\\" over the conventional I‚Äìvi‚ÄìIV‚ÄìV chord progression of the chorus. Hooks in hip hop almost always refer to the chorus between verses; as in the lyrics to \\"Ice Ice Baby\\", \\"check out the hook, while my DJ revolves it\\", that leads into the chorus itself. ==Use in market research== The hooks of a song may be used in market research to assist in gauging the popularity of a song based on the listener's ability to recognize the song's hook. Often radio stations conduct \\"call out\\" either on the Internet, via telephone, or a music test (either online or in an in-person setting) to conduct surveys. Stations may use the services of a professional \\"hook service\\" or prepare the materials themselves. In some studies, radio stations play the hook, typically 8‚Äì12 bars long, for audiences of up to 150 participants. The participants are then asked to rate the song on a scale from \\"dislike very much\\" to \\"like very much\\". Top 40 stations typically can't wait that long for results and have participants \\"call out\\" directly, by listening and rating different hooks.Cobo, Leila. \\"Radio Research: How Much does it Determine what Gets Played how often? Programmers Insist its Role is Valuable - and Misunderstood.\\" Billboard - The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment, vol. 114, no. 50, 2002. Studies such as these inform the radio station how popular current songs are or if the audience is \\"burned out\\" of a certain song. Market research based on hooks gives radio stations of all genres awareness of what their audience demographic wants to listen to, and is even used to test the musical boundaries of the audience. Some groups even release these research hooks on a single's CD release. ==Scientific research== A European consortium (including Utrecht University and the University of Amsterdam) studies the hook by using online games and the wisdom of the crowd to understand and quantify the effect of catchiness on musical memory. ==See also== *Catchiness *Lick *Refrain *Vamp *Theme *Ostinato *Earworm ==References== Category:Musical techniques ","title":"Hook (music)"},{"id":"830004","text":"The Coat of arms of South Australia is the official symbol of the state of South Australia.

The incident occurred during counter-insurgency operations against Malay and Chinese communists in Malaya ‚Äì then a colony of the British Crown. It was described as \\"Britain's My Lai\\" in Christopher Hale's Massacre in Malaya: exposing Britain's My Lai. Despite several investigations by the British government since the 1950s, and a re-examination of the evidence by the Royal Malaysia Police between 1993 and 1997, no charges were brought against any of the alleged perpetrators. ==Background== After World War II, the British returned to Malaya to recover control from Japanese military forces. During the war the British government had supported the guerrillas who continued to fight against the Japanese forces. However, following VJ Day in August 1945, many resistance units did not completely disband. These groups instead became the foundation for the independence movement against British rule in Malaya. Some guerrillas turned from agitation to communism and began targeting British commercial interests in the colony by attacking rubber plantations and tin mines. By June 1948, escalating violence and the assassinations of several prominent British landowners led colonial authorities in Malaya to declare an \\"Emergency\\". This gave the Malayan Police and government greater powers and flexibility in combating the insurgents. Although the British had extensive experience in jungle warfare, most recently in the Burma Campaign during World War II, military leaders had not formalized their experience into a specific jungle warfare curriculum.The Other Forgotten War: Understanding atrocities during the Malayan Emergency, digitalcommons.csbsju.edu; accessed 18 November 2015. Michael Gilbert, a member of the Suffolk Regiment, said his training \\"[was] teaching you how to march, how to handle a rifle, and how to behave in a soldierly manner.\\" Raymond Burdett, another member of the Suffolk Regiment, reflected on his experience; he said the trainers sought \\"to get us to follow instructions, not to question commands.\\" Basic training for these troops focused on infantry skills, not their ability to judge the appropriateness of orders in the context of international law. ==Killings== In December 1948, 7th Platoon, G Company, 2nd Scots Guards surrounded a rubber plantation at Sungai Rimoh near Batang Kali in Selangor. The civilians were then rounded up by the British soldiers. The men were separated from the women and children for interrogation. A total 24 unarmed men from the village were killed by automatic weapons fire. The only adult male survivor was a man named Chong Hong, who was in his 20s at the time. He fainted and was presumed dead. Other eyewitnesses included the victims' spouses and children, such as Tham Yong, age 17, and Loh Ah Choy, who was about seven at the time. ==Subsequent developments== In the 1960s, Denis Healey, the British Defence Secretary instructed Scotland Yard to set up a special task force (led by Frank Williams) to investigate the matter. An alleged lack of evidence gave the incoming Conservative government an excuse to drop the investigation in 1970. On 9 September 1992, a BBC documentary, an investigative report into the massacre titled \\"In Cold Blood\\", was aired in the United Kingdom and revealed fresh evidence. The documentary included accounts from witnesses and survivors, including confessions of an ex-Scots Guards soldier and interviews with the Scotland Yard police officers who had investigated the case. On 8 June 1993, with the help of the MCA Legal Bureau, a petition was presented to Queen Elizabeth II asking that justice be done. On 14 July 1993 a police report was lodged by three survivors, accompanied by the MCA Public Service and Complaints Bureau Chief Michael Chong. On 18 September 1993, however, Gavin Hewitt (Head of South East Asia Department of the Foreign Office, UK) stated that \\"No new evidence has been uncovered by the British authorities to warrant the setting up of another official inquiry into the alleged massacre of 24 villagers in Batang Kali‚Ä¶\\". On 30 December 1997, an investigation report was submitted to the Royal Malaysian Police Jabatan Siasatan Jenayah Bukit Aman. The case was closed on the grounds of insufficient evidence for prosecution. On 13 July 2004, the DAP, a Malaysian political party, raised the Batang Kali massacre in the Malaysian Parliament. On 25 March 2008, the family members of the massacre victims and several NGOs formed an 'Action Committee Condemning the Batang Kali Massacre' and submitted a petition to the British High Commission in Malaysia. The petition seeks official apology, compensation for the family members of the 24 massacre victims and financial contribution towards the educational and cultural development of the Ulu Yam community. On 30 January 2009, the Foreign Office in Britain rejected a call for an inquiry into the massacre of villagers.. On 24 April 2009, the British government announced that it was reconsidering this decision.. On 30 April 2009, The Independent reported that the British government had agreed to reinvestigate the massacre.. In January 2012, lawyers for the victims and their families were given Foreign Office correspondence and Cabinet Office guidance relating to the incident. ==Judicial review== Malaysian victims unsuccessfully petitioned Queen Elizabeth II personally - to re-open an inquiry into the massacre in 1993 and in 2004. They tried again in 2008 and didn't receive a reply from the British government until 2011 when the High Court agreed to review the case.Engelhart, Katie (December 2012). \\"Rule Britannia: Empire on Trial\\" , World Policy Journal. In May 2012 the judicial review on the British government's position was held at the High Court in London. On 4 September 2012, the High Court's judges in London upheld a government decision not to hold a public hearing into the killing. The Court also ruled that Britain was responsible for the killing in Batang Kali. In its written judgement, it said, \\"There is evidence that supports a deliberate execution of the 24 civilians at Batang Kali.\\" In March 2014, the UK's Court of Appeal announced it would make a ruling on whether a public enquiry will be held into the killings. The move was welcomed by families of the plantation workers who had died at Batang Kali. The British government had earlier rejected calls for a public hearing, a decision that was upheld by the High Court in September 2012. In November 2015 the United Kingdom Supreme Court ruled that the United Kingdom government was not obliged to hold a public inquiry into the 1940s killing of 24 Malayan villagers by a British army patrol, even though it may have been a war crime, because the atrocity occurred too long ago. An appeal to the European Court of Human Rights failed when the case was ruled inadmissible on essentially the same grounds in October 2018. ==See also== *List of massacres in Malaysia *British war crimes ==References== ==Further reading== *Short, Anthony.

He is known as a leading figure in the second wave of Detroit techno artists during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Pitchfork described him as a \\"techno pioneer.\\" He is the founder of the record label Planet E Communications. As of 2008, Craig has released over 200 singles and remixes under numerous aliases. He was nominated for the 2008 Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical for his remix of Junior Boys' \\"Like a Child\\". ==Early life== Carl Craig was born in Detroit, Michigan, on May 22, 1969. His mother is a teacher's assistant and his father is a post office worker. He attended Cooley High School, where he developed an interest in music. He learned to play guitar and later became interested in club music through his cousin Doug Craig, who worked lighting for Detroit area parties. After hearing Derrick May's radio show on WJLB, Craig began experimenting with recording on a dual-deck cassette player. Craig met someone who knew May and passed along a tape of some of his home studio productions. ==Career== Since 1989, Craig has released many recordings under a large number of aliases, including Psyche, BFC, 69, Paperclip People, and Innerzone Orchestra. Craig founded his own record label called Planet E Communications in 1991. Since then, it has released records by other artists such as Kevin Saunderson, Moodymann, and Kenny Larkin. His first studio album, Landcruising, was released on Blanco y Negro Records in 1995. In 1996, he released The Secret Tapes of Doctor Eich under the Paperclip People moniker. Elements 1989-1990, a compilation album which collected Craig's early material as Psyche and BFC, was also released in 1996. In 1997, he released More Songs About Food and Revolutionary Art. It was placed at number 29 on Pitchforks \\"50 Best IDM Albums of All Time\\" list. In 1999, he released Programmed under the Innerzone Orchestra moniker. Craig served as co-creator and artistic director for the Detroit Electronic Music Festival in 2000 and 2001. His subsequent dismissal by festival organizers caused substantial controversy within the Detroit techno community, igniting a high-profile campaign in his favor. In 2001, he filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit against festival producer Pop Culture Media. He released a reworked version of Landcruising, titled The Album Formerly Known As..., in 2005. In 2008, he released a collaborative album with Moritz Von Oswald, titled Recomposed, on Deutsche Grammophon. He returned as artistic director for the 2010 Detroit Electronic Music Festival. In 2015, he released a collaborative album with Green Velvet, titled Unity, on Relief Records. In 2017, he released Versus on InFin√©. Craig created a sound installation, titled Party/After-Party, which opened at the Dia Beacon art museum in March 2020. The culmination of a five-year-long engagement with Dia Beacon, it was his first foray into the art world. ==Style and influences== Mixmag called Carl Craig \\"a leading figure in Detroit techno's second generation,\\" while Exclaim! called him a \\"central figure\\" in the genre's second wave. Pitchfork described him as \\"techno pioneer.\\" He has approached techno using inspiration from a wide range of musical genres, including soul, jazz, new wave, industrial, and Krautrock, while his works have spanned ambient techno, breakbeat, house, and modular synthesizer-based stylings. In a 2015 interview, he cited The Electrifying Mojo, Prince, Kraftwerk, Juan Atkins, and Jeff Mills as the major influences on his music. Regarding the many positions he has held in the music industry (artist, producer, DJ, record label boss, and more), Craig has said, \\"I have a bad habit of getting my hands dirty in every little thing, and I really do enjoy it.\\" ==Legacy== Craig's 1992 track \\"Bug in the Bassbin\\", released under the Innerzone Orchestra moniker, was picked up by DJs such as 4hero, Goldie, and J Majik. In the United Kingdom, DJs started playing the track at 45 rpm instead of the intended 33 rpm. According to Now, the track \\"ended up providing inspiration and in many ways writing the blueprint for what drum 'n' bass was to become in England.\\" ==DiscographyStudio albums=== * Landcruising (1995) * The Secret Tapes of Doctor Eich (1996) * More Songs About Food and Revolutionary Art (1997) * Programmed (1999) * The Album Formerly Known As...

The magnetic amplifier was invented early in the 20th century, and was used as an alternative to vacuum tube amplifiers where robustness and high current capacity were required. World War II Germany perfected this type of amplifier, and it was used in the V-2 rocket. The magnetic amplifier was most prominent in power control and low-frequency signal applications from 1947 to about 1957, when the transistor began to supplant it.H. P. Westman et al, (ed), Reference Data for Radio Engineers, Fifth Edition, 1968, Howard W. Sams and Co., no ISBN, Library of Congress Card No. 43-14665 chapter 14 The magnetic amplifier has now been largely superseded by the transistor-based amplifier, except in a few safety critical, high-reliability or extremely demanding applications. Combinations of transistor and mag-amp techniques are still used. == Principle of operation == A saturable reactor, illustrating the principle of a magnetic amplifier Visually a mag amp device may resemble a transformer, but the operating principle is quite different from a transformer ‚Äì essentially the mag amp is a saturable reactor. It makes use of magnetic saturation of the core, a non-linear property of a certain class of transformer cores. For controlled saturation characteristics, the magnetic amplifier employs core materials that have been designed to have a specific B-H curve shape that is highly rectangular, in contrast to the slowly tapering B-H curve of softly saturating core materials that are often used in normal transformers. The typical magnetic amplifier consists of two physically separate but similar transformer magnetic cores, each of which has two windings: a control winding and an AC winding. Another common design uses a single core shaped like the number \\"8\\" with one control winding and two AC windings as shown in the photo above. A small DC current from a low-impedance source is fed into the control winding. The AC windings may be connected either in series or in parallel, the configurations resulting in different types of mag amps. The amount of control current fed into the control winding sets the point in the AC winding waveform at which either core will saturate. In saturation, the AC winding on the saturated core will go from a high- impedance state (\\"off\\") into a very low-impedance state (\\"on\\") ‚Äì that is, the control current controls the point at which voltage the mag amp switches \\"on\\". A relatively small DC current on the control winding is able to control or switch large AC currents on the AC windings. This results in current amplification. Two magnetic cores are used because the AC current will generate high voltage in the control windings. By connecting them in opposite phase, the two cancel each other, so that no current is induced in the control circuit. The alternate design shown above with the \\"8\\" shaped core accomplishes this same objective magnetically. == Strengths == The magnetic amplifier is a static device with no moving parts. It has no wear-out mechanism and has a good tolerance to mechanical shock and vibration. It requires no warm-up time. Multiple isolated signals may be summed by additional control windings on the magnetic cores. The windings of a magnetic amplifier have a higher tolerance to momentary overloads than comparable solid-state devices. The magnetic amplifier is also used as a transducer in applications such as current measurement and the flux gate compass. The reactor cores of magnetic amplifiers withstand neutron radiation extremely well. For this special reason magnetic amplifiers have been used in nuclear power applications. ==Limitations== The gain available from a single stage is limited and low compared to electronic amplifiers. Frequency response of a high-gain amplifier is limited to about one-tenth the excitation frequency, although this is often mitigated by exciting magnetic amplifiers with currents at higher than utility frequency. Solid-state electronic amplifiers can be more compact and efficient than magnetic amplifiers. The bias and feedback windings are not unilateral and may couple energy back from the controlled circuit into the control circuit. This complicates the design of multistage amplifiers when compared with electronic devices. Magnetic amplifier output waveform (violet) at about 50% saturation. Input (yellow) is 120 VAC 60 Hz. Magnetic amplifier output waveform frequency spectrumMagnetic amplifiers introduce substantial harmonic distortion to the output waveform consisting entirely of the odd harmonics. Unlike the silicon controlled rectifiers or TRIACs which replaced them, the magnitude of these harmonics decreases rapidly with frequency so interference with nearby electronic devices such as radio receivers is uncommon. == Applications == Magnetic amplifiers were important as modulation and control amplifiers in the early development of voice transmission by radio.H. F. Storm, Magnetic Amplifiers, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1955 page 383 A magnetic amplifier was used as voice modulator for a 2 kilowatt Alexanderson alternator, and magnetic amplifiers were used in the keying circuits of large high-frequency alternators used for radio communications. Magnetic amplifiers were also used to regulate the speed of Alexanderson alternators to maintain the accuracy of the transmitted radio frequency. Magnetic amplifiers were used to control large high-power alternators by turning them on and off for telegraphy or to vary the signal for voice modulation. The alternator's frequency limits were rather low to where a frequency multiplier had to be utilized to generate higher radio frequencies than the alternator was capable of producing. Even so, early magnetic amplifiers incorporating powdered-iron cores were incapable of producing radio frequencies above approximately 200 kHz. Other core materials, such as ferrite cores and oil-filled transformers, would have to be developed to allow the amplifier to produce higher frequencies. The ability to control large currents with small control power made magnetic amplifiers useful for control of lighting circuits, for stage lighting and for advertising signs. Saturable reactor amplifiers were used for control of power to industrial furnaces. Magnetic amplifiers as variable AC voltage controllers have been mostly replaced by silicon controlled rectifiers or TRIACs. Magnetic amplifiers are still used in some arc welders. Small magnetic amplifiers were used for radio tuning indicators, control of small motor and cooling fan speed, control of battery chargers. Magnetic amplifiers were used extensively as the switching element in early switched-mode (SMPS) power supplies,Abraham I. Pressman (1997). Switching Power Supply Design. McGraw-Hill. . as well as in lighting control. Semiconductor-based solid-state switches have largely superseded them, though recently there has been some regained interest in using mag amps in compact and reliable switching power supplies. PC ATX power supplies often use mag amps for secondary side voltage regulation. Cores designed specifically for switch mode power supplies are currently manufactured by several large electromagnetics companies, including Metglas and Mag-Inc. Magnetic amplifiers were used by locomotives to detect wheel slip, until replaced by Hall Effect current transducers. The cables from two traction motors passed through the core of the device. During normal operation the resultant flux was zero as both currents were the same and in opposite directions. The currents would differ during wheel slip, producing a resultant flux that acted as the Control winding, developing a voltage across a resistor in series with the AC winding which was sent to the wheel slip correction circuits. Magnetic amplifiers can be used for measuring high DC-voltages without direct connection to the high voltage and are therefore still used in the HVDC-technique. The current to be measured is passed through the two cores, possibly by a solid bus bar. There is almost no voltage drop in this bus bar. The output signal, proportional to the ampere turns in the control current bus bar, is derived from the alternating excitation voltage of the magnetic amplifier, there is no voltage created or induced on the bus bar. The output signal has only a magnetic connection with the bus bar so the bus may be, quite safely, at any (EHT) voltage with respect to the instrumentation. Instrumentation magnetic amplifiers are commonly found on space craft where a clean electromagnetic environment is highly desirable. The German Kriegsmarine made extensive use of the magnetic amplifiers. They were used for the master stable element systems, for slow moving transmission for controlling guns, directors and rangefinders and train and elevation controls. Magnetic amplifiers were used in aircraft systems (avionics) before the advent of high reliability semiconductors. They were important in implementing early autoland systems and Concorde made use of the technology for the control of its engine air intakes before development of a system using digital electronics. Magnetic amplifiers were used in stabilizer controls of V2 rockets. ===Usage in computing=== Magnetic amplifiers were widely studied during the 1950s as a potential switching element for mainframe computers. Mag amps could be used to sum several inputs in a single core, which was useful in the arithmetic logic unit (ALU). Custom tubes could do the same, but transistors could not, so the mag amp was able to combine the advantages of tubes and transistors in an era when the latter were expensive and unreliable. The principles of magnetic amplifiers were applied non linearly to create magnetic digital logic gates. That era was short, lasting from the mid-1950s to about 1960, when new fabrication techniques produced great improvements in transistors and dramatically lowered their cost. Only one large-scale mag amp machine was put into production, the UNIVAC Solid State, but a number of contemporary late-1950s/early-1960s computers used the technology, like the Ferranti Orion and the English Electric KDF9, or the one-off MAGSTEC. == History Early development=== A voltage source and a series connected variable resistor may be regarded as a direct current signal source for a low resistance load such as the control coil of a saturable reactor which amplifies the signal. Thus, in principle, a saturable reactor is already an amplifier, although before 20th century they were used for simple tasks, such as controlling lighting and electrical machinery as early as 1885. In 1904 radio pioneer Reginald Fessenden placed an order for a high frequency rotary mechanical alternator from the General Electric Company capable of generate AC at a frequency of 100 kHz to be used for continuous wave radio transmission over great distances.Ernst F. Alexanderson, The accomplishments and life of E. F. Alexanderson, 1878-1975, Edison Tech Center- 2014Milestones:Alexanderson Radio Alternator, 1904 The design job was given to General Electric engineer Ernst F. Alexanderson who developed the 2 kW Alexanderson alternator. By 1916 Alexanderson added a magnetic amplifier to control the transmission of these rotary alternators for transoceanic radio communication.George Trinkaus, The Magnetic Amplifier, Nuts & Volts Magazine - February 2006 The experimental telegraphy and telephony demonstrations made during 1917 attracted the attention of the US Government, especially in light of partial failures in the transoceanic cable across the Atlantic Ocean. The 50 kW alternator was commandeered by the US Navy and put into service in January 1918 and was used until 1920, when a 200 kW generator-alternator set was built and installed. ===Usage in electric power generation=== Magnetic amplifiers were extensively used in electricity power generation from the early 1960s onwards. They provided the small signal amplification for generator automatic voltage regulation (AVR) from a small error signal at milliwatt (mW) level to 100 kilowatt (kW) level. This was in turn converted by a rotating machine (exciter) to 5 megawatt (MW) level, the excitation power required by a typical 500 MW Power Plant Turbine Generator Unit. They proved durable and reliable. Many are recorded in service through the mid-1990s and some are still in use at older generating stations, notably in hydroelectric plants operating in northern California. == Misnomer uses == A real magnetic audio amplifier, designed by Swedish engineer Lars Lundahl, utilizes saturable reactors in its final power amplifying stage. In the 1970s, Robert Carver designed and produced several high quality high-powered audio amplifiers, calling them magnetic amplifiers. In fact, they were in most respects conventional audio amplifier designs with unusual power supply circuits. They were not magnetic amplifiers as defined in this article. They should not be confused with real magnetic audio amplifiers, which also exist. == See also == * Parametron * Magnetic logic * Transductor == References == * Alexanderson, E. F.

It is the second major component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) preceded by Terra (launched 1999) and followed by Aura (launched 2004). The name \\"Aqua\\" comes from the Latin word for water. The satellite was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on May 4, 2002, aboard a Delta II rocket. Aqua is on a Sun-synchronous orbit. It flies as the third in the satellite formation called the \\"A Train\\" with several other satellites (OCO-2, the Japanese GCOM W1, CALIPSO, CloudSat, and Aura). ==Mission== Aqua is one of NASA's missions for Earth science operating in the A-Train constellation. It has demonstrated a very high level of precision in making the primary long-term measurements of the mission. These highly calibrated climate quality measurements of radiance, reflectance, and backscatter have been used to cross-calibrate past and present sensors launched by NASA, as well as a variety of sensors launched from other agencies and the international community. Thousands of scientists and operational users from around the world have made use of the Aqua data to address NASA's six interdisciplinary Earth science focus areas: Atmospheric Composition, Weather, Carbon Cycle and Ecosystems, Water and Energy Cycle, Climate Variability and Change, and Earth Surface and Interior. Aqua has experienced some minor, non-mission ending anomalies. Because of a 2007 anomaly with the Solid State Recorder (SSR) it can only hold two orbits worth of data. A series of solar array and array regulator electronics anomalies starting in 2010 has led to the loss of 13 strings of solar cells out of a total of 132 strings. A 2005 short circuit within a battery cell led to a partial loss of cell capacity. In 2009, a solar panel thermistor failed and an error in the Solar Array offset was detected. The offset issue has been corrected periodically since then. On September 8, 2007, the Dual Thruster Module (DTM-2) Heater experienced an anomaly. On August 16, 2020, The Formatter Multiplexer Unit (FMU) experienced an anomaly, corrupting some data in the SSR and stopping all data streams until it was recovered on September 2, 2020. The current end of mission plan has Aqua leaving the \\"A-Train\\" constellation in March 2022, with the mission continuing at a lower orbit until 2025. Aqua's life could be extended with a possible re-fueling mission. Worst-case scenario would result in a re-entry by 2046. ==Instruments== Aqua carries six instruments for studies of water on the Earth's surface and in the atmosphere, of which four are still operating: *Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) ‚Äî measures cloud properties, sea surface temperature, near-surface wind speed, radiative energy flux, surface water, ice and snow. Furnished by the National Space Development Agency of Japan. The AMSR-E instrument had over 480 pounds of spinning mass, and the lubricant in the bearing assembly gradually deteriorated over the course of the mission. By 2007, there was a noticeable increase in motor current. This led to the development of new contingency procedures in case of high current or torque, which were put in place in 2011. In October 2011, the instrument began to cause yaw vibrations in the spacecraft that exceeded torque limits and on October 4, 2011 was automatically slowed to 4 rpm from the normal 40 rpm and then, because it could not maintain 4 rpm, was slowed to a stop. A recovery procedure was developed and tested through 2012, culminating with a December 4, 2012 successful acceleration to 2.0767 rpm to allow for cross-calibration with the AMSR-2 instrument launched in 2012 aboard the GCOM-W1 satellite. On December 4, 2015 AMSR-E was slowed to a stop and then on March 3, 2016 it was turned off. *Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ‚Äî also measures cloud properties and radiative energy flux, also aerosol properties; land cover and land use change, fires and volcanoes. An identical MODIS instrument is also aboard Terra. As of 2017, some degradation of channels in the MODIS short wave visible bands has been observed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). *Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-A) ‚Äî measures atmospheric temperature and humidity. Since launch, AMSU has lost 5 of 15 channels. Power to the AMSU-A2 microwave instrument was lost at 19:47 UT September 24, 2016. This caused the loss of Channels 1 and 2. All recovery attempts were unsuccessful and no further recovery attempts are planned. *Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) ‚Äî measures atmospheric temperature and humidity, land and sea surface temperatures. Cooler A telemetry became frozen on March 24, 2014, but this had no impact on science gathering. On September 25, 2016, Cooler-A experienced a shut down anomaly. Anomaly recovery occurred two days later and also cleared a condition that had disabled Cooler-A telemetry since the 2014 Cooler-A anomaly. *Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB) ‚Äî VHF band equipment measuring atmospheric humidity. Furnished by Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais of Brazil. The HSB instrument has been in survival mode, and thus non-operational, since February 5, 2003, when the scan mirror motor failed. *Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) ‚Äî Flying Modules 3 and 4, measure broadband radiative energy flux. CERES' shortwave channel on module 4 failed on March 30, 2005, but its two other channels remain operational. The Aqua spacecraft has a mass of about , plus propellant of about at launch. Stowed for launch, the satellite fit in a volume of 2.68 m x 2.49 m x 6.49 m. Deployed, Aqua is 4.81 m x 16.70 m x 8.04 m.

The station has undergone numerous branding changes over the years; it was branded as B105 following its conversion from AM to FM. This lasted until a co-branding as Hit 105.3 B105, then as Hit B105 (dropping the \\"B\\" shortly after) and finally back to B105 in July 2020. ==History== The station began life as 4BK, commencing transmission on 1930 on the AM band, initially on the frequency 1290 kHz before changing to 1300 kHz on 1 Sep 1935 (to accord with the new Australian 10 kHz channel spacing raster). Again the implementation by Australia of the 9 kHz channel spacing raster developed by the ITU and formalised in the 1975 Geneva Plan necessitated 4BK moving to 1296 kHz on 23 November 1978. In 1988, the Austereo group purchased the station from Hoyts, intending to use it as a vehicle to bid for an FM conversion licence. Austereo won the FM licence, and in February 1990, the station changed its callsign to 4BBB (not used on-air except during test broadcasts, unlike the previous AM callsign) and commenced broadcasting on a frequency of 105.3 MHz with the on-air name B105. Between March 1990 until 2006 it was the highest rating station in Brisbane, except in one ratings survey in 1994, beaten by AM station 4KQ. In April 2011 the Austereo Group was purchased by Southern Cross Media for more than $700 million, and is now operated under the name Southern Cross Austereo. On Friday 6 March 2015, B105 rebranded as Hit 105.http://www.radiotoday.com.au/news/whats- new/6456-hit105-arrives.html On Monday 27 July 2020, Hit 105 rebranded back to B105.https://www.radiotoday.com.au/sca-hit-network-rebrand/ ==Studios== The 4BK studio complex, an AM radio facility was located at 16 Campbell Street Bowen Hills. When the FM conversion license was granted, the Austereo group converted the premises to an FM facility and began broadcasting as B105 FM in 1990. The B105 studio complex remained at the Bowen Hills location until July 2000, when Austereo relocated B105 and sister station Triple M into new combined premises at 309 North Quay, Brisbane. The new complex was the first in Australia to use the now defunct Klotz Digital audio system, which was revolutionary at the time however was replaced during a 2016 studio upgrade with Axia Fusion. In June 2019, B105 moved from North Quay into new studios at The Barracks on Petrie Terrace. ==Transmission== 4BBB's FM transmission has always emanated from the TVQ Ten tower at Mount Coot-tha, Brisbane. The station originally used two Harris HT10 tube transmitters in an A/B failsafe configuration to deliver the service. In 2002 a new solid state Harris Z10CD transmitter was installed at the newly created TX Australia facility, located under the TVQ Ten tower. The existing HT10 transmitter now serves as a backup facility located at the BTQ Seven tower, away from Channel Ten on Mount Coot- tha. B105's service is licensed for 12Kw Effective Radiated Power at the antenna, and operates its transmitters at 5Kw base power.

It is the largest palace erected in Europe during the 18th century.https://www.reggiadicasertaunofficial.it/it/reggia/il- palazzo/ In 1997, the palace was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site; its nomination described it as \\"the swan song of the spectacular art of the Baroque, from which it adopted all the features needed to create the illusions of multidirectional space\\".Unesco site evaluation.

Grand Staircase of Honour. The throne room. The Diana and Actaeon Fountain at the feet of the Grand Cascade. The construction of the palace was begun in 1752 for Charles VII of Naples (Charles III of Spain), who worked closely with his architect, Luigi Vanvitelli. When Charles saw Vanvitelli's grandly scaled model for Caserta, it filled him with emotion \\"fit to tear his heart from his breast\\". In the end, he never slept a night at the Reggia, as he abdicated in 1759 to become King of Spain, and the project was carried to only partial completion for his third son and successor, Ferdinand IV of Naples. The political and social model for Vanvitelli's palace was Versailles, which, though strikingly different in its variety and disposition, solves similar problems of assembling and providing for king, court and government in a massive building with the social structure of a small city, confronting a baroque view of a highly subordinated nature, la nature forc√©e.Siegfried Giedion (1941) Space, Time and Architecture pp 133ff. This was part of the entire concept of the palace when it was first proposed by Mario Gioffredo sometime in 1750. According to Hersey, the proposal envisaged a palace \\"that was a virtual city, housing not just the court and king but all the main political and cultural elites of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies - university, museum, library, cabinet bureaus, military high commands, and so on.\\" The population of Caserta Vecchia was moved 10 kilometers to provide a work force closer to the palace. A silk manufactory at San Leucio resort was disguised as a pavilion in the immense parkland. Another of the king's primary objects was to have a magnificent new royal court and administrative center for the kingdom in a location protected from sea attack, and distant from the revolt-prone and congested city of Naples. To provide the king with suitable protection, troop barracks were housed within the palace. The Royal Palace of Madrid, where Charles had grown up, which had been devised by Filippo Juvarra for Charles' father, Philip V of Spain, and Charlottenburg Palace provided models. A spacious octagonal vestibule seems to have been inspired by Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute in Venice, while the palatine chapel is most often compared to the Royal Chapel at Versailles. Vanvitelli died in 1773: the construction was continued by his son Carlo and then by other architects; but the elder Vanvitelli's original project, which included a vast pair of frontal wings similar to Bernini's wings at St. Peter's, was never finished. From 1923 to 1943 the palace was the location of the Accademia Aeronautica, the Italian Air Force Academy. From 1943, during the allied invasion the royal palace served as Allied Force Headquarters for the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean area; Sir Maitland Wilson and later Sir Harold Alexander. In April 1945 the palace was the site of the signing of terms of the unconditional German surrender of forces in Italy. The agreement covered between 600,000 and 900,000 soldiers along the Italian Front including troops in sections of Austria. The first Allied war crimes trial took place in the palace in 1945; German general Anton Dostler was sentenced to death and executed nearby, in Aversa. In the left hand arc behind the fa√ßade, a set of barracks were built. During World War II the soldiers of the US Fifth Army recovered here in a \\"rest centre\\". ==Layout of the Palace== The palace has 5 floors, 1,200 rooms, including two dozen state apartments, a large library, and a theatre modelled after the Teatro San Carlo of Naples. A monumental avenue that would run 20 kilometers between the palace and Naples was planned but never realized. The palace has a rectangular plan, measuring 247 √ó 184 m, and the four sides are connected by two orthogonal arms, forming four inner courts. Each floor measures approximately , but considering the five floors, the whole palace measures . Caserta is by far the largest royal palace in the world in terms of volume, with more than 2 million m¬≥ (70 million cu ft). Behind the fa√ßades of its matching segmental ranges of outbuildings that flank the giant forecourt, a jumble of buildings arose to facilitate daily business. The palace encloses four courts that feature what scholars describe as well- proportioned interior that evoke a monotonous dignity, unique in its time. Of all the royal residences inspired by the Palace of Versailles, the Reggia of Caserta is the one that bears the greatest resemblance to the original model: the unbroken balustraded skyline and the slight break provided by pavilions within the long, somewhat monotonous fa√ßade. As at Versailles, a large aqueduct was required to bring water for the prodigious water displays. Like its French predecessor, the palace was intended to display the power and grandeur of an absolute Bourbon monarchy. A solecism at Caserta is that above the piano reale, the King's floor, is another floor of equal magnificence. The enfilades of Late Baroque saloni were the heart and seat of government, as well as displays of national wealth. Caserta provided a royal refuge from the dust and factions of the capital, just as Versailles had freed Louis XIV from Paris. The royal palace has more than 40 monumental rooms completely decorated with frescoes when, in comparison, Versailles counts only 22 monumental rooms. ==The park== The garden, a typical example of the baroque extension of formal vistas, stretches for 120 ha, partly on hilly terrain. It is also inspired by the park of Versailles. The park starts from the back fa√ßade of the palace, flanking a long alley with artificial fountains and cascades. There is a botanical garden, called \\"The English Garden\\", in the upper part designed in the 1780s by Carlo Vanvitelli and the German-born botanist, nurseryman, plantsman-designer, John Graefer, trained in London and recommended to Sir William Hamilton by Sir Joseph Banks.Alice M. Coats, \\"Forgotten Gardeners, II: John Graefer\\" The Garden History Society Newsletter No. 16 (February 1972), pp. 4‚Äì7. It is an early Continental example of an \\"English garden\\" in the svelte naturalistic taste of Capability Brown. The fountains and cascades, each filling a vasca (basin), with architecture and hydraulics by Luigi Vanvitelli at intervals along a wide straight canal that runs to the horizon, rivalled those at Peterhof outside St. Petersburg. These include: *The Fountain of Diana and Actaeon (sculptures by Paolo Persico, Angelo Maria Brunelli, and Tommaso Solari); *The Fountain of Venus and Adonis (1770‚Äì80); *The Fountain of the Dolphins (1773‚Äì80); *The Fountain of Aeolus; *The Fountain of Ceres. A large number of figures from classical Antiquity were modelled by Gaetano Salomone for the gardens of the Reggia, and executed by large workshops. Contemporary observers noted that the Caserta surpassed all other royal palaces in Europe, including its models, on one particular aspect: the combination of completeness and stateliness. This is attributed to the spacious oval piazza in front of the edifice's south side ==UNESCO World Heritage site== The palace was listed as a world heritage site in 1997. According to the rationale, the palace, \\"whilst cast in the same mould as other 18th century royal establishments, is exceptional for the broad sweep of its design, incorporating not only an imposing palace and park, but also much of the surrounding natural landscape and an ambitious new town laid out according to the urban planning precepts of its time.\\"Unesco listing ==See also== * Asteroid 274246 Reggiacaserta * List of Baroque residences ==Notes== ==Further reading== * *Hersey, George.

Retrieved 29 January 2012. in Hillingdon, London) is a British actor, playwright, director, singer and broadcaster. In 2005 he became the second black Briton to have a play staged in the West End of London. (Ray Harrison Graham's Fringe First award-winning play GARY played at the Arts Theatre in 1990.) Kwei-Armah's award-winning piece Elmina's Kitchen transferred to the Garrick Theatre in 2005. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to drama. He is currently the artistic director of the Young Vic theatre in London, succeeding David Lan. Brought up in Southall, he changed his name at the age of 19 after tracing his family history, through the slave trade back to his ancestral African roots in Ghana. His parents were born in Grenada. He has four children. Kwei-Armah was chancellor of the University of the Arts form 2011 to 2015. He served as the Artistic Director of the Baltimore's Center Stage theater in the United States from 2011 to 2018. In 2018 he became the Artistic Director of the Young Vic in London. Kwei-Armah's son, who goes by the stage name of KZ, contributed production and vocals to Wretch 32 and Avelino's 2015 mixtape, Young Fire, Old Flame, and Wretch 32's third studio album, Growing Over Life, released in September 2016. ==Early life== Kwei-Armah was born in Hillingdon Hospital and named Ian Roberts. He changed his name when he was aged 19 after tracing his family history (in which he first became interested as a child after watching the TV series Roots), through the slave trade back to his ancestral African roots in Ghana, descendent of Coromantins. His parents were born in Grenada, then a British colony. His maternal grandmother moved to Trinidad, where she died, leaving her five children including Kwei-Armah's mother as orphans in Grenada. Kwei-Armah's mother moved to Britain in 1962. His father, Eric, moved to Britain in 1960, at a time when there was high unemployment in Grenada, and found work in London at the local Quaker Oats factory. When he was one year old, Kwei-Armah's family moved to a two-storey terraced house in Southall, London, where they let two rooms to help to pay for the mortgage. Kwei-Armah started at his first primary school as a five-year-old, and after a teacher disciplined him by kicking him in the back, his mother took on three jobs to pay for him and his two siblings to go to a private stage school, the Barbara Speake Stage School in London ‚Äì working as a child minder, as a night nurse at Hillingdon Hospital, and doing some hairdressing work. He also attended The Salvation Army, and received musical training there. At the age of about 35 years his mother had a stroke leading to left-sided weakness, from which she slowly recovered. Kwei-Armah grew up in Southall in the 1970s at a time when Asian families were moving in and white families were moving out, and he perceived animosity from the Asian community towards the Afro-Caribbean community. One day, at the time of the April 1979 Southall riots, his father came home after the evening work-shift and took him out to see the Hambrough Tavern on fire. Kwei-Armah saw a police van arrive, and when the police started to charge at the crowd using batons and shields he ran home frightened. From the upstairs front room he claims to have seen the police chasing black and Asian boys along the street followed by skinheads, who also had batons and shields, chasing behind the police. The event shocked him making him feel that he was living in an alien environment, and reinforced his resolve to do well in his education. He later wrote about the event in his first play, A Bitter Herb. ==Appearances on stage, television and radio== Kwei-Armah appeared in the original London production of Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens, which played at the Criterion Theatre in 1993. Kwei- Armah first achieved fame playing the paramedic Finlay Newton in the BBC drama series Casualty from 1999 to 2004. His other television credits include appearances in episodes of Casualty‚Ä≤s sister series Holby City, the BBC's Afternoon Play, Between the Lines and The Bill. In 2003 he appeared as a contestant on the Reality TV programme Comic Relief does Fame Academy and subsequently released an album, Kwame. In 2007, he starred as E. R.

In the series, Kira is a first- generation Coordinator, a genetically enhanced human being born of normal humans (Naturals). At the beginning of Gundam SEED, Kira lives on the neutral space colony Heliopolis to avoid the war between the Coordinators and the Naturals, but the colony becomes involved in the war shortly thereafter. Kira is the only person within the Earth Alliancethe Naturals' military factionwho is able to effectively pilot their mobile suita type of a mecha created by them. He is forced to become a mobile suit pilot and to participate in various battles to protect his friends. Kira has also been featured in Gundam SEEDs direct sequel, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, in which he fights to stop a new war between the races' military organizations. Kira has also appeared in the manga adaptations from the two TV series as well as the film compilations. Various video games from the Gundam franchise as well as crossover games also feature Kira as a pilot from mobile suits. Director Mitsuo Fukuda regarded Kira's actions as based on Japanese people's thoughts, and emphasized a large development occurring to his character across the series. He is voiced in the Japanese series by S≈çichir≈ç Hoshi. In English, he is voiced by Matt Hill in the Ocean English dub, and by Max Mittelman in the NYAV English dub. Kira is one of the most popular characters in the Anime Grand Prix popularity polls for favorite male characters, often coming in first or second between 2002 and 2005. His character has also been well received by publications for manga, anime and other media due to his friendly personality, the constant struggles he has with his enemies that allow him to have a notable development. In regards to his return in SEED Destiny, reviewers found him more likable than the new lead, Shinn Asuka, a found his characterization deeper. ==AppearancesIn Mobile Suit Gundam SEED=== At the start of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, Kira is a shy, friendly teenager living peacefully in the Heliopolis colony. Kira is a highly skilled computer programmer who assists with research and development at the Heliopolis technical college, where he is a student. When a war between the Naturals and Coordinators is brought to Heliopolis, Kira takes control of a mobile suit, the , to protect his friends from ZAFTthe military organization of the Coordinators. Born as a Coordinator, Kira's advanced mental and physical skills allow him to skillfully control the Strike. Kira is shocked when he discovers that his childhood friend Athrun Zala is a member of ZAFT. When they last met, Athrun gave Kira his robotic pet as a sign of their enduring friendship, (voiced by Naomi Shindou in the Japanese anime and Tabitha St. Germain in the English dub) which Kira is often seen with. Several survivors from Heliopolis are brought on board the Archangel and Kira defends them from enemy attacks until they arrive in Alaska on Earth. Kira has strong reservations against fighting, fearing he may confront Athrun and that he may kill a person. After manipulation by Flay Allster, Kira gradually becomes more aggressive when defending the Archangel to the point where he could kill a person without hesitation. During one of the Archangel's battles against ZAFT, the Strike suffers multiple damages by Athrun and Kira is declared missing in action. He is found alive but injured by Reverend Malchio, who transports him to a space colony known as PLANT where most coordinators reside and is ZAFT's homebase. There, his wounds are treated by Lacus Clyne, a Coordinator who befriended Kira when she was taken aboard the Archangel and was used as a hostage. After hearing that ZAFT plans to attack the base his friends are staying at, Kira decides to continue battling to bring the war to an end. Lacus then gives Kira ZAFT's new mobile suit, , which he uses to accompany the Archangel, whose objective has also changed to ending the war. When piloting Freedom Kira is noted to avoid hitting enemy mobile suits' cockpits to reduce the number of human casualties. Kira joins the Archangel and Lacus' faction to fight both the Earth Alliance and ZAFT to stop both sides from destroying each other. Kira learns of his origins from ZAFT commander Rau Le Creuset during these battles. Kira is the Ultimate Coordinator; his fetus was artificially developed outside his mother's womb and his genetic enhancements were intended to be superior to all other Coordinators. Kira was the only fetus to survive the process. He was born as the twin brother of his comrade Cagalli Yula Athha but does not learn about this relationship until the latter half of the series. Kira was adopted by his aunt Caridad and uncle Haruma Yamato and was led to believe they were his biological parents. Despite being shocked by his origins as the Ultimate Coordinator, Kira continues to fight alongside the Archangel until their opponents, including Rau, have been defeated and the war comes to end. ===In Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny=== During Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, Kira has been living in the secluded Marshall Islands since the end of the war within the country of Orb. He and Lacus have spent the past two years since the end of the war assisting Reverend Malchio and Kira's adoptive mother with their orphanage. When an incident triggers another war, Coordinators try to kill Lacus; Kira pilots Freedom to defeat them. When Orb attempts to join the war as a member of the Earth Alliance, Kira and the Arcangel intervene Orb's forces to preserve the nation's neutral status. Kira suspects Gilbert Durandal, the chairman of the PLANT colonies and leader of ZAFT, to be behind Lacus' attempted murder, but his motives are questioned by Athrun who is working in ZAFT. Later, when the Archangel becomes a target of the ZAFT ship known as Minerva, Kira is defeated and the Freedom is destroyed by pilot Shinn Asuka. Lacus gives Kira an upgraded version of Freedom, , so he can continue fighting. Having obtained a weapon of mass destruction, Durandal imposes the Destiny Plan, a rule which removes freewill and dictates a person's entire life based on their genetics. Kira, the Archangel and their allies confront ZAFT's forces in space and defeat them in the final battle. Kira personally confronts Durandal and the latter is killed by one of his own subordinates. Besides the television series, Kira appears in the original video animation (OVA) Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Final Plus. Following Durandal's death, Kira meets Shinn and they promise to work for a peaceful future. He is also featured in two films, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED: Special Edition and Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: Special Edition, which retell the events from the television series. In the latter film's ending, Kira becomes a member of ZAFT after the war ends. ===In other media=== Kira is featured in the manga adaptations of Gundam SEED and Gundam SEED Destiny. Kira's designs, according to Masatsugu Iwaseauthor of the Gundam SEED mangawas intended to be that of \\"a spineless wimp while not making him look too childish\\", but he later decided to make him a strong character in the manga. The manga Mobile Suit Gundam SEED: The Edge Desire features a story about Kira's recovery following Freedom's destruction. The manga series Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Astray explores Kira's survival after the Strike's defeat; a technician named Lowe Guele finds Kira wounded and takes him to Reverend Malchio. Although Kira appears only at the end, his defeat is the objective of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED X Astrays protagonist, Canard Pars. In Mobile Suit Gundam SEED C.E. 73 Œî Astray Kira makes a brief appearance; he kidnaps Cagalli from Orb during the events of Gundam SEED Destiny. He has also been featured in two character CDs from the series, with tracks performed by his Japanese voice actor, S≈çichir≈ç Hoshi. Kira has also appeared in various video games in the Gundam franchise, including Gundam Seed: Rengou vs. Z.A.F.T. and its sequel Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny: Rengou vs. Z.A.F.T. II. He is the main playable character in the mobile phone game Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Phase-Act Delivery. He appears in the Gundam fighting crossover games Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2 and Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 3 with Strike Freedom as a playable mobile suit. Other Gundam crossover games also feature Kira as a pilot including Gundam vs. Gundam Next and Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme Vs.. Another crossover game in which he is playable is Gundam Assault Survive, piloting the Strike. Kira, along with other Gundam SEED characters, appears in several video games from the Super Robot Wars series. He appears in Another Century's Episode 3 piloting the Freedom mobile suit and its follow-up, Another Century's Episode R, with the Strike Freedom. ==Creation and conception== Kira pointing a fireweapon at Gilbert Durandal indicates the character's return to his war persona according to Mitsuo Fukuda. Director Mitsuo Fukuda stated that initially the story of Gundam SEED was written from Kira's point of view. Kira's personality and thought process were derived from what Fukuda considered to be Japanese people's thoughts. He said that his story was about his forced wish to fight, in contrast to Shinn Asuka who was not reluctant to fight in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. In retrospective, Fukuda emphasized a contrast between both Kira's and Shinn's characters to the point both were the opposite of each other regarding their opinions; Kira's development was easier to script. Fukuda said that as both Kira's and Shinn's characters as were similar, they were easy to voice. An official guidebook to the series made an official count of the number of times Kira cried in Gundam SEED by the time the book was released. He was said to have cried over ten times, and thus a comical message of support was made towards him. Fukuda reclaims having enjoyed the an scene from episode 46 based on the emotional support Lacus provides to Kira. Athrun's voice actor, Akira Ishida, agreed with Fukuda, stating the scene was well directed. For the final episode of the series, Fukuda aimed to bring Kira to his lowest where he becomes unstable when Fray is killed by Rau, leaving a major impact in him, considering himself a failure for not failing to protect her. When it came to this scene in both retelling films and HD remaster of the series, Fukuda wanted the original audio to remain the same as he feared adding a song or changing the background music would have ruined it. Following Rau's death at Kira's hand in the final episode of the series, Fukuda wanted the last scene involving Kira being outside Freedom in space while being rescued by Athrun and Cagalli to change for the remaster for adding a more symbolic tone. Kira's inclusion in Destiny was made in order to tell a story from three people's point of views: Kira's, Athrun's and Shinn.„ÄéÊ©üÂãïÊà¶Â£´„Ç¨„É≥„ÉÄ„É†SEED DESTINY ÂÖ¨Âºè„Ç¨„Ç§„Éâ„Éñ„ÉÉ„ÇØ3 -Ë™ì„ÅÑ„ÅÆÂÆáÂÆô- The director lamented that from the three protagonists, Kira was the least explored character during the making of the series alongside alongside two other characters with major importance: Durandal and Lacus. Fukuda described Kira in SEED Destiny as a person who runs away from fights despite often his values for Orb. His characterization was made to change briefly across the story as Kira faced Gilbert Durandal's ideals and became a person more compromised with war in contrast to his original pacifist persona after this incarnation was challenged multiple other characters in regards to his actions in he battlefield. In the Japanese version of the series, Kira is voiced by S≈çichir≈ç Hoshi. Hoshi expressed joy in voicing the character and was happy when redoing his character's lines for the remaster of the series. One of Hoshi's favorite lines in the franchise is \\"I still have a world I want to protect!\\" in the final episode of SEED when facing Raw as he felt it was heartwarming. Another aspect Hoshi enjoyed in regards to his work was how Kira and Athrun become allies in the 39th episode following multiple fights across the anime. For the English dub, he is voiced by Matt Hill, who got the role thanks to a friend from the dub's director, who told Hill not to have too much energy when doing the voice. The line \\"Kira Yamato! Launching!\\" was repeated by Hill several times when obtaining the role. Hill remembers enjoying his work, having taken a liking to the character. Max Mittelman replaced Hill for the NYAV dub. ==ReceptionPopularity=== Kira's character has been well received by anime viewers, appearing various times in the Anime Grand Prix popularity polls for the favorite male characters category. He ranked first in 2002, second in 2003 and 2004, first in 2005, and second in 2006. In a NHK poll, he was voted as the fourth best Gundam character. In a 2012 poll, Kira's line was voted by fans as the best line in Gundam SEED. In a Newtype poll, Kira was voted the second most popular male anime character from the 2000s. In another poll focused on all of the characters in the Gundam franchise, Kira was voted the most popular. In a poll organized by Sunrise to find the best couple in the Gundam franchise, Kira and Lacus were second, and in another regarding the best team- ups between former enemies, Kira and Athrun were second. In another poll from the same site that asked fans which character would they would want to meet, Kira was the most popular. Kira was most popular in two other polls which asked readers who the most memorable characters from Gundam SEED and from Gundam SEED Destiny were. Kira, along with five other notable mecha and pilots from the Gundam series, was recognized in the second set of \\"Anime Heroes and Heroines\\" stamps, released in Japan in 2005. In 2017, Kira was voted as the best Gundam main character. In the 2007 Seiyu Awards, S≈çichir≈ç Hoshi was a nominee in the category \\"Best Actors in supporting roles\\" for his portrayal as Kira in the Gundam SEED Destiny OVA, but lost to Akira Ishida and K≈çki Miyata. Kira was also voted as the second best character voiced by Hoshi. ===Critical response=== Manga and anime publications have commented on Kira's character, and he received mainly positive critical responses. IGN's Andy Patrizio said Kira's character was likable and the only problem he found was how he often repeated Athrun Zala's name in early episodes. THEM Anime Reviews' Derrick L. Tucker said he was one of the strongest characters from the series; Tucker also said he was likable despite his angsty displays. Tucker also compared him with Amuro Ray from the first Gundam series, Mobile Suit Gundam, finding both likeable. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment liked Kira's handling of the mobile suits and his ability to reprogram them, finding it as a new concept in the Gundam franchise. Also writing for Mania Entertainment, Kim Wolstenholme was worried about how much Kira's and Athrun's relationship would be focused in Gundam SEED, but liked that Lacus Clyne's introduction added tension to it. Ever Cheung from Animefringe who wondered about the future of Kira and Lacus because the two are about to embrace in the anime's opening sequence. He said, \\"If that's real, this story may be more interesting than I thought ...\\" Ross Liversidge from UK Anime Network enjoyed Kira's and Athrun's rivalry which resulted in well-done fight scenes from each of their mobile suits as well as intense drama due to how originally the two were friends. Liversidge praised the development from such rivalry as the two started hating each other and their battle. DVDTalk writer Don Houston considered Kira to be similar to other anime protagonists because he fights for peace and not glory, labeling him the \\"reluctant hero\\", but still praised his character arc in the series without overshadowing other character like Athrun and Cagalli. Due to the origins regarding Kira's original nature and his connections with Rau, UK Anime Network expected to see an intense final battle but was sightly disappointed despite enjoying Kira's anger displayed in the finale when engaging his enemy. Besides SEEDs television series, Kira's actions in the compilation films were commented. Due to the compilation films not carefully adapting the television series, both Anime News Network and the Fandom Post feel like Kira's struggle to keep up with his philosophy of not killing and his releationship with Athrun do not work in this format and thus only returning fans might enjoy the movies. While still praising the narrative originally provided in Kira's premise, IGN disliked how the game Locked and Rocked failed to portray Kira accurately as a result of lacking enough dialogue. Reviewers have also commented on Kira's role in the sequel Gundam SEED Destiny. Initial reviews mentioned his lack of appearances during the first episodes and whether the new characters could be as appealing as him. He was expected to return in the series to fight the new lead character Shinn Asuka. While writing an article for later episodes, Liversidge found Kira's actions more appealing than Shinn's, and was looking forward to them. DVDTalk.com shared similar feelings and stated Kira's return to the battlefield appears to be a theme \\"key players from the previous series are forced into positions they aren't happy with\\" something he felt was the focus of Kira's group. Luis Cruz from Mania Entertainment found that Kira's character expansion developed depth, pointing to one of Kira's discussions with Athrun about the relation between people's dreams and conflicts. HobbyConsolas praised Kira's characterization and his relationship with Lacus as an appealing couple due to their mutual caring in SEED Destiny as well their actions in the plot. Despite finding flaws within the narrative, Mania liked how Kira is forced to drop his pacifist methods on Stella leading to her death resulting into an appealing conflict between him and Shinn who wants to avenge her. Anime News Network writer Carl Kimlinger said that in the series' OVA finale, Kira was highly developed. Kimlinger stated that Kira had \\"grown into a martial leader of Buddha-like calm and compassion\\", and that the last OVA allows viewers to enjoy his actions. Matt Hill's English-language performance in the OVA was criticized in comparison with other voice actors from the series who were praised. ===Controversy=== The sixteenth episode of Gundam SEED features a scene in which Kira is seen dressing after getting out of a bed where Flay lies sleeping naked, suggesting a sexual relationship. The Japanese Commission for Better Broadcasting reported that viewers filed complaints regarding the scene as the show was aired at 6 pm when children would be watching. Mainichi replied by mentioning it should have given more careful consideration to the episode before airing it. The scene was extended in one of the compilation films with John Oppliger noting it expanded the off- screen scene with three shots. In a further analysis, Kira was noted to be as a mentally unstable forced soldier in the plot due to how Kira starts suffering depression due to failing to protect a ship containing innocent civilians. Kira and Flay's relationship are also noted to stand out as \\"comfort abuse\\" within the franchise alongside the narrative of Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam due to how the Flay manipulates Kira to fight for Archangel's cause noting that while in early episodes of the series, Kira was attracted by her, he had not planned start a relationship with her with sexual tones that felt written to make Flay as a prostitute. The writer notes that how Kira's apparent death in his fight against Athrun Zala, Flay develops but in guilt for turning Kira in a soldier. Meanwhile, the fight between Kira and his best friend was commented as the idea of the chaos war can cause. ==References== ==External links== Category:Adoptee characters in anime and manga Category:Fictional admirals Category:Television characters introduced in 2002 Category:Fictional commanders Category:Fictional ensigns Category:Fictional genetically engineered characters Category:Fictional twins Category:Human experimentation in fiction Category:Male characters in anime and manga Category:Mobile Suit Gundam SEED characters Category:Orphan characters in anime and manga ","title":"Kira Yamato"},{"id":"830626","text":"Gezer, or Tel Gezer (), in Arabic Tell Jezer or Tell el-Jazari, the site of the abandoned Arab village of Abu Shusheh, is an archaeological site in the foothills of the Judaean Mountains at the border of the Shfela region roughly midway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. It is now an Israeli national park. In the Hebrew Bible, Gezer is associated with Joshua and Solomon. It became a major fortified Canaanite city-state in the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE. It was later destroyed by fire and rebuilt. The Amarna letters mention kings of Gezer swearing loyalty to the Egyptian pharaoh. Its importance was due in part to the strategic position it held at the crossroads of the ancient coastal trade route linking Egypt with Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia, and the road to Jerusalem and Jericho, both important trade routes. ==NameHellenistic and Roman period=== Josephus writes that a certain \\"Gadara\\" was one of the five synedria, or regional administrative capitals of the Hasmonean realm, established by the Roman proconsul of Syria, Gabinius, in 57 BCE. The name has been edited to \\"Gazara\\" in the Loeb edition, in accordance with an identification of Gadara with Gezer. However, other researchers prefer one of two canditates from Transjordan, Gadara in Perea, or Gadara of the Decapolis (see more at Perea and Gadara (disambiguation)). ==Location== Tell Jezer from the 1871-77 PEF Survey of Palestine, also showing Abu Shusha Gezer was located on the northern fringe of the Shephelah region, approximately thirty kilometres northwest of Jerusalem. It was strategically situated at the junction of the Via Maris, the international coastal highway, and the highway connecting it with Jerusalem through the valley of Ayalon, or Ajalon. Verification of the identification of this site with biblical Gezer comes from bilingual inscriptions in either Hebrew or Aramaic, and Greek, found engraved on rocks several hundred meters from the tell. These inscriptions from the 1st century BCE read \\"boundary of Gezer\\" and \\"of Alkios\\" (probably the governor of Gezer at the time). ==In the Hebrew BibleConquest under Joshua=== The biblical story of the Israelite conquest of Canaan under their leader Joshua mentions a certain \\"king of Gezer\\" () who had gone to help his countrymen in Lachish, where he met his death. Gezer is listed in the Book of Joshua as a Levitical city, one of ten allotted to the Levite children of Kehoth - the Kohathites (). ===The sack of Gezer=== According to the Hebrew Bible, the only source for both the existence of Solomon and this particular event, the Sack of Gezer took place at the beginning of the 10th century BCE, when the city was conquered and burned by an unnamed Egyptian pharaoh, identified by some with Siamun, during his military campaign in Palestine. This anonymous Egyptian pharaoh then gave it to King Solomon as the dowry of his daughter. Solomon then rebuilt Gezer and fortified it. The Bible states: Identifying the pharaoh The only mention in the Bible of a pharaoh who might be Siamun (ruled 986‚Äì967 BC) is the text from 1 Kings quoted above, and we have no other historical sources that clearly identify what really happened. As shown below, Kenneth Kitchen believes that Siamun conquered Gezer and gave it to Solomon. Others such as Paul S. Ash and Mark W. Chavalas disagree, and in 2001 Chavalas states that \\"it is impossible to conclude which Egyptian monarch ruled concurrently with David and Solomon\\". Professor Edward Lipinski argues that Gezer, then unfortified, was destroyed late in the 10th century (and thus not contemporary with Solomon) and that the most likely Pharaoh was Shoshenq I (ruled 943‚Äì922 BC). \\"The attempt at relating the destruction of Gezer to the hypothetical relationship between Siamun and Solomon cannot be justified factually, since Siamun's death precedes Solomon's accession.\\" Tanis temple relief One fragmentary but well-known surviving triumphal relief scene from the Temple of Amun at Tanis believed to be related to the sack of Gezer depicts an Egyptian pharaoh smiting his enemies with a mace. According to the Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen, this pharaoh is Siamun. The pharaoh appears here \\"in typical pose brandishing a mace to strike down prisoners(?) now lost at the right except for two arms and hands, one of which grasps a remarkable double-bladed axe by its socket.\\" The writer observes that this double-bladed axe or 'halberd' has a flared crescent-shaped blade which is close in form to the Aegean-influenced double axe but is quite distinct from the Canaanite double-headed axe, which has a different shape that resembles an X. Thus, Kitchen concludes Siamun's foes were the Philistines who were descendants of the Aegean-based Sea Peoples and that Siamun was commemorating his recent victory over them at Gezer by depicting himself in a formal battle scene relief at the temple in Tanis. More recently Paul S. Ash has put forward a detailed argument that Siamun's relief portrays a fictitious battle. He points out that in Egyptian reliefs Philistines are never shown holding an axe, and that there is no archaeological evidence for Philistines using axes. He also argues that there is nothing in the relief to connect it with Philistia or the Levant. ==History of excavation== Archaeological excavation at Gezer has been going on since the early 1900s, and it has become one of the most excavated sites in Israel. The site was identified with ancient Gezer by Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau in 1871. R. A. Stewart Macalister excavated the site between 1902 and 1909 on behalf of the Palestine Exploration Fund. Macalister recovered several artifacts and discovered several constructions and defenses. He also established Gezer's habitation strata, though due to poor stratigraphical methods, these were later found to be mostly incorrect (as well as many of his theories). Other notable archaeological expeditions to the site were made by Alan Rowe (1934), G.E. Wright, William Dever and Joe Seger between 1964 and 1974 on behalf of the Nelson Glueck School of Archaeology in the Hebrew Union College, again by Dever in 1984 and 1990, as well as the Andrews University. Excavations were renewed in June 2006 by a consortium of institutions under the direction of Steve Ortiz of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (SWBTS) and Sam Wolff of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA). The Tel Gezer Excavation and Publication Project is a multi-disciplinary field project investigating the Iron Age history of Gezer. The first season of the Gezer excavations concluded successfully and revealed some interesting details. Among other things is a discovery of A thick destruction layer may be dated to the destruction at the hands of the Egyptians, which some associate with the biblical episode from . In 2013, two separate archaeological survey-excavations were conducted at Tel Gezer, the one by Tsvika Tsuk, Yohanan Hagai, and Daniel Warner, on behalf of the IAA,Israel Antiquities Authority, Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2013, Survey Permit # A-6744 and the other led by a team of archaeologists from the SWBTS and Andrews University's Institute of Archaeology.Israel Antiquities Authority, Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2013, Survey Permit # S-438 ==History and archaeologyChalcolithic=== The first settlement established at Tel Gezer dates to the end of the 4th millennium BCE during the Chalcolithic period, when large caves cut into the rock were used as dwellings. ===Bronze Age=== June 3, 2011, ongoing works to clear the Bronze Age water system at Gezer, originally excavated by Macalister Early Bronze Age At the beginning of the Early Bronze Age (early 3rd millennium BCE), an unfortified settlement covered the tell. It was destroyed in the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE and subsequently abandoned for several centuries. Middle Bronze Age In the Middle Bronze Age IIB (MBIIB, first half of the 2nd millennium BCE), Gezer became a major city, well fortified and containing a large cultic site. It may have grown due to MBIIA-sites like Aphek becoming weaker. :Fortifications The fortifications consisted of two lines of defense surrounding the tell. First, an outer earthen rampart c. 5 metres high, built of compacted alternating layers of chalk and earth covered with plaster. Second, a 4 metre wide inner wall made of large stone blocks, reinforced with towers. The city gate stood near the southwest corner of the wall, was flanked by two towers which protected the wooden doors, a common design for its time. The tell was surrounded by a massive stone wall and towers, protected by a earthen rampart covered with plaster. The wooden city gate, near the southwestern corner of the wall, was fortified by two towers. :Cultic site with massebot Cultic remains discovered in the northern part of the tell were a row of ten large standing stones, known as massebot or matsevot, singular masseba/matseva, oriented north‚Äìsouth, the tallest of which was 3 meters high, with an altar-type structure in the middle, and a large, square, stone basin, probably used for cultic libations. The exact purpose of these megaliths is still debated, but they may have constituted a Canaanite \\"high place\\" from the Middle Bronze Age, ca. 1600 BCE, each masseba possibly representing a Canaanite city connected to Gezer by treaties enforced by rituals performed here. Both the number and size of the standing stones confer a unique character to this cultic site. Such massebot are found elsewhere in the country, but those from Gezer massebot are the most impressive examples. A double cave beneath the high place was shown to be predating it and not connected to it. Late Bronze Age The Canaanite city was destroyed in a fire, presumably in the wake of a campaign by the Egyptian pharaoh Thutmose III (ruled 1479‚Äì1425 BC). The oldest known historical reference to the city is to be found on an inscription of conquered sites at Thutmose's temple at Karnak. A destruction layer from this event was found in all excavated areas of the tell. The Tell Amarna letters, dating from the 14th century BCE, include ten letters from the kings of Gezer swearing loyalty to the Egyptian pharaoh. The city-state of Gezer (named Gazru in Babylonian) was ruled by four leaders during the 20-year period covered by the Amarna letters. Discoveries of several pottery vessels, a cache of cylinder seals and a large scarab with the cartouche of Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep III attest to the existence of a city at Gezer's location in the 14th century BCE - one that was apparently destroyed in the next century \\\\- and suggest that the city was inhabited by Canaanites with strong ties to Egypt., Haaretz, published October 24, 2013, retrieved November 27, 2013. In the Late Bronze Age (second half of the 2nd millennium BCE) a new city wall, four meters thick, was erected outside the earlier one. It is a very rare example of Late Bronze Age fortifications in the country, witness for the elevated political status of Gezer in southern Canaan during Egyptian rule. In the 14th century BCE, a palace was constructed on the high western part of the tell, the city's acropolis. Archaeologists also discovered remains of what might have been the Egyptian governor's residence from the same period in the northern part of the tell. Toward the end of the Bronze Age, the city declined and its population diminished. Gezer is mentioned in the victory stele of Merneptah, dating from the end of the 13th century BCE. ===Iron Age=== The Gezer Calendar tablet, early Iron Age, 10th century BCE, Museum of Archaeology, Istanbul, Turkey In 12th-11th centuries BCE, a large building with many rooms and courtyards was situated on the acropolis. Grinding stones and grains of wheat found among the sherds indicate that it was a granary. Local and Philistine vessels attest to a mixed Canaanite/Philistine population. Tiglath-Pileser III and the Neo-Assyrian period The Neo-Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III put Gezer under siege between the years 734 and 732 BC. The city was probably captured by the Assyrians at the end of the campaign of Tiglath-Pileser III to Canaan. A reference to Gezer may have appeared in a cuneiform relief from the 8th- century BCE royal palace of Tiglath-Pileser III at Nimrud. The siege may have been the one depicted on a stone relief at the royal palace in Nimrud, where the city was called 'Gazru'. ===Hellenistic period=== During the Hellenistic period, Gezer was fortified by the Maccabees and was ruled by the independent Jewish Hasmonean dynasty (). ===Post-Hellenistic periods=== Gezer was sparsely populated during Roman times and later times, as other regional population centers took its place. ===Crusader period=== In 1177, the plains around Gezer were the site of the Battle of Montgisard, in which the Crusaders under Baldwin IV defeated the forces of Saladin. There was a Crusader Lordship of Montgisard and apparently a castle stood there, a short distance from Ramleh. ===Ottoman and modern periods=== ==Selected archaeological findings== In July 2017, archaeologists discovered skeletal remains of a family of three, one of the adults and a child wearing earrings, believed to have been killed during an Egyptian invasion in the 13th-century BCE. A 13th century BCE amulet, various scarabs and cylinder seals were also found on the site. The amulet bears the cartouches ‚Äîor official royal monikers‚Äî of the Egyptian Pharaohs Thutmose III and Ramses II. ===Canaanite water system=== Canaanite water tunnel at Tel Gezer A large Canaanite (Bronze Age) water system comprising a tunnel going down to a spring, similar to those found in Jerusalem, Hazor and Megiddo, was first excavated by Macalister and was re-excavated as part of the 2006-17 campaigns of the Tel Gezer Excavation and Publication Project. ===\\"Gezer calendar\\"=== Large replica of the Gezer calendar in Gezer National Park One of the best-known finds is the Gezer calendar. This is a plaque containing a text appearing to be either a schoolboy's memory exercises, or something designated for the collection of taxes from farmers. Another possibility is that the text was a popular folk song, or child's song, listing the months of the year according to the agricultural seasons. It has proved to be of value by informing modern researchers of ancient Middle Eastern script and language, as well as the agricultural seasons. ===Israelite city gate, wall=== In 1957 Yigael Yadin identified a wall and six-chambered gateway very similar in construction to remains excavated at Megiddo and Hazor as Solomonic; they have since been reinterpreted by some as dating from several centuries later. ===Boundary stones=== Boundary inscription from Hellenistic Gezer, in Aramaic or Hebrew (top) and Greek (bottom) Thirteen boundary stones have been identified near the tell, distanced between less than 200 metres to almost 2 km from it, probably dating from the Late Hellenistic period (late second \\\\- first century BCE), the most recent having been found by archaeologists from SWBTS in 2012. See also Location. There are only a few \\"lost\\" biblical cities that have been positively identified through inscriptions discovered by means of archaeological work (surveys or digs). Gezer is the first among them thanks to Clermont-Ganneau's discovery of three such inscribed stones in 1874 and of a fourth in 1881. Ten of the thirteen inscriptions are bilingual, including the first three ones, containing two distinct parts, one in Greek and one either Hebrew or Aramaic, and written in what is known as square Hebrew characters. Clermont-Ganneau's reading of the Hebrew/Aramaic part as \\"the boundary of Gezer\\" was later confirmed. The inscriptions' Greek part contains personal names, either (H)alkios, Alexas, or Archelaos, for instance Clermont-Ganneau's four stones were all bearing the inscription \\"of Alkios\\". Sometimes the two parts are upside-down, or \\"t√™te- b√™che\\", in relation to each other, on the last discovered one the lines being separated by a line and the Hebrew/Aramaic inscription \\"Tehum Gezer\\" (\\"the boundary of Gezer\\") facing the tell. With the discovery of the last nine inscriptions it became evident that their distribution does not support Clermont-Ganneau's initial interpretation, of them marking Gezer's Sabbath limit, but rather that they probably mark the boundaries between private estates, or between city land and these estates. Analysis of the lettering have led to the conclusion that they were all contemporaneous, with opinions based on palaeography and history slightly diverging in regard to their date - either Hasmonean or Herodian. The earlier date and the Hebrew script can be connected to what we know from the First Book of Maccabees about Simon replacing the gentile inhabitants with Jewish ones () The later date can be supported by a scenario in which Herod, after acquiring the lands of the vanquished Hasmoneans, gave them to (H)alkios, Archelaos and Alexas, all three names mentioned by Josephus for members of a powerful land-owning family from Herod's court. Language: Hebrew or Aramaic According to David M. Jacobson, who states that the inscriptions are in Hebrew, this is an interesting fact, considering that Aramaic was the common administrative language in Judaea by the late Second Temple period. Other scholars are not convinced that the language of the inscriptions is indeed Hebrew, not Aramaic, leaving both options as possible, as is the case in the Corpus Inscriptionum Iudaeae/Palaestinae. ==See also== *Archaeology of Israel ==References== ==Further reading== *William G.

The highest point of the hill lies within Fort Southwick at 131m above sea level. The ridge offers good views to the south over Portsmouth, the Solent, Hayling Island and Gosport, with the Isle of Wight beyond. The hill is on the mainland, just to the north of Ports Creek, which separates the mainland from Portsea Island, on which lies the main part of the city of Portsmouth, one of the United Kingdom's main naval bases. To the north lies the Forest of Bere, with the South Downs visible in the distance. Butser Hill can be seen on a clear day. The hill is formed from an inlier of chalk which has been brought to the surface by an east‚Äìwest upfold of the local strata known as the Portsdown Anticline.British Geological Survey 1998 Fareham England and Wales sheet 316 solid and drift geology. 1:50,000 (Keyworth, Nottingham: BGS) Southwick House is close by the north side of the hill, the HQ for U.S. General Dwight D.

The A3(M) motorway cuts through the east side of the hill while the original A3 climbs over the centre by the George Inn pub and Christ Church. The nearest railway stations (from west to east) are Portchester, Cosham and Bedhampton. There are many stories about real and imagined tunnels in the hill.http://www.portsdown-tunnels.org.uk/index.html The area contains active military research establishments, including one of the core sites of Dstl (known as Dstl Portsdown West) and sites run by QinetiQ. Part of the hill has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

A series of 6 forts were planned along the of the ridge. From west to east they are forts Fareham, Wallington, Nelson, Southwick, Widley and Purbrook. The line was finished off at the eastern end with Crookhorn Redoubt and Farlington Redoubt. The main threat was perceived to be from Napoleon III of France, but this receded soon after the forts' completion. Due to this they became known as \\"Palmerston's Folly\\" but, though never needed for their original purpose, were useful anti-aircraft gun emplacements during World War II. Fort Fareham is now a small industrial estate.http://www.subterraneanhistory.co.uk/2009/03/fort-fareham- hampshire.html The remains of the Fort are Grade II listed. Fort Wallington has been largely demolished to make way for an industrial estate.http://fwie.co.uk/ What remains is now a Grade II Listed Building. Fort Nelson has been extensively restored as an artillery museum run by the Royal Armouries. It is a Grade I Listed Building, the highest level of designation.

Grazing ceased in the early 1950s, and consequently the site was gradually invaded by scrub, mostly hawthorn, dogwood, and wild privet. An intensive restoration programme funded by the Countryside Commission and Portsmouth City Council was initiated in 1995; large areas of scrub have now been cleared by machine, and flowers and grasses allowed to regenerate naturally. Scrub re-encroachment is controlled by cattle and horses which graze overwinter. Several species of butterfly became extinct owing to the loss of habitat to scrub, notably the Adonis blue, silver-studded blue, dingy skipper, and dark green fritillary. Others such as the chalkhill blue and small blue were at the brink of extinction, but are now flourishing again. Indeed, the hill has now probably the largest metapopulation of the small blue in the UK. ==References== ==External links== * Palmerston Forts Society * Victorian Forts data sheet on Fort Purbrook * Victorian Forts data sheet on Fort Widley * Victorian Forts data sheet on Fort Southwick * Victorian Forts data sheet on Fort Wallington * Victorian Forts data sheet on Crookhorn Redoubt * Portsdown Tunnels * Christ Church Portsdown * Fort Southwick * Fort Widley * The Royal Armouries at Fort Nelson - Official Site. * The Royal Armouries at Fort Nelson - Guide * Conservation Management and Volunteering on Portsdown Hill - the SSSI bit Category:History of Hampshire Category:Hills of Hampshire Category:Palmerston Forts Category:Napoleonic beacons in England ","title":"Portsdown Hill"},{"id":"830674","text":"Randall Gene Spelling (born October 9, 1978) is an American former actor who became a life coach.

Prior to this the mountain had been locally known as Sgurr Biorach.http://www.spns.org.uk/oldnotes4.html Scottish Place-Name Society. Retrieved 4 June 2015 ==Ascent== As with other hills of the Cuillin, a head for heights and scrambling ability are needed to attain the summit. The least technical route follows a feature known as the \\"Great Stone Chute\\", a scree gully that leads up from the corrie of Coire Lagan to a col just below the main ridge. From this col, a pleasant scramble (Grade 2 standard) up the well scratched east ridge leads to the narrow summit.The Islands of Scotland, Scottish Mountain Club Guidebook (1989 edition). Other routes require scrambling ability or rock climbing; while there are rock climbs directly up the flanks, the only other way of reaching the summit via a ridge is the south-west ridge, a Grade 3 scramble that begins up a scratched chimney which can be accessed from the summit of Sg√πrr Sgumain or from Coir' a' Ghrunnda; there is also a slightly easier route from the top of this chimney directly up a shallow gully on the south face. The summit of Sg√πrr Alasdair can be attained by a short detour (from Sg√πrr The√†rlaich) off the main ridge by climbers undertaking the full traverse of the Cuillin ridge, or by those following the circuit of Coire Lagan.

A field with a non-trivial discrete valuation is called a discrete valuation field. ==Discrete valuation rings and valuations on fields== To every field K with discrete valuation u we can associate the subring ::\\\\mathcal{O}_K := \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in K \\\\mid u(x) \\\\geq 0 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} of K, which is a discrete valuation ring. Conversely, the valuation u: A \\\\rightarrow \\\\Z\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{\\\\infty\\\\\\\\} on a discrete valuation ring A can be extended in a unique way to a discrete valuation on the quotient field K=\\\\text{Quot}(A); the associated discrete valuation ring \\\\mathcal{O}_K is just A. ==Examples== * For a fixed prime p and for any element x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q} different from zero write x = p^j\\\\frac{a}{b} with j, a,b \\\\in \\\\Z such that p does not divide a,b.

This means: if u(f)=j>0 then f has a root of order j at the point p; if u(f)=j<0 then f has a pole of order -j at p. In a similar manner, one also defines a discrete valuation on the function field of an algebraic curve for every regular point p on the curve.

O2 Ireland was previously called Esat Digifone when it was owned by Esat Telecommunications (and Telenor) from 1997 to 2006. O2 Ireland became a subsidiary of Telef√≥nica in 2006, after its parent company O2 in the United Kingdom was purchased. In June 2013, Hutchison Whampoa announced it would acquire the Irish arm of O2 for ‚Ç¨780m. O2 was merged into Hutchison Whampoa's subsidiary Three Ireland in March 2015. == History  1997‚Äì2000: Origin === Esat Digifone In 1995 the then government, with Michael Lowry as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, authorised a second mobile phone network, to compete with Eircell owned by the semi-state Telecom √âireann. The licence was awarded to Esat Digifone, a joint venture between Denis O'Brien's company Esat Telecommunications and Norway's Telenor, which began operations in 1997. The Moriarty Tribunal found in 2008 that the awarding of the licence was influenced by payments made to Lowry by O'Brien. === 2000‚Äì2001: BT ownership. === In 1999, Esat Telecom and Telenor began to dispute how Esat Digifone should be operated. Telenor removed the word Esat from the companies name, and began the attempted removal of Denis O'Brien as chairman of Digifone. Esat Telecom retaliated by threatening to take legal action against Telenor, and make repeated offers to buy Telenor's share of Digifone. In November 1999, Telenor placed a bid for the entire share capital of Esat Telecom as a way of resolving the conflict. The bid was rejected by the majority shareholders of Esat Telecommunications who voted against the takeover. In January 2000, British Telecommunications counteracted Esat Telecom failed bid by placing its own bid to buy Telenor's shares in Digifone. In January 2000, British Telecommunications made a takeover offer for Telenor which was backed by Esat Telecommunications shareholders. Esat Telecommunications became a wholly owned subsidiary of British Telecommunications and was delisted from the stock market. When BT acquired Esat, they began integrating the business along with its Northern Ireland subsidiary, BT (NI). This eventually became BT Ireland. However Esat Digifone was not part of the operations integrated with BT's existing Irish operations. Instead, it became part of the BT Wireless division within BT, and was briefly rebranded simply Digifone. This branding lasted for less than six months. ===2001‚Äì2005: Demerger from BT Ireland=== In 2001, the BT Wireless division became mmO2 plc, a separate company, through a demerger from BT. British Telecommunications shareholders received 1 BT Group and 1 mm02 share for each British Telecommunications share they held. After the de- merger, most of mmO2's operations, including Digifone, were rebranded O2. mmO2 plc later became O2 plc and remained an independent company until 2005. === 2005‚Äì2006: Telef√≥nica transition === On 31 October 2005 it was announced that Telef√≥nica, S.A., the Spanish telecommunications company, had made a recommended takeover bid for O2 Ireland's parent company, O2 plc. This was then approved by shareholders and O2 was officially purchased in mid February 2006. The O2 brand is now used in several countries for Telef√≥nica's mobile operations outside Spain and Latin America, where Telef√≥nica fixed line and mobile services are branded as movistar. In January 2009, it was revealed that Ireland was nearly the most profitable market in the world for multinational mobile operators like O2. ===2006-2013=== On 23 March 2009 Vodafone and O2's parent company Telef√≥nica announced a deal to share their existing networks in Ireland and rollout future infrastructure jointly.\\"O2 and Vodafone to share network infrastructure\\", The Independent, Monday 23 March 2009. On 6 April 2011 it was announced that Telef√≥nica O2 Ireland and Eircom had agreed a new network sharing partnership.‚ÄúO2 Ireland &Eircom; in network sharing deal‚Äù, RT√â News, Wednesday, 06 April 2011. === 2013: Hutchison 3 Ireland merger === On 24 June 2013, it was announced that Hutchison Whampoa would acquire Telef√≥nica's Irish mobile operations for ‚Ç¨780 million, to be merged into 3 Ireland upon completion of the deal. The deal was cleared by the EU in June 2014. On 15 July 2014, the acquisition was fully completed. On 2 March 2015 it was announced on social media that O2 Ireland and Three Ireland were merging with O2 posting the following message to their Twitter page: \\"Today, O2 will become Three as 1.5 million customers are welcomed into the Three family. This means the O2 logo will be replaced by a Three logo in stores, on the website, and on phones and bills. All the benefits you experienced as an O2 customer remain the same, including the same network quality and award winning customer service. You can also look forward to improved data coverage and superfast broadband.\\" While Three Ireland posted the following message on their Twitter page: \\"Today we welcome 1.5 million customers to Three. This means the O2 logo will be replaced by a Three logo in stores, on the website, and on phones and bills. Please visit our FAQ section if you have any further questions.\\" This change meant that Three Ireland had over 1.5 million customers on their network putting them up near the customer numbers of Vodafone Ireland. ==Services== O2 was the second largest telecommunications provider in Ireland, with approximately 40% market share or 1.6 million customers. The company's STD prefix was 086, but following the introduction of full number portability, some O2 Irish mobile numbers featured prefixes starting 087, 085, 089 or 083, as customers may switch provider but keep their old phone number. The company provided WAP and GPRS services under the O2 Active brand. In October 2005, O2 Ireland launched a version of NTT DoCoMo's i-mode service. The company held a UMTS licence, and was the third Irish operator to offer 3G services, after Vodafone Ireland and Three Ireland, offering services in some built-up areas in late 2006. ===O2 Broadband=== In July 2007, O2 launched its mobile broadband offering in Ireland using HSDPA technology over its 3G network. They provided speeds of up to 7.2 Mbit/s and claimed to cover 90% of the population on the least contended Irish 3G network following an upgrade in 2007. ===Speak Easy=== Speak Easy was the name of O2 Ireland's prepaid service. In 2007 they became the first Irish operator to offer free text messages to all Irish mobile numbers, although it only applied for weekends. However, in early 2008 they introduced a new tariff which offered unlimited free text messages to all networks at any time, for life. The term \\"speak easy\\" was introduced when the company was branded as Esat Digifone ===O2 Freedom=== The O2 Freedom plans were introduced in June 2013 which offered 2 main new price plans, Freedom talk and Freedom Internet. O2 was the first Irish operator to offer free calls to all networks at any time on prepay. This offer was Freedom Talk and gave customers Unlimited calls to all Irish mobiles and landlines which required a ‚Ç¨20 top up of which ‚Ç¨10 was deducted for the offer. Freedom Internet offered 1GB of data and 350 any network texts. Same terms applied as per Freedom talk. In December 2013 the data allowance of 1GB was increased to 7.5GB which O2 advertised as Unlimited Internet. Along with the new price plan O2 also launched a vast amount of prepay addons such as Talk, Text, Data, International Talk and International text. ==Corporate affairsCompany structure=== In 2010, O2 underwent a restructuring phase, implementing a number of cost-cutting measures which involved outsourcing internal divisions to external companies. O2's IT division was outsourced to IBM Ireland, while the Network Operations division was outsourced to BT Ireland (who also run the network operations for Three Ireland). The Network team outsource was limited to the Field Operations team along with some other support functions. The Network rollout team & Transmission team remained in-house to facilitate future network changes. It was more cost effective to retain these divisions in-house. ===Charitable activities=== In 2006 O2 chose Irish Autism Action as their charity of choice. The three-year deal involved sponsorship, creating awareness, using O2 staff to assist the charity and using technology developed by O2 to assist children affected by autism. In 2010, the company's charity of choice became Headstrong, a charity providing mental health support to young people. ===Sponsorship programmes=== Over the years, O2 entered into some very high-profile sponsorship arrangements. In 1998 the then ESAT Digifone committed its support to the Hurlers & Footballers of Cork. They remained sponsors of Cork GAA for ten years. Another high-profile sponsorship agreement was their association with the Irish Rugby Football Union and the Ireland national team, which has been continued by Three. Building on their rugby links with Shannon RFU, O2 joined forces with the top level of rugby in Ireland. They also sponsored the West Stand at Ireland's former home ground, Lansdowne Road. They were also the title sponsor of one of the country's most high-profile venue, \\"The O2\\", now renamed the \\"3Arena\\". They were title sponsor of the Aisling Foundation's Ability Awards.https://www.rte.ie/tv/theafternoonshow/2010/0510/theo2abilityawards915.html ===Chief executive=== Tony Hanway was Chief Executive of Telef√≥nica Ireland from his appointment in September 2011 until March 2015. Hanway first joined Telef√≥nica in Ireland in 2005 as Head of Customer Care, subsequently becoming Consumer Sales Director. Immediately prior to taking the role, Hanway headed up the Consumer division of Telef√≥nica in the Czech Republic, managing a team of over 4000 people across the retail, online and customer care functions. ==Criticism== In July 2004 the company admitted overcharging 71,000 customers following a review of its systems. The disclosure meant that 136,535 O2 subscribers - more than 10 per cent of its customer base - were overcharged. Analysis by the Sunday Independent in January 2006 showed the massive margins being earned by Vodafone and O2 in the country were costing Irish mobile phone users about ‚Ç¨300m a year. If the mobile phone companies were to cut their Irish margins to the group average, O2 customers would end up paying ‚Ç¨84.07 less every year (‚Ç¨7 a month less). The European Commission upheld a ruling by the Irish regulatory body, ComReg, that the Irish mobile phone market needed greater competition, and acknowledged that \\"tacit collusion possibly existed between O2 and Vodafone\\". In May 2007, O2 Ireland management announced that the entire O2 Ireland technical staff were to be outsourced to a single Managed Service Provider. The next month O2 customers got a busy signal or no dial tone at all when they tried to make calls due to a network glitch. The reason for the glitch remained a mystery at the time because the company's spokesperson couldn't be reached by the media on her mobile, also seemingly affected by the problem. The Consumers' Association of Ireland lodged a complaint with the Competition Authority over a loophole used by O2 that allowed it to bombard customers with unwanted text messages. The telecoms lobby group ALTO criticised O2 Ireland for its decision to quadruple the revenue it generated from calls to the 1850 LoCall number. This is a fixed price, shared cost service used by charities and a number of public service bodies. The company was criticised for its monthly subscription fees levied on Irish users of the iPhone, as they represented poor value for money when compared with the services available to customers paying similar amounts in the UK. Less than 48 hours after the much hyped launch of Apple's latest model, owners of all phones on the O2 network discovered they could not access the internet at all due to a network failure. Further criticism came from iPhone customers regarding the continued failure of O2 to deploy Visual Voicemail. O2 was the only carrier in the world to launch the original iPhone without Visual Voicemail, one of its headline features. O2 was responsible for the highest number of registered judgments, which financially blacklists those people who do not pay their bills on time in August 2008. The Advertising Standards Authority upheld complaints concerning advertisements by O2. In August 2010, O2 was warned by the telecoms watchdog, ComReg, that it could not move customers to online billing without their explicit agreement. In March 2011, O2 pleaded guilty to a breach of the Data Protection Act at the Dublin District Court. In March 2011, it was revealed that Denis O'Brien made payments to the Minister for Communications, Michael Lowry, to aid Esat Digifone's licence bid. ==See also== * List of Irish companies * List of mobile network operators of Europe == References == ==External links== * Category:Telef√≥nica Category:Telecommunications companies of the Republic of Ireland Category:Telecommunications in the Republic of Ireland Category:Telecommunications companies established in 1997 Category:Companies disestablished in 2015 ","title":"O2 (Ireland)"},{"id":"830834","text":"Boca grande is Spanish for big mouth.

His death from cancer shocked and saddened the Brown community, as few knew about it in advance. ==Early life and education== Swearer was born on March 13, 1932 in Hutchinson, Kansas. His undergraduate work was at Princeton University, graduating in 1954. He earned a master‚Äôs and a Ph.D. in political science from Harvard University, in 1956 and 1960, respectively.

It was during the Swearer administration that Carleton's Winter Break was extended from four to six weeks by moving the start date of fall term two weeks earlier. Due to the high fuel prices in 1974 with the OPEC embargo, Swearer and the college's treasurer suggested the change might save fuel (not only would the college be largely unoccupied for a longer period during the colder months of November and December, but students who wished to visit home for Thanksgiving would not need to return to campus immediately afterward and then head home again a week or two later). Though students were at the time opposed to the change, their objections were overruled and it was put into effect for the 1974-1975 school year. A poll taken in 1975 found a high level of support for the change, and Carleton has had a six-week winter break ever since.Hillemann, Eric. Winter Break.

During his tenure there, he led another successful capital campaign that increased several research grants and allowed for several deferred building projects to go forward. In 1985, Swearer helped found Campus Compact, a national non-profit dedicated to the civic purpose of higher education and the development of future democratic leaders. Swearer believed universities should be communities of compassionate people involved in serious intellectual pursuits, but never divorced from the realities of their communities.Howard R.

Wells, John Galsworthy and Arnold Bennett. ==Biography== Swinnerton was born in Wood Green, a suburb of London, the son of Charles Swinnerton, a copperplate engraver, and Rose, n√©e Cottam. Contemporary Authors Online. The Gale Group, 2000, accessed 22 November 2008 ===Career=== Swinnerton left school at the age of 14 and was employed as an office boy for a newspaper publisher, Hay, Nisbet & Co and then as a clerk-receptionist by J. M. Dent, publishers of Everyman's Library.The Times obituary, 10 November 1982, p. 14 He moved on to the publishing house of Chatto & Windus, first as a proof- reader and then as an editor. Although he began writing novels in 1909, he continued editing until he became a full-time author in 1926. Even then, he also worked as literary critic for the magazine Truth, the London Evening News (1929‚Äì32) and The Observer (1937-43). As a novelist, Swinnerton achieved critical and commercial success with Nocturne in 1917, and remained a successful writer for the rest of his life. His last novel, Some Achieve Greatness (1976), was published when he was in his early nineties. Some critics detected echoes of George Gissing and Arnold Bennett in Swinnerton's work, but he himself thought his chief influences were Henry James, Henrik Ibsen and Louisa May Alcott. His prose style was \\"natural and lucid\\", and he was disapproving of over-intellectual or pretentious writing. In The Georgian Literary Scene, an evocation of the era of the gentlemanly man of letters in its final years, he wrote, \\"If I dwell for a moment longer, as I fear I must, upon the weakness of too much scholarship in the arts, it is because I think scholarship is nowadays excessively valued as a necessary preliminary to creative writing.\\" Of all of his critical contributions, The Georgian Literary Scene stands out, and it is still used by those who study the period. The New York Times declared it \\"wholly ‚Äì and most refreshingly ‚Äì unlike other literary histories.\\" Swinnerton himself said of his work: \\"My best books, in my own opinion, are Harvest Comedy and The Georgian Literary Scene, but I do not regard either one as of lasting importance.... I live in the country, am very lazy, work unwillingly very hard, and have few intolerances.\\" ===Personal life=== Swinnerton lived for more than fifty years in Old Tokefield, Cranleigh, Surrey, a rural spot not far from London. He was twice married; his first marriage, in 1917, to the poet Helen Dircks, ended in divorce. In 1924 he married Mary Dorothy Bennett, with whom he had one daughter. Swinnerton died at Old Tokefield at the age of 98. His obituary notice in The Times began by noting that his death \\"breaks one of the last links with his great contemporaries, Wells, Galsworthy and Arnold Bennett.\\" == Bibliography == *The Merry Heart, 1909. *The Young Idea, 1910. *The Casement, 1911. *The Happy Family, 1912. *George Gissing: a Critical Study, 1912. *On the Staircase, 1914. *R.

He was the brother of Herbert Bayard Swope, and father of Henrietta Swope and John Swope, the Hollywood and Life Magazine photographer who married actress Dorothy McGuire. He is possibly best known for his labor relations innovations. At General Elctric, Swope implemented numerous labor reforms, making conditions better for employees with voluntary unemployment insurance, profit-sharing, and other programs considered that were radical in their day. Swope increased sales and overall efficiency (economics), earning high profits and market share and focused on employee training, retention, and loyalty. Before the passage of the Wagner Act, Swope \\"had long supported labor legislation.\\"Richman, Sheldon, Libertarian Left , The American Conservative (March 2011) He served as Chairman of The Business Council, then known as the Business Advisory Council, for the United States Department of Commerce in 1933.The Business Council, Official website, Background Swope's other Roosevelt administration roles included member, Industrial Advisory Board of the National Recovery Administration (NRA) (1933); member, Bureau of Advertising and Planning of the Department of Commerce (1933); chairman, Coal Advisory Board (1933); member, National Labor Board (1933); member, President's Advisory Council on Economic Security (1934); and member, Advisory Council on Social Security (1937-1938). Swope was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in 1942, when he was chairman of the Committee to Study Budgets of Relief Appeals for Foreign Countries. For his work, he won the Hoover Medal.Book Rags, Gerald Swope Biography, available at www.bookrags.com. He died in New York City in 1957. In 2005, Forbes Magazine ranked Swope as the 20th most influential businessman of all time. ==Swope Plan== In September 1931, Swope presented a proposal for recovery. Under Swope plan, the Federal Trade Commission would supervise trade associations established for each industry. Trade associations would cover every company with at least 50 employees after three years. Associations would regulate output and set prices. Workers would receive life insurance, pensions, and unemployment insurance paid for in part by employers. The Chamber of Commerce and other conservative groups provided enthusiastic support.Garraty, John (1986). The Great Depression. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. , p. 149. President Herbert Hoover, who strongly supported voluntary trade associations, denounced the plan for being compulsory, inefficient, and monopolistic.Garraty (1986), p. 191 In an oral history interview, Leon H.

In particular, she measured the period- luminosity relation for Cepheid stars, which are bright variable stars whose periods of variability relate directly to their intrinsic luminosities. Their measured periods can therefore be related to their distances and used to measure the size of the Milky Way and distances to other galaxies. ==Personal life== She was the daughter of Gerard Swope, and niece of Herbert Bayard Swope. Her father went to MIT and was an engineer. He worked for General Electric, eventually rising to be president of the company and enabling Ms. Swope to be independently wealthy throughout her life. By vacationing with her family on Nantucket, she learned of talks at Maria Mitchell Observatory, and took an evening class there alongside her brother. She also heard Harvard astronomer Harlow Shapley speak; eventually she would go to work with him on variable stars. ==Education== Swope attended Barnard College, and graduated in 1925, with an AB degree in mathematics. She only took an astronomy class, from Harold Jacoby, in her final year. After college, she went back to Chicago and attended the School of Social Service Administration, at the University of Chicago, but only for one year. While working with Harlow Shapley, she obtained Masters in Astronomy in 1928 from Radcliffe College. ==Professional history== She learned that Dr. Shapley at Harvard was offering fellowships for women to work on finding variable stars. Swope went to work for Shapley in 1926 and began working alongside other \\"girls\\" to identify variable stars in the Milky Way. She became friends with Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin and Adelaide Ames. She supported herself on a salary from Harvard and a stipend from her family. She became an expert on estimating magnitudes of stars from images on photographic plates. Swope left Harvard at the start of World War II to work for the Hydrographic office at MIT. In her Oral History, she says, \\"...they said, 'How much were you getting [at Harvard]?' And I said, I think, $2000. That‚Äôs what they say they would pay me, what I was getting, but that was too little for them. They couldn't. So I rose fairly quickly.\\" During the war, 1942-1947, she worked on the LORAN navigation tables. After the War, Swope taught for two years at Barnard college and Connecticut College for Women and did research using old plates from Harvard. In 1952, Walter Baade of the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Observatories asked her, via Martin Schwarzschild as an intermediary, to come work with him on variable stars detected in other galaxies by the new 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory. Although she was hired as Baade's research assistant, in the \\"nebular-studies\\" group, she worked independently even to the point of writing scientific publications with his name on them after his death. She stayed at the Carnegie Institution for the rest of her career; she officially retired in 1968. In 1964, a paper by Baade & Swope reported the results of light curves for 275 Cepheids derived by Swope from photographic plates of the Andromeda Galaxy taken at the relatively new Hale 200-inch Telescope at Palomar Mountain. They reported a new distance to M31, given as a distance modulus of 24.25. They followed up this work in 1963 with new results of 20 Cepheids in a region of Andromeda less affected by extinction and estimated a new distance modulus of 24.20 mag. ==Legacy== In 1967, Swope made a donation of securities valued at $650,000 to the Carnegie Institution of Washington to develop \\"optical astronomical observatory facilities in the Southern Hemisphere.\\" This gift was used for development of the site, including roads, water, and power systems, and for building a 40-inch telescope at Carnegie's Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. This telescope was named the Swope Telescope in her honor; it started operation in 1971 and is still used today. Swope also left most of her estate to Carnegie to support further Las Campanas and astronomical research at the institution more generally. Henrietta Hill Swope died at the age of 78 in Pasadena in California. ==Awards and honors== * Annie J.

Swope spent most of his career at the New York World. He was the first and three-time recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for Reporting. Swope was called the greatest reporter of his time by Lord Northcliffe of the London Daily Mail. ==Background== Herbert Bayard (pronounced \\"by-ard\\") Swope was born on January 5, 1882 in St. Louis, Missouri, to German immigrants Ida Cohn and Isaac Swope, a watchcase maker. He was the youngest of four children - the younger brother of businessman and General Electric president Gerard Swope. ==Career== Time Cover, 28 Jan 1924 Swope was the first recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for Reporting in 1917 for a series of articles that year entitled \\"Inside the German Empire\\"Pulitzer Prizes for Reporting, 1917‚Äì1947, pulitzer.org; accessed January 15, 2017. The articles formed the basis for a book released in 1917 entitled Inside the German Empire: In the Third Year of the War (), which he co-authored with James W. Gerard. He is known for saying, \\"I can't give you a sure-fire formula for success, but I can give you a formula for failure: try to please everybody all the time.\\" He is also credited with coining the phrase \\"Cold War\\". Although standard editorial pages have been printed by newspapers for many centuries, Swope established the first modern op-ed page in 1921. When he took over as editor in 1920, he realized that the page opposite the editorials, was \\"a catchall for book reviews, society boilerplate, and obituaries.\\" He wrote: > \\"It occurred to me that nothing is more interesting than opinion when > opinion is interesting, so I devised a method of cleaning off the page > opposite the editorial, which became the most important in America... and > thereon I decided to print opinions, ignoring facts.\\"Swope, H. B. as quoted > in Meyer, K. (1990). Pundits, poets, and wits. New York: Oxford University > Press, p. xxxvii. Swope served as the editor for New York World's 21-day crusade against the Ku Klux Klan in October 1921, which won the newspaper the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 1922. As an example of investigative journalism, it was ranked 81st of the top 100 journalism stories of the 20th century by New York University's journalism department. He was a legendary poker player, at one point winning over $470,000 in a game with an oil baron, a steel magnate, and an entertainer.Press, Politics and Poker - Howard Bayard Swope by Byron Liggett, Poker Player (newspaper). April 4, 2005. He was also a member of a social club, the precursor to the Algonquin Round Table known as the Thanatopsis Inside Straight and Pleasure Club. He was inducted into the Croquet Hall of Fame of the United States Croquet Association in 1979 and his son Herbert Bayard Swope, Jr. in 1981. ==Mansion== Swope died in 1958, aged 76, at his home, known as Land's End, Prospect Point, Sands Point, New York. He hosted parties with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier, Dorothy Parker, Harpo Marx, Winston Churchill, Averell Harriman, Albert Einstein, Alexander Woollcott - as well as F. Scott Fitzgerald. These associations, along with other similarities to the houses and events in The Great Gatsby, helped give rise to unsubstantiated reports that Fitzgerald had modeled Daisy Buchanan's home in the 1925 novel after Swope's home. However, Swope did not buy Land's End until late 1928. The more likely explanation that ties Swope to Fitzgerald is the time period of 1922‚Äì24, when Fitzgerald was living in nearby Great Neck. Prior to buying the Sands Point mansion, Swope had been renting a home since 1919 on East Shore Road in Great Neck, overlooking Manhasset Bay. The property was directly north of 325 East Shore Road, the residence of sportswriter Ring Lardner. The two were good friends. David O. Selznick and Jock Whitney met at the home many times throughout the 20s and 30s and held meetings at the mansion that secured funding for Gone with the Wind. Other reports suggest the home, built in 1902, had been designed by Stanford White - although most sources dispute the claim. The clapboard colonial mansion included 15 bedrooms and 14 baths (eleven full baths), a seven-car garage, a tennis court with a tennis pavilion, a rose garden and a guest house - on 13.35 acres. The waterfront mansion had originally been built for clothing merchant John S. Browning Sr. in 1911 and originally named Kidd's Rocks. It was purchased in 1921 by Malcolm D. Sloane, whose wife renamed the estate Keewaydin. The house had been a site for a Vanity Fair photo shoot with Madonna and had been a location for the 1978 shooting of The Greek Tycoon, a film on the life of Aristotle Onassis. Keith Richards' family lived there for a time in the early 1980s. Charles Shipman Payson and his wife, Virginia Kraft, purchased the house in the 1980s. In 2005 she sold the house to developer Bert Brodsky of Port Washington for $17.5 million. ‚ÄúThey misrepresented themselves‚Äù, Payson told The Observer, \\"I would not show it to any developer. He said that his life's ambition was to live in that manor, but it was very clear at the closing that they had no intention of living in it. They are the most awful people I have ever heard of, and that includes terrorists and dictators. They have taken a work of art and permitted it to be totally decimated. It was in pristine condition when I left ... He let it fall apart. He stripped everything out that he could sell, which is sacrilegious. I went by the house perhaps two years after we sold it, and that‚Äôs when I realized how he was going to get around the town's objections. Broken windows, storming in‚Äîit‚Äôs sinful\\". In 2011, the home was razed and the property was subdivided. ==References== ==Further reading== * Kahn, E. J. The World of Swope: A Biography of Herbert Bayard Swope (1965) * Lewis, Alfred Allan.

As a member of The Chaser, he is best known for co-writing and appearing on satirical ABC Television shows CNNNN (2002‚Äì2003) and The Chaser's War on Everything (2006 ‚Äì July 2009). He formerly co-hosted the drive radio show Today Today (2004‚Äì05) on Triple J with fellow Chaser member Craig Reucassel, and in 2007, he wrote the musical comedy Dead Caesar. Taylor also hosted the mini documentary series 'Australia's Heritage: National Treasures'. In 2010, with his Chaser colleague Andrew Hansen, Taylor made a musical comedy series for Triple J titled The Blow Parade, which became the number one podcast in the country, and won the 2010 ARIA Award for Best Comedy Release. In 2019, Taylor was the creator and co-writer of the drama Upright starring Tim Minchin. The series screened to critical acclaim in both Australia and the UK. ==Early years== Taylor grew up on Sydney's Northern Beaches and North Shore and attended Shore School, North Sydney. After completing secondary school, Taylor undertook an arts degree at the University of Sydney, and also studied play-writing at NIDA. But at 21 he abandoned play-writing and went back to university to study journalism at University of Technology, Sydney. In 1997 he moved to Melbourne after the ABC offered him a journalism cadetship there. For five years Taylor worked as an ABC journalist, including two years as a court reporter. He covered cases including the murder of toddler Jaidyn Leskie, the fatal Longford gas explosion and the unsuccessful defamation action by the then Victorian premier Jeff Kennett against The Australian. Taylor then moved back to Sydney in 2001 to work full-time for The Chaser's newspaper, and ultimately became a Chaser member. Chris is also a cricketer and plays in an amateur team \\"The Mighty Ducks\\" with Julian Morrow Pedestrian TV and Charles Firth. == CNNNN == In 2001, Andrew Denton got hold of one of The Chaser's newspapers and gave them the opportunity to produce a television show, hence The Chaser team produced their first ABC Television program The Election Chaser, which covered the 2001 Australian Federal Election. They then went on to create other television shows for ABC TV, including two series of the Logie Award-winning CNNNN in 2002‚Äì03 (in which Taylor portrayed a chief commentator), and The Chaser Decides in 2004, which covered the 2004 Australian Federal Election. == Triple J == In addition to his roles on television, Taylor has teamed up with Chaser colleague Andrew Hansen to write and star in a musical comedy series, The Blow Parade, on Australian radio station Triple J from 14 April 2010 until 26 May 2010. The program will also be available to download free of charge for a limited time. Taylor also united with fellow Chaser Craig Reucassel to present the Triple J drive slot, Today Today in 2004‚Äì2005. As part of his role on Today Today, Taylor wrote and voiced a weekly Coma FM sketch, satirising the formats and style of commercial radio. He also co-hosted the radio program Bloody Sunday with Reucassel in 2006 and 2007. During the shows Chris would regularly ask listeners to \\"go for broke\\" and vandalise Wikipedia pages. Tara Reid, Peter Overton and Wikipedia's own Wikipedia page were chosen targets. And in 2008 Taylor and Reucassel returned to present The Race Race, covering the US Presidential election. The show quickly became the number one podcast in the country. Taylor also has the distinction of being Roy Slaven's official understudy at Triple J, broadcasting alongside HG Nelson on This Sporting Life and a Twenty20 cricket game on the couple of instances when Roy Slaven was absent. In a notable instance while working at Triple J, Taylor agreed to streak across the grounds of the Sydney Big Day Out if the theme song from Media Watch polled in the 'Triple J Hottest 100' Countdown. It was announced that in terms of votes counted, the Media Watch theme had in fact come in at number 7, and Taylor proceeded to do his nude run in front of a large group of spectators.Today Today On Triple J With Chris And Craig ‚Äì Nude Run , Triple J, 4 December 2007. == The Chaser's War on Everything == Taylor, who's often referred to as \\"Tayls\\" by his colleagues, is one of the main presenters on The Chaser's War on Everything. He is also the program's script editor and principal writer behind many of the show's segments, sketches and songs, some of which were controversial. === Appearance on Sunrise === In The Chaser's War on Everything skit \\"Will You Divorce Me?\\", Taylor made a guest appearance on Sunrise, a live morning talk show on Channel 7. He said he had an announcement for his wife and ended up yelling \\"Get the fuck out of my life\\" at the camera. The appearance of authenticity of this clip made it appear as though the segment went live to air on Sunrise, but it only ever appeared on The Chaser's War on Everything. When the segment became a viral video, Taylor and the hosts admitted it was staged on the Sunrise set after one of their shows though the latter said the dialogue was improvised and unaware of the profane punchline. === Tim Freedman parody === Taylor sparked controversy with Tim Freedman, singer and songwriter of indie rock band The Whitlams. On 7 October 2007, Freedman posted a message on the band's official website, citing a parody of him which was written by Taylor and had aired on the 3 October 2007 episode of The War.I Love The Chaser , The Whitlams, 7 October 2007. The song was performed by a fellow Chaser, Andrew Hansen, and the lyrics implied that Freedman was obsessed with the Sydney suburb of Newtown and that he continually referred to the area of Newtown in his own songs. In his message, Freedman said that the lyrics were indeed written by Taylor and that the parody had been motivated by jealousy over a woman they had both dated, Anna Skellern, who was a non-contributing cast member in the first season of CNNNN. Taylor denied this and said that the song had nothing to do with Skellern.Tim Freedman hits back at Chaser, NineMSN, 10 October 2007. Andrew Hansen in the commentary track for the Season 2 DVD revealed that Taylor and Freedman had sorted the issue out and that everything between them was all good. In the final episode of Season 3, Freedman even made a friendly cameo appearance on the show in a mock oral sex scene with Taylor. === The Eulogy Song === On 17 October 2007 episode of The War, Andrew Hansen performed The Eulogy Song,song a song written by Taylor which satirised the lives of several deceased celebrities, including Peter Brock, Princess Diana, Donald Bradman, Steve Irwin, Stan Zemanek, John Lennon, Jeff Buckley, and Kerry Packer, expressing the view that people with flaws during life are often disproportionately hailed as \\"top blokes\\" after death. The song became the target of significant media attention, with several radio and television personalities saying the song was in \\"bad taste\\". Then Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, and then Opposition Leader, Kevin Rudd, expressed negative views. In response to the attention, Taylor defended the song, stating that it was a legitimate skit about the way the media airbrushes celebrities in death. He also revealed it was a \\"watered down\\" version of the song which was previously performed on stage in the musical Dead Caesar. The original had a verse about Rene Rivkin, but it was replaced with one about Stan Zemanek.From \\"The Chaser's Bore on Everything Q&A; session\\", 11 December 2007. Andrew Hansen performed an updated version of The Eulogy Song in his 2020 national tour. == Dead Caesar == As well as writing for The Chaser's War on Everything, Taylor wrote the play called Dead Caesar which premiered at the Sydney Theatre Company on 1 February 2007, and then had a one-month run in July 2007. The play was a musical comedy based on the life of Julius Caesar, featuring original music composed by Andrew Hansen, who also appeared in the play as Mark Antony and Lucius. The now infamous Eulogy Song was originally written for this production. ==See also== == References == == External links == * * Today Today At The Triple J Website * 2003 Interview ‚Äì The Thrill Of The Chase * 2007 Sydney Morning Herald Interview * 2007 ABC Interview * Chris Taylor, Hell Is For Hyphenates, 31 October 2013 Category:1974 births Category:The Chaser members Category:ARIA Award winners Category:Australian television writers Category:Australian television personalities Category:Triple J announcers Category:Australian dramatists and playwrights Category:Australian male comedians Category:Comedians from Sydney Category:Living people Category:People educated at Sydney Church of England Grammar School Category:University of Technology Sydney alumni Category:People from the North Shore, Sydney Category:Male television writers ","title":"Chris Taylor (comedian)"},{"id":"830933","text":"Long Ashton Research Station (LARS) was an agricultural and horticultural government-funded research centre located in the village of Long Ashton near Bristol, UK. It was created in 1903 to study and improve the West Country cider industry and became part of the University of Bristol in 1912. Later, it expanded into fruit research (particularly apples, pears, plums, strawberries and blackcurrants) and in the 1980s was redirected to work on arable crops and aspects of botany. It closed in 2003. The Research Station is known for developing Ribena a still popular vitamin C-rich drink that was widely distributed in the UK during the Second World War. ==History of LARS== The Hirst Laboratory at Long Ashton Research on cider making began privately in 1893 at Robert Neville-Grenville's farm near Glastonbury. This led to the formation of the National Fruit and Cider Institute in 1903 in fields south of the main road through Long Ashton. Frederick Lloyd was appointed Director. In 1912 the Institute became the University of Bristol's Department of Agricultural and Horticultural Research and its name was changed to Long Ashton Research Station. Indeed, the Universities of Bath and Bristol ran Master of Science (MSc) courses at the research station for many years. The first purpose built laboratory, the Barker Laboratory, was ready for use in 1914. Fenswood Farm on the north side of the road was bought by the University in 1920 to extend the space available for experiments, and in 1921 the Campden Research Station was taken under Long Ashton's management. The plant pathologists Lawrence Ogilvie and Brian Mulligan at Long Ashton Research Station 1930 The British Government formed the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) in 1931 and this body was given a direct role in managing LARS. During World War II a home grown source of Vitamin C was needed and the blackcurrant drink Ribena was developed at Long Ashton. A new Biology Laboratory was completed in 1948 and in 1952, although links with Campden Research Station ended, the ARC Unit of Plant Nutrition was set up at Long Ashton. The Station's 50th year was celebrated by the publication of a book, Science and Fruit. The 1950s were a time of rapid expansion for Long Ashton with the opening of the Kearns and Hewitt Laboratories (1956) and the Wallace Laboratory, Refectory and Conference Room (1959). The first Long Ashton International Symposium was held in 1967. 1981 saw the disbandment of two of Long Ashton's major research divisions, the Pomology and Plant Breeding Division and the Food and Beverage Division. This action by the ARC was a severe blow to the Research Station and began a long period of structural change. The Hirst Laboratory was built in 1983 as part of the reorganisation process, and work on arable crops substantially replaced Long Ashton's long history of work on fruit and cider. The Wallace Laboratory at Long Ashton, following closure of the site The Agricultural and Food Research Council (AFRC, previously ARC) closed other research sites including the Letcombe Laboratory (1985) and the Weed Research Organisation (1986) and their staff and programmes were moved to Long Ashton. With Rothamsted it became part of the Institute of Arable Crops Research (IACR) in 1986. Although the new Treharne Library and Fryer Laboratory were built in 1987, as a junior partner in IACR, Long Ashton was now vulnerable in the event of further restructuring. The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC, formed from the previous AFRC in 1994) announced in 1999 that Long Ashton was to be closed. The seventeenth and final Long Ashton International Symposium took place in 2002 and the Research Station was duly closed in 2003 having served agriculture and horticulture for exactly 100 years. Some of the remaining staff were moved to Rothamsted during Long Ashton's final years, providing some continuity with the programmes of work under way prior to closure. The site was sold and subsequently redeveloped for housing, employment space, community uses and playing fields. ==Nutrient solution== Long Ashton is also commonly known for the development of the Long Ashton Nutrient Solution (LANS).Hewitt E.

He is best known for being a member of satirical team The Chaser. He hosted the Australian version of Balls of Steel, which premiered in April 2011. Since 2013, Reucassel and fellow Chaser Julian Morrow have been main presenters on the ABC program The Checkout. In 2017, Reucassel presented the four-part ABC TV series War on Waste which focused on clothing and food waste in Australia, its environmental impacts and what can be done to help reduce waste. This was followed by a second series in 2018, which focused on the use of plastics, and particularly 'single-use' plastics such as straws. == Early life == Reucassel was born in South Africa on 1 January 1977 and later moved to Adelaide with his parents. There, he attended Semaphore Park Primary School. Reucassel later attended Bowral Public School and Bowral High School in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, becoming the only Chaser member to be public school educated. In 1993 while attending the school he represented the school in The Sydney Morning Herald Plain English Speaking competition, as did future Chaser member Julian Morrow. Reucassel attended the University of Sydney, and completed a Bachelor of Economics (Social Science) degree in 1999 and graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 2002. With a strong dedication to extracurricular activities on campus, Reucassel ran the Arts revue and the canoe club, and was an editor of the student newspaper Honi Soit. He also debated at several World Universities Debating Championships including ranking 30th in the World at Manila in 1999,World Debate Website and ranking 167th in Glasgow in 2001.World Debate Website Furthermore, in 2000 he competed in the Philip C. Jessup Cup international law mooting competition, his team winning the Australian rounds. He graduated from the Sydney Law School, along with Chaser colleagues Julian Morrow, Dominic Knight and Chas Licciardello. == Triple J == In 2004 and 2005, Reucassel co-hosted the drive- time radio show Today Today on Triple J with fellow Chaser Chris Taylor. The pair returned with their Sunday afternoon show Bloody Sunday to do relief shifts in mid-2006 and summer 2006‚Äì07. == The Chaser's War on Everything == series of APEC pranks. Reucassel was a founding member of the satirical multi-media group The Chaser team, and worked to produce their satirical newspaper, as well as television shows on ABC TV including The Election Chaser, CNNNN, The Chaser Decides and The Chaser's War on Everything. He has been one of the main presenters on The War since the pilot episode. He and his wife Keisha have three children together, and their son Ollie has appeared on some of the sketches on The War. Reucassel was often the one selected to confront former Prime Minister John Howard on his morning walks, most famously in the axe stunt (see below). === Speedos incident === On 19 March 2007, during a campaign appearance for the New South Wales State Election, the then opposition leader Peter Debnam was confronted by Reucassel wearing nothing but Speedos and a baseball cap, making fun of Debnam's campaign appearances in the swimwear. When TV cameras remained focused on Reucassel rather than Mr Debnam, he said, \\"Sorry, I'm not Peter Debnam, he's over there. Just because I'm wearing this doesn't mean I'm Peter Debnam\\". Reucassel stuck around for the press conference but failed to draw a response from the opposition leader, and was again ignored when he went to shake Debnam's hand. === The axe stunt === On 2 August 2006, Reucassel responded to a news story about a private school student who had hugged then Prime Minister John Howard while holding a screwdriver during one of the PM's morning walks. To test the Prime Minister's security arrangements, he approached Howard during a morning walk and asked for a hug while holding a large plastic battle axe. Reucassel did receive the hug, but a later approach while holding a running chainsaw was not so successful. There was much debate surrounding whether to turn on the chainsaw and whether they would be shot at for doing this. Cut out from this segment was an unsuccessful attempt that took place between the axe and the chainsaw, in which Reucassel was holding a four-point-star mace.The Chaser's War on Everything Season 1.2 DVD audio commentary. ==Other work== Reucassel speaking at the 2017 Australian Skeptics convention.

He was the 29th and last person to be executed in the Republic of Ireland, as capital punishment was gradually abolished in the decades following Manning's execution. ==Murder and trial== Manning, a 25-year-old carter from Johnsgate in Limerick, was found guilty of the rape and murder of Catherine Cooper, a 65-year-old nurse who worked at Barringtons' Hospital in the city, in February 1954. Nurse Cooper's body was discovered on 18 November 1953 in the quarry under the New Castle, Dublin Road, Castletroy where she was found to have choked on grass stuffed into her mouth to keep her from screaming during the commission of the crime. Manning expressed remorse at the crime, which he did not deny. By his own account, he was making his way home on foot after a day‚Äôs drinking in The Black Swan, Annacotty when he saw a woman he did not recognise, walking alone. \\"I suddenly lost my head and jumped on the woman and remember no more until the lights of a car shone on me.\\" He took flight at this point but was arrested within hours, after his distinctive hat was found at the scene of the crime. Although Manning made an impassioned plea for clemency in a letter to Minister for Justice Gerald Boland, his request was denied despite it also being supported by Nurse Cooper's family. The execution by hanging was duly carried out on 20 April 1954 in Mountjoy Prison, Dublin by Albert Pierrepoint, who had travelled from Britain where he was one of three Senior Executioners. Frank Prendergast, subsequently TD for Limerick East who knew Manning well, recalled later, \\"Friends of mine who worked with me, I was serving my time at the time, went up to visit him on the Sunday before he was hanged. And they went to Mass and Holy Communion together and they played a game of handball that day. He couldn't have been more normal.\\" Manning left a wife who was pregnant at the time of the murder. His body was buried in an unmarked grave in a yard at Mountjoy Prison. ==Aftermath== The death penalty was abolished in 1964 for all but the murder of Garda√≠, diplomats and prison officers. It was abolished by statute for these remaining offences in 1990 and was finally expunged from the Constitution of Ireland by a referendum in 2001. ==Footnotes== == External links == *Capital punishment in Ireland since the foundation of the state Category:1929 births Category:1954 deaths Category:People from County Limerick Category:People executed by Ireland by hanging Category:People executed for murder Category:Executed Irish people Category:People executed by the Republic of Ireland Category:Irish people convicted of murder Category:Irish rapists Category:Irish criminals Category:20th-century Irish criminals ","title":"Michael Manning (murderer)"},{"id":"830953","text":"Theater of Salvation is the fourth (or third \\"official\\") studio album by German heavy metal band Edguy, released in 1999.

They solve murder cases in Munich and surroundings (with three unsolved cases in total). It was produced by Telenova Film und Fernsehproduktion in association with ZDF, ORF and SRG. Derrick is considered to be one of the most successful television programmes in German television history, it was also a major international success and the series was sold in over 100 countries. On 2 May 2013 ZDF announced it would no longer carry reruns of the show, after it emerged that Tappert had been untruthful in discussing his service in the Waffen-SS in World War II. ==History== All 281 60-minute episodes were written by veteran screenwriter Herbert Reinecker and produced by Helmut Ringelmann. As a rule, new Derrick episodes were broadcast on Friday night at 20:15. The series received enormous popularity and was aired in more than 100 countries worldwide. The series' discontinuation in October 1998 came as Horst Tappert had reached the age limit he had set himself. Derrick had many fan clubs abroad including the Netherlands and France. In France, Derrick is known as Inspecteur Derrick. In Italy, the show is called L‚Äôispettore Derrick. In Chinese, it is known as D√© li k√®. ==Evolution of concept== Some episodes follow a whodunit structure, others follow a howcatchem structure. The series took a noticeable turn towards psychological drama as time progressed and Derrick approached retirement age. Acting on a hunch, Derrick would ignore a number of possible suspects right from the start and, instead of doing the legwork often shown in police movies, would follow the main suspect to his or her favourite haunts and involve them in lengthy conversations, claiming that he had to get to know them better. Towards the end of the show the murderer, now revolted by what they had done, would then be prepared to confess to his or her crime without Derrick having to produce any further piece of evidence. Generally, there is little violence or bloodshed and no shoot-out at the end. ===Final episode=== This philosophy also held true to the last episode, \\"Das Abschiedsgeschenk\\" (\\"The Farewell Gift\\"). Originally, Derrick was supposed to die by the hands of one of the criminals he had incarcerated just as he is about to take a new job as the chief of Europol. But the violent end was eventually scrapped; while there is a shoot-out, no one is killed, and Derrick goes on into the dark city and towards a new life. ==Derrick and Klein== As the series begins Derrick has only recently been promoted from Hauptinspektor to Oberinspektor. The personal relationship between Derrick and his assistant, Klein, is characterized by Derrick's often annoyance over Klein which takes its form as sarcastic remarks to the point of rolling his eyes and shaking his head over his companion in front of witnesses and in public. The reason for this animosity remains unclear since Klein rarely makes any mistakes, yet Derrick seems to pick at him quite regularly. Klein on the other side never talks back and also never gives the slightest appearance of taking offense at this low-level bullying. These many minor episodes notwithstanding, the two work very professionally and organically as a team, however, with Derrick always as the leading partner. This behavior of Derrick becomes less noticeable as the seasons progress. Derrick hardly has any private life; a girl friend occurs only in two episodes. In one episode Derrick says, \\"no, I am no longer married\\"; Klein, on the other hand, does not seem to have any private life. However, as a younger inspector he seems to love getting statements from young, good-looking girls. In that respect and also in the way he goes about a case, Derrick resembles Lt. Columbo. However, as Umberto Eco has pointed out, Columbo is the obedient, seemingly helpless servant of a community of rich and powerful Californians while Derrick, elegantly dressed and impeccably behaved, always appears in control and superior even to the wealthy people he is tracking down. Just like an earlier television series, Der Kommissar (also written by Reinecker), Derrick features many prominent German and Austrian actors and actresses, including Lilli Palmer, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Maria Schell, Horst Buchholz, Curd J√ºrgens, Christine Kaufmann, Brigitte Mira, Gottfried John, Sybil Danning, Reinhard Kolldehoff, Carl M√∂hner, Eric Pohlmann, Anton Diffring and Christoph Waltz. Many appear repeatedly in different roles throughout several of the seasons. As one of the first western TV series shown on the screen of Chinese televisions after the country opened its gate to outside world in 1980s, the series (as \\"Detective Derek\\" - „ÄäÊé¢ÈïøÂæ∑ÈáåÂÖã„Äã) was popular in China. Reportedly it was also actually used to teach police officers and inspectors in proper procedure of tracing and solving criminal cases. Derrick reached cult status in Australia where it screened on SBS Television with English subtitles. ===\\"Harry, hol schon mal den Wagen\\"=== The famous phrase \\"Harry, hol schon mal den Wagen\\" (\\"Harry, bring the car 'round\\"; implying \\"we're done here\\") was attributed to Derrick and became part of popular culture in Germany and China as catch phrases. Actually, this phrase was never spoken in any of the 281 episodes; however, in the second episode of the series, \\"Johanna\\" (which premiered on 3 November 1974), Derrick orders Klein \\"Harry! Wir brauchen den Wagen sofort!\\" (\\"Harry! We need the car immediately!\\"). The exact same phrase was used by Erik Ode in the earlier TV Series Der Kommissar, where Fritz Wepper already played the character named Harry Klein, then the assistant to a different police inspector (played by Ode). It is unknown how exactly this phrase became attributed to Derrick, but one theory is that since Der Kommissar and Derrick were both created and written by screenwriter Herbert Reinecker, a TV critic may have attributed this phrase to the wrong one of Reinecker's series, after which it entered German popular culture as a catch phrase for Derrick. Horst Tappert did, however, speak this phrase in character as Stephan Derrick was as voice actor of his animated self in the 2004 animated feature film Derrick ‚Äî die Pflicht ruft (Derrick ‚Äî Duty calls). (See \\"Beam me up, Scotty\\" for a catch phrase with a similar background.) This animated film shed some satirical light on the ever-serious and sombre world of the original series, making fun of numerous clich√©s attributed to the series, including Harry's rumoured envy for Derrick always standing in the spotlight, while he, assistant for 25 years, always had to stand back behind his boss. ==International popularity== * The series, with English subtitles, was shown on SBS in Australia for many years. * The Chinese dubbed version was broadcast widely in many provincial TV stations in China in 1980s-1990s and the series became a smash hit. * In Norway Derrick has been shown throughout the show's history by state-owned broadcaster NRK. Reruns are still running. * In France the series has been shown on France 3 television weekday afternoons and was running until May 2013. * In South Africa, it was dubbed into Afrikaans, with the original German soundtrack simulcast over the radio. * In Iran, a Persian dubbed version of the series is still running in 2014 at TV station called Tamasha. * In India, an English dubbed version of the series ran on a state run TV station called Doordarshan during the 1980s. * In Italy, an Italian dubbed version of the series is still running in 2015 at TV station called TV2000. * In Kenya, an English dubbed version of the series ran on a state run media corporation called Kenya Broadcasting Corporation during the 1980s to 1990s. *In Uganda, an English dubbed version appeared on state television station, UTV, for much of the 80s and 90s alongside other popular German series like Tele-match and Didi's comedy show.

The series was parodied on the Norwegian comedy show √Öpen Post. It was humoristically claimed that NRK had bought the rights to produce dubbed remakes of the series' original episodes after the show stopped airing in Germany. However, NRK could not afford expensive remakes, leading to a very simplistic (and, in the viewers' eyes, ridiculous) approach to the show, involving uninspired actors and a strong lack of action. ==Books== Derrick was also used as the protagonist for a series of books published in Germany and Italy: * Das gro√üe Derrick Buch (), Henschel Verlag * Das Derrick Buch (), Henschel Verlag * Derrick ¬´Harry, hol schon mal den Wagen¬ª (), Ullstein (for ZDF) * Die Derrick Story (), BSV Burgschmiet Verlag * Grazie, Derrick (), Bompiani * Derrick ‚Äì L'ordre des choses (), Les Editions de l'H√®be * Derrick ‚Äì Eine Erfolgsgeschichte des deutschen Fernsehens (), Teiresias Verlag * Derrick oder Die Leidenschaft f√ºr das Mittelma√ü (), Dtv ==See also== * List of Derrick episodes *Der Kommissar *The Old Fox ==ReferencesCategory:1980s German television series Category:1990s German television series Category:1974 German television series debuts Category:1998 German television series endings Category:German crime television series Category:German drama television series Category:German- language television shows Category:Television shows set in Munich Category:Fictional German people Category:ZDF original programming ","title":"Derrick (TV series)"},{"id":"830973","text":"Mandrake is the fifth album by German power metal band Edguy, released in 2001.

Holub's work was heavily influenced by his experiences as an Immunologist, writing many poems using his scientific knowledge to poetic effect. His work is almost always unrhymed, so lends itself easily to translation. It has been translated into more than 30 languages and is especially popular in the English-speaking world. Although one of the most internationally well-known Czech poets, his reputation continues to languish at home. Holub was born in Plze≈à. His first book in Czech was Denn√≠ slu≈æba (1958), which abandoned the somewhat Stalinist bent of poems earlier in the decade (published in magazines). In English, he was first published in the Observer in 1962, and five years later a Selected Poems appeared in the Penguin Modern European Poets imprint, with an introduction by Al Alvarez and translations by Ian Milner and George Theiner. Holub's work was lauded by many, including Ted Hughes and Seamus Heaney,The New York Times, 22 July 1998 and his influence is visible in Hughes' collection Crow (1970). In addition to poetry, Holub wrote many short essays on various aspects of science, particularly biology and medicine (specifically immunology) and life. A collection of these, titled The Dimension of the Present Moment, is still in print. In the 1960s, he published two books of what he called 'semi-reportage' about extended visits to the United States. The minor planet 7496 Miroslavholub, an outer main belt asteroid, is named in his honour. ==Works in translation== * Vanishing Lung Syndrome, trans.

The village is close to the cliffs at Easton Bavents, a village now much eroded. Both were established before neighbouring Southwold. The parish church is St Margaret of Antioch.The Suffolk Churches Site. Retrieved 26 January 2009 The parish of Easton Bavents was merged with Reydon in 1987, when part of Southwold was also transferred. ==Communications and services== There are three main roads through Reydon, around which the village is built: A1095 Halesworth heading west to Blythburgh and Halesworth, B1126 Wangford heading north-west through Reydon to Wangford, and B1127 Lowestoft heading north-east to Wrentham and Lowestoft. The village of Reydon lies to the north of the town of Southwold. The three main roads converge at Reydon Corner, about 100 metres from Mights Bridge across Buss Creek, which provides the only road entry to Southwold. Reydon has two shops. Local opposition could not prevent the sub-post office from closing on 11 February 2008, but the associated shop continues. It also has a pub/hotel with restaurant, The Randolph Hotel, in Wangford Road.The Randolph Hotel It was renamed \\"The Cricketers\\", due to the adjacent locality of Southwold's former Eversley School cricket ground and playing fields, but reverted to its original name. The cricket ground was sold for housing and has now been built upon. Further along is a group of new houses on the site of a former senior school, Reydon Modern, renamed Reydon High after converting into a comprehensive in 1978, but closed in 1990. Continuing towards Wangford, there is St Margaret's Church (see below), then Reydon Hall, at one time the home of the writers Elizabeth Strickland, Agnes Strickland, Jane Margaret, Catharine Parr, Susanna Moodie and Samuel Strickland.Rosemary Mitchell, 'Strickland, Agnes (1796‚Äì1874)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 26 May 2015.

Housing replaced the former Eversley School playing field to the south of the Randolph Hotel, and further construction is planned on other vacant plots throughout the village, and on adjacent farmland. According to figures in the 2011 Census, Reydon's permanent population has risen to more than double that of Southwold. The spread of new homes has lost Reydon much of its village atmosphere. Additionally, rising house prices in Southwold have led to several properties in Reydon being purchased as second homes, often unoccupied for long periods. However, this is unlikely to affect the increase in permanent population, at least in the short term. In 2004, a 4400 m¬≤ distribution centre for Adnams Brewery was constructed on the western edge of Reydon on the site of an old open-cast sand quarry. ==The Church of St Margaret== St Margaret's Church, Reydon in the snow The parish church, dedicated to St Margaret of Antioch, stands in Wangford Road, to the north-west of the village. One of its striking features is a large, unnamed bronze angel inscribed \\"To Fanny my beloved wife\\". The present building is mainly from the early 14th century. The tower was built about 1325. The chancel was restyled in the 15th century, and has many niches for saints in the window splays. The church suffered damage during the Reformation and the Civil War and was much altered in succeeding centuries.Taken from 'A photographic and historical guide to the Parish Churches of East Suffolk' compiled by Adrian S. Pye. 27 January 2009. Page 213Taken from The Sole Bay Team Ministry. 27 January 2009.Taken from The Suffolk Churches Site. 27 January 2009. More drastic was the restoration and re-roofing of 1875‚Äì1887, which robbed the church of most of its old furnishings and architectural detail. The replacement roof is of a plain, simple design. The royal arms displayed are those of Queen Anne and date from 1713. In 1988 a large extension was built onto the north side of the nave using the original north door, which was reopened when the organ was moved into the chancel to allow for the building. The building is the frequently- used parish room. The rood loft stairs are open but partly bricked up at the top. The Victorian organ is in the chancel, for want of space in the nave, but it clutters the space and distracts attention from some Victorian stained glass. Behind the organ is a blocked entrance, also apparent from the outside. The small chapel to which it led has vanished. The font, of no great age, stands at the base of the tower, having been moved there from the nave in 1988 to improve access to a new parish room. The font cover, donated in 1922, was once suspended from the ceiling in the nave and operated by a system of weights; the wood in the roof still shows this. In 1999, the parish of Reydon became part of the Sole Bay Team Ministry. ===The church bells === 'Gabriel' in the 'up' position, set ready for ringing The tower originally held three bells, two of which were sold in 1792 to fund repairs to the church. In 1991 an appeal was launched to restore the tower, replace the two missing bells and procure a further three. These were dedicated at a service in December 1996. The original 15th-century bell, \\"Gabriel\\", has been joined by \\"Michael\\", \\"Raphael\\", \\"Peter\\", \\"Mary\\" and \\"Seraph\\", all cast at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1995 and 1996. The tenor (the largest) weighs 517 kg and the treble (the smallest) about a third of that. The bells hang in a two-tier steel frame, installed in 1995. The bells are hung for the traditional English art of change ringing. Ringing takes place from ground level with the font in the centre of the rope circle. The tower is affiliated to the Suffolk Guild of Ringers. The bells are rung regularly for practice, Sunday services, weddings and other special occasions.Taken from Doves Guide. 27 January 2009. ==Notable residents== In birth order: *Rev.

William Symington (1764‚Äì1831) was a Scottish engineer and inventor, and the builder of the first practical steamboat, the Charlotte Dundas. ==Early life== Symington was born in Leadhills, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, to a family he described as being \\"respectable but not wealthy.\\" His father worked as a practical mechanic at the Leadhills mines. Although his parents intended for him to enter the ministry, he intended to use his good education to make a career as an engineer. So, in 1785, he joined his brother George in his attempts to build a steam engine at Wanlockhead, Dumfriesshire. While there, he impressed the manager of a local mining company, Gilbert Meason, so much that he was sent to the University of Edinburgh in 1786 to spend a few months attending science lectures. By the time William joined his brother, George had already succeeded in building the second engine using James Watt's design to be built in Scotland. ==Improvements to Watt's design== William Symington William Symington quickly saw a way to marry the efficiency of the Watt engine with the simplicity of that devised by Thomas Newcomen. Encouraged by Gilbert Meason, Symington demonstrated the practicality of his idea and his improved atmospheric engine was patented in 1787. When Watt sent someone to make a sketch of how this new engine worked, he discovered that the steam was condensed under a second piston and this was then pushed down when fresh steam entered the cylinder, forcing out the condensate. The power piston worked by the atmospheric pressure acting on the vacuum created by the condensing steam. After its completion, Symington drew up a prospectus outlining the advantages of his invention, and this was circulated by Meason and his influential friends. ==Dalswinton steamboat== The banker Patrick Miller of Dalswinton, just north of Dumfries, had experimented with double hulled pleasure boats propelled by cranked paddle-wheels placed between the hulls, and he got Symington to build the patent steam engine with its drive into a pleasure boat built in 1785 which was successfully tried out on Dalswinton Loch near Miller's house on 14 October 1788. The trial was said to have been a success. Alexander Nasmyth depicted her on her trial run. A version of the illustration held by the Science Museum in London, Ref No. 0307379 shows her flying a red saltire, presumably a lithographer's mistake. James Nasmyth in his autobiography published in 1883 stated erroneously that she was built of tinned iron plate. ==The canal steamboat== After the successful demonstration of a steam engine on a boat, a larger engine was commissioned that would be tried in a boat on the Forth and Clyde Canal. The parts for the engine were ordered and an engine similar to that used previously, but a lot larger, was erected on another twin hull paddle boat. It was . The first trial, on 2 December 1789, was unsuccessful because the paddle wheels were not up to the task and began to break up when an increase in speed was attempted. Patrick Miller, the patron of the venture, sanctioned repairs and, on 26 and 27 December, more successful trials were done. ==Mines and mills== Although Symington is best remembered for his contribution to steam powered vessels, he also built successful engines for mines and mills. The first of these was built on a mine in Wanlockhead in 1790. This was followed by engines in Sanquhar, and then in London. In 1792, he built a large pumping engine that James Watt was also considered for. In the same year, he built an engine for the colliery of James Bruce. This marked a move to live near Falkirk and, later, a place as engine consultant for the Carron Company. In 1793, he developed a crank drive with a crosshead above the cylinder, and built such an engine to wind coal from one of Bruce's pits. his engine proved very successful and about fifteen were built. In all, there are firm references to thirty-two engines built by Symington up until 1808, and passing mention of several more. ==More steamboats== It was Thomas, Lord Dundas who would motivate further steamboat trials. This was because he had extensive business interests on the east and west coasts and was governor of the Forth and Clyde Canal Company. Therefore, the canal was essential to his business, and steam power could speed up the movement of vessels through the canal. It helped progress that the Dundas family were one of the most powerful families of the late 18th century. At a meeting of company directors on 5 June 1800, Dundas brought up the idea of having a Captain Schank boat worked by a steam engine provided by Symington. The directors immediately agreed that this was a good idea. A diagram of Symington's engine recently came to light and it showed an engine driving a forward wheel (or two wheels, one on either side) within the hull. The boat was built by Alexander Hart at Grangemouth and was tested on the River Carron in June 1801, when it moved with ease. It was less successful on the canal and was rejected by the committee. By 1800, Watt's patent had expired, so Symington set about the task of building a horizontal engine. He got a patent for his design in 1801. This design was ahead of its time because other engineers believed that it would not work. It was not widely accepted until 1825. ==The Charlotte Dundas== Since the Canal Company had not been satisfied with the first boat, Lord Dundas gave Symington his support for the building of a second boat. Therefore, a model of the new boat was shown to Dundas and was named after one of his daughters in an attempt to secure his interest. The hull of the boat was made by John Allan to Symington's direction and the Carron Company made the engine. The Charlotte Dundas was first sailed on 4 January 1803, with Lord Dundas and some of his friends and relatives on board. The crowd were pleased with what they saw, but Symington wanted to make improvements and another more ambitious trial was made on 28 March. On this occasion, the steamboat towed two loaded vessels through the canal, covering 18¬Ω miles in 9¬Ω hours. The Charlotte Dundas therefore became the first boat to do more than just move itself, but the Canal Company - to Symington's disappointment - did not wish to pursue the construction of another vessel. Symington was further upset when a scheme to build tug boats for the Duke of Bridgewater collapsed when the Duke died a few days before the trial was due to take place. ==Colliery manager== As well as an engine builder, Symington was a colliery manager, also known as a 'viewer'. His first appointment in this capacity was in 1794 when the Trustees asked him to take over on James Bruce's death. His salary for this was ¬£100 per annum and a house on the estate. This appointment ended in 1800 when Symington took over management of the Grange colliery near Bo'ness. William Cadell was behind Symington at this job. In 1804, he joined a local businessman in a partnership intended to manage the Callendar colliery at Falkirk. A new pump was needed there and this allowed Symington to develop what he called a 'lifting engine'. He may have built one of these for the Wanlockhead mines in 1789. The Callendar venture ended badly, however, and, in a dispute at the High Court in Edinburgh that lasted until 1810, Symington lost. ==Last years== Due to Patrick Miller's unwillingness to pursue the potential of the 1789 trial, the loss of interest from Lord Dundas and the proceedings at the High Court, Symington was left out-of-pocket. In 1829, in ill health and in debt, Symington and his wife moved to London to live with their daughter and her husband. Symington died in 1831 and was buried in St. Botulph's churchyard. In 1890, a bust was unveiled in Edinburgh, in what is now the National Museum, in memory of the great engineer. == References == *Harvey, W.S. & Downs-Rose, G. (1980).

He served as the first Secretary of the Air Force from 1947 to 1950 and was a United States Senator from Missouri from 1953 to 1976. Born in Amherst, Massachusetts, Symington worked as an executive in his uncle's iron products company and for other companies before becoming president of Emerson Electric. He resigned from Emerson in 1945 to take various positions in the administration of President Harry S. Truman, becoming the first Secretary of the Air Force in 1947. He was elected to the Senate in 1952, defeating incumbent Republican Senator James P. Kem. He joined the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and emerged as a prominent critic of McCarthyism. Symington sought the Democratic nomination in the 1960 presidential election with the backing of former President Truman, but the nomination went to John F. Kennedy. After the Kansas City Athletics moved to Oakland, Symington threatened to revoke Major League Baseball's antitrust exemption, which in turn encouraged the formation of the Kansas City Royals. Symington declined to seek re-election in 1976 and was succeeded by John Danforth. ==Education and business career== Symington was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, the son of Emily Kuhn (n√©e Harrison) and William Stuart Symington Jr. His father, who received a Ph.D in French literature, was a romance languages professor at Stanford and Amherst College before pursuing a law career and becoming a federal judge in Baltimore, Maryland.

Symington attended Roland Park Public School and the Gilman School, a private all-male preparatory school in Baltimore's Roland Park neighborhood. He graduated from Baltimore City College in 1918, and at the age of 17, Symington enlisted in the United States Army as a private first class during World War I. Stationed in an Officer Training Program at Camp Zachary Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, Symington was never deployed to fight in World War I, with the war ending before he could seek deployment. Symington was commissioned as a second lieutenant, becoming one of the youngest members of the Army to achieve that rank; being discharged as a second lieutenant in January 1919. He graduated from Yale University in 1923. At Yale he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter), the Elihu senior society, and served on the board of the Yale Daily News. In 1924, he married the former Evelyn Wadsworth in a lavish ceremony attended by President Coolidge and other prominent politicians. By all accounts, the two had a very happy marriage and were known for their devotions and faithfulness to each other, both of which were not always present among the social elite. When Evelyn died in 1972, Symington was devastated, telling his biographer that \\"he never knew this much loneliness could be around.\\" In 1923, Symington went to work for an uncle in the shops of the Symington Company of Rochester, New York, manufacturers of malleable iron products. Two years later he formed Eastern Clay Products but in 1927 returned to the Symington Company as executive assistant to the President. Symington resigned in 1930 to become President of the Colonial Radio Corporation. In January 1935, he accepted the presidency of Rustless Iron and Steel Corporation (manufacturers of stainless steel) but remained a director of Colonial Radio Corporation. When Rustless Iron and Steel Corporation was sold to the American Rolling Mill Company in 1937, Symington resigned and in 1938 accepted the presidency of Emerson Electric Company in St. Louis, Missouri. During World War II he transformed the company into the world's largest builder of airplane gun turrets. ==First Secretary of the Air Force== He resigned from Emerson in 1945 to join the administration of fellow Missourian Harry S. Truman. His first positions were chairman of the Surplus Property Board (1945), administrator of the Property Administration (1945‚Äì1946) and Assistant Secretary of War for Air (1946‚Äì1947). On September 18, 1947, the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force was created and Symington became the first Secretary. Symington had a stormy term as he worked to win respect for the United States Air Force, which previously had been part of the Army. He had numerous public battles with Secretary of Defense James Forrestal. ===Cancellation of the Flying Wing=== During his tenure, there was a major debate and investigation into production of the Convair B-36 Bomber, which was the last piston-powered bomber at the beginning of the Jet Age. During his tenure, Symington had a meeting with John K. Northrop on the contract for the Flying Wing bomber, which was well underway with seven examples manufactured. During this meeting, Symington threatened Northrop that if they refused to enter into a corporate merger with Consolidated (the company building the rival B36 bomber) that Northrop would be, \\"Goddamn sorry if you don't!\\". This threat was made in front of witnesses, and was eventually carried though when Symington cancelled the Flying Wing programme and ordered all existing aircraft destroyed. Major accomplishments during Symington's term as Secretary included the Berlin Airlift and championing the United States Air Force Academy. Symington resigned in 1950 to protest lack of funding for the Air Force after the USSR detonated its first nuclear weapon. He remained in the administration as the Chairman of the National Security Resources Board (1950‚Äì1951) and the Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Administrator (1951‚Äì1952). He was featured on the cover of Time magazine's January 19, 1948 issue. ==U.S. Senator== Symington while in the Senate. ===Election=== At the urging of his father-in- law James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr., a former Republican Speaker of the New York State Assembly and U.S. Senator from New York, Symington decided to run for the U.S. Senate. In 1952, he was elected Senator from Missouri, taking the seat previously held by Truman and scoring a win for the Democrats in a year otherwise favorable to the Republicans. He was re-elected in 1958, 1964, and 1970. ===Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees=== As a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees, Symington specialized in military affairs and became known as an advocate for a strong national defense. He was also a strong supporter of the Air Force Academy. In 1954, he charged that the Department of Defense had wasted millions of dollars on outdated weapons. He became a leading critic of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War (1957‚Äì1975). During 1966, he was thoroughly briefed on the Central Intelligence Agency-run covert operations of the Laotian Civil War. At one point, he was a guest of CIA Chief of Station Ted Shackley while touring the Kingdom of Laos. In the early 1970s, when his committee held hearings on the subject, Symington professed shocked outrage at the CIA's audacity. ===Opponent of Joseph McCarthy=== Symington was an especially vocal opponent of Senator Joseph McCarthy, to the vexation of the latter, who nicknamed him \\"Sanctimonious Stu\\". He involved himself in the case of Annie Lee Moss, who had been brought before McCarthy's committee under the accusation that she was a Communist spy. Evidence supporting this claim was given by an undercover FBI agent who could not be cross-examined by Mrs. Moss or her counsel. As it appeared that Moss had been mistakenly identified, Symington proclaimed before the packed audience that he believed she was not a Communist and had never been, receiving thunderous applause from those present. Later that year, Symington took a lead role in censuring McCarthy during the Army‚ÄìMcCarthy hearings, capitalizing upon his prominence and expertise as a former Secretary of the Air Force. ===Presidential candidacy=== In 1959, Symington, then Chairman of the National Security Resources Board in Washington, D.C., was preparing to run in the 1960 presidential election and won the backing of former President and fellow Missourian Harry Truman, but eventually lost the nomination to Senator John F. Kennedy. On July 2, 1960, Truman announced that he would not be attending the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Truman was miffed that the convention was being controlled by the \\"overzealous\\" supporters of Kennedy. Announcing his decision, Truman restated his support for the candidacy of Symington and added, \\"I have no second choice\\".Truman Charges Kennedy Backers Run Convention, Janson, Donald, New York Times, July 2, 1960 Symington, unlike Kennedy or Lyndon B. Johnson, refused to speak to segregated audiences in the southern United States and this hurt his chances. Additionally, having concluded that the nomination would be determined by party bosses at the convention, Symington declined to enter any of the Democratic primaries, clearing the way for Kennedy to win enough primaries to be the frontrunner and probable nominee as the convention opened. He was Kennedy's first choice for Vice President, but was dropped in favor of Texas Senator Lyndon B. Johnson. He advised President Kennedy as a member of EXCOMM during the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. ===Other issues=== Symington was also committed to constituent services, answering letters from Missouri citizens both important, trivial, and sometimes even zany. As an example, Symington once formally requested a report from military sources regarding the possible existence of subterranean superhumans, which one of his constituents had become concerned about after reading a fiction book and mistaking it for non-fiction. In 2002, this and Symington's other senatorial correspondence and papers were donated to the Western Historical Manuscripts Collection of the University of Missouri and are now available to the general public. In 1967 when Major League Baseball owners approved the move of the Kansas City Athletics to Oakland, California, he threatened legislation to revoke the league's antitrust exemption and vowed to support lawsuits challenging the legality of the reserve clause. Kansas City was awarded an expansion team, the Kansas City Royals, which was scheduled to begin play in 1971. Symington, saying Kansas City should not wait, continued to threaten the league, and the team began play in 1969. Symington did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto, and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court. ===Resignation=== In 1976, Symington did not seek a fifth term and resigned on December 27, a week before the end of his final term, so that his Republican successor, John Danforth, would gain a seniority advantage in the Senate. ==Legacy== In 1962, in recognition of his career, Princeton University's American Whig-Cliosophic Society awarded Symington the James Madison Award for Distinguished Public Service. His son, James W. Symington, served in the United States House of Representatives from Missouri's Second Congressional District from 1969 to 1977. His cousin, Fife Symington III, was Governor of Arizona from 1991 to 1997. His grandson, also named W. Stuart Symington, is employed by the U.S. State Department, serving as U.S. ambassador to Nigeria since 2016; he previously served as the U.S. ambassador to Djibouti (2006‚Äì2008) and Rwanda (2008‚Äì2011).State Department biography\\"Hope on the Horn of Africa\\", an interview with Stuart Symington He is a distant relative of UK-based travel writer Martin Symington. Symington was an active member of the Grand Lodge of Missouri Ancient Free and Accepted Masons. Symington retired in 1978 to his home in New Canaan, Connecticut, where he died on December 14, 1988. He is buried in a crypt in Washington National Cathedral. In Jeff Greenfield's alternate history book If Kennedy Lived, Symington is featured as surviving-President John F. Kennedy's running mate in the 1964 presidential election, after Vice President Lyndon Johnson was forced to leave due to financial scandals. ==See also== * Symington Amendment ==References== ==External links== - - Category:1901 births Category:1988 deaths Category:American people of English descent Category:Baltimore City College alumni Category:Burials at Washington National Cathedral Category:Democratic Party United States senators Category:Emerson Electric people Category:Missouri Democrats Category:Politicians from Amherst, Massachusetts Category:Politicians from Baltimore Category:Reconstruction Finance Corporation Category:Truman administration personnel Category:United States Army officers Category:Candidates in the 1956 United States presidential election Category:Candidates in the 1960 United States presidential election Category:20th-century American politicians Category:United States Secretaries of the Air Force Category:United States senators from Missouri Category:1956 United States vice-presidential candidates Category:Yale University alumni Category:Civilian recipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (United States) ","title":"Stuart Symington"},{"id":"831047","text":"Svazarm or Union for Cooperation with the Army (Czech: Svaz pro spolupr√°ci s arm√°dou / Svazarm, Slovak: Zv√§z pre spolupr√°cu s arm√°dou / Zv√§zarm), was, in Communist Czechoslovakia, the largest \\"paramilitary\\" organisation, although many of the activities that Svazarm provided for its members were more reminiscent of a Boy Scout movement than of a regimented paramilitary group. Established in 1951, the Svazarm was an almost exact copy of the Soviet Union's DOSAAF, however, with massively scaled down maritime activities as Czechoslovakia was landlocked. However, canoeing was still a popular activity. In 1985, it had about one million members, 60% of whom were under 35 years of age. ==Activities== The activities the Svazarm provided were extremely diverse, ranging from medical training to dog training. Dog lovers would be instructed in the training and breeding of dogs suitable for military purposes, especially German Shepherds. Shortwave radio operation was another popular activity, and was also useful for creating future radio operators in the army. A more specialised branch of the Svazarm, based at Ko≈°ice, trained pilots for the air force. Training included at least twenty flight hours of glider training and forty hours of basic training on motorised aeroplanes, as well as the necessary aviation theory. There were also sections: Model airplanes and gliding (formally DOSLET), motor sport section (motorcycles and cars) and all sorts of shooting sports. Svazarm also operated its own hi-fi club and record label, ƒås. Hifi-klub, which distributed its releases primarily to club members. The repertoire included Czechoslovak and Warsaw Pact as well as Western artists. ==Svazarm members in the armed forces== The Czechoslovakian military were usually less than impressed with the recruits that the Svazarm sent them, complaining that Svazarm members were \\"too soft\\" and lacked military knowledge. As military training for Svazarm members totalled 25 hours per year, and nearly all Svazarm instructors were insufficiently trained, this complaint was not unfounded. Many Svazarm members thought that as any World War III would be fought with nuclear weapons, conventional military training was a complete waste of time and thus took up an apathetic view of the entire Svazarm enterprise. It was also rumoured that many Svazarm trainers were not too enthusiastic themselves and would tell their students how to avoid being conscripted. ==External links== *Czechoslovakia - A Country Study Category:Organizations based in Czechoslovakia Category:Military of Czechoslovakia Category:1951 establishments in Czechoslovakia Category:Organizations established in 1951 ","title":"Svazarm"},{"id":"831048","text":"Ngwane V (also known as Mahlokohla, Bhunu, Hhili) (11 May 1876 - 10 December 1899) was the King of Swaziland from 1895 until his death on 10 December 1899. Ngwane was born the son of Mbandzeni and his mother was Labotsibeni Mdluli. He ascended to the throne after a short regency of Queen Mother Tibati Nkambule. He was only 16 years old when he became king. His royal capital was at Zombodze while the Queen Mother's residence was at Lobamba. Ngwane became the king after the Swaziland convention of 1894. This had led to the classification of Swaziland as a protected state of the South African Republic which was then led by President Paul Kruger. During this time Swaziland had a partial Dutch administration in parallel to Ngwane's administration. The Dutch or European for European interests and Ngwane as head and authority of the Swazi nation. An annual payment was made to Ngwane and Labotsibeni while they were in office from taxes collected and from contributions from concessionaires and taxes. Ngwane's rule was short. In 1899 the Anglo-Boer war began, and brought to an end the Dutch or Boer partial administration of Swaziland and hence gave way to independence. However Mahlokohla died on 10 December of that year while dancing incwala. This was hid from the nation until the ceremony was over. Ngwane was succeeded by his four-month-old son Nkhotfotjeni and his wife Lomawa Ndwandwe. His mother Labotsibeni who had been very influential during his reign continued as queen regent until Sobhuza was crowned in 1921. Ngwane's reign gave way to a stable territory surrounded by conflicting states. Today Mahlokohla is named for one of the main streets, Mahlokohla Street in Swaziland's capital Mbabane. ==Early life== Ingwenyama Ngwane was born in 1876 to King Mbandzeni and inkhosikati Labotsibeni. He became the crown prince of Swaziland after his father's death in 1889 during the paper conquest of Swaziland. He was however too young to be installed king, thus a queen regent ruled on his behalf until he was old enough and he was prepared for the reins of power. His mother Labotsibeni was the daughter of Matsafeni Mdluli who was a governor under Mswati II and was given the name Tsibeni while fighting the Tsibeni people in present-day Barberton. Ngwane had a younger brother named Prince Malunge. ==Reign== Ngwane's rule was very short but dramatic. The Swaziland convention of 1894 had seen Swaziland made a protected territory under the South African Republic. This meant that there existed some institutions in Swaziland particularly for European interests such as the concessionaires and other white settlers. The concessions, many of whom were granted during the reign of Mbandzeni and earlier by Mswati II were enforced and Ngwane and Queen Mother Labotsibeni were paid a stipend or proceeds from administrative revenues such as postal service, taxes and concession agreements. These taxes collected from Swazi residents meant that many had to seek employment in the tin and gold mines within the Kingdom or in the numerous mines of the South African Republic. The Transvaal authority in Swaziland was never fully implemented and Swazis continued to be directly ruled by traditional methods. In 1898 Ngwane allegedly ordered the killing of royal governor Mbhabha Nsibandze and his collaborators.\\"Dictionary of African Biography, lemma about Bhunu\\" \\"Killing off\\", a practice which existed in earlier precolonial times when the king had total judicial power was unacceptable to the Transvaal authorities. As a result, Ngwane was prosecuted. He first fled to Zululand which was under British Natal administration at the time. His return occurred after guarantees for his safety, after which he was tried in court in Bremersdorp (present day Manzini). Ngwane brought with him to court a large Swazi army, and in the trial was only charged with a minor offence of public disturbance. For this he was to pay a fine. For the rest of his rule, Ngwane oversaw a largely stable country and he maintained the old regimental system for warriors at the royal residences. In 1899 war broke out between the British and the Boer Republics of Transvaal and the Orange Free State. As a result, all white residents of Swaziland or burghers were advised to leave Swaziland in anticipation for the skirmishes about to take place. President Paul Kruger notified Ngwane of the unfolding events and their withdrawal and advised him to continue to \\"rule his country\\" in peace. Swaziland, in a precarious position announced its neutrality in the conflict. However this was not to be as the Anglo-Boer war took place in Swaziland territory later on. As the result of the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer war, Swaziland regained its independence. ==Later life== Ngwane died in December 1899 while dancing the sacred incwala ceremony at the age of 23. His death was speculated to be of poisoning and was not announced to the nation until the ceremony was over. The Swazi council then chose his wife Lomawa Ndwandwe and their four-month-old son Nkhotfotjeni to be Queen Mother and King. Sobhuza would remain as king-in-waiting until 1921 after a long regency of his grandmother Labotsibeni and his uncle Prince Malunge. Mahlokohla left Swaziland in an uncertain state but had led it as a stable country from a protectorate to short-lived independence (1899‚Äì1903). His son Sobhuza would rule Swaziland for 82 years and become the longest verifiable reigning monarch in history. ==References== Category:1876 births Category:1899 deaths Category:19th-century monarchs in Africa Category:Swazi monarchs ","title":"Ngwane V"},{"id":"831054","text":"Sir Roland Theodore Symonette (16 December 1898 ‚Äì 13 March 1980) achieved high office as a Bahamian political figure. He was leader of the United Bahamian Party (UBP), which some felt represented the interests of the \\"Bay Street Boys\\" and was the ruling party between 1958 and 1967.Nohlen, D. (2005), Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, p. 73. When the country achieved self-government in 1964 Symonette was the first premier. ==Biography== Roland \\"Pop\\" Symonette was one of nine children of Methodist minister Edwin Lofthouse Symonette and his wife Lavania Alethia (n√©e Weech) on the small island settlement of Current, Eleuthera. Although he had only six years of formal education, Symonette became one of the wealthiest men of his generation. An autodidact and lifelong advocate of education, he was a school teacher early in his career. As teaching was a difficult way to make a living, Symonette first tried to make his way as a fisherman in Riveria Beach, Florida and then during Prohibition, Symonette transported whiskey to the United States. During this time he engaged in business with the Bronfman syndicate via Sam Ross, the spouse of Libby Bronfman. Symonette parted ways with the Bronfmans as prohibition ended and when the Bronfman's were looking into more unsavory ways to profit from human vice. Presumably Symonette felt that in addition to being morally objectional, the Bronfman's plans would endanger the populace of his small homeland. Symonette's distaste for gambling and drugs was well known. With the profits from bootlegging, Sir Roland invested in real estate, hotels, a shipyard which built boats for the British Navy during WWII and eventually a wide range of philanthropic interests, including Camp Symonette, originally built for the youth of the Bahamas. The Symonette family's holdings have never been publicly confirmed, but public speculation has placed it between $700 million and US$2.5 billion. In 1925, Symonette campaigned successfully for a seat in the Bahamas' House of Assembly. He served in the House, representing the Shirlea district until his retirement in 1977. His 52 years as a Member of Parliament is the longest record of service in the House of Assembly. Symonette served as the head of government of the Bahama Islands from 1955 to 1964 and in 1964, when the country achieved internal self-government, he became the first Premier of the Bahama Islands. In 1959, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. Symonette's political opposition (the PLP)seeks to smear him by repeating that the United Bahamian Party (UBP) which Symonettee led was a \\"white oligarchy\\" intent on suppressing Afro-Bahamaians, this is an opinion not a fact. While it's true that he was conservative, Sir Roland's philanthropy extended to many Afro-Bahamian churches and individuals. (See obituaries, tributes published at the time of his death in 1981 plus ongoing conversations in groups such as \\"Bygone Bahamas\\".) The 1967 British Royal Commission of Inquiry reported that Symonette received 5,000 pounds from the U.S. casino interests who had left Cuba and were seeking a greater presence in The Bahamas. This sum was so modest to a man of Symonette's wealth that it is thought that he was acting as an informant to US intelligence agencies, who were concerned lest mobsters reestablish enterprises like the ones they operated in Cuba before the revolution. (See also Sir Stafford Sands). Source: Masters of Paradise: Organised Crime and the Internal Revenue Service in the Bahamas by Alan Block page 41 as quoted below: \\"‚Ä¶Of those on the executive council who were lobbied so in intensely and extensively, Sir Roland Symonette was the most reluctant and disturbed. Soon to become the first premier of the Bahamas with the passage of a new constitution in 1964, Symonette was morally opposed to gambling. And even though he finally accepted a modest consultancy agreement with DEVCO, he still could not bring himself to vote for the certificate. Shortly after this difficult and morally ambiguous period, Symonette became premier and resigned his consultancy, having collected only 5,000 pounds.(21)\\" ==Family life== Symonette was married three times. By his first wife Gertrude Nellie, Symonette had one son, Basil Harcourt. By his second wife, the former Thelma Bell Clepper of Andalusia, Alabama, Symonette had one son, Robert \\"Bobby\\", and one daughter, Zelda. In the late 1940s, Symonette married Canadian Margaret Frances, the union producing one daughter, Margaret Ann, who died of encephalitis when she was a toddler, and two sons, Roland Craig and Theodore Brent. Symonette's eldest son founded the Bitter End Resort in the BVI's. His second son Bobby served as Speaker of the House of Assembly. His youngest son Brent Symonette was the Deputy Prime Minister of The Bahamas, Free National Movement, Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Ingraham led government and in 2017 was appointed Minister of Financial Services, Trade & Industry and Immigration. His daughter was honored by the B'nai B'rith for improving relations between the races. Sir Roland Symonette died on 13 March 1980 at his home in Nassau; his widow, Lady Margaret Symonette died 24 years later in 2004. ==Legacy== Symonette's portrait appears on the Bahamian $50 note. A community park in the settlement of Current, Eleuthera, Bahamas, just feet from his birthplace, was named after him on what would have been his 111th birthday, 16 December 2009. ==See also== *\\"A Little Bit of Independent\\", Time Magazine, 24 January 1964. *\\"Consultant's Paradise Lost\\", Time Magazine, 8 September 1967. *\\"Bad News for the Bay Street Boys\\", Time Magazine, 20 January 1967. ==References== Category:1898 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Prime Ministers of the Bahamas Category:Foreign ministers of the Bahamas Category:United Bahamian Party politicians Category:Members of the House of Assembly of the Bahamas Category:People from Eleuthera Category:Knights Bachelor ","title":"Roland Theodore Symonette"},{"id":"831072","text":"Jan Syrov√Ω (24 January 1888 - 17 October 1970) was a Czechoslovak Army four star general and the prime minister during the Munich Crisis. ==Early life and military career== Jan Syrov√Ω studied building at a technical school. Following his graduation in 1906, he became a one-year volunteer in the Austro-Hungarian army. After that, he studied at a technical college in Russia. During World War I, he fought in the Czechoslovak Legions of the Russian army and lost his right eye in the Battle of Zborov.Precl√≠k, Vratislav.

By the end of the war he commanded the Legions and anti- Bolshevik forces on the Trans-Siberian railway. A well-known veteran commander, he served as Chief of Staff of the Czechoslovak Army from 1926 to 1933 and as is general inspector from 1933 to 1938. Vojensk√© osobnosti-Jan Syrov√Ω During this time, helped to prepare the Czechoslovak Air Force with the collaboration of Jan Anton√≠n Ba≈•a and moved military personnel and materials away from Nazi Germany. ==Premiership and the \\"Munich Crisis\\"== When Milan Hod≈æa's government resigned on 23 September 1938, President Edvard Bene≈° appointed Syrov√Ω to head a national unity government. Syrov√Ω demurred at first, insisting he was just a soldier, not a politician, and that he lacked the qualifications and relevant experience for such an important post. Bene≈° told Syrov√Ω that the nation needed him. The president added that as a soldier, Syrov√Ω should not consider it an offer but an order. With some reluctance, Syrov√Ω then accepted, and also took the defence portfolio as well. As Prime Minister, he was forced to accept the terms of the Munich Agreement on 30 September. Announcing the acceptance of the agreement in a nationwide radio address, he stated that Czechoslovakia was not in a position to turn the agreement down because without British or French support, the country was outnumbered and that any conflict would result in severe casualties. \\"We were abandoned\\", he said. \\"We stand alone.\\". Projev p≈ôedsedy vl√°dy Syrov√©ho 30. z√°≈ô√≠ 1938 Following the resignation of President Edvard Bene≈° on 5 October, Syrov√Ω assumed most presidential duties, in accord with the Czechoslovak Constitution, until Emil H√°cha was duly on elected President on 30 November 1938. He resigned the premiership on 1 December 1938, remaining as Minister of National Defence until 27 April 1939. He did not join the anti-German resistance since he was too well-known a figure for his involvement to be anything other than a liability. However, he arranged the transfer of substantial sums from a Legionary relief fund to assist the resistance and people facing persecution. == Postwar == On 14 May 1945, in the immediate aftermath of the war, Syrov√Ω was arrested and charged with collaboration (although he had consciously steered clear of that as far as his office allowed). In a show trial of alleged collaborators in 1947, the National Court found him guilty (along with Rudolf Beran) and sentenced him to 20 years of imprisonment in severe conditions. Released in 1960 by Anton√≠n Novotn√Ω's amnesty, Syrov√Ω was left with no pension or any means of maintenance, and the communist regime barred him from employment. Eventually, he was allowed to work as a nightwatchman, ironically guarding Ludƒõk Marold's panorama of the Battle of Lipany. Not until late 1967 did the regime grant him a limited retirement pension. Syrov√Ω was deeply wounded by the verdict of the National Court and remained so for the rest of his life. His own conscience was clear, and he never came to terms with the apparent injustice of the decision. He reviewed his trial in an interview for the Report Magazine in 1968 and stated that there were three critical pieces of evidence laid against him. The first was a snapshot of himself shaking hands with Adolf Hitler during a meeting that he was obliged to attend at the Prague Castle. Hitler had made a speech of reassurance as to Czechoslovakia's future under the 'protection' of the Reich and then held out his hand to Syrov√Ω, and the photographers immediately took a picture. Another photo provided the second piece of evidence was a photograph taken at a government banquet that showed Syrov√Ω sitting alongside Konrad Henlein. Syrov√Ω stated that the picture was taken out of context, to be used for Nazi propaganda. The third piece of critical evidence was an arms contract with the Nazis. Syrov√Ω stated the weapons sold had been obsolete items from the First World War, which were no longer of any use to Czechoslovakia and that the weapons had been sold to German private companies. He also stated that the decision to sell was made ultimately not by him alone but by the government as a whole. Syrov√Ω felt that if the allies of Czechoslovakia had offered their promised help, he would never have had to agree to the Munich dictate, but that under the circumstances, the Czechoslovak Army had no chance of success on its own.  Interview in the Report Magazine Syrov√Ω died on 17 October 1970. ==Decorations== Awarded by Belgium: :58px Order of the Crown, in the grade of: Grand Officer :58px Croix de Guerre 1914-18 Awarded by Czechoslovakia: :58px Czechoslovak War Cross 1918: with four linden branches :58px Order of the Falcon: with swords :58px Czechoslovak Revolutionary Medal 1914-18 with clasps: \\"ƒå.D.\\", \\"Zborov\\" and numbers \\"1\\", \\"2\\" :58px Czechoslovak Medal of Victory 1918 Awarded by Estonia: :58px Military Order of the Cross of the Eagle, for the Protection of the Country: I. class Awarded by France: :58px L√©gion d'honneur, in the grade of: Grand Officier ::::L√©gion d'honneur, in the grade of: Commandeur ::::L√©gion d'honneur, in the grade of: Officier ::::L√©gion d'honneur, in the grade of: Chevalier [Knight] :58px Croix de Guerre 1914-18: with palme From the right: ≈†pidl√≠k, ≈†vec, Syrov√Ω Image taken one day before Syrov√Ω lost his eye.

British Bechuanaland was a short-lived Crown colony of the United Kingdom that existed in southern Africa from its formation on 1 Sep 1885 until its annexation to the neighbouring Cape Colony on 16 Nov 1895. British Bechuanaland had an area of and a population of 84,210. Today the region forms part of South Africa. ==History== Bechuanaland meant \\"the country of the Tswana\\", and for administrative purposes was divided into two political entities. The northern part was administered as the Bechuanaland Protectorate and southern part, south of the Molopo River, was administered as the Crown colony of British Bechuanaland. In 1882 the Tswana country suffered two secessions by the Boer states of Stellaland and Goshen. For many months, starting in 1883, pressure was placed on the British Government to take action in Bechuanaland because of unrest in the area. On 29 October 1884, the British Government appointed Sir Charles Warren as Special Commissioner of Bechuanaland. On 13 November 1884 Parliament voted a sum of ¬£675,000 (this is equivalent to over ¬£32 million today) for military operations in Bechuanaland. Sir Charles Warren was authorised to recruit an irregular force of 1,500 in South Africa in addition to the regular troops that would be provided. A force of 4,000 troops, under Sir Charles Warren, set off to recapture Stellaland and Goshen. On 7 February 1885 the force reached Vryburg, the principal town in Stellaland, then continued to the hamlet of Rooigrond, the administrative centre of Goshen. Just north of Rooigrond the town of Mafeking was laid out as an administrative centre. By 8 April 1885, Sir Charles Warren sent a dispatch to notify the British Government that he had occupied Bechuanaland and had entirely restored order. The two Boer republics had collapsed without any bloodshed. On 30 September 1885 Stellaland, Goshen and other territories to the south of the Molopo and Nossob rivers (excluding Griqualand West) were constituted as the Crown Colony of British Bechuanaland.

It currently serves about 1,060 students and is a part of the Dickinson Public Schools system. The official school colors are orange and black and the athletic teams are known as the Midgets. A Midgets fan page of '64 In 1994, Dickinson adopted the block scheduling system, in which students attend only 4 courses a day, each 1.5 hours long, enabling them to earn more class credits than in other schools (which mandate 7 courses per day). They have recently added the \\"opportunity period,\\" which allows a 30-minute period for lunch. In this time the students can work on homework, tests, or whatever the teacher assigns. This takes place three days a week and freshmen are required to attend. If the other classes do not need the extra help, they get an extended lunch. There has been controversy surrounding Dickinson's mascot, the Midget. In the mid-1990s the school became concerned that their 80-year- old mascot was not very politically correct, and communicated that they were considering a change. In 1996, the school board voted to change the mascot. Residents of Dickinson were angry at the decision and recalled at least three of the board members. Another South Dakota school changed its nickname from \\"midget\\" to \\"mustangs\\" by request of the Little People of America, but Dickinson refused a change. In 2010, the school board's president, Dean Rummel, brought up the issue again but the board decided not to address it. In 2019, the Little People of America came to Dickinson to request again that the school consider changing the mascot. The school board directed the school district administration to collect feedback from the community about the change before agreeing to proceed. DHS educates an average of 1,000 students in grades nine through twelve each year, and employs 60 certified teachers and 35 classified staff members. DHS offers 328 different courses in a variety of subjects, as well as Advanced Placement courses and college dual-credit courses. ==History== Photograph of A.L. Hagen Junior High where Dickinson High School once was In 1909 the community built Central High School, a two-story structure of 12 classrooms. The first floor contained the library and assembly hall, and the basement served as the gym. Central High possessed the latest in technological marvels when electric lights were installed in 1910. The school stood on the southwest corner of the school block where P.S. Berg Elementary stands today. By the mid-1930s Dickinson's schools suffered from overcrowding. The school board felt it was time to build a new high school, but, despite information presented to the public, the city voted against the $100,000 bond issue necessary for construction. However, the school board applied for assistance from the Public Works Administration to build the high school and adjoining athletic field. Additions were made to this new Central High School in 1950. Central High School became increasingly more crowded and as the Model High at Dickinson State College closed in 1963, the need for a new high school was evident. The State Department of Vocational Education agreed to help with construction. Aerial photo of the new High School in Dickinson, ND In March 1966, voters approved the $1,525,000 bond issue for construction. The new high school, Dickinson High School, was designated as one of the two area vocational high schools in North Dakota. Several outbuildings and a new auditorium were added over the years. The 1981-1982 school year saw the largest student enrollment in the district's history, with 1,041 students in the high school. The former Central High became A.L. Hagen Junior High in 1968, when the new Dickinson High School was built on Empire Road north of town. ==Activities and athleticsChampionships=== *State Class 'A' speech: 2016 *State Class 'AAA' football: 1997 *State Class 'A' volleyball: 2005, 2006 *State Class 'A' boys basketball: 2003, 2007 *State Class 'A' baseball: 2001, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2016 *State Class 'A' boys' track and field: 1941, 1959, 1960, 1962, 1981, 1982, 1989, 1990, 1997, 1998, 1999 *State Class 'A' girls' track and field: 1975, 1976, 1977, 1980, 1990 *State Class 'A' boys' cross country: 1986, 2000 *State Class 'A' girls' cross country: 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 *State gymnastics: 1974, 1975, 1976, 1987, 1988, 2007, 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 *State Class 'A' dance team *Jazz: 2009 *Hip Hop: 2009 *State Science Bowl: 2008, 2009 ==Notable alumni and staff== *Mitch Malloy (born 1961), singer, songwriter, and producer mix and mastering engineer *Kelly Armstrong (born 1976), U.S. Representative for North Dakota's at-large congressional district *Cole Frenzel (born 1990), former collegiate and minor league baseball player, current professional outdoor enthusiast ==References== ==External links== *Dickinson High School website *Dickinson High School Alumni website Category:Public high schools in North Dakota Category:Educational institutions established in 1909 Category:Schools in Stark County, North Dakota Category:North Dakota High School Activities Association (Class A) Category:North Dakota High School Activities Association (Class AAA Football) Category:Dickinson, North Dakota Category:1909 establishments in North Dakota ","title":"Dickinson High School (Dickinson, North Dakota)"},{"id":"831109","text":"Hellfire Club, released March 15, 2004, is the sixth album by German power metal band Edguy.

The result was the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, a list of the top ranked wines, named the Grand Crus Class√©s (Great Classified Growths). With several thousand Chateaux producing their wines in Bordeaux, to be classified was to carry a mark of high prestige. Within the Grand Cru Class√© list, wines were further ranked and placed in one of five divisions. The best of the best wines were assigned the highest rank of Premier Cru; only four wines, Ch√¢teau Latour, Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild, Ch√¢teau Margaux and Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion were deemed worthy. Of all the 61 great classified wines, all but one came from the M√©doc region. The exception was the premier cru Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion, produced in Graves. The 1855 list remained unchanged for over a hundred years until finally Mouton Rothschild was promoted to Premier Cru status in 1973, after decades of relentless lobbying by its powerful owner, Baron Philippe de Rothschild. Of lesser importance, in 1988 the premier cru Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion was changed in appellation from Graves to Pessac-Leognan to represent apparent changes in soil structure caused by the urbanisation of areas surrounding Bordeaux. ===Bordeaux sweet wines=== Also in 1855, 21 of the best sweet wines from Bordeaux were classified as Grand Crus Class√©s in a separate list. In the original classification, nine wines (primarily from the Sauternes and Barsac regions) were classed as Premier Cru, while 11 were assigned the lower (though still prestigious) rank of Deuxi√®me Cru (Second Growth). One wine (Ch√¢teau d'Yquem) was considered so great it was granted a special Premier Cru Sup√©rieur classification. ===Other classification schemes in Bordeaux=== With the exception of Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion from Graves, the 1855 Classification did not include producers in the regions of Graves, Saint-√âmilion and Pomerol. For details on their own classification schemes, see their sections below. ===Other classification schemes in France=== Burgundy maintains its own classification scheme based on specific appellations. Although the terminology used is similar, the classification hierarchy is different and also attaches to the vineyards themselves. The most-highly rated vineyards are graded as Grand Cru, while those at the next level are classified as Premier Cru. ==First Growth wines todayBordeaux reds=== Premier Grand Cru * Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild M√©doc (Pauillac) * Ch√¢teau Margaux M√©doc (Margaux) * Ch√¢teau Latour M√©doc (Pauillac) * Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion Graves (Pessac-Leognan) * Ch√¢teau Mouton-Rothschild M√©doc (Pauillac) ===Bordeaux sweet wines=== Premier Cru Sup√©rieur * Ch√¢teau d'Yquem (Sauternes) Premier Cru * Ch√¢teau La Tour Blanche, Bommes (Sauternes) * Ch√¢teau Lafaurie-Peyraguey, Bommes (Sauternes) * Ch√¢teau Clos Haut-Peyraguey, Bommes (Sauternes) * Ch√¢teau de Rayne-Vigneau, Bommes (Sauternes) * Ch√¢teau Suduiraut, Preignac (Sauternes) * Ch√¢teau Coutet, Barsac * Ch√¢teau Climens, Barsac * Ch√¢teau Guiraud, Sauternes * Ch√¢teau Rieussec, Fargues (Sauternes) * Ch√¢teau Rabaud-Promis, Bommes (Sauternes) * Ch√¢teau Sigalas-Rabaud, Bommes (Sauternes) The communes of Bommes, Fargues and Preignac were once separate communes but now fall into the single commune of Sauternes. ==The Graves classification== After the Second World War the omission of wines of Graves from the official classification was having a negative effect on the price and desirability of wines from the region. To improve marketing the region announced in 1953 its own classification of red wines and one white wine, with more white wines added in 1959. Sixteen wines were given special classification. * Ch√¢teau Bouscaut (red & white) * Ch√¢teau Carbonnieux (red & white) * Ch√¢teau Couhins (white) * Ch√¢teau Couhins-Lurton (white) * Domaine de Chevalier (red & white) * Ch√¢teau de Fieuzal (red) * Ch√¢teau Haut-Bailly (red) * Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion (red) * Ch√¢teau La Mission Haut-Brion (red) * Ch√¢teau La Tour Haut-Brion (red) * Ch√¢teau Latour-Martillac (red & white) * Ch√¢teau Laville Haut-Brion (white) * Ch√¢teau Malartic- Lagravi√®re (red & white) * Ch√¢teau Olivier (red & white) * Ch√¢teau Pape Cl√©ment (red) * Ch√¢teau Smith Haut Lafitte (red) ==The Saint-√âmilion classification== Missing from the 1855 list, the Bordeaux region of Saint- √âmilion offered its own classification in 1955 to improve market demand and prices. The Classification of Saint-√âmilion wine differs from the 1855 list in that it is updated approximately every ten years based on new assessments of quality. For each new release of the classification, wines may be promoted or demoted within the list. A wine may even be removed entirely, while other unclassified wines may be added. In 2006, for example, eleven wines were removed from the list, six new wines added, and two existing wines promoted to a higher division. The Saint-√âmilion Classification currently labels 15 wines as First Growths. These Premiers Grands Crus Class√©s, subdivided into two further classes : A (2 wines) and B (13 wines). A further 64 wines are currently classified as Grands Crus Class√©s. ===Premiers Grands Crus Class√©s A=== * Ch√¢teau Ausone * Ch√¢teau Cheval Blanc * Ch√¢teau Ang√©lus * Ch√¢teau Pavie ===Premiers Grands Crus Class√©s B=== * Ch√¢teau Beaus√©jour (Duffau-Lagarrosse) * Ch√¢teau Beau-S√©jour B√©cot * Ch√¢teau B√©lair-Monange * Ch√¢teau Canon * Ch√¢teau Figeac * Clos Fourtet * Ch√¢teau La Gaffeli√®re * Ch√¢teau Magdelaine * Ch√¢teau Pavie-Macquin * Ch√¢teau Troplong Mondot * Ch√¢teau Trottevieille ==Pomerol== Pomerol has refused to create any sort of classification scheme but it has produced red wines that are among the most expensive in the world, such as Petrus. ==See also== * French wine * Bordeaux wine * Wine labels * Second wine ==References== Category:Bordeaux wine Category:Wine classification Category:Wine terminology ","title":"First Growth"},{"id":"831150","text":"Burning Down the Opera, released August 26, 2003, is the first live album by the German power metal band Edguy recorded in Europe during their Mandrake World Tour.

The AGP was formed after the historic Assam Accord of 1985 and formally launched at the Golaghat Convention held from 13‚Äì14 October 1985 in Golaghat, that let Prafulla Kumar Mahanta to be elected as the youngest chief minister of the state. The AGP has formed government twice from 1985 to 1989 and from 1996 to 2001. The party split in 2005, with former Chief Minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta forming the Asom Gana Parishad (Progressive), but regrouped on 14 October 2008 in Golaghat. The party won 14 seats out of 126 in the 2016 Legislative Assembly Elections; a historic win for the party. Further, it shares power with the Bodoland People's Front and Bharatiya Janata Party. Currently it is a part of North-East Regional Political Front consisting of political parties of the northeast which has supported the National Democratic Alliance (India). ==History== AGP was a result of a six-year-long Assam Agitation against illegal infiltration of foreigners from Bangladesh into Assam, led by All Assam Students' Union.Official Website For years, people of Assam have been complaining against infiltration of illegal migrants from neighboring Bangladesh (East Pakistan till 1972), as they feared that it is altering the demographic, social and economic make-up of the state. In 1979, AASU started peaceful democratic movement demanding detection of all illegal migrants in the state, deletion of their names from the country's electoral rolls and deportation of all of them under the laws of the land. This movement continued for years, and the Assembly Election was held in 1983 in this hostile environment, which was protested by the agitating people. AASU then constituted the All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad (AAGSP) which consisted of representatives of various organizations including the Asom Sahitya Sabha, two regional political parties ‚Äì Asom Jatiyabadi Dal and Purbanchaliya Loka Parishad, the Sadau Asom Karmachari Parishad, Asom Jatiyabadi Yuva-Chatra Parishad, Asom Yuvak Samaj, All Assam Central and semi-Central Employees‚Äô Association etc. Several rounds of discussions with successive governments in New Delhi led to the signing of the Assam Accord on 15 August 1985 between the AASU and the government, with prime minister Rajiv Gandhi standing witness to it. The movement, known as Assam Agitation could have come to be remembered as one of the longest peaceful movements in the world after the freedom movement of India. But the Nellie massacre remains as one of the most barbaric incidents of independent India. Following this, the State Assembly was dissolved and the Congress government headed by Hiteswar Saikia, which came to power in February 1983, was dismissed. The Golaghat National Convention, organised in Golaghat on 13‚Äì14 October 1985 decided that a regional political party under the name and style of Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) be constituted and the Asom Gana Parishad was finally launched in Golaghat on 14 October 1985. By that time, the previous central executive committee of the All Assam Students‚Äô Union (AASU) was dissolved at a convention in North Lakhimpur in September, and Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, the president of the AASU during the period of the peaceful democratic movement, was elected the president of the presidium of the new political party. Asom Jatiyabadi Dal and the Purbanchaliya Loka Parishad also merged with AGP. Members from other organisations also joined the party. The AGP contested the State Assembly elections held in December 1985 and swept the polls by winning 67 of the 126 seats apart from capturing seven of the 14 Lok Sabha (Parliament) seats, and formed the Government of Assam. The party again formed the government in Assam after winning the elections in 1996. Party leader Prafulla Kumar Mahanta served as the Chief Minister of Assam for two terms, first from 1985 to 1990 and then again from 1996 to 2001. Asom Gana Parishad was a part of the National Front government from December 1989 to November 1990. Its Member of Parliament Dinesh Goswami was the Union Minister of Law and Justice in the V. P. Singh Ministry. The party was again a part of the United Front governments headed by H. D. Deve Gowda and Inder Kumar Gujral. AGP leaders Birendra Prasad Baishya and Muhi Ram Saikia were the Union Minister of Steel and Mines and the Union Minister of State for Human Resources Development respectively in the United Front governments. The party has been marginalized in the politics of Assam. Once a formidable force, it has been sidelined by the Bodoland People's Front and the AIUDF of Badruddin Ajmal. Currently, the party has only 14 M.L.A in the Legislative Assembly of Assam. ==Internal Splits and Mergers== The AGP in March 1991 underwent a split when party general secretary and former Assam Home Minister Bhrigu Kumar Phukan, former Union Law Minister and MP Dinesh Goswami, former state Education Minister Brindaban Goswami, Assam Legislative Assembly speaker Pulakesh Barua and others formed the Natun Asom Gana Parishad (natun means new in Assamese). This fraction came back to the party fold in 1992. In 2000, former Assam PWD minister and senior party leader Atul Bora (Senior) moved away along with Pulakesh Barua and formed Trinamool Gana Parishad. After the second AGP Government's reign under Prafulla Kumar Mahanta came to an end and Congress regained power, numerous allegations were raised against him related to the corruption during his tenure, government's involvement in secret killings, and Mahanta's overall inactive leadership. These led to his demotion from being President of the party and later he was expelled from the party on 3 July 2005 after being accused of anti-party activities. Mahanta then formed his own party, Asom Gana Parishad (Progressive). In 2008, a process started to reconcile the differences among all the breakaway fractions and to bring back everybody under the mother party umbrella to strengthen the regional party movement in Assam. Finally on 14 October 2008 all breakaway groups reconciled in one umbrella at the historic town Golaghat. Prafulla Mahanta merged his AGP(P) with it. Atul Bora and Pulakesh Barua merged their TGP with the AGP and farmer leader and former legislator of Patacharkuchi, Pabindra Deka too merged the Purbanchaliya Loka Parishad (PLP) with it. ==Splits from AGP== 2011: Firebrand Youth Leader Sarbananda Sonowal resigned from All Executive posts within AGP and joined in Bharatiya Janata Party, due to dissatisfaction with and amongst the senior leadership of the party who were trying to forge an alliance with a party that was against the scrapping of the controversial IMDT Act. \\"The AGP was born out of the illegal foreigners' issue after the six- year-long Assam agitation; 855 people laid down their lives in the agitation. However, the party has failed to honour the sacrifice of the martyrs by deviating from its principles. But I have no grievances against the dedicated grassroot-level workers. Since the AGP has failed to tackle the illegal migrants' problem, I've joined the BJP keeping in mind the interest of the people of Assam and the fact that I'll be able to highlight the problems and issues of the state at the national level,\\" Sonowal, the former AGP general secretary, said. On 8 February 2011, Sonowal joined Bharatiya Janata Party in the presence of the then BJP National President Nitin Gadkari and senior leaders like Varun Gandhi, Vijay Goel, Bijoya Chakravarty and state BJP president Ranjit Dutta. He was immediately appointed a member of the BJP National Executive and then later on State Spokesperson of the state BJP unit, prior to his current assignment to head the state as the new president. Again on 3 July 2013, senior party leader Atul Bora once again left the party and joined BJP. ==2016-present== In May 2016, after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led National Democratic Alliance which includes parties like Asom Gana Parishad and Bodoland People's Front formed its first government in Assam, and formed a new alliance called the North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) with Himanta Biswa Sarma as its convener. The Chief Ministers of the north eastern states of Sikkim, Assam and Nagaland too belong to this alliance. Thus, the Asom Gana Parishad joined the BJP led NEDA. In November 2016, Atul Bora was elected for President of Asom Gana Parishad second time amending party's constitution ‚Äòone man one post‚Äô as he is also minister of Agriculture, Horticulture and Food Processing, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary in Sarbananda Sonowal Ministry.Atul Bora AGP president for second term In January 2019, they broke alliance with Bharatiya Janata Party on the issue of Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019but in March 2019 the party returned to North- East Democratic Alliance for the Lok Sabha election. As per the agreement, AGP will contest on 3 seats, Bodoland People's Front at one and Bharatiya Janata Party on ten seats.BJP, AGP back together after 2-month divorceAGP to fight Lok Sabha polls with BJP in Assam ==List of Chief Ministers== *Prafulla Kumar Mahanta **First term (24 December 1985 ‚Äì 28 November 1990). **Second term (15 May 1996 ‚Äì 17 May 2001). ==See also== *Golaghat Convention *Natun Asom Gana Parishad *Assamese Language Movement. ==References== Category:Political parties in India Category:Political parties established in 1985 Category:1985 establishments in India Category:Political parties in Assam Category:State political parties in Assam Category:Regionalist parties in India ","title":"Asom Gana Parishad"},{"id":"831320","text":"Wartenberg may refer to: == Buildings == * Wartenberg castles, situated on the Wartenberg hill in the municipality of Muttenz near Basel * Wartenberg Castle built in the present day Kaiserslautern and destroyed in 1522; former seat of Counts of Wartenberg * Wartenberg station, an S-Bahn and railway station in the Lichtenberg district of Berlin == Places == * Wartenberg, Hesse in the district Vogelsbergkreis, Hesse, Germany * Wartenberg (Berlin), a locality in the borough of Lichtenberg in Berlin, Germany * Wartenberg, Bavaria in the district Erding, Upper Bavaria, Germany * Wartenberg (Swabian Jura), a mountain in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany * Wartenberg am Rollberg, the German name of Str√°≈æ pod Ralskem, Czech Republic * The medieval County of Wartenberg, a fief of the Holy Roman Empire, mediatised to Kingdom of Westphalia in 1806 and subsequently to Prussia in 1814 *Oty≈Ñ, Poland (German: Deutsch-Wartenberg) *Syc√≥w, Poland (German: Polnisch-Wartenberg until 1888, then Gro√ü-Wartenberg) == People == * Franz Wilhelm von Wartenberg (1593-1661), Count, Catholic clergy, Prince-Bishop of Minden, Osnabr√ºck and Verden as well as Vicar Apostolic of the Archdiocese of Bremen * Robert Wartenberg (1887-1956), neurologist * Counts of Wartenberg, (since 1802 known as Counts of Wartenberg- Roth) an aristocratic family from Rhenish Hesse, Palatine and Upper Swabia * Counts of Wartenberg of the Wittelsbach dynasty, aristocratic title given to the descendants of Ferdinand of Bavaria (1550-1608) * , extinct aristocratic family from Bohemia == Other == * Wartenberg wheel, a medical device for neurological use ","title":"Wartenberg"},{"id":"831346","text":"Ambedkar Samaj Party (Ambedkar Society Party) is a political party in India, that fights for the rights of Dalits.

It allows host or subnetwork IP addresses, names and/or ident query replies, to be used as tokens on which to filter for access control purposes. The original code was written by Wietse Venema in 1990 to monitor a cracker's activities on the Unix workstations at the Department of Math and Computer Science at the Eindhoven University of Technology.TCP WRAPPER - Network monitoring, access control, and booby traps. by Wietse Venema (USENIX UNIX Security Symposium III, 1992) He maintained it until 1995, and on June 1, 2001, released it under its own BSD- style license. The tarball includes a library named libwrap that implements the actual functionality. Initially, only services that were spawned for each connection from a super-server (such as inetd) got wrapped, utilizing the tcpd program. However most common network service daemons today can be linked against libwrap directly. This is used by daemons that operate without being spawned from a super-server, or when a single process handles multiple connections. Otherwise, only the first connection attempt would get checked against its ACLs. When compared to host access control directives often found in daemons' configuration files, TCP Wrappers have the benefit of runtime ACL reconfiguration (i.e., services don't have to be reloaded or restarted) and a generic approach to network administration. This makes it easy to use for anti-worm scripts, such as DenyHosts or Fail2ban, to add and expire client- blocking rules, when excessive connections and/or many failed login attempts are encountered.

Betrayal at Krondor takes place largely in Midkemia, the fantasy world developed by Raymond E. Feist in his Riftwar novels. The game is designed to resemble a book, separated into chapters and narrated in the third-person with a quick- save bookmark feature. Although neither the dialog nor narrative were written by Feist himself, the game is considered canon, having been novelized as Krondor: The Betrayal five years later. Events in the game were also written into the Riftwar novels. PyroTechnix completed a sequel, Return to Krondor, which was released by Sierra in 1998. Its protracted development experienced considerable delay, and the finished product was not nearly as warmly received as Betrayal. GOG.com released an emulated version of Betrayal at Krondor for Microsoft Windows in 2010. ==Gameplay== The main interface of Betrayal at Krondor. The party is travelling east along a road. Gameplay occurs mainly from a first-person perspective while traveling the overworld, dungeons, and caves, but switches to a third-person view during combat. The user interface is mouse-driven, with keyboard hotkeys for each action. The game has two possible views, the 3D first-person view and the 2D top-down map view, where the player is represented with a triangular marker. The overworld is completely mapped, but other locations are automatically mapped in the top- down view as the player explores them. The player can also view the full map of Midkemia and see their location. Each chapter's main plot usually takes place completely within one or two regions of the game world. However, the player is given enormous freedom to explore the world however they wish, with ample opportunity to perform optional sub-quests and enhance their characters' abilities, gain cash, upgrade weapons and armor, and so on. Only certain locations are accessible in each chapter, though the player is free to explore anywhere within those boundaries as well as take their time performing quests. While traveling, the party camps in the wilderness to rest and recover lost health and stamina, provided that there are no enemies in the vicinity. ===Moredhel wordlock chests=== One of the game's unique features is the large assortment of Moredhel wordlock chests, hidden throughout the land. These chests have combination locks with letters on each dial, and a riddle written upon them whose answer opens the chest. Wordlock chests can hold valuable items and equipment, as well as quest items essential to completing the game. If no member of the player's party can read Moredhel, the writing on the chest will appear untranslated, although it can still be opened by a brute force method of systematically cycling through each tumbler. The Moredhel alphabet is a character substitution of the A-Z alphabet. Gorath, a Moredhel, can read it, and casting the Union spell allows Patrus to do so for short periods of time. Wordlock chests containing essential quest items are relatively easy to find, either located near roads or their locations being disclosed through interaction with NPCs. However, \\"bonus\\" wordlock chests are typically hidden in areas where the player is not likely to travel unless they are assiduously searching for treasure. ===Plot and dialogue=== The storyline is advanced primarily through literary cutscenes. Each chapter begins and ends with a cutscene, consisting of text, dialogue, and animations. The player meets various NPCs during their travels. Dialogue is text-based and some NPCs have their own pictures as well. Conversation is tree-based: in some cases, the player can choose between various dialogue keywords. This is used to get information, training, and items, sometimes for a price. ===RPG system and player character development=== Character sheet. Two skills - melee and crossbow accuracy - are emphasized, as indicated by the red pommels of the swords. There are two or three characters in the adventuring party at any time. While the player meets various non-human characters during the game (including dwarves, elves, goblins, and dragons), five of the six player characters are human. The exception being Gorath, a dark elf. There are two classes of characters: fighters (Locklear, James, and Gorath) and magicians (Pug, Owyn, and Patrus). Fighters use swords and crossbows, while magicians use a staff. The only long-range attacks magicians are capable of are magic spells. The character system is unique. The main character attributes are health, stamina, speed, and strength. Speed determines how many combat grid squares the character can move. Strength influences the amount of damage the character inflicts in m√™l√©e combat. Spell-casting, swinging one's weapon, and combat damage first use up stamina. Once stamina is depleted, you begin to eat into health. Once it decreases, the character's skills (such as the crucial trait of weapon accuracy), as well as their movement speed, are adversely impacted. In addition to attributes, each character has a set of skills expressed as percentages. Skills can be emphasized, causing them to improve faster, while de-emphasized skills improve slower. Unlike many other role- playing games, skills are improved by using them rather than through a leveling up system. For example, fixing weapons will improve the weaponcraft skill, which in turn will make the character more effective at fixing weapons in the future. Skills include defense, crossbow accuracy, m√™l√©e weapon accuracy, spell-casting accuracy, enemy assessment, weapon and armor repair, barding, haggling, lockpicking, scouting for ambushes, and stealth. Some NPCs offer training in skills and items can increase skills permanently or temporarily. Characters can acquire various status effects that affect their health or skills. Characters whose health drops to zero in combat are knocked out and acquire \\"near death\\" status, making them ineffective in combat, and their health recovery rate drops virtually to nil. If the health of the entire party drops to zero, the game will end. Improved healing rate is handled as a status effect as well, as are poisoning, drunkenness, sickness (from eating spoiled rations), and plague, which is an extremely serious condition that can reduce the party to moribund husks incapable of any productive action. ===Magic=== Spells are organized into six groups, grouped by magic symbol. Four groups of spells are combat spells and two groups are non-combat spells. Spells first drain the caster's stamina and then health. Some spells have variable strength; the player can choose how much energy the spell consumes. Some combat spells also require that the target being within line of sight of the caster. Spells are learned from scrolls that are found in caches or on enemies and can be bought from shops or NPCs throughout the world. ===Items and inventory=== Inventory screen. The game features a wide variety of items, including equipment, food, treasure, and magical artifacts. Each item also has detailed background information available by right-clicking it. The inventory management allows transferring items between the party characters. In the case of stacks of multiple items, there's also an option to distribute them evenly within the party. The game also manages money and keys independently. Each weapon and type of armor has modifiers affecting its combat effectiveness, such as accuracy, damage, blessing, and racial modifiers. After combat, most weapons and armor must be kept in shape with a whetstone or armorer's hammer respectively. There are also items that enhance weapons and armor, such as the poisonous silverthorn or fiery naphtha. Player characters must carry and eat rations every day or their health starts dropping. Rations are sold in taverns and can be found on enemies and in caches. Rations can also be poisoned or spoiled and will sicken characters if they eat it, adversely affecting their health, although careful inspection of all packages of questionable provenance will avoid this possibility. ===Combat=== A battle scene. Gorath, marked with a green square on the grid, is having his turn; hovering mouse over the target marks it with a yellow square, and shows attack damage estimate on the bottom of the screen. Combat is turn-based and takes place on a grid, similar to tactical role-playing games. The characters can move to a different location on the grid and if they can reach an enemy, can attack in the same move. There are two options for attacking: a thrust and a swing. The thrust is the default attack used when moving to attack an enemy. The swing often does more damage but is less accurate and uses up one point of health/stamina. Fighters can use crossbows and magicians can cast spells, but only if there are no enemy units in adjacent squares. The player can also rest, which regains health and stamina, defend against enemy m√™l√©e attacks, or assess an enemy's capabilities. Injured enemies may try to flee from combat, and will escape entirely and permanently from the player's grasp, unless they are killed or otherwise prevented them from reaching the upper edge of the battlefield. Defeated enemies remain on the ground after a battle, allowing the player to loot their remains. Salvaged items of little use to the party may be sold at shops in order to boost cash reserves. The combat interface is also used to solve magical traps. Traps involve various types of hazards, such as fireball blasters and laser crystals, and the player either has to disable them using the objects provided or otherwise navigate through the trap and reach the top of the combat field. Although the game uses a GUI, many actions can be performed using keys as well. There is a glitch (or intended hidden feature) that allows the player to make certain combinations of two moves in a single turn‚Äîone using the mouse and another using the keyboard‚Äîor rest twice by pressing 'R' before the turn begins and holding it through the turn. Computer opponents also seem to use this in some instances (like moving and defending in the same turn). Another type of character-environment interaction, that could be considered a trap or a bonus, are the graveyards scattered around the landscape. The player is able to read the inscriptions on the gravestones (usually in the form of a short poetic eulogy), and then decide to dig up the grave (if someone has a shovel). Some graves reveal items and/or money, while others summon a ghost (in some cases, multiple ghosts), which must be fought using the standard combat interface. ===Temples, stores and inns=== Temples offer a variety of services including healing and blessing equipment. They also sell a relatively expensive teleportation service; the player is able to teleport between any temples they have already visited, with the price based on the distance traveled. This operates on the principle that a person visiting a new temple will memorize a unique pattern upon the wall, and by recalling this pattern at a different temple, be transported to the first temple with the aid of a priest. Stores buy and sell various kinds of items; some also repair equipment. Inns and taverns allow characters to buy food and alcohol, gain information on local happenings, gamble (in some inns), talk to some NPCs, earn money by playing the lute, and sleep, which allows full healing of wounds and fatigue, whereas resting in the wilderness only restores 80% of health and stamina. ==CharactersMain characters=== ; Seigneur Locklear : (Chapters 1, 5, 7) Locklear is the youngest son of the Baron of Land's End, a Seigneur in Prince Arutha's court, and a skilled swordsman decorated for his service at Armengar and Sethanon during the Great Uprising (A Darkness at Sethanon). Locklear recently entered the service of a Kingdom garrison in Yabon to investigate reports of moredhel activity, where he rescued Gorath of the Ardanien from an assassin. ; Squire Owyn Beleforte : (Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9) Owyn is a nineteen-year-old magician and the youngest son of the Count of Tiburn. Uninterested in politics, Owyn instead idolizes the magician Pug. A resourceful and crafty boy, Owyn used part of his father's wealth to travel and study magic in secret. His father eventually discovered what he was doing and, due to the political embarrassment Owyn causes him, has given him a great deal of freedom, hoping that he will eventually settle down and become suitable for a political marriage. Owyn was traveling home from visiting his aunt in Yabon when he met Locklear and Gorath. Not eager to return to the boredom of life at home, Owyn hitches his fate to theirs. ; Gorath of the Ardanien : (Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9) A hero of the Riftwar, Gorath was chieftain of Clan Ardanien and Delekhan's chief rival to the throne of Sar-Sargoth. Gorath believes Delekhan's plan to invade the Kingdom to be madness and betrays the moredhel to warn Prince Arutha, as it the only way to save his people from another disastrous war. There is also another reason for his exile: he has broken from the Dark Path and is \\"Returning\\" to the eledhel in Elvandar, assuming he is not killed by his brethren first. ; Seigneur James : (Chapters 2, 3, 5, 7) Once known as Jimmy the Hand, James is a legend among the Mockers and the son of the Upright Man, though he is unaware of his parentage. After foiling a Nighthawk attempt to assassinate Prince Arutha (Silverthorn), James was forced to give up his life as a thief and became a squire in Arutha's court, where he became best friends with Locklear. James eventually rose to the rank of Seigneur, becoming one of Arutha's most trusted and loyal servants but still wanders the Thieves' Highway, often on business for the Crown. ; Patrus : (Chapters 5, 7) Patrus is the court magician and magical adviser to Baron Gabot in Northwarden and one of Owyn's early magical tutors. Despite his old age, he is a spry and capable magician, whose knowledge of the Union spell allows him to temporarily read moredhel. ; Duke Pug conDoin : (Chapters 8, 9) As an orphan growing up in Crydee, Pug was apprenticed to Kulgan the magician but showed little magical ability until he was captured by the Tsurani during the Riftwar (Magician: Apprentice). Seeing potential in the boy, Tsurani Great Ones trained him in the magic of the Greater Path, previously nonexistent in Midkemia. When he returned, Pug helped the sorcerer Macros the Black end the Riftwar and was adopted into the royal family and given land to start his academy of magic at Stardock (Magician: Master). Pug is considered the most powerful magician in Midkemia, having inherited much of Macros' power in addition to his Tsurani training. He is married to Katala, whom he met in Kelewan, and has two children: a biological son William and an adopted daughter Gamina, who has telepathic powers. ===Allies=== ; Prince Arutha conDoin : Prince Arutha of Krondor is ruler of the Western Realm, younger brother of King Lyam, and half- brother of Duke Martin of Crydee. Arutha proved himself one of the Kingdom's best field commanders defending Crydee during the Riftwar and became prince after the unexpected deaths of King Rodric, Prince Erland, and his father Duke Borric. He is a well-loved and capable ruler, albeit a reluctant one. ; Cullich : Gorath's estranged wife Cullich is a moredhel witch who helped him escape from the Northlands. Cullich thinks Gorath's willingness to surrender his position as clan leader is a sign of weakness but she doesn't trust Delekhan and will help Gorath if she can. ; Baron Gabot : Baron Gabot is commander of Northwarden, which guards one of the four passes between the Kingdom and the Northlands. Previously Huntmaster of Carse, Gabot was old acquaintances with Duke Martin, who recommended him to the position after Baron Rossol died. Like Martin's father Duke Borric, Gabot saw the benefit of having a magician in his service and appointed Patrus his magical adviser. ; Liallan : As a powerful moredhel clan leader and Delekhan's consort, Liallan openly supports him though she believes his plan is doomed to fail. She has her eye on the throne of Sar-Sargoth for herself and secretly aids many of Delekhan's enemies, including engineering Gorath's escape from the Northlands. Should Delekhan and his son Moraeulf die during their invasion, it would leave her in a prime position to take over the leadership of the moredhel. ; Duke Martin conDoin : Once known as Martin Longbow, Duke Martin of Crydee is the elder half-brother of King Lyam and Prince Arutha. The illegitimate son of Duke Borric, he was raised and trained by the elves in Elvandar before becoming Huntmaster and later Duke upon the death of his father. One of the best archers in Midkemia, Martin dislikes court life and often roams the forests with his longbow in hand. ; The Oracle of Aal : The Aal are among the oldest races in the universe and one of the few to survive the Chaos Wars between the Valheru and the gods. The Oracle, the last of its dying race, agreed to help Pug and Tomas during the Great Rising in exchange for salvation. After the battle of Sethanon, Pug brought the Oracle to Sethanon and placed it in the body of the dragon Ryath, whose mind was drained by a Dreadlord (A Darkness at Sethanon). The Oracle of Aal now watches over the Lifestone and will send warning to Pug and a secret garrison near Sethanon if it is disturbed. ; Squire Phillip : Though he appears to be a young noble about Owyn's age, Phillip is actually thirty-seven, a captain in the Kingdom Army, and a courier for the secret garrison near Sethanon. Owyn met him at a party in Yabon prior to the start of the game and meets him again throughout his travels. ; Tomas : Prince Consort to Queen Aglaranna and Warleader of Elvandar, Tomas grew up in Crydee with his best friend Pug. During the Riftwar, Tomas discovered the dying dragon Rhuagh, who gave him an ancient suit of armor (Magician: Apprentice). The armor transformed Tomas into a blend of human and Valheru and gave him the memories and abilities of Ashen-Shugar, the Valheru to whom it once belonged. After marrying Aglaranna, Tomas considers Elvandar under his protection and only leaves in the most extreme of circumstances. ===Villains=== ; Delekhan : Delekhan is the leader of the Moredhel Nations of the North. One of the Murmandamus' field generals during the Great Rising (A Darkness at Sethanon), Delekhan believes Murmandamus still lives, imprisoned by Prince Arutha at Sethanon. He has unified his people with the help of magicians known only as \\"the Six\\" (later revealed to be Tsurani Great Ones) in order to invade the Kingdom of the Isles, free Murmandamus, and finish what was started a decade before. ; Makala : Makala is a Great One, a magician from the Tsurani homeworld of Kelewan, who is visiting Prince Arutha's court ostensibly as a representative of the Emperor of Tsuranuanni. Believing that Pug hid a weapon of tremendous power which could be used against the Tsurani, Makala set out to investigate what really happened at the battle of Sethanon. He manipulates Delekhan and the moredhel, using their attack as a diversion so that he can enter Sethanon unhindered. ; Narab and Nago : The brothers Narab and Nago are magicians who serve Delekhan. Nago has infiltrated the Kingdom and coordinates moredhel spies from a secret location near Sarth. Narab has fallen out of favor with Delekhan, and seeking to regain his position in Delekhan's inner circle, captures Owyn and Gorath for him. However, Delekhan is displeased with what he has done so Narab turns on his former master and helps Owyn and Gorath escape. He then plans on becoming leader of the moredhel himself. ; Navon du Sandau : To most he is simply a charismatic young merchant, but Navon is actually Neville Corvalis, the half- brother of Owyn's cousin Ugyne. When Ugyne's father Count Corvalis found out that Neville was his wife's illegitimate son, he arranged to have Neville killed in a wine cellar collapse. Though he was believed dead, Neville's body was never found. He was found by Nighthawks who had regrouped in Cavall after their destruction in Krondor by Prince Arutha (A Darkness at Sethanon). Using a Corvalis family heirloom, a magical spyglass, Neville convinced them he had magical powers and became their leader. He then set about exacting revenge on Count Corvalis, burning down the keep so the caverns underneath could be used as a Nighthawk hideout and courting Ugyne so he could take over her family's fortune. ==LocationsMidkemia=== ; Cavall Keep : (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) Cavall Keep is a small eastern farming town in the Kenting Hills ruled by Owyn's uncle, Count Geoffrey Corvalis.

Although ruled by Duke Romney, control of the city lies with its various merchant guilds, leading to the occasional guild war. ; Sarth : (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) The town of Sarth is home to an ancient mountaintop fortress which was converted into an abbey and library by the Order of Ishap. The vaults have hundreds of thousands of books, containing a wealth of knowledge about the history and lore of Midkemia, tended to by Brother Anthony and Brother Marc. Beneath the vaults is an abandoned dwarven emerald mine known as the Mac Bourgalan Dok. ; Sar-Isbandia (Armengar) : (Accessible in Chapter 4) The fortress city of Sar- Isbandia was built atop miles of naphtha tunnels long ago by the glamredhel (the mad elves) before they were obliterated by the moredhel (the dark elves). Located in the Vale of Isbandia north of the Inclindel Gap, humans from Yabon settled in the city hundreds of years ago, renamed it Armengar and became lifelong enemies of the moredhel. The Armengarians were among Murmandamus' first targets during the Great Rising so Prince Arutha and Guy du Bas-Tyra, the city's Protector, evacuated the city and attempted to destroy Murmandamus' army by incinerating the city (A Darkness at Sethanon). Recently, moredhel have moved into the ruins and started to rebuild. ; Sar-Sargoth : (Accessible in Chapter 4) Twin city of Sar-Isbandia, the fortress city of Sar-Sargoth to the north was also built by the glamredhel and was taken by the moredhel as their capital.

During the Chaos Wars, the gods of Timirianya crystallized magic into solid manna, causing the Valheru to leave when they thought the world's energy was depleted. In order to cast magic on Timirianya, one must use a crystal staff and keep it charged with raw manna. ; The Temple of Karzeen Mauk : Located in the north, all that remains of the high temple of the gods of Timirianya are nine pillars, within which the surviving gods have taken refuge. Only Dhatsavan, Lord of Gates, still has enough power left to communicate with visitors. ; The Temple of Dhatsavan (Riftworld Mine) : Also known as the Riftworld Mine, the ruins of the temple are buried underground and are currently occupied by Panath-Tiandn. After Makala abducts her, Gamina is imprisoned in a crystal cage within the ruins. ==Plot== Ten years after A Darkness at Sethanon, Seigneur Locklear is serving at a northern Kingdom garrison when he saves Gorath of the Ardanien from an assassin. Gorath has brought a warning of an invasion planned by Delekhan, leader of the moredhel, so Locklear agrees to take him to see Prince Arutha in Krondor. Injured from numerous attacks, they ask for help from Owyn Beleforte, a young magician from Tiburn. The game begins in their camp north of LaMut. ===Chapter I: Into A Dark Night=== Owyn is bandaging Gorath's and Locklear's injuries when they are attacked by a moredhel assassin whom Gorath dispatches before the three of them set out south. Surviving multiple assassination attempts, they eventually reach Krondor. Finding the palace gates sabotaged, they enter the palace via the sewers with Seigneur James' help. Upon meeting Prince Arutha, another moredhel assassin sneaks in and attempts to kill Gorath, only to be foiled by Pug. ===Chapter II: Shadow Of The Nighthawks=== Gorath informs Arutha of Delekhan's plans, but Arutha does not trust him because he does not know the location of the attack. Gorath thinks they can find out by intercepting Delekhan's Nighthawk spies in Romney. Arutha arranges for James to escort Gorath to Romney and meet with a group of the king's soldiers investigating recent Nighthawk activity in the east. Arutha will muster his army and await word of where the attack will occur. James, Owyn, and Gorath secretly slip out of the city through the sewers and head east. Arriving at the tavern in Romney, they discover that the king's soldiers have all been murdered. ===Chapter III: The Spyglass And The Spider=== Two clues were left behind at the murder scene: an enchanted spyglass and a silver spider. James, Owyn, and Gorath follow the trail of the spyglass and the spider north to Cavall Keep and uncover the leader of the Nighthawks, the merchant Navon du Sandau. After killing him, they enter the Nighthawks' hideout in the caverns beneath Cavall Keep, where they learn that Delekhan plans to attack Northwarden. Realizing that Nighthawks probably infiltrated the fortress, they split up. James heads to Northwarden while Owyn and Gorath head south to warn Arutha. Before they can reach Arutha though, Owyn and Gorath are captured by Narab, one of Delekhan's chieftains. ===Chapter IV: Marked For Death=== Gorath and Owyn are taken to Sar-Sargoth, where Narab presents them to Delekhan. Delekhan, enraged that Narab has ruined his plans, tells him his life is forfeit. Narab turns on Delekhan and, unbeknownst to them, frees Owyn and Gorath. They escape Sar-Sargoth and head south to the Inclindel Gap, where they meet a Kingdom patrol and are taken to Arutha's camp. Learning of the impending attack on Northwarden, Arutha readies his army and sends Owyn and Gorath to Krondor to seek Pug's help in case the moredhel employ magic. ===Chapter V: When Rivers Run Blood=== James and Locklear arrive at Northwarden and are sent by Baron Gabot to find his magical adviser Patrus. The three of them help Duke Martin prepare for the attack by poisoning moredhel food supplies, finding the minstrel Tamney, stealing the moredhel battle plans, and killing six moredhel magicians hiding behind Kingdom lines. Returning to Northwarden as the moredhel siege begins, they discover that Nighthawks have murdered Baron Gabot, leaving James in command. The battle goes badly and they are about to be overrun when Arutha arrives with his army in time to drive off the moredhel. ===Chapter VI: Betrayal=== Makala visits Pug in Krondor, telling him that Gamina is considered an abomination by the Assembly of Magicians and that he has imprisoned her until her fate can be decided. Pug is enraged at Makala's betrayal and vows to find her, blasting the words \\"The Book Of Macros\\" into the wall. When Katala is unable to find him or their daughter, she discovers his message and informs Owyn and Gorath. Following clues from the libraries at Sarth and the Abbaye Ishap, Owyn and Gorath head west to Elvandar, where Gorath completes his \\"Returning\\" and pledges his allegiance to Queen Aglaranna and Prince Consort Tomas. Tomas shows them the Book of Macros, a gift from Pug to find him should he leave the message to do so. Recently injured by a poisoned blade in a moredhel skirmish, Tomas asks Owyn and Gorath to go in his stead. Owyn and Gorath read the book, which teleports them into the unknown. ===Chapter VII: The Long Ride=== In Northwarden, the moredhel raiding leader is captured and reveals that they plan to use a rift machine in the Dimwood to bypass Arutha's army, enter Sethanon, and free Murmandamus, whom they believe is alive and imprisoned there. Realizing that the attack was a diversion engineered by Makala, Arutha orders his troops to Sethanon and instructs James, Locklear, and Patrus to find and destroy the rift machine. After learning that the machine can be disrupted by a Tsurani device called a Waani, they find the machine and disable it. However, as the rift collapses, it pulls in everything nearby before exploding. James and Locklear grab onto trees but Patrus is sucked into the collapsing rift and is apparently killed. At the same moment, three figures appear in a flash of purple light. ===Chapter VIII: Of Lands Afar=== Owyn and Gorath are teleported to Timirianya, where Owyn realizes that magic does not work and Pug would be powerless. Owyn and Gorath eventually find Pug, who has figured out that by abducting Gamina and manipulating Delekhan, Makala has lured Pug away from Midkemia and Arutha's army away from Sethanon and is free to enter Sethanon unopposed and seek out the Lifestone. Using the Cup of Rlnn Skrr, Owyn restores Pug's powers and they find Gamina imprisoned in a crystal cage in the underground ruins of the Temple of Dhatsavan. Gorath smashes the cage and, using a special pattern stone Pug has brought, the four of them return to Midkemia. ===Chapter IX: Mad Gods Rage=== In a flash of purple light, Pug, Owyn, and Gorath appear before James and Locklear in the Dimwood and tell them to wait for Arutha and let him know that there is no magical threat to his army; Makala will be waiting for Pug at Sethanon. Pug, Owyn, and Gorath travel to the caverns beneath Sethanon and kill the Tsurani Great Ones (\\"the Six\\") protecting the Lifestone Chamber. Gorath remains behind to protect the Oracle of Aal, which was incapacitated by Makala, while Pug and Owyn confront the magician. Makala believes that Pug was keeping the Lifestone hidden to use as a weapon and wants it destroyed, but Pug refuses because it would release the Valheru souls trapped inside. Engaging Makala in a magical battle, Pug and Owyn eventually kill him. Afterward, Gorath enters the chamber locked in combat with Delekhan. When Delekhan reaches for the Lifestone, Gorath tries to stop him and they begin to transform as the Valheru within try to escape. Pug and Owyn are forced to kill them both with a blast of magic in order to prevent the Valheru from being released. Returning above ground, Pug creates magical illusions of Murmandamus and Delekhan which are then incinerated by the Oracle of Aal. Having seen their leaders killed, the moredhel retreat, during which Narab kills Delekhan's son Moraeulf, fulfilling his plans for taking over the moredhel. Owyn is left alone with Pug, who reveals that since Owyn now knows about the Lifestone, Pug must ensure that the secret is safe and suggests that Owyn become one of his students at Stardock. Owyn laughs and replies that he's never wanted anything else. ==Development== Although the game was licensed from Raymond E. Feist, a long- held myth was that the text and the story of the game were actually created by Feist himself. Feist states in his afterword to Krondor: The Betrayal that he was busy writing The King's Buccaneer during the game's production and that the plot, text, and new characters were created solely by designers Neal Hallford and John Cutter. Feist did have editorial final say on the game, but most of what Hallford and Cutter created was left intact. ===Technical details=== The game runs in 256-color 320x200 VGA mode. The graphics engine uses textured 3D graphics to draw the terrain and uses sprites for most of the detailed objects. The engine does not support multilevel terrain as such, but obstacles such as hills and mountains are supported. Most shops, inns, temples, special locations, and large cities are navigated through pictures usable through hotspots, while smaller towns have 3D buildings. NPC and character art is based on photographs. Environments are a mix of captured images and hand-drawn. In combat and puzzle screens, all characters are animated, except for movement - characters do not appear to move their legs while walking. The game models illuminate to a certain extent: in the overworld, day and night are modeled, and in underground locations, the player needs to use a torch or a light spell to illuminate their surroundings. The game runs in protected mode, using Borland C++'s Ergo DPMI / RTM DOS extender.String in krondor.exe: \\"Borland C++ - Copyright 1991 Borland Intl.\\" It remained quite compatible with Microsoft Windows up to the 9x series and works very well in DOSBox and VDMSound. A playable version for Mac OS X DOSBox is also available. xBaK is a game engine recreation which allows Betrayal at Krondor to be played natively under the X Window System, using the original data files.xBaK ===Release history=== The following commercial editions of the game have been released: * 1993: The original 3¬Ω\\" floppy disk release. * 1994: CD-ROM edition, which includes Red Book CD-audio versions of the original game's MIDI music tracks, a 5-minute video interview with Raymond E. Feist, and a Windows hint program/package. * 1996: Re-release of the CD-ROM in Sierra's SierraOriginals budget line.The files on CD-ROM have 1996 timestamps and inner-ring CD-ROM barcode area has July 1996 date. Copyright date of the package is 1993, the original release year. * 1997: free download on Sierra's website to promote the game Betrayal in Antara, though this version is no longer available. * 1998: CD-ROM edition (but without the CD-audio soundtrack) that came with the hardcover edition of Krondor: the Betrayal, with a PDF manual and video interview with Feist, promotional materials and a trailer for Return to Krondor. * 2010: CD-ROM edition re-released on GOG.com as a downloadable file.http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/betrayal_at_krondor/ Contrary to popular belief, Vivendi Universal Games has stated that the game is not free to be redistributed by others. ===Krondor: The Betrayal=== Feist later wrote Krondor: The Betrayal, a novelization of the game and the first in a series of new Midkemia books called The Riftwar Legacy. Feist credited Hallford and Cutter as co-authors of the original story for Krondor: the Betrayal, and dedicated the book to both of them. The game and book are set approximately halfway between A Darkness at Sethanon and Prince of the Blood. There are minor differences, such as Owyn's last name being Belefote rather than Beleforte and the towns of Tanneurs and Eggley are changed to Tannerus and Eggly, but the novel largely covers the main plot of the game accurately and ignores most of the sidequests. The game first introduced Lysle Rigger, Jimmy the Hand's long lost twin brother as well as Kat and Abbot Graves, whose granddaughter was Katherine \\"Kitty\\" Graves. Both Lysle Rigger and Kitty Graves would play significant roles in Feist's Serpentwar novels. ==Reception== Sales of the original 3¬Ω\\" floppy disk release were slow, leading Sierra to sell the Riftwar rights back to Raymond Feist, but the game became a hit when it was re-released on CD-ROM. Pelit gave Betrayal at Krondor a 94% score, calling the game citing \\"the wonderful game system, lack of bugs, and the book-like atmosphere\\" and said \\"Krondor is as big a revolution in turn-based role- playing games as the Underworlds were in 3D role-playing games.\\" Computer Gaming World in October 1993 called Krondor \\"a fantasy role-playing game unlike any other ... a new high-watermark in RPG design\\". While noting that the graphics \\"are not going to knock players out of their chairs\\", the magazine praised combat as \\"the best I've seen in a fantasy CRPG\\". It concluded that the game was \\"a rare gem ... and has set new standards for others to follow. For once, a game actually lives up to, even exceeds, its advance billing\\". A less enthusiastic review by Sandy Petersen appeared in November 1993 in Dragon magazine #199 in the \\"Eye of the Monitor\\" column, in which he gave the game two stars out of five. Though Petersen praised the graphics for being \\"well-rendered\\" at times and for its \\"rather entertaining plot\\", he chastised the gameplay for being slow and for subjecting the player to \\"dull maintenance activities\\", such as armor polishing, as well as quests that he found frustratingly hard to understand how to complete. Quandary gave it a 4.5/5 in its 1996 review, calling it \\"no ordinary role-playing game\\" with its \\"complex\\" immersive environment, traps, and riddles replacing \\"the usual pits and levers and rolling rocks that are more common in role-playing dungeons.\\" They also called the strategic turn-based combat \\"very satisfying\\" though \\"it takes a little getting used to.\\" Betrayal at Krondor was named 1993's best role-playing game and overall \\"Game of the Year\\" by Computer Games Strategy Plus. In June 1994 Betrayal at Krondor won Computer Gaming Worlds Role-Playing Game of the Year award. The editors wrote that it \\"is the quintessential example of how a computer game should be built from a fantasy novel\\", stating that they thought it took the most creative risks while readers liked \\"its play value and non-linear story\\". The magazine ranked Krondor #43 on their list of the 150 best games of all time in the magazine's November 1996 Anniversary Edition. The magazine added the game to its Hall of Fame in 2001, saying that Krondor was the \\"first role-playing game to offer a 3D environment and...one of the first games to use digitized images effectively in the context of a role-playing game.\\" In 1994, PC Gamer US named Betrayal at Krondor as the 31st best computer game ever. The editors hailed it as \\"a pivotal title in the evolution of role-playing games\\", praising its \\"interactive plot and characters that stir the emotions of the player.\\" The magazine later included it on its 1997 \\"The Best 50 Games of All-Time\\" list. In 1998, PC Gamer US declared it the 44th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it \\"a classic that will last through the ages.\\" ==See also== *Betrayal in Antara, a spiritual successor developed by Sierra ==ReferencesBetrayal at Krondor at Mike's RPG Center * XBAK project, native play under X Window using original files Category:1993 video games Category:DOS games Category:Windows games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Raymond E.

Mary Ann had inherited money from her mother in her own right and was known to be a great benefactor. An account of her generosity was contained in a book about Leicestershire. It stated: : \\"Many were the gifts made to the church by this benevolent lady ; to give an account of them is impossible. The best known examples of her munificence are the almshouses at Woodhouse, built in 1856 ; a house for the schoolmaster and mistress at Woodhouse Eaves, built in i860 ; the infant school in the same parish, built six years later ; and the dispensary at Loughborough, built in 1862, at a cost of 5000 pounds ; the expense of the last two benefactions being shared by her brother, William Perry Herrick, Esq., of Beaumanor.\\"\\"An inventory of the church plate of Leicestershire, with some account of the donors‚Äù, 1890, p. 73.

Sophia managed the Beaumanor estate for the next 40 years and was well regarded by the tenants. She kept a fairly large number of household staff one of whom was Elizabeth Ellerbeck (1843 ‚Äì 1919) the housekeeper who remained with her for over 30 years.

William Montagu Curzon Herrick is seated in the centre House party at Beaumanor in 1926 William and Kathleen held frequent house parties at Beaumanor and one of them hosted in 1926 is shown in the photograph. Until just preceding the Second World War in 1939, the Herrick family owned the park. The estate consisted of Beaumanor Hall and 6,500 acres of land, including several farms, Beacon Hill, the Hangingstone Rocks, St Mary's in the Elms church, the vicarage house (Garats Hay), workers houses/cottages along Forest Road and 350 acres (1.4 km¬≤) of parkland. In 1939 the War Office requisitioned the estate, including Garats Hay, and the vicar moved to a cottage in the village. The park became a secret listening station where encrypted enemy signals (Morse code) were intercepted and sent to the famous Station X at Bletchley Park (by motorcycle every day) for decoding. Beaumanor Park was to be the home of the War Office ‚ÄòY‚Äô Group for the duration of the war. After the war (1945) the estate passed back to the Herrick family, and on the death of William Montague Curzon-Herrick, the Beaumanor estate passed to Lt. Col. Assheton Penn Curzon Howe Herrick, who in 1946, for financial reasons (death duties, etc.), decided to dispose of his assets. In a sale conducted at the Town Hall in Loughborough on 20‚Äì21 December 1946, the War Office bought both Beaumanor Hall and Garats Hay and some of the immediate surrounding grounds used during the war. === Beaumanor Hall history 1939‚Äì1970 === From 1939 the hall itself was occupied by Number 6 Intelligence school, and the rooms inside Beaumanor Hall were used as a training centre for the Civilian Staff of the Post Office, Civil Service and Merchant Navy. The Royal Corps of Signals, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force were also having military staff trained inside the hall. The huge cellars stretching underneath the whole of the building were used as electricians' workshops. The outbuildings and stables at the side and rear of the hall were used as workshops. These housed aerial riggers, a barracks store, M T Office, transport garage workshop and the instrument mechanics' laboratory. By late 1941, most of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force military personnel had left for duties at other Y-stations, and the main part of the site became the home of the Royal Signals. Military personnel were still being trained inside the hall for various tasks until the end of the war. In February 1942 the first of the newly trained ladies of the Auxiliary Territorial Service arrived at Beaumanor and were billeted in outlying villages and Garats Hay hall. Beaumanor became one of the most important of the small number of strategic intercept stations, or \\"Y stations\\", intercepting enemy radio transmissions and relaying the information to \\"Station X\\", at Bletchley Park, for decryption and analysis.Nicholls, J., (2000) England Needs You: The Story of Beaumanor Y Station World War II Cheam, published by Joan Nicholls It is known that one of the first confirmations of the successful Operation Chastise mission was received here. It is also widely rumoured that this listening post knew details of the Katyn massacre as early as 1941; however, the British government files were not released to the public, as it would implicate surviving perpetrators. By 1943, Room 61 on the top floor of the hall was being used for Radio fingerprinting (Ackbar 13). This new technology was employed to uniquely identify the particular wireless set that was being used to send the transmissions. Special receiving sets filmed the signals as they came in, like a cathode ray tube, and then the signals were captured on film and developed. Light tables were then used to compare the signals in order to verify who was sending them. A civilian from military intelligence at Bletchley Park was in charge of this room. The Radio Direction Finding records room was next door and kept records of the signals' exact locations of origin. In 1940 the use of the hall for all of these different functions allowed for the required specially designed wireless set rooms to be constructed in the grounds of the hall. This was instead of converting the existing rooms within the building for this purpose. A field to the north of the hall was chosen as the ideal location to construct the new set huts. In the mid-1970s the hall was bought by Leicestershire County Council, developing quickly into a busy Conference and Education Centre. ===The operational huts === The War Office Y Group had acquired an architect who worked as part of the local staff at Beaumanor, and he was tasked with designing the set rooms and other buildings. These were to be disguised and fitted into their surroundings by being made to look like normal outbuildings associated with a country house. This disguising is unique to Beaumanor, and there are no current records of any other buildings the military used during the war being disguised in this way. A twenty acre (8.1 ha) field to the north of the hall was chosen as the appropriate site to build the required operational set rooms (huts). The huts were spaced far enough apart to avoid collateral damage should a bombing raid occur. Each hut was brick-built with blast walls, and then a disguising outer covering was put over it. The huts were disguised in different ways: one to look like a cart shed with barn (J), two to look like cottages (H&I;), the fourth to look like stables (K), the fifth disguised as a glasshouse (M) block, and the sixth, Hut G, as a cricket pavilion complete with a false clock tower. To give them an identity, the huts were each given a letter of the alphabet. The four huts around the perimeter of the field were lettered H, I, J and K. These huts were to be the four set rooms, which housed the wireless receivers for intercepting messages. All of the cables and aerial feeds were located in underground ducts. Each hut had a pneumatic tube for sending the handwritten, received messages to G hut via a cylinder, which was shot down the tube. This tube system was also underground and out of sight. In order to carefully conceal them, the other huts were given wooden exteriors and located in the wooded area to the rear of the hall on its western side. These huts were lettered A, B, C, D, E and F. The wireless listeners were uniformed women of the ATS (Auxiliary Territorial Service), who had been trained on the Isle of Man. They intercepted German and Italian messages, many of which had been enciphered on Enigma machines. It was the most difficult of signals intelligence gathering, because the enciphering meant that no prediction was possible. Once gathered, the intercepts were sent by motorcycle courier to Bletchley Park, for decryption. Collectively, the women who worked at Beaumanor were known as the WOYGians. ==References== ==Sources== * Wessel, Caroline (1988) Portrait of Beaumanor, The Herricks and Beaumanor Society, * This article contains text that has been reproduced by permission of Beaumanor & Garats HaY Amateur Radio Society M0GBY. ==External links== * Beaumanor history * Bletchley Park Museum * Garats Hay Branch of Royal British Legion Category:Cryptography organizations Category:Country houses in Leicestershire Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Leicestershire Category:Signals intelligence of World War II ","title":"Beaumanor Hall"},{"id":"831416","text":"Pathare Prabhu middle-class gentleman of nineteenth century.

The Pathare Prabhus and the Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhus (CKPs) are considered sister communities, both being part of the 'Prabhu castes'. However, the Pathare Prabhu followed the Smartha tradition of Hinduism whereas the CKP followed the Advaita Vedanta tradition propounded by Adi Shankara, the first Shankaracharya. Along with all the Maharashtrian Brahmin castes and the CKP, they are considered one of the 'high' or 'elite' castes of Maharashtra.

The objective is to get a loop or line of your colour while attempting to stop your opponent from completing a loop in their colour. If a tile played in any turn forms an adjacent space or spaces into which same coloured track enters from two edges, that same player must play a further tile into each such space so as to join up the same coloured track, be it white or red, as part of that turn. A forced play may itself require further forced plays to be made.

After a long community campaign, it re-opened in 2004. ==History== The Fitzroy Central School as it was first known, opened for the 1915 school year, admitting students from Grades 5 to 8. In 1957, it received its current name, and was allowed to take students up to Year 12. In 1988, it merged with Exhibition High School, but retained its original site.John Andrews & Deborah Towns (2018) Unlocking the Past; What stories does your School have to reveal? (A compendium to A Secondary Education for All) P.27 Australian Scholarly Publishing, ===Closure=== After coming to power in 1992, then-Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett embarked on an array of budget cuts in an attempt to restore the state's flagging finances. As a result, the decision was made to close a significant number of schools across the state. Fitzroy High was one of the first to be earmarked for closure, and it shut down at the end of the 1992 school year. After its closure, the local community feared that the site, which had been public land ever since 1871, would be sold for development. Community groups decided to occupy the site, in an attempt to prevent its sale, and in a widely publicised campaign, maintained a 24-hour vigil for fourteen months. People manned the site in four-hour shifts, or slept overnight in the principal's office or administration wing. ===Twelve years later, Fitzroy High reopens its doors=== In 1993, the state government finally struck a deal with the local community, and the Kangan Batman TAFE was allowed to use the site. They operated a campus at the site until 1998, when budgetary requirements forced it to close. The following year, they handed the site back to the Education Department. Around the same time, Jeff Kennett lost power, and was replaced by Steve Bracks, who was more supportive of their cause. The site lay dormant for two years, until then-Education Minister Mary Delahunty approved plans to re-open the school for Years 7 to 10 in 2001. The site was significantly renovated, involving the construction of a new science and technology wing, a library and a food technology division. During 2002, the school was used as a central filming location for the children's series Short Cuts. ===Re-opening=== On 28 January 2004, the school re-opened, with 135 students in Years 7 and 8. It expanded to Years 9 and 10 in the 2005 school year, and plans were announced in December 2005 to begin classes for Years 11 and 12 in 2007 in conjunction with another Melbourne school, Collingwood College. A building program, comprising a unique design to facilitate the school's learning philosophy, was completed in 2009 to increase accommodation for up to 600 students in years 7-12. The new building has now won a number of design awards including the Dulux Colour and the Australian Institute of Architecture Victorian Chapter annual award 2010 -Public Alterations and Additions.

The major use of stepping switches was in early automatic telephone exchanges to route telephone calls. Later, they were often used in industrial control systems. During World War II, Japanese cypher machines, known in the United States as CORAL, JADE, and PURPLE contained them. Code breakers at Bletchley Park employed uniselectors driven by a continuously rotating motor rather than a series of pulses in the Bombe machines to cryptanalyse the German Enigma ciphers. In a uniselector, the stepping switch steps only along or around one axis, although several sets of contacts are often operated simultaneously. In other types, such as the Strowger switch, invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1888, mechanical switching occurs in two directions, across a grid of contacts. ==Single-axis stepping switches== An example of a Western Electric 7A Rotary (Bird-cage) Line Finder assembly. The horizontal shaft is driven by a gear and when the Line Finder's electromagnet is energized, a flexible disc at the base of the Line Finder's brush carriage is engaged through friction to the horizontal shaft's driving disc, causing the brush carriage to rotate. Stepping switches were widely used in telephony and industrial control systems when electromechanical technology was paramount. A basic stepping switch is an electrically operated rotary switch with a single (typically input) terminal, and multiple (typically output) terminals. Like other typical rotary switches, the single terminal connects to one of the multiple terminals by rotating a contact arm, sometimes called a wiper, to the desired position. Moving from one position to the next is called stepping, hence the name of the mechanism. Using traditional terminology, this is a single-pole, multi-position switch. While some stepping switches have only one pole (layer of contacts), a typical switch has more; in the latter case, all wipers are aligned and move together. Hence, one input with multiple wires could be connected to one of multiple outputs, based on the receipt of a single set of pulses. In this configuration, the rotating contacts resembled the head support arms in a modern hard disk drive. Multipole switches were common; some had perhaps as many as a dozen poles, but those were less common. Most switches have a bank of stationary contacts extending over half a cylinder, while some have only a third of a cylinder. The typical \\"half- cylinder\\" switch has two sets of wiper contacts opposite each other, while the \\"third of a cylinder\\" type has three sets, equally spaced. For any given level, both or all three wipers are connected, so it makes no difference which of the two (or three) is connecting. When access to more outlets was required, the rotor had two sets of wipers opposite each other but offset vertically: on the first half rotation one set of outlets was accessed; the second set of outlets was accessed on the second half rotation. An electromagnet advances (steps) the wipers to the next position when fed with a pulse of DC. The magnet's armature (spring-loaded) operates a pawl that advances a ratchet. When the pawl reaches its full stroke, it blocks the ratchet so it and the wipers will not overshoot. When power to the coil disconnects, the spring retracts the pawl. Another pawl, sometimes called a detent spring, pivoted on the frame ensures that the wipers do not move backward; contact friction keeps them in place. Some uniselector designs step on application of the operate pulse; others step on its removal. An array of uniselector stepping switches as installed in a telephone exchange. The silver dials show the current position of the moving wipers. The fixed feeder brushes are barely visible. In most applications, such as telephony, it is desirable to be able to return the wipers to a \\"home\\" position; this is at the beginning of rotation, at one end of the array of fixed contacts. Some switches have a cam attached to the wiper shaft. This cam operates a set of contacts when the wiper is at home position, which is at the beginning of the span of rotation. Other circuit designs used one level (pole) of the contacts to home the wipers, so the separate homing contacts were not needed. Typical stepping switches have contacts directly operated by the stepping magnet's armature; these contacts can serve to make the magnet cycle (\\"self-step\\") and advance the wipers as long as power is applied. The external control circuits remove power when the wipers reach the desired position; that could be the home position. Most stepping switches rotate the wipers in only one direction, but some are bidirectional; the latter have a second magnet to rotate the wipers the other way. A third variety \\"winds\\" a spring as the wiper steps progressively, and a ratchet holds the wipers from returning to home position. When the circuit is no longer needed, another electromagnet releases the holding pawl; the spring then returns the wipers to their home position. Stepping switches were quite noisy in operation (especially when self-stepping), because their mechanisms accelerated and stopped quickly to minimize operating time. One could compare their sound to that of some snap-action mechanisms. Nevertheless, they were engineered for long life, given periodic maintenance; they were quite reliable. Single-axis stepping switches are sometimes known as uniselectors.

Typically, a single compact group of wipers could connect to one of 100 (or 200) different fixed contacts, in ten levels. When the switch was idle, the wipers were disengaged from the fixed contacts. The wipers moved up and down on a vertical shaft, and rotated into the contact bank to make a connection. A spring, internal to the vertical shaft, returned the wipers to their home position at the bottom. This type had two stepping coils with pawls and ratchets, one to raise the wipers to the desired banks of contacts, and one to rotate the wipers into the banks. These were commonly used in telephone switching with ten banks of ten contacts. The coils were typically driven by the electrical pulses derived from a rotary telephone dial. On a two-motion selector, as a digit was dialed, the wipers would step up the banks, then automatically rotate (self-step) into the selected bank until they found an \\"unused\\" outlet to the next switch stage. The last two digits dialed would operate the connector switch (final selector in Britain). The second to last digit would cause the wipers to move up and the last digit would cause them to rotate into the bank to the called customer's line outlet. If the line was idle then ringing voltage would be applied to the called line and ringing tone was sent to the calling line. Another variant of the two-axis switch was the Stromberg-Carlson X-Y Switch which was quite common in telephone exchanges in the western USA. It was a flat mechanism, and the moving contacts moved both sidewise, as well as to and fro. It was quite reliable, and could be maintained by people with minimal training. ==Applications== Stepping switches are used in a variety of applications, other than telephone systems. By connecting several in series with the highest output of one going to the stepping contact of the next, a counter could be constructed. Or by feeding the stepping contact with an endless pulse train via a relay, and controlling the relay from the switch's own output, it can be made to automatically hunt for the first unpowered line (or powered, depending on whether the relay is normally open or normally closed). They could also be used as a demultiplexer, so that two input lines could control a number of output devices. One input line steps the switch until the correct device is selected, and the other then powers that device. Many other applications are possible. Such switches were used in a series of Japanese cypher machines during World War 2: CORAL, JADE, PURPLE (the names were American). Some of the equipment used to break the Enigma machine code also used many such switches, which some observers called the \\"Machine Gun\\" for the loud noise. ==References== == External links == * Explanation of the way a stepping switch works Category:Switches Category:American inventions Category:Telephone exchanges Category:Telecommunications equipment ","title":"Stepping switch"},{"id":"831619","text":"The plain-brown woodcreeper (Dendrocincla fuliginosa), is a sub-oscine passerine bird which breeds in the tropical New World from Honduras through South America to northern Argentina, and in Trinidad and Tobago. Sometimes it is considered to include the plain-winged woodcreeper (D. turdina) as a subspecies. This woodcreeper is typically 22 cm long, and weighs 37 g. It is drab even by woodcreeper standards. As its name implies, it lacks the streaking shown by most of its relatives, and is plain brown above and below. The bill is longish and straight. The normal call is a loud stick, but when following army ants, the groups keep up a noisy chatter. The song is a descending te-te-te-tu-tu-tu-tue-tue-tue-chu-chu-chu. The plain-brown woodcreeper is an insectivore which feeds on ants and other insects. It feeds low in trees, on the trunk or foliage, but rarely on the ground. It will follow columns of army ants, often in groups of up to a dozen birds. If specialist ant feeders like antbirds or larger woodcreepers are present, it tends to keep higher than those species. It also accompanies South American coatis (Nasua nasua) on their foraging excursions, especially when they feed in trees during the dry season.de Mello Beisiegel (2007) Though it may eat the occasional army ant and coatis might benefit from the birds spotting predators before they do, in both cases the plain-brown woodcreeper is typically a commensale, snatching prey that flees before the more formidable predators. This woodcreeper is a common and widespread forest bird which builds a leaf- lined nest in a palm tree stump; two or three white eggs are laid. ==Footnotes== ==References== * de Mello Beisiegel, Beatriz (2007): Foraging Association between Coatis (Nasua nasua) and Birds of the Atlantic Forest, Brazil.

The regiment cherishes its traditions, especially on the parade ground where the scarlet uniform and bearskin have become synonymous with the regiment and the other Guards regiments. The regiment takes part in numerous events, most notably the Beating Retreat, Changing of the Guard, Queen's Birthday Parade, Remembrance Sunday and State Visits. The Guards' regiments ceremonial uniforms differ from each other only slightly, the differentiations being in the tunic and the type of plume on the bearskin, if any, they have. The Scots Guards uniform consists of tunic buttons in threes, the Order of the Thistle on the shoulder badge, the Thistle on the collar badge and no plume on the bearskin. ==World War II history== ==A declining empire== Both battalions were back in the UK by 1946, having returned from Germany and Trieste respectively. In 1948, the 1st Battalion assumed the role of Guards Training Battalion, a role that lasted until 1951. The 2nd Battalion was once more involved in war, however, when it deployed to Malaya during the native insurgency there as part of the 2nd Guards Brigade. The State of Emergency in Malaya had been declared in June after increased violence and terrorist acts against British, Asian and other citizens were perpetrated by the Malayan Races Liberation Army (MRLA), an organisation made up largely of ethnic Chinese Communists who opposed the creation of the Federation of Malaya as they believed it did not directly lead to the creation of a Communist state, and also opposed the British Empire. The Communist insurgents were originally known as 'Bandits' but this was soon replaced with the term CT (Communist Terrorist). The battalion arrived in Malaya in October with the rest of the Guards Brigade and in 1950, the battalion joined the 18th Infantry Brigade, the retitled 2nd Guards Brigade. During its time in Malaya, the 2nd Battalion performed a variety of duties, including, in their involvement in the Emergency, guarding duties due to the Malayan Police's manpower problems, but also performed more aggressive tasks, such as patrolling into the dense jungle, hunting for CT. The patrols were difficult for the Commonwealth forces, who did not know where the CT lurked, and who had to contend with all the many aspects of the jungle, such as the diverse animals and sounds that make the jungle their home (especially leeches), and the claustrophobia of such a place, with the soldiers having probably been accustomed to living in relatively wide-open cities. A very apparent danger was the deadly booby traps laid by the CT. Patrols at times, despite hard slogging in the energy-sapping jungle, gave very little to show for the hard-work, but when contact was made with the CT, it invariably ended in fierce, close-quarters combat, with much valour and professionalism often displayed by the battalion. In 1948, the Scots Guards were involved in the Batang Kali massacre. By the time the battalion departed Malaya in 1951 for home. it had lost thirteen officers and other ranks. The Emergency was declared over on 31 July 1960, the Communists had been defeated. In late 1951, the 1st Battalion deployed to Cyprus with the rest of the 32nd Guards Brigade, and in February the following year, the battalion deployed to the Suez Canal Zone, Egypt which was experiencing strife within the Zone, fomented by the Egyptian Government (as well as newspapers) who, in 1951, had unilaterally abrogated the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 which had given the British a base in the Suez Canal Zone, and was intended to expire in 1956. During its time in Egypt, the battalion performed a number of tasks, including the usual patrolling and guarding, which at times, tended to be monotonous and uneventful, though at others, such duties sometimes involved incidents which included coming under attack from Egyptians, including by snipers as well as rioting taking place. The battalion remained in Egypt until late 1954, when it, and the rest of the 32nd Guards Brigade, departed after a Treaty was signed between the two countries, which agreed that British and Egyptian technicians would maintain the base, and that a gradual phase-out of British forces in Egypt would begin, with the last British forces leaving Egypt in June 1956. During its time in Egypt the battalion suffered a single fatality. Also in 1952, Queen Elizabeth succeeded to the throne, and became the regiment's fifth Colonel-in-Chief since the first, King Edward VII, in 1901. Also in 1952, the regiment formed a new alliance with the 3rd Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment, an alliance that remains intact as of 2004. In July 1953, the 2nd Battalion deployed to West Germany to join the 4th Guards Brigade at Hubbelrath, part of the British Army of the Rhine, and returned home in 1957. That year the 1st Battalion headed for Hubbelrath to join the 4th Guards Brigade and remained there until 1960 when it too returned home to the UK. In February 1962, the 2nd Battalion arrived in Kenya where it joined the 24th Infantry Brigade. While there the battalion operated in support of the civil power there, which included in 1964, assistance during the mutiny of the 1st Battalion, The Kenya Rifles and in Uganda, sent a company to help in quelling the mutiny of the 1st Battalion, The Uganda Rifles, and the battalion departed Kenya that same year for home. Elsewhere in 1964 the regiment's alliance with the Canadian Winnipeg Grenadiers came to an end, ending an alliance that had existed since 1933. The Winnipeg Grenadiers would disband the following year. In late 1964 the 1st Battalion deployed to Malaysia, which had only been formed the previous year, where it joined the 28th Commonwealth Brigade, and was based in Camp Terendak, Malacca. In 1965 the battalion undertook two tours in Borneo during the Indonesian Confrontation. The battalion's time in Borneo was quite similar to the 2nd Battalion's experiences in the Malaysian mainland during the Malayan Emergency, with patrols being undertaken against Indonesian incursions in the dense jungle that covered Borneo. The following year the 1st Battalion returned home from the Far East. That same year the 2nd Battalion deployed to West Germany where it was based in Iserlohn as part of 4th Armoured Brigade and the following year moved to Munster, Germany. ==Actions in Northern Ireland== The 1st Battalion deployed for the first time to the Persian Gulf when it arrived in Sharjah, now part of the United Arab Emirates and left in late 1970. Also that year the 2nd Battalion returned home from Germany and deployed on a short tour of Northern Ireland which would be one of many for the regiment, and especially so during the 1970s. In 1971 the 2nd Battalion, due to defence cuts, was placed in 'suspended animation' and two companies were retained, but the following year, due to the change of Government, the battalion was reformed. Also in 1971 the 1st Battalion deployed to Ireland for the first time. Such deployments were difficult with troops being in constant danger from snipers and bombs, with patrols and guarding being the main routine duties. Their tour came to an end in December. During their deployment five men were lost to shooting and bombing incidents. In 1972 the 1st Battalion deployed to West Germany where it was stationed in Munster as part of 4th Armoured Brigade. That same year the recently reformed 2nd Battalion undertook a tour of Northern Ireland and during its tour the battalion lost three of its men by gunfire. In May 1973 the 1st Battalion deployed to Northern Ireland, leaving in September to return to its base in Germany. The 2nd Battalion followed in late 1973 and suffered a fatality from sniper fire during its tour. In 1974 two members of the regiment lost their lives during an IRA bombing of two pubs in Guildford. Two members of the Women's Royal Army Corps and a civilian were also killed and dozens were wounded. In 1975 the 1st Battalion deployed to Ireland yet again, though this time they did not suffer any fatalities during their four-month tour-of-duty and returned to Munster in August. The 2nd Battalion arrived in Belize in Central America for a five- month deployment. In January 1976 the 1st Battalion returned home from Germany while the 2nd Battalion journeyed in the opposite direction, being based in Munster. Later that year the 2nd Battalion deployed to Northern Ireland for another tour-of-duty fulfilling the usual roles of troops in Ireland before returning to Munster in January 1977. The 1st Battalion arrived in Northern Ireland later that year for a very brief tour there. In August 1978 the 1st Battalion returned again to Ireland for another four-month tour-of-duty. That year a member of the 2nd Battalion was killed while working undercover for the 14th Intelligence Company in Northern Ireland. In March 1980 the 1st Battalion deployed to Northern Ireland where it was stationed at Aldergrove for a deployment that would last until late 1981. The 2nd Battalion joined the 1st Battalion when it deployed to Northern Ireland in May 1980 for a five-month tour-of-duty. In late 1981 the 1st Battalion left Aldergrove and deployed to Hong Kong in the Far East on a two-year posting. ==Falklands War== On 2 April 1982, Argentina, then under a dictatorship led by General Galtieri, invaded the British territory of the Falkland Islands off South America. The British soon assembled a large array of Royal Navy (RN) warships, Royal Fleet Auxiliaries and merchant ships and headed south for Ascension Island. On 25 April, the island of South Georgia, off Antarctica was recaptured and on 1 May the RN Carrier Battle Group had entered the 200-mile (370 km) Total Exclusion Zone (TEZ) which had been placed around the Falklands. On 12 May the 2nd Battalion, as part of the 5th Infantry Brigade (1st Battalion, The Welsh Guards, 1st/7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles), embarked aboard RMS Queen Elizabeth 2 (QE2), which had been requisitioned by the Government for use as a troopship, and departed Southampton for South Georgia. In the early hours of the 21 May D-Day began with 3 Commando Brigade (including two Para battalions) landing unopposed at San Carlos water and successfully established a bridgehead. In late May the QE2 arrived at her destination but because she could not be risked by moving her closer to the Falklands, most of 5th Brigade were transferred to the P & O liner who would then take them to their destination. On 2 June, Canberra anchored in San Carlos Water, and subsequently the Guards were landed at San Carlos by LCU, a day after the 1st/7th Gurkhas had been landed by LCU from the ferry Norland. On 5 June the Scots Guards were embarked aboard the assault ship before being transferred to the ship's four LCUs who transported them to Bluff Cove. On 8 June the 1st Welsh Guards were aboard RFA Sir Galahad also waiting to be landed at Bluff Cove when Sir Galahad and RFA Sir Tristram were attacked by Argentinian Skyhawk fighters who proceeded to hit both ships. Sir Galahad was terribly hit and both ships caught fire, causing terrible casualties aboard Sir Galahad. Forty eight people, including thirty two Welsh Guards, were killed and many were wounded, many suffering from terrible burns. Unfortunately, only 200 survived. On the morning of 13 June the Scots Guards were moved from their positions at Bluff Cove by helicopter to an assembly area near Goat Ridge near to their objective, Mount Tumbledown, which was defended by a crack Argentinian unit, the 5th Marine Infantry Battalion. On the night of the 13th the main force of the Scots Guards began its advance on the western side of Mount Tumbledown. During the course of the battle in the early hours of the 14th, men of the battalion launched a bayonet charge on the stout Argentinian defenders which resulted in bitter and bloody fighting, and was one of the last bayonet charges by the British Army. The battle raged on and by 8:00 am the final objective was taken and Mount Tumbledown was in the hands of the Scots Guards. The battle had been bloody, yet successful, and the battalion had proven the elite calibre and professionalism of the regiment in taking a well-defended mountain, defended by a top Argentinian unit, for it had been performing public duties back in London only a few months before. The Scots Guards casualties were eight Guards and one Royal Engineer killed, and forty three wounded. Their Argentinian opponents lost forty men and over thirty captured. See Battle of Mount Tumbledown. On 14 June the Argentinian commander surrendered his forces of just under 10,000 men to the British, the war was over, though the end of hostilities would not officially be declared until 20 June. The following day, Juiliet Company (made up mostly of men of Naval Party 8901 who had defended the Falklands when it had been invaded) raised the Governor's flag above Government House, it had been down for seventy four days; the Falklands was finally liberated. Most of 5th Brigade were moved back to Fitzroy and the Scots Guards were subsequently moved to West Falkland to await the arrival of the first garrison troops and eventually departed the Falklands for Ascension on Norland on 19 July. The battalion was subsequently returned home by air, being transported by RAF VC-10 aircraft. The regiment won a number of gallantry awards for their actions in the Falklands War. A single Distinguished Service Order (DSO) was won, being awarded to the battalion's CO Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Scott. Also won by the battalion were two Military Crosses (MC), two Distinguished Conduct Medals (DCM) and two Military Medals (MM). The battalion was awarded two battle honours for its part in the war, \\"Tumbledown Mountain\\" and \\"Falkland Islands 1982\\". ==Activity in the 1980s and 1990s== In 1984 the 1st Battalion returned from Hong Kong while the 2nd Battalion did the opposite and left for abroad, being deployed to the Sovereign Base Area, Cyprus where the battalion would remain until February 1986 when it returned home. In June the 1st Battalion took part once more in the Queen's Birthday Parade, a parade which was the last time Queen Elizabeth rode on horseback during the parade. In September the 1st Battalion deployed to Ireland on an emergency tour that lasted until January 1987 The 1st Battalion was presented with new Colours by Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace and the regiment also takes part in the Queen's Birthday Parade. In October the 2nd Battalion deployed on the usual tour of NI, a tour that lasted until February 1988. That same month, the 1st Battalion deployed to Hohne, West Germany where it joined the 22nd Armoured Brigade.The 2nd Battalion also deployed abroad, when it took part in mechanised infantry exercises in the BATUS, Canada which lasted for 6-weeks. Also that year the 2nd Battalion was presented with new colours by the Queen at Hopeton House, Edinburgh In 1989 the 1st Battalion deployed on an emergency tour of East Tyrone, NI, a tour that lasted for about 4 months. The 2nd Battalion also deployed abroad, to Canada where they took part in 6-week exercises at the BATUS. The first year of the 1990s brought much of the same for the Scots Guards when the 1st Battalion departed for 6-weeks of exercises at BATUS, Canada. The 1st Battalion did gain new equipment that year when it converted from the FV432 to the much more capable Warrior APC. In March the 2nd Battalion arrived in Northern Ireland for another tour, and during that year the regiment suffered one fatality in Ireland. In November 1990, commanded by Lt. Col. Price, the Regimental Band of the Scots Guards set off to the Gulf to take part in Operation Granby. The band served in 33 Field Hospital in Kuwait as medics on various wards, as well as providing musical entertainment at the British ambassadors residence as well as playing for the coffins as they returned home. Musicians of the Scots Guards band can still be seen wearing their medals today. The 1st Battalion also deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Granby, the British contribution to the war against Saddam Hussein, for which the battalion was awarded the theatre honour \\"Gulf 1991\\". That same year the 2nd Battalion took part in the Queen's Birthday Parade. Other events in 1992 for the regiment included the 2nd Battalion providing the Royal Guard at Balmoral Castle, participating in the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, in which the regiment has participated in many times. Also that year the regiment celebrated at Holyrood Palace, the 350th Anniversary of the regiment's creation. In 1993 the 2nd Battalion took part in 6-week exercises at BATUS in Canada but on 4 November, due to defence cuts, the battalion was placed in 'suspended animation' and a single company (F Company) was formed for public and other duties. In 1994 the 1st Battalion deployed on a tour of Ireland that lasted for 6-months. The following year saw the 1st Battalion take part in the Queen's Birthday Parade and deploy to Canada for 6-weeks of exercises at BATUS. In 1996 the battalion deployed once more to Ireland and the following year the regiment takes part in the Queen's Birthday Parade. In 1998 the 1st Battalion deployed to Abercorn Barracks at Ballykinler, Ireland on a 2-year posting and returned home. ===The McBride shooting=== Guardsmen Wright and Fisher who were convicted of the murder of a civilian during the 1992 tour of Northern Ireland. In 1992 the 1st Battalion deployed to Belfast, Northern Ireland and during that six-month tour the battalion suffered two fatalities. In September of this tour, two members of the 1st Battalion were involved in the shooting of an unarmed civilian, 18-year-old Peter McBride. During a routine patrol of the New Lodge area of Belfast, Guardsmen Mark Wright and James Fisher came across McBride. He was searched and found to have no weapons and no outstanding warrants. Frightened by the confrontation, McBride ran from the Guardsmen, who responded by shooting him in the back. Seriously wounded, McBride collapsed across a car and slid to the ground, where he was again shot in the back. In 1995, Wright and Fisher were convicted of the shooting, and given life sentences. However, they were freed in 1998 according to the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, which provides for the early release of prisoners (in both Britain and Ireland) serving sentences in connection with the activities of paramilitary groups. Upon release, the two men were reinstated into the British Army, despite Queen's regulations stating that any member given a custodial sentence in a civilian court must be dismissed, barring \\"exceptional reasons\\". This decision caused a great deal of controversy in Northern Ireland, with national politicians such as Belfast Lord Mayor Martin Morgan speaking out against it. McBride's mother and sister have continued their activism against this decision. ==Dawn of a new millennium== For the regiment, activities in the new millennium began similarly to the 1990s. The 1st Battalion was deployed to Ireland in 2000. Later that year, the battalion also deployed to Kenya for exercises that lasted 6 weeks. A contingent of the Scots Guards was also deployed to Sierra Leone in West Africa. In 2001 the 1st Battalion was back in Ireland, and a single company stayed there for 6 months. When the Queen Mother died in March 2002, only a month after her daughter, Princess Margaret, the regiment was very active contributing to the funeral. On 5 April, 6 officers and 300 other Guardsmen of various ranks took part in the funeral procession to Westminster Hall where the late Queen Mother would be lying-in-state until 9 April. Officers of the regiment took turns at standing vigil in Westminster Hall around the Queen Mother's coffin. Later that month, the 1st Battalion and F Company were presented with their new Colours by Queen Elizabeth at Windsor Castle. On 15 June the battalion took part in the Queen's Birthday Parade, a parade that was all the more significant because 2002 was also the year of Queen Elizabeth's Golden Jubilee, her 50th year as Queen. The regiment was also celebrating its 360th year, and had been the first regiment (the 2nd Battalion) to parade the Colour for Queen Elizabeth in 1952. The battalion and F Company were also involved in firefighting duties as part of Operation Fresco during the firefighters' strike. The Scots Guards, as did all other armed forces units, used vintage Army Green Goddess fire engines. The Scots Guards operated in Greater London during their firefighting duties. In 2003 the 1st Battalion deployed to M√ºnster, Germany where it joined British Forces Germany (BFG) on a 6-year posting. Also that year, F Company deployed abroad to take part in exercises in the ex-Soviet state of Kazakhstan. In 2004 the 1st Battalion deployed to Iraq on a 6-month posting as part of 4th Armoured Brigade. The 4th Brigade relieved 1st Mechanised Brigade, and joined the Multi-National Division (South East), which was under UK command. The Multi- National Division provided security to south-east Iraq until 2009, when command was transferred to the United States Army. Under the British Army reforms announced in 2004, the Scots Guards remained as a single battalion regiment, and were given a fixed role as an armoured infantry battalion. They were moved from M√ºnster to Catterick, North Yorkshire, in northern England in 2009. In 2011, the 1st Battalion undertook public duties for the first time in many years, in conjunction with it having its Queen's Colour trooped during the Queen's Birthday Parade. For this, elements of the battalion moved from Catterick to Pirbright for a time. ==References== ==External links== *Scots Guards Association - History Category:Scots Guards Category:20th-century history of the British Army Category:Military units and formations of the United Kingdom in the Falklands War Category:Military units and formations of the Gulf War ","title":"History of the Scots Guards (1946‚Äìpresent)"},{"id":"831650","text":"These carabiners have an anodized aluminium surface that has been dyed; they are made in many colours. Anodizing is an electrolytic passivation process used to increase the thickness of the natural oxide layer on the surface of metal parts. The process is called anodizing because the part to be treated forms the anode electrode of an electrolytic cell. Anodizing increases resistance to corrosion and wear, and provides better adhesion for paint primers and glues than bare metal does. Anodic films can also be used for several cosmetic effects, either with thick porous coatings that can absorb dyes or with thin transparent coatings that add interference effects to reflected light. Anodizing is also used to prevent galling of threaded components and to make dielectric films for electrolytic capacitors. Anodic films are most commonly applied to protect aluminium alloys, although processes also exist for titanium, zinc, magnesium, niobium, zirconium, hafnium, and tantalum. Iron or carbon steel metal exfoliates when oxidized under neutral or alkaline micro-electrolytic conditions; i.e., the iron oxide (actually ferric hydroxide or hydrated iron oxide, also known as rust) forms by anoxic anodic pits and large cathodic surface, these pits concentrate anions such as sulfate and chloride accelerating the underlying metal to corrosion. Carbon flakes or nodules in iron or steel with high carbon content (high-carbon steel, cast iron) may cause an electrolytic potential and interfere with coating or plating. Ferrous metals are commonly anodized electrolytically in nitric acid or by treatment with red fuming nitric acid to form hard black Iron(II,III) oxide. This oxide remains conformal even when plated on wiring and the wiring is bent. Anodizing changes the microscopic texture of the surface and the crystal structure of the metal near the surface. Thick coatings are normally porous, so a sealing process is often needed to achieve corrosion resistance. Anodized aluminium surfaces, for example, are harder than aluminium but have low to moderate wear resistance that can be improved with increasing thickness or by applying suitable sealing substances. Anodic films are generally much stronger and more adherent than most types of paint and metal plating, but also more brittle. This makes them less likely to crack and peel from ageing and wear, but more susceptible to cracking from thermal stress. ==History== Anodizing was first used on an industrial scale in 1923 to protect Duralumin seaplane parts from corrosion. This early chromic acid‚Äìbased process was called the Bengough‚ÄìStuart process and was documented in British defence specification DEF STAN 03-24/3. It is still used today despite its legacy requirements for a complicated voltage cycle now known to be unnecessary. Variations of this process soon evolved, and the first sulfuric acid anodizing process was patented by Gower and O'Brien in 1927. Sulfuric acid soon became and remains the most common anodizing electrolyte. Oxalic acid anodizing was first patented in Japan in 1923 and later widely used in Germany, particularly for architectural applications. Anodized aluminium extrusion was a popular architectural material in the 1960s and 1970s, but has since been displaced by cheaper plastics and powder coating.. The phosphoric acid processes are the most recent major development, so far only used as pretreatments for adhesives or organic paints.. A wide variety of proprietary and increasingly complex variations of all these anodizing processes continue to be developed by industry, so the growing trend in military and industrial standards is to classify by coating properties rather than by process chemistry. ==Aluminium== Coloured anodized aluminum key blanks Aluminium alloys are anodized to increase corrosion resistance and to allow dyeing (colouring), improved lubrication, or improved adhesion. However, anodizing does not increase the strength of the aluminium object. The anodic layer is insulative.. When exposed to air at room temperature, or any other gas containing oxygen, pure aluminium self-passivates by forming a surface layer of amorphous aluminum oxide 2 to 3 nm thick,. which provides very effective protection against corrosion. Aluminium alloys typically form a thicker oxide layer, 5‚Äì15 nm thick, but tend to be more susceptible to corrosion. Aluminium alloy parts are anodized to greatly increase the thickness of this layer for corrosion resistance. The corrosion resistance of aluminium alloys is significantly decreased by certain alloying elements or impurities: copper, iron, and silicon,. so 2000-, 4000-, 6000 and 7000-series Al alloys tend to be most susceptible. Although anodizing produces a very regular and uniform coating, microscopic fissures in the coating can lead to corrosion. Further, the coating is susceptible to chemical dissolution in the presence of high- and low-pH chemistry, which results in stripping the coating and corrosion of the substrate. To combat this, various techniques have been developed either to reduce the number of fissures, to insert more chemically stable compounds into the oxide, or both. For instance, sulphuric-anodized articles are normally sealed, either through hydro-thermal sealing or precipitating sealing, to reduce porosity and interstitial pathways that allow corrosive ion exchange between the surface and the substrate. Precipitating seals enhance chemical stability but are less effective in eliminating ionic exchange pathways. Most recently, new techniques to partially convert the amorphous oxide coating into more stable micro-crystalline compounds have been developed that have shown significant improvement based on shorter bond lengths. Some aluminium aircraft parts, architectural materials, and consumer products are anodized. Anodized aluminium can be found on MP3 players, smartphones, multi-tools, flashlights, cookware, cameras, sporting goods, firearms, window frames, roofs, in electrolytic capacitors, and on many other products both for corrosion resistance and the ability to retain dye. Although anodizing only has moderate wear resistance, the deeper pores can better retain a lubricating film than a smooth surface would. Anodized coatings have a much lower thermal conductivity and coefficient of linear expansion than aluminium. As a result, the coating will crack from thermal stress if exposed to temperatures above 80 ¬∞C (353 K). The coating can crack, but it will not peel. The melting point of aluminium oxide is 2050¬∞C (2323¬∞K), much higher than pure aluminium's 658¬∞C (931¬∞K). This and the insulativity of aluminium oxide can make welding more difficult. In typical commercial aluminium anodizing processes, the aluminium oxide is grown down into the surface and out from the surface by equal amounts. Therefore, anodizing will increase the part dimensions on each surface by half the oxide thickness. For example, a coating that is 2 Œºm thick will increase the part dimensions by 1 Œºm per surface. If the part is anodized on all sides, then all linear dimensions will increase by the oxide thickness. Anodized aluminium surfaces are harder than aluminium but have low to moderate wear resistance, although this can be improved with thickness and sealing. ===Process=== The anodized aluminium layer is grown by passing a direct current through an electrolytic solution, with the aluminium object serving as the anode (the positive electrode). The current releases hydrogen at the cathode (the negative electrode) and oxygen at the surface of the aluminium anode, creating a build-up of aluminium oxide. Alternating current and pulsed current is also possible but rarely used. The voltage required by various solutions may range from 1 to 300 V DC, although most fall in the range of 15 to 21 V. Higher voltages are typically required for thicker coatings formed in sulfuric and organic acid. The anodizing current varies with the area of aluminium being anodized and typically ranges from 30 to 300 A/m2. Aluminium anodizing is usually performed in an acidic solution, typically sulphuric acid or chromic acid, which slowly dissolves the aluminium oxide. The acid action is balanced with the oxidation rate to form a coating with nanopores, 10‚Äì150 nm in diameter. These pores are what allow the electrolyte solution and current to reach the aluminium substrate and continue growing the coating to greater thickness beyond what is produced by auto-passivation.. These pores allow for the dye to be absorbed, however, this must be followed by sealing or the dye will not stay. Dye is typically followed up by a clean nickel acetate seal. Because the dye is only superficial, the underlying oxide may continue to provide corrosion protection even if minor wear and scratches break through the dyed layer. Conditions such as electrolyte concentration, acidity, solution temperature, and current must be controlled to allow the formation of a consistent oxide layer. Harder, thicker films tend to be produced by more concentrated solutions at lower temperatures with higher voltages and currents. The film thickness can range from under 0.5 micrometres for bright decorative work up to 150 micrometres for architectural applications. ===Dual- finishing=== Anodizing can be performed in combination with chromate conversion coating. Each process provides corrosion resistance, with anodizing offering a significant advantage when it comes to ruggedness or physical wear resistance. The reason for combining the processes can vary, however, the significant difference between anodizing and chromate conversion coating is the electrical conductivity of the films produced. Although both stable compounds, chromate conversion coating has a greatly increased electrical conductivity. Applications, where this may be useful, are varied, however, the issue of grounding components as part of a larger system is an obvious one. The dual finishing process uses the best each process has to offer, anodizing with its hard wear resistance and chromate conversion coating with its electrical conductivity. The process steps can typically involve chromate conversion coating the entire component, followed by a masking of the surface in areas where the chromate coating must remain intact. Beyond that, the chromate coating is then dissolved in unmasked areas. The component can then be anodized, with anodizing taking to the unmasked areas. The exact process will vary dependent on service provider, component geometry and required outcome.It helps to protect aluminium article. ==Other widely used specifications== The most widely used anodizing specification in the US is a U.S. military spec, MIL-A-8625, which defines three types of aluminium anodizing. Type I is chromic acid anodizing, Type II is sulphuric acid anodizing, and Type III is sulphuric acid hard anodizing. Other anodizing specifications include more MIL-SPECs (e.g., MIL-A-63576), aerospace industry specs by organizations such as SAE, ASTM, and ISO (e.g., AMS 2469, AMS 2470, AMS 2471, AMS 2472, AMS 2482, ASTM B580, ASTM D3933, ISO 10074, and BS 5599), and corporation-specific specs (such as those of Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Airbus and other large contractors). AMS 2468 is obsolete. None of these specifications define a detailed process or chemistry, but rather a set of tests and quality assurance measures which the anodized product must meet. BS 1615 guides the selection of alloys for anodizing. For British defense work, a detailed chromic and sulfuric anodizing processes are described by DEF STAN 03-24/3 and DEF STAN 03-25/3 respectively. STAN 03-24/3 STAN 03-25/3 ===Chromic acid (Type I)=== The oldest anodizing process uses chromic acid. It is widely known as the Bengough-Stuart process but, due to the safety regulations regarding air quality control, is not preferred by vendors when the additive material associated with type II doesn't break tolerances. In North America, it is known as Type I because it is so designated by the MIL-A-8625 standard, but it is also covered by AMS 2470 and MIL-A-8625 Type IB. In the UK it is normally specified as Def Stan 03/24 and used in areas that are prone to come into contact with propellants etc. There are also Boeing and Airbus standards. Chromic acid produces thinner, 0.5 Œºm to 18 Œºm (0.00002\\" to 0.0007\\")US Military Specification MIL-A-8625, ASSIST database more opaque films that are softer, ductile, and to a degree self-healing. They are harder to dye and may be applied as a pretreatment before painting. The method of film formation is different from using sulfuric acid in that the voltage is ramped up through the process cycle. ===Sulfuric acid (Type II & III)=== Sulfuric acid is the most widely used solution to produce an anodized coating. Coatings of moderate thickness 1.8 Œºm to 25 Œºm (0.00007\\" to 0.001\\") are known as Type II in North America, as named by MIL-A-8625, while coatings thicker than 25 Œºm (0.001\\") are known as Type III, hard-coat, hard anodizing, or engineered anodizing. Very thin coatings similar to those produced by chromic anodizing are known as Type IIB. Thick coatings require more process control, and are produced in a refrigerated tank near the freezing point of water with higher voltages than the thinner coatings. Hard anodizing can be made between 13 and 150 Œºm (0.0005\\" to 0.006\\") thick. Anodizing thickness increases wear resistance, corrosion resistance, ability to retain lubricants and PTFE coatings, and electrical and thermal insulation. Type III Anodize should not be dyed or sealed to maintain its wear resistance. Sealing will reduce this greatly. Standards for thin (Soft/Standard) sulfuric anodizing are given by MIL-A-8625 Types II and IIB, AMS 2471 (undyed), and AMS 2472 (dyed), BS EN ISO 12373/1 (decorative), BS 3987 (Architectural). Standards for thick sulphuric anodizing are given by MIL-A-8625 Type III, AMS 2469, BS ISO 10074, BS EN 2536 and the obsolete AMS 2468 and DEF STAN 03-26/1. ===Organic acid === Anodizing can produce yellowish integral colours without dyes if it is carried out in weak acids with high voltages, high current densities, and strong refrigeration. Shades of colour are restricted to a range which includes pale yellow, gold, deep bronze, brown, grey, and black. Some advanced variations can produce a white coating with 80% reflectivity. The shade of colour produced is sensitive to variations in the metallurgy of the underlying alloy and cannot be reproduced consistently. Anodizing in some organic acids, for example malic acid, can enter a 'runaway' situation, in which the current drives the acid to attack the aluminium far more aggressively than normal, resulting in huge pits and scarring. Also, if the current or voltage are driven too high, 'burning' can set in; in this case, the supplies act as if nearly shorted and large, uneven and amorphous black regions develop. Integral colour anodizing is generally done with organic acids, but the same effect has been produced in laboratories with very dilute sulfuric acid. Integral colour anodizing was originally performed with oxalic acid, but sulfonated aromatic compounds containing oxygen, particularly sulfosalicylic acid, have been more common since the 1960s. Thicknesses of up to 50 Œºm can be achieved. Organic acid anodizing is called Type IC by MIL-A-8625. ===Phosphoric acid === Anodizing can be carried out in phosphoric acid, usually as a surface preparation for adhesives. This is described in standard ASTM D3933. ===Borate and tartrate baths=== Anodizing can also be performed in borate or tartrate baths in which aluminium oxide is insoluble. In these processes, the coating growth stops when the part is fully covered, and the thickness is linearly related to the voltage applied. These coatings are free of pores, relative to the sulfuric and chromic acid processes. This type of coating is widely used to make electrolytic capacitors because the thin aluminium films (typically less than 0.5 Œºm) would risk being pierced by acidic processes. ===Plasma electrolytic oxidation=== Plasma electrolytic oxidation is a similar process, but where higher voltages are applied. This causes sparks to occur and results in more crystalline/ceramic type coatings. ==Other metalsMagnesium=== Magnesium is anodized primarily as a primer for paint. A thin (5 Œºm) film is sufficient for this. Thicker coatings of 25 Œºm and up can provide mild corrosion resistance when sealed with oil, wax, or sodium silicate. Standards for magnesium anodizing are given in AMS 2466, AMS 2478, AMS 2479, and ASTM B893. ===Niobium=== Niobium anodizes in a similar fashion to titanium with a range of attractive colors being formed by interference at different film thicknesses. Again the film thickness is dependent on the anodizing voltage. Uses include jewelry and commemorative coins. ===Tantalum=== Tantalum anodizes similarly to titanium and niobium with a range of attractive colours being formed by interference at different film thicknesses. Again the film thickness is dependent on the anodizing voltage and typically ranges from 18 to 23 Angstroms per volt depending on electrolyte and temperature. Uses include tantalum capacitors. ===Titanium=== Selected colors achievable through anodization of titanium. An anodized oxide layer has a thickness in the range of to several micrometers. Standards for titanium anodizing are given by AMS 2487 and AMS 2488. AMS 2488 Type III anodizing of titanium generates an array of different colours without dyes, for which it is sometimes used in art, costume jewellery, body piercing jewellery and wedding rings. The colour formed is dependent on the thickness of the oxide (which is determined by the anodizing voltage); it is caused by the interference of light reflecting off the oxide surface with light travelling through it and reflecting off the underlying metal surface. AMS 2488 Type II anodizing produces a thicker matte grey finish with higher wear resistance. ===Zinc=== Zinc is rarely anodized, but a process was developed by the International Lead Zinc Research Organization and covered by MIL-A-81801. A solution of ammonium phosphate, chromate and fluoride with voltages of up to 200 V can produce olive green coatings up to 80 Œºm thick. The coatings are hard and corrosion resistant. Zinc or galvanized steel can be anodized at lower voltages (20‚Äì30 V) as well as using direct currents from silicate baths containing varying concentration of sodium silicate, sodium hydroxide, borax, sodium nitrite and nickel sulphate.Imam, M. A., Moniruzzaman, M., & Mamun, M. A. ANODIZING OF ZINC FOR IMPROVED SURFACE PROPERTIES. Proceedings of a meeting held 20‚Äì24 November 2011, 18th International Corrosion Congress, Perth, Australia, pp. 199‚Äì206 (2012), ==Dyeing== Colored iPod Mini cases are dyed following anodizing and before thermal sealing The most common anodizing processes, for example, sulphuric acid on aluminium, produce a porous surface which can accept dyes easily. The number of dye colours is almost endless; however, the colours produced tend to vary according to the base alloy. The most common colours in the industry, due to them being relatively cheap, are yellow, green, blue, black, orange, purple and red. Though some may prefer lighter colours, in practice they may be difficult to produce on certain alloys such as high- silicon casting grades and 2000-series aluminium-copper alloys. Another concern is the \\"lightfastness\\" of organic dyestuffs‚Äîsome colours (reds and blues) are particularly prone to fading. Black dyes and gold produced by inorganic means (ferric ammonium oxalate) are more lightfast. Dyed anodizing is usually sealed to reduce or eliminate dye bleed out. White color cannot be applied due to the larger molecule size than the pore size of the oxide layer. Alternatively, metal (usually tin) can be electrolytically deposited in the pores of the anodic coating to provide more lightfast colours. Metal dye colors range from pale champagne to black. Bronze shades are commonly used for architectural metals. Alternatively, the colour may be produced integral to the film. This is done during the anodizing process using organic acids mixed with the sulfuric electrolyte and a pulsed current. Splash effects are created by dying the unsealed porous surface in lighter colours and then splashing darker colour dyes onto the surface. Aqueous and solvent-based dye mixtures may also be alternately applied since the coloured dyes will resist each other and leave spotted effects. ==Sealing== Sealing is the final step in the anodizing process. Acidic anodizing solutions produce pores in the anodized coating. These pores can absorb dyes and retain lubricants but are also an avenue for corrosion. When lubrication properties are not critical, they are usually sealed after dyeing to increase corrosion resistance and dye retention. There are three most common types of sealing. First, long immersion in boiling-hot (96‚Äì100¬∞C/205-212¬∞F) deionized water or steam is the simplest sealing process, although it is not completely effective and reduces abrasion resistance by 20%. The oxide is converted into its hydrated form and the resulting swelling reduces the porosity of the surface. Second, mid- temperature sealing process which works at 160-180¬∞F (60-80¬∞C) in solutions containing organic additives and metal salts. However, this process will likely leach the colors. Third, Cold sealing process, where the pores are closed by impregnation of a sealant in a room-temperature bath, is more popular due to energy savings. Coatings sealed in this method are not suitable for adhesive bonding. Teflon, nickel acetate, cobalt acetate, and hot sodium or potassium dichromate seals are commonly used. MIL-A-8625 requires sealing for thin coatings (Types I and II) and allows it as an option for thick ones (Type III). ==Cleaning== Anodized aluminium surfaces that are not regularly cleaned are susceptible to panel edge staining, a unique type of surface staining that can affect the structural integrity of the metal. ==Environmental impact== Anodizing is one of the more environmentally friendly metal finishing processes. Except for organic (aka integral colour) anodizing, the by-products contain only small amounts of heavy metals, halogens, or volatile organic compounds. Integral color anodizing produces no VOCs, heavy metals, or halogens as all of the byproducts found in the effluent streams of other processes come from their dyes or plating materials. The most common anodizing effluents, aluminium hydroxide and aluminium sulfate, are recycled for the manufacturing of alum, baking powder, cosmetics, newsprint and fertilizer or used by industrial wastewater treatment systems. ==Mechanical considerations== Anodizing will raise the surface since the oxide created occupies more space than the base metal converted.https://www.skyemetalcoating.com/services/anodizing This will generally not be of consequence except where there are tight tolerances. If so, the thickness of the anodizing layer has to be taken into account when choosing the machining dimension. A general practice on engineering drawing is to specify that \\"dimensions apply after all surface finishes\\". This will force the machine shop to take into account the anodization thickness when performing the final machining of the mechanical part before anodization. Also in the case of small holes threaded to accept screws, anodizing may cause the screws to bind, thus the threaded holes may need to be chased with a tap to restore the original dimensions. Alternatively, special oversize taps may be used to precompensate for this growth. In the case of unthreaded holes that accept fixed-diameter pins or rods, a slightly oversized hole to allow for the dimension change may be appropriate. Depending on the alloy and thickness of the anodized coating, the same may have a significantly negative effect on fatigue life. Conversely, anodizing may increase fatigue life by preventing corrosion pitting. ==ReferencesCitations=Bibliography=== * * ==External links== * Hard anodizing ‚Äì A selection of suitable aluminium alloys * Article on Anodising and its applications from Manufacturing Network Knowledge Base * The Aluminum Anodizers Council * Article on anodizing and dyeing from Coating and Fabrications Magazine * Encyclopedia Article * Website with useful anodizing information in Layman's Terms * \\"Titanium in Technicolor\\", an article on anodizing titanium from Theodore Gray's How2.0 column in Popular Science * \\"High-density Nanoporous Structures for Enhanced Electrocatalysis\\", a scientific paper for a method to create a high-density nanopore structure * \\"Anodised Aluminium Care & Maintenance Instructions\\" * \\"How to anodize and color aluminium DIY (SUB ENG)\\" Category:Coatings Category:Corrosion prevention Category:Electrolysis Category:Metallurgical processes ","title":"Anodizing"},{"id":"831652","text":"Vy≈°ehrad from the southwest Vy≈°ehrad (Czech for \\"upper castle\\") is a historic fort in Prague, Czech Republic, just over 3 km southeast of Prague Castle, on the east bank of the Vltava River.Granville Baker, From a Terrace in Prague, pg. 44, Echo Library (2008), It was probably built in the 10th century. Inside the fort are the Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul and the Vy≈°ehrad Cemetery, containing the remains of many famous Czechs, such as Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k, Bed≈ôich Smetana, Karel ƒåapek, and Alphonse Mucha. It also contains Prague's oldest Rotunda of St. Martin, from the 11th century. ==History== Local legend holds that Vy≈°ehrad was the location of the first settlement which later became Prague, though thus far this claim remains unsubstantiated. Coat of arms of Vy≈°ehrad from 19 century Legend has it that Duke Krok founded Vy≈°ehrad while looking for a safer seat than in Budeƒç. On a steep rock above the Vltava river, he ordered a forest to be cut down and a castle built there. Also according to legend, Prince K≈ôesomysl imprisoned the knight Horym√≠r at Vy≈°ehrad because he damaged silver mines, and Horym√≠r jumped with his horse ≈†em√≠k over the walls and from Libu≈°e's bath into the river. When the P≈ôemyslid dynasty settled on the current site of Prague Castle, the two castles maintained opposing spheres of influence for approximately two centuries. The zenith of Vy≈°ehrad was during the second half of the 11th century, when Vratislav II transferred his seat from Prague Castle to Vy≈°ehrad, and the original fort was remodeled as a complex comprising the sovereign's palatial residence, a church, and the seat of the chapter. The period of growth ended around 1140 when Prince Sobƒõslav moved his seat back to Prague Castle.Ehrenberger, Toma≈° The Most Beautiful 88 Castles, pg. 114, Kartografie Praha a.s., When Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV began to build the Prague Castle in its current dimensions in the early 14th century, the deteriorating Vy≈°ehrad was abandoned as a royal seat. Later the whole complex was renewed by Charles IV and new fortifications, with two gates and a royal palace were built, while the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul awaited repair. At the beginning of the Hussite Wars, the Hussites conquered and ransacked Vy≈°ehrad in 1420. The troops of King George of Podƒõbrady did the same in 1448. The castle was then abandoned and became ruined. It underwent a renovation in the 17th century, when the Habsburg Monarchy took over the Czech lands after the Thirty Years' War and remodeled it in 1654 as a Baroque fortress, turning it into a training center for the Austrian Army, and later incorporating it into the Baroque city walls. The present form of Vy≈°ehrad as a fortified residence, with powerful brick ramparts, bastions, and the T√°bor and Leopold gates, is a result of Baroque remodeling. The Ciheln√° br√°na (Brick gate) is an Empire- style structure, dating from 1841. The main part of the ≈†piƒçka Gate, parts of the Romanesque bridge, and the ruined Gothic lookout tower known as Libu≈°ina l√°ze≈à (Libu≈°e's Bath) are the only fragments that have been preserved from the Middle Ages. The Romanesque rotunda of St. Martin dates from the second half of the 11th century. The 11th century Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul, which dominates Vy≈°ehrad, was remodeled in the second half of the 14th century and again in 1885 and 1887 in neo-Gothic style. Vy≈°ehrad and the area around it became part of the capital city in 1883. The area is one of the cadastral districts of the city. By the twenty-first century, Vy≈°ehrad has become a public park that is a popular site for recreation and celebrations. For example, it is a popular place for Czechs to celebrate New Year's Eve.

Often a film or other media display is used. If the site has permit requirements or guided tours, the visitor center is often the place where these are coordinated. * A tourist information center, providing visitors to a location with information on the area's attractions, lodgings, maps, and other items relevant to tourism. Often, these centers are operated at the airport or other port of entry, by the local government or chamber of commerce. Often a visitor center is called simply an information center. * A corporate visitor center, provides visitors with an easily accessible window into the corporation. Visitor centers used to provide fairly basic information about the place, corporation or event they are celebrating, acting more as the entry way to a place. The role of the visitor center has been rapidly evolving over the past 10 years to become more of an experience and to tell the story of the place or brand it represents. Many have become destinations and experiences in their own right. ==Europe== Cultural and Tourist Information Center in Ducal Castle, Szczecin, Poland Texas Travel Information Center located near thumb thumb Visitor centre of the thumb ===United Kingdom=== In the United Kingdom, there is a nationwide network of Tourist Information Centres run by the British Tourist Authority (BTA), represented online by the VisitBritain website and public relations organisation. Other TICs are run by local authorities or through private organisations such as local shops in association with BTA. In England, VisitEngland promotes domestic tourism. In Wales, the Welsh Government supports TICs through Visit Wales. In Scotland, the Scottish Government supports VisitScotland, the official tourist organisation of Scotland, which also operates Tourist Information Centres across Scotland. ===Poland=== In Poland there are special offices and tables giving free information about tourist attractions. Offices are situated in interesting places in popular tourists' destinations and tables usually stay near monuments and important culture ==North America== In North America, a welcome center is a rest area with a visitor center, located after the entrance from one state or province to another state or province or in some cases another country, usually along an Interstate Highway or other freeway. These information centers are operated by the state they are located in. The first example opened on 4 May 1935, next to US 12 in New Buffalo, Michigan, near the Indiana state line. Many United States cities, such as Houston, Texashttp://visithoustontexas.org, retrieved 1 November 2016. and Boca Raton, Florida, as well as counties and other areas smaller than states, also operate welcome centers, though usually with less facilities than state centers have. In Ontario, there are 11 Ontario Travel Information Centres located along 400-series highways. ==South AmericaPeru=== Peru features Iper√∫, Tourist Information and Assistance, a free service that provides tourist information for domestic and foreign travelers, the information covers destinations, attractions, recommended routes and licensed tourism companies in Peru.

Delegated legislation is used for a wide variety of purposes such as fixing the date on which an Act of Parliament will come into force; setting fees for a public service; or establishing the details of an Act of Parliament. Delegated legislation is dependent on its parent act, which prescribes its parameters and procedures. Although a large volume of delegated legislation is written without close parliamentary scrutiny, there are statutory instruments to prevent its misuse. ==Background== Delegated legislation is derived from its parent act, which prescribes its parameters and procedures. Delegated legislation saves parliamentary time by considering matters of technical detail. Such details are prepared by those with relevant expert knowledge. Through its inherent flexibility, delegated legislation accommodates changing circumstances such as changing fees for public services, developments in science or minor changes in government policy. Delegated legislation, allows the rapid drafting of emergency powers. In comparison to Acts of Parliament, which may take much time to pass, the flexibility of delegated legislation can be used to solve problems of governance in a timely way. Delegated legislation is officiated by signature of the author or his authorized representative. In the case of the monarch, only her verbal assent is required. A statutory instrument related to the parent act is required to write delegated legislation. It ensures the legislation is catalogued and published by the Queen's Printer. Exceptions are directions and by-laws where notifications are made to affected entities. Criticism of delegated legislation may arise, firstly because it is subject to a lesser degree of parliamentary scrutiny than Acts of Parliament. Secondly, it may be used to remove from the scrutiny of the parliament matters that are causing difficulty for the government by designating them \\"matters concerning detail\\". Thirdly, within the large volume of delegated legislation there may be little public knowledge of changes being made. However, the statutory instruments are in place to prevent misuse. ==Types== Delegated legislation can take a variety of forms, each with different uses. The boundaries between the forms are not fixed. The types used will be determined by the wording of the Parent Act. * Orders in Council are made by the Queen on the advice of the Privy Council (the Government). Orders in Council are used in matters of constitutional significance. An example is bringing into force emergency powers to be exercised by Ministers. * Orders of Council are made by the Lords of the Privy Council. They are used for regulation of professional bodies and the higher education sector. * Ministerial orders are made by ministers. * Orders exercise executive powers of government ministers. An example is the dissolution of a public body. Commencement Orders set the date on which an Act, or part of an Act, comes into force. * Regulations set out how an Act is to be implemented and are usually made by Ministers. * Rules set out procedures for operation of a government entity such as the courts or the Patent Office. Rules may be made by ministers or, if specified in the parent Act, a senior judge. In Scotland, rules of court take the form of Scottish statutory instruments. Those regulating civil procedure are enacted by the Court of Session and are called Acts of Sederunt. Those regulating criminal procedure are enacted by the High Court of Justiciary as Acts of Adjournal. Acts of Adjournal can modify primary legislation, where it relates to criminal judicial procedure. * Schemes are made by commissions to proscribe how entities under their remit are governed. An example is the Charity Commission which supervises Charitable organizations. * Directions are a means by which ministers give legally binding instructions to a public body about the way it exercises its functions. * By-laws are laws of limited application (usually restricted to certain places) made by local authorities or certain other bodies (for example, train operating companies or the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty) to control the activities of the people in public spaces. ==Layout of official documents== A document which records delegated legislation will begin with a preamble. It describes the author of the legislation, the related parent Act and its preconditions and any stakeholders. The terms used in the document are determined by the type of delegated legislation it records. For instance, in orders, clauses are called \\"articles\\". Clauses may be grouped under headings and in complex delegated legislation, the document may be divided into parts. The main text is followed by any schedules and explanatory notes. ==Controls== Delegated legislation is controlled by parliament and the judiciary. Parliamentary controls include \\"affirmative resolution procedures\\" where the legislation requires approval in both houses of parliament and \\"negative resolution procedures\\" where the legislation may be vetoed by either house. By convention, the House of Lords will not veto but rather pass a motion to convey its concerns about the legislation. Judicial control of delegated legislation is exercised through judicial review. Delegated legislation can be quashed by a court if it is found to be ultra vires (outside the parameters defined in the parent Act). There are two types of ultra vires. In \\"substantive ultra vires\\", delegated legislation is deemed void because it goes beyond the powers defined in the parent Act. In \\"procedural ultra vires\\", delegated legislation is deemed void because of some procedural deficiency. A court may also quash delegated legislation on the basis of unreasonableness. ==See also== * Statutory Instrument Practice, 3rd edition (June 2003), Cabinet Office and Her Majesty‚Äôs Stationery Office * House of Commons Information Office Factsheet L7 - Statutory Instruments ==References== Category:Laws in the United Kingdom Category:United Kingdom administrative law ","title":"Delegated legislation in the United Kingdom"},{"id":"831775","text":"The Philadelphia History Museum at the Atwater Kent at 15 South 7th Street between Market and Ranstead Streets in Center City, Philadelphia was founded in 1938 to be Philadelphia's city history museum. The museum occupies architect John Haviland's landmark Greek Revival structure built in 1824‚Äì1826 for the Franklin Institute. The Museum operates as a city agency as part of Philadelphia's Department of Recreation. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 1, 1979. The Museum closed its doors in June 2018; its future is uncertain. ==Founding== The museum was established through the efforts of Philadelphia Mayor S. Davis Wilson, Frances Wistar, president of the Philadelphia Society for the Preservation of Landmarks, and A. Atwater Kent, radio pioneer and inventor. In 1938 Wilson and Wistar approached Kent to purchase the Franklin Institute building, which the Institute had vacated in 1933,, p.36 and create a history museum for the City of Philadelphia. They were joined in their efforts by the president of the University of Pennsylvania, the director of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, and the president of the Franklin Institute. Kent agreed, and purchased the building as a gift for the city with three conditions: It was to be dedicated to the history of Philadelphia; was to be named for Kent; and be open to the public free of charge.

A PostScript file that conforms to DSC is called a conforming document. The need for a structuring convention arises since PostScript is a Turing-complete programming language. There is thus no guaranteed method ‚Äî short of actually printing the document ‚Äî to do things like determining how many pages long a given document is or how large a given page is, or how to skip to a particular page. The addition of structure, with DSC comments exposing that structure, helps provide a way for, e.g., an intelligent print spooler to have the ability to rearrange the pages for printing, or for a page layout program to find the bounding box of a PostScript file used as a graphic image. Collectively, any such program that takes PostScript files as input data is called a document manager. In order for a PostScript print file to properly distill to PDF using Adobe tools, it should conform to basic DSC standards. Some DSC comments serve a second function, specifying a way to tell the document manager to do certain things, like inserting a font or other PostScript code (collectively called resources) into the file. DSC comments that serve this second function are more akin to preprocessing directives and are not purely comments. Documents using those kinds of DSC comments require a functioning document manager to come out as intended; sending them directly to a printer will not work. DSC is the basis for encapsulated PostScript; EPS files are conforming documents with further restrictions. The set of DSC comments can be expanded by a mechanism called the Open Structuring Conventions, which, together with the EPS specification, form the basis of early versions of the Adobe Illustrator Artwork file format. ==DSC at a glance== The basic premise of DSC is the separation of prolog (static definitions) and script (code that affects job-specific printed output), plus the disallowing of certain PostScript operators deemed inappropriate for page descriptions. This ensures a basic level of predictability in the PostScript code, thus forming the basis of document manageability. An optional, additional layer of document manageability is provided by separating the script into a document setup section, zero or more functionally independent pages, and an optional trailer (cleanup code). (‚ÄúZero pages‚Äù in DSC usually means ‚Äúone page without the use of the PostScript ‚Äòshowpage‚Äô operator.) The functional independence between pages, plus the disallowing of more PostScript operators in the pages section, form the basis for page independence, which allows pages to be reordered, and independently and randomly accessed. This imposed structure is then exposed by delimiting the PostScript file with DSC comments, which normally begin with two percent signs followed by a keyword. Some keywords need to be followed by a colon, an optional space character, and then a series of arguments. Finally, the document is marked as conforming by starting it with a comment starting with ‚Äú%!PS-Adobe-‚Äù followed by the DSC version number. Sections of reusable PostScript code can be modularized into procsets (procedure sets, corresponding to function libraries in other programming languages), in order to ease the generation of PostScript code. Procsets and other PostScript resources (for example, fonts) can be omitted from the PostScript file itself, and externally referenced by a directive-like DSC comment; such external referencing, however, can only work with a document manager that understands such DSC comments. DSC version 3.0 was released on September 25, 1992. The specification states, \\"Even though the DSC comments are a layer of communication beyond the PostScript language and do not affect the final output, their use is considered to be good PostScript language programming style.\\" Thus, most PostScript-producing programs output DSC- conformant comments along with the code, although some such programs do not actually produce conforming documents. ==Example== A DSC-conforming document (this one generated by dvips) might begin: %!PS-Adobe-2.0 %%Creator: dvips(k) 5.95a Copyright 2005 Radical Eye Software %%Title: texput.dvi %%Pages: 1 %%PageOrder: Ascend %%BoundingBox: 0 0 612 792 %%DocumentPaperSizes: Letter %%EndComments which has the following meaning: # marks the document as conforming to version 2.0 of the DSC # identifies the PostScript-producing program as dvips 5.95a # identifies the document title # tells the document manager that the document consists of one page # tells the document manager that pages are independent (i.e., not in Special ordering) and appear in ascending order in the document; in this example, since the document only consists of one page, this information is not usually relevant, but will be needed if additional pages are to be inserted by a document manager # tells the document manager the coordinates, measured in PostScript points, of the bounding box for all the pages taken together; 0 0 612 792 is the coordinates of a US Letter‚Äìsized page # tells the document manager what kind of paper sizes are used in the whole document; in this example only one size is used, namely the US Letter size # marks the end of the prolog == See also == *Adobe Systems *Encapsulated PostScript *PostScript ==References== *Adobe Technical Note 5001: PostScript Language Document Structuring Conventions Specification (PDF) ==External links== Category:PostScript ","title":"Document Structuring Conventions"},{"id":"831817","text":"The Lieber Code of April 24, 1863, also known as General Order No. 100,The Lieber Code can also be found in U.S. War Department, The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1899), Series III, 3, pp. 148‚Äì164. was an instruction signed by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln to the Union Forces of the United States during the American Civil War that dictated how soldiers should conduct themselves in wartime. Its name reflects its author, the German‚ÄìAmerican legal scholar and political philosopher Franz Lieber. ==Historical background== Lieber had fought for Prussia in the Napoleonic Wars and had been wounded at the Battle of Waterloo. He later lived and taught for two decades in South Carolina, where he was exposed to the horrors of slavery. Beginning in October 1861, as professor of history and political science on New York at what became Columbia University , Lieber delivered a series of lectures at its new Law School titled \\"The Laws and Usages of War\\". He believed the methods used in war needed to align with the goals and that the ends must justify the means. During the American Civil War, soldiers were faced with a number of ethical dilemmas. Lieber knew about some from his own European wartime experiences, as well as through his sons (two of whom fought for the Union, and another died fighting for the Confederacy near Williamsburg). While in St. Louis searching for one of his sons, who had been wounded at Fort Donelson, Lieber met Union General Henry Halleck, who had been a lawyer in civilian life and had published \\"International Law, or, Rules Regulating the Intercourse of States in Peace and War\\" in early 1861.Beard, Rick. The Lieber Codes New York Times, April 24, 2013. As the war dragged on, the treatment of spies, guerrilla warriors, and civilian sympathizers became especially troublesome. So too was the treatment of escaped slaves, who were forbidden to be returned to their owners by an order of March 13, 1862. After Halleck became general-in-chief in July, 1862, he solicited Lieber's views. The professor responded with a report, \\"Guerilla Parties Considered With Reference to the Laws and Usages of War\\", and Halleck ordered 5,000 copies printed. That same summer, Lieber advised Secretary of War Edwin Stanton concerning the \\"military use of colored persons\\". By year's end, Halleck and Stanton invited Lieber to Washington to revise the 1806 Articles of War. Other members of the revision committee included Major Generals Ethan Allen Hitchcock, George Cadwalader, and George L. Hartsuff, and Brigadier General John Henry Martindale, but essentially Lieber was left to draft instructions for Union soldiers facing these situations. Halleck edited them to ensure nothing conflicted with Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. Then Lincoln issued them in April, 1863. ==Main provisions== The main sections concerned martial law, military jurisdiction, and the treatment of spies, deserters, and prisoners of war. ===Ethical treatment=== The document insisted upon the humane, ethical treatment of populations in occupied areas. It was the first codified law that expressly forbade giving \\"no quarter\\" to the enemy (i.e. killing prisoners of war), except in such cases when the survival of the unit that held these prisoners was threatened. It forbade the use of poisons, stating that use of such puts any force who uses them entirely outside the pale of the civilized nations and peoples; it forbade the use of torture to extract confessions; it described the rights and duties of prisoners of war and of capturing forces. It described the state of war, the state of occupied territories, and the ends of war, and discusses permissible and impermissible means to attain those ends; it discussed the nature of states and sovereignties, and insurrections, rebellions, and wars. As such, it is widely considered to be the first written recital of the customary law of war, in force between the civilized nations and peoples since time immemorial, and the precursor to the Hague Regulations of 1907, the treaty-based restatement of the customary law of war. The Lieber Code also contained one of the first explicit prohibitions on rape. Paragraphs 44 and 47 of the Lieber Code contained provisions prohibiting several crimes including '(...) all rape (...) by an American soldier in a hostile country against its inhabitants (...) under the penalty of death, or such other severe punishment as may seem adequate for the gravity of the offense.' Thus, the only enforcement mechanisms were the military commanders themselves, having the right to execute the soldiers immediately. ===Slavery and black prisoners of war=== The Lieber Code was which the Confederacy insisted was in violation of the customary rules of warfare. Moreover, Confederate officials such as Jefferson Davis had announced that the Confederacy would treat black Union soldiers as criminals, not as soldiers, subject to execution or re-enslavement upon capture. The Lieber Code defended the lawfulness of Emancipation under the laws of war and insisted that those same laws prohibited discrimination on the basis of color among combatants. One recent author says that the Code's association with Emancipation and the problem of black Union soldiers was so close that it ought to be called not Lieber's Code but Lincoln's Code since it was part and parcel of the most important decision of Lincoln's presidency. ===Sterner measures=== Both the Lieber Code and the Hague Convention of 1907, which took much of the Lieber Code and wrote it into the international treaty law, included practices that would be considered illegal or extremely questionable by today's standards. In the event of the violation of the laws of war by an enemy, the Code permitted reprisal (by musketry) against the enemy's recently captured POWs; it permitted the summary execution (by musketry) of spies, saboteurs, francs-tireurs, and guerrilla forces, if caught in the act of carrying out their missions. (These allowable practices were later abolished by the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions of 1949, following World War II, which saw these practices in the hands of totalitarian states used as the rule rather than the exception to such.) Such terms reflected Lieber's deep interest in the ideas of Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz. They also arose out of one of the Code's central aims, which was not merely to limit the war, but to legitimate its expansion in the move to Emancipation and a more aggressive war effort.See Witt, Lincoln's Code, ch. 6‚Äì8. However, the code envisioned a reciprocal relationship between the population and the Army. As long as the population did not resist military authority, it was to be treated well. Should the inhabitants violate this compact by taking up arms and supporting guerrilla movements, then they were open to sterner measures. Among these were the imposition of fines, the confiscation and/or destruction of property, the imprisonment and/or expulsion of civilians who aided guerrillas, the relocation of populations, the taking of hostages, and the possible execution of guerrillas who failed to abide by the laws of war. It authorized the shooting on sight of all persons not in uniform acting as soldiers and those committing, or seeking to commit, sabotage. Part of the Code follows: ==LegacyIn the Civil War=== Historians have often dismissed the role of the Code in the war effort. While it is true that commanders such as William Tecumseh Sherman rarely, if ever, consulted the Code in making combat decisions, the Code played a significant role nonetheless in the war's last two years. It provided a blueprint for hundreds of war crimes trials (i.e., charging people for violations of the laws and customs of war). Also, its provisions on black soldiers bolstered the Union's unpopular decision to cease prisoner exchanges so long as the South refused to exchange black prisoners on equal terms with white ones. ===In international law=== Participants in the international Hague Peace Conferences used Lieber's text as the basis for negotiations which resulted in the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. These two international agreements set forth laws of land and naval warfare. Subsequently, during World War I and World War II, many of these laws were broken. Following World War II, jurists at the Nuremberg Trials and the Tokyo Trials ruled that by 1939 the rules for armed conflicts, particularly those concerning belligerent and neutral nationals, had been recognized by all civilized nations and thus could apply to officials even of countries that never signed the Hague Conventions. Some features of the Lieber Code are still evident in the Geneva Conventions of 1949. ===Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War=== An abridged version of the Lieber Code was published in 1899 in The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies.United States. War Department. The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies. Series 2. 5. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1899, pp. 671‚Äì682. Lieber's son, Guido Norman Lieber, was Judge Advocate General of the Army from 1895 until 1901, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. The Lieber Code therefore was used extensively during this period when considering and litigating actions by American forces against the native population and Philippine revolutionaries (e.g., J. Franklin Bell and Littleton Waller). === U.S. Law of War Manual=== In 2015, the United States Department of Defense published its Law of War Manual. It was updated and revised in May 2016. or via U.S. Department of Defense The Manual explicitly refers to the Lieber Code, and the Lieber Code's influence on the Law of War Manual is apparent throughout. ==See also== *Command responsibility *International criminal law ==References== ==External links== *The full text of the Lieber Code *The full text of the Lieber Code at the Yale Avalon Project *Text of the Law of War Manual alternate link Category:American Civil War documents Category:Laws of war Category:Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War Category:General orders Category:United States military law Category:Legal history of the United States Category:1863 documents Category:Codes of conduct ","title":"Lieber Code"},{"id":"831879","text":"Benjamin Foster (born 1968), also known as Ben Weasel, is an American songwriter, singer, and guitarist. He is best known as the lead singer and guitarist of the punk rock band Screeching Weasel. ==Early life== Foster was born in 1968, and was raised in Prospect Heights, Illinois. He attended River Trails Middle School in Mount Prospect, Illinois where he first met future Screeching Weasel co-founder John Pierson. Weasel was expelled from John Hersey High School and St. Viator High School. He was eventually sent to the √âlan School in Poland, Maine for his behavior issues. ==CareerScreeching Weasel=== When Foster returned to Illinois from the √âlan School, he got a job at a local movie theater, and formed the band Screeching Weasel with co-worker and former junior high classmate John Pierson, aka Jughead. Screeching Weasel have released 13 studio albums: Screeching Weasel (1987), Boogadaboogadaboogada! (1988), My Brain Hurts (1991), Ramones (1992), Wiggle (1993), Anthem for a New Tomorrow (1993), How to Make Enemies and Irritate People (1994), Bark Like a Dog (1996), Television City Dream (1998), Emo (1999), Teen Punks In Heat (2000), and First World Manifesto (2011) On May 26, 2015, Screeching Weasel a released a rock opera entitled Baby Fat: Act 1 on Recess Records. ===The Riverdales and The Vindictives=== After an initial break-up in 1989, Screeching Weasel reformed in 1991 and broke up for a second time in 1994. Following the second breakup, Foster formed a new band, The Riverdales, with Screeching Weasel members Dan Vapid, and Dan Panic. In the early 1990s, Foster founded The Gore Gore Girls (unrelated to the later band of the same name) with SW guitarist Jughead, Glynis Johnson (also of Red Red Meat) and Russ Forester (founder of Underdog Records). The Gore Gore Girls lasted only three shows and made an appearance on a compilation EP, Mouthful of Monkey Bile (1992). He also played 2nd guitar in The Vindictives, to be replaced by Billy Blastoff. Foster appeared on the first 4 EPs released by the band. In 1996, Lookout! Records released a 7\\" EP by The Shotdowns which included Foster, Jughead, and rock critic Jim DeRogatis. Foster was credited as \\"Pappy Le Pew\\". Foster reunited with Screeching Weasel again in 1996. The band lasted until 2001 before breaking up again. On March 27, 2009, Foster announced he was reforming Screeching Weasel. He and Danny Vapid were the only returning members. ===Solo albums=== In 2002, Foster released his first solo album, Fidatevi. His second album, These Ones Are Bitter, was released in June 2007. A live album (featuring all Screeching Weasel songs, including the majority of the album My Brain Hurts), titled \\"The Brain That Wouldn't Die\\", appeared in 2009 and featured Screeching Weasel member Danny Vapid. As well as Jon Phillip. ===Panic Button records=== Foster formed Chicago-based record label, Panic Button Records, in 1997 with Pierson. The label was later purchased by Lookout! Records. ===Writing=== In the early 1990s, Foster published the fanzine Panic Button. He published two chapbooks through Oyster Publications, Brady Bunch Behemoth (1991) and Stab! Stab! Stab! (1992). Weasel also wrote for other various zines, including Razorcake, Non-Stop Banter, Jersey Beat, Hit List and 10 Things Jesus Wants You To Know. He also had a long-running column in MAXIMUM ROCKNROLL, one of the most prominent punk rock fanzines. He wrote a novel in 2001 called Like Hell and put out a collection of his columns and articles in 2002 entitled Punk is a Four Letter Word. Both books were published by Hope and Nonthings, a small publishing house based in Chicago run by former bandmate John Jughead. ===Weasel Radio=== Foster co- hosted a weekly radio show with Owen Murphy called Weasel Radio which premiered on ESPN 1070. Weasel Radio eventually became a podcast and its last episode was released on May 5, 2016. Foster appeared on Ken Reid's TV Guidance Counselor Podcast on September 11, 2015. He was a guest host on Dying Scene Radio episode 017. ==SXSW Incident== On Friday, March 18, 2011 at Austin, TX's SXSW Festival, Foster was involved in an altercation with two women during a Screeching Weasel performance. The first woman threw ice cubes at Foster. Upon being hit with more ice Foster found an unruly woman was the source of the ice. Foster originally stated he \\"can't kick a girl's ass\\" and offered money for another woman to handle the attacker. As the ice and spitting continued Foster threatened to beat the woman up himself. The woman then threw beer at Foster, who responded by attacking her. A club owner, also female, then came on stage and grabbed Foster. He pushed her and punched her before being pulled to the other side of the stage by a bouncer. On March 20, Foster posted an apology on his website BenWeasel.com stating Following the incident, several bands who were slated to appear at Weasel Fest in Chicago dropped out, including Chinese Telephones, Chixdiggit, The Soviettes, Teenage Bottlerocket and Kepi Ghoulie. On March 23, 2011 the other four members of Screeching Weasel all resigned from the band citing the SXSW incident as the reason. On March 31 it was announced that the entire Weasel Fest had been cancelled. In August, Weasel issued a full article on Screeching Weasel's website describing his whole point of view on the situation. ==Personal life== On November 30, 2010, Foster appeared on Last Call with Carson Daly and revealed that he suffers from anxiety, panic attacks, and bouts of agoraphobia. Foster lives with his wife and 3 children in Madison, Wisconsin. He used to be a Buddhist but then became Catholic. ==DiscographyWith Screeching Weasel=== * Screeching Weasel (1987) * Boogadaboogadaboogada!

Volo was a too-curious-for-his-own-good travelling scholar and minor wizard. Always on the lookout for an expos√©, he all too frequently was at odds with Elminster, who preferred some things to be kept in the dark. In fact, it was his assembling his \\"first\\" guide‚ÄîVolo's Guide to All Things Magical‚Äîthat put him on the \\"path\\" to making his other guides. As for Elminster, it is he who edits every guide that Volo has published, as evident in the many footnotes in each, including Volo's Guide to All Things Magical, which almost got Volo killed making it. \\"Volo\\" is not to be confused with \\"Marcus Volo\\", real name Marcus Wands, of the Wands family of Waterdeep. A trouble-making bard, Wands gained Volothamp's moniker after he stole an artifact from a powerful wizard, and laid the blame on the far more infamous scapegoat of the real Volo. Pursued by the mad mage and his forces, and protected by adventurers hired by his father, Marco came into his own at the finale, when the artifact was revealed as containing a god from another world, who had come to Toril along with Marco's family. The Sunstaffs, as they were known then, had through the generations been destined to keep the god imprisoned, and Marco awakened to his destiny with the help of the adventurers, Volothamp himself, and the gods Tyr, Sune, and Corellon Larethian. He has also had several adventures of his own, as told in Once Around the Realms and The Mage in the Iron Mask. ==Reception== Trenton Webb, writing for the British magazine Arcane, thought of Volo as \\"a sort of magically empowered Magenta DeVine\\". Paul Pettengale, also writing for Arcane, described him as \\"a famous AD&D; adventurer who, in an effort to help adventurers in Faer√ªn, has written a number of guides to regions within the Realms. He's one of those characters that everyone's heard about, and one that just about every Dungeon Master must have been tempted to introduce to their campaign at some point or another.\\" Cameron Kunzelman for Paste wrote \\"imagine that Ken Jennings was a drunk, really cared about being able to name all the animals of the zoo, and was the sole grantor of Michelin stars across the world. That's Volo. [...] As a character, Volo is brilliant because he is a device through which the designers of the Forgotten Realms can give Dungeon Masters a set of bounds.[...] That 'thinks he knows' is crucial, because having Volo write the guide means that he can be wrong. From a design perspective, Volo is a way of giving DMs a toolbox that they don‚Äôt have to be completely adherent to. Whatever Volo thinks or writes can be slightly off the mark. Maybe he only saw a tavern during the daytime. Maybe he cut some corners. Nesting world design within the subjective opinions of an expansive, world-trotting character with a penchant for embellishment solves a lot of problems and generally makes the job of being a DM a little more fun\\". ==Appearances in other media== Volo makes minor appearances in the computer games Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal, where he appears in taverns near the beginning of each game. In Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal he informs the player that he is writing a novel chronicling the events of the games and will give the player previews of how he intends to describe your companions in the game. The printed manual for Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II itself also contains annotations supposedly written by Volo (and also by Elminster). He is also a major character in Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir where he acts as narrator and features prominently in the plot itself. He is responsible for inviting the player's party aboard the ship that you begin the game aboard. The opening and closing sequences are presented in such a way as to imply that the game is one of his books. He also appears in Baldur's Gate 3. ==References== Category:Fictional arcane spellcasters (Dungeons & Dragons) Category:Forgotten Realms characters ","title":"Volothamp Geddarm"},{"id":"831917","text":"FSC may refer to: ==Education== * Farmingdale State College, a college in New York, United States * Fitchburg State College, now Fitchburg State University, in Massachusetts, United States * Film Study Center at Harvard University * Florida Southern College, in Lakeland, Florida, United States * Florida State College at Jacksonville, a college in Florida, United States * Florida Sun Conference, an American college athletic conference * Forest School Camps, a British camping organisation * Framingham State College, a college in Massachusetts, United States * Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools (Latin: '), a Roman Catholic religious teaching order * Yale Film Study Center == Finance == * Financial Services Commission (disambiguation) * Financial Supervision Commission, Isle of Man * Financial Supervisory Commission (Republic of China) * Foreign Sales Corporation, a repealed tax device of the United States Internal Revenue Code == Governmental and politics == * Catalan Federation of the PSOE, a defunct political party in Catalonia, Spain * Federal Salary Council, an advisory body of the United States federal government * Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan * Texas Forensic Science Commission, a state agency of Texas, United States == Industry == *Fabryka Samochod√≥w Ciƒô≈ºarowych, a Polish automotive company * Fiji Sugar Corporation, a Fiji government-owned sugar milling company *Fujitsu Siemens Computers, a Japanese and German IT supply chain *Future Supply Chains, an Indian logistics and supply chain company ==Other organisations== * Les Scouts - F√©d√©ration des Scouts Baden-Powell de Belgique (FSC, Catholic Baden-Powell-Scout Federation of Belgium) * Field Studies Council, a British environmental education charity * Filipino Society of Cinematographers * First Satanic Church, an organization dedicated to Satanism and the occult * Forest Stewardship Council, an international environmental organization * Free Speech Coalition, a trade association for the adult film and pornography industry * Fountain Street Church, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States ==Other uses== * Figari Sud- Corse Airport, in Corsica, France * Fine-structure constant * Fire safe cigarette * Foo Swee Chin (born 1977), Singaporean comic book artist * Football South Coast, in New South Wales, Australia * Fourier shell correlation * Funvic Soul Cycles‚ÄìCarrefour, a Brazilian cycling team * Future Surface Combatant of the Royal Navy ","title":"FSC"},{"id":"831919","text":"Kisan Mazdoor Bahujan Party (Peasants and Workers Majority Party) was a splinter group of the Jantantrik Bahujan Samaj Party in India.

The origins of the policy can be traced to a Reichstag debate on 6 December 1897 during which German Foreign Secretary Bernhard von B√ºlow stated, \\"in one word: We wish to throw no one into the shade, but we also demand our own place in the sun.\\" (\\"Mit einem Worte: wir wollen niemand in den Schatten stellen, aber wir verlangen auch unseren Platz an der Sonne.\\")F√ºrst B√ºlows Reden nebst urkundlichen Beitr√§gen zu seiner Politik. Mit Erlaubnis des Reichskanzlers gesammelt und herausgegeben von Johannes Penzler. I. Band 1897‚Äì1903. Berlin: Georg Reimer, 1907. p. 6-8 Original text on German Wikisource Nancy Mitchell says that the creation of Weltpolitik was a change in the appliance of German foreign policy. Up until Wilhelm's dismissal of Bismarck, Germany had concentrated its efforts on stopping the possibility of a two-front war in Europe. Prior to Weltpolitik, there was a greater focus on using its army and subtle diplomacy to maintain its status. In particular, Bismarck had initially been wary of acquiring overseas colonies and wished to reserve the role of Germany as an \\"honest broker\\" in continental affairs, though the 1884/85 Congress of Berlin had revealed the limits of his mediation political viewpoint. However, despite Bismarck's initial scepticism, the foundations of the German colonial empire were already laid during his tenure from 1884 onwards, when the government began to place the privately acquired properties of colonisers like Adolf L√ºderitz, Adolph Woermann, Carl Peters and Clemens Denhardt under the protection of the German Reich, necessitating costly action such as in the 1888 Abushiri revolt. According to the German historian Hans- Ulrich Wehler, German colonial policy in the 1880s was an example of a \\"pragmatic\\" social imperialism, a device that allowed the government to distract public attention from domestic problems and preserve the existing social and political order.Eley, Geoff \\"Social Imperialism\\" pages 925-926 from Modern Germany Volume 2 New York, Garland Publishing, 1998 page 925. Under Weltpolitik, despite a two-front war still being at the forefront of Germany's concerns as proven through the Schlieffen Plan, Kaiser Wilhelm II was far more ambitious. Colonial policies officially became a matter of national prestige, promoted by pressure groups like the Pan-German League; in the ongoing Scramble for Africa, Germany was a latecomer and must stand firm to catch up. However, only relatively small acquisitions were made, such as Kiautschou Bay and Neukamerun, whereas Wilhelm's support for a policy of colonization was shown in his Kruger telegram in 1896 and response to the Venezuelan crisis of 1902‚Äì03; Wilhelm's social darwinist attitude was similarly reflected in the Herero and Namaqua genocide from 1904 onwards and the suppression of the Maji Maji Rebellion from 1907, as well as in the First and Second Moroccan Crisis of 1905 and 1911. The Anglo-German naval arms race was likely lost when Germany failed to keep up with the British after the advent of dreadnought battleships from 1906 onwards; with the Anglo-Russian Convention and the Triple Entente of 1907, German Weltpolitik showed itself unable to forestall the threat of a two-front war. The policy's ultimate failure would be sealed in the First World War. == References == ==Further reading== * Carroll, E. Malcolm.

On classic Psion PDAs such as the Series 3, 5/5mx, Series 7, and netBook/netPad, as well as the MC218, OPL is part of the standard application suite. OPL is also included in Psion Teklogix industrial handhelds such as the Workabout mx. OPL is an interpreted language similar to BASIC. A fully Visual Basic-compatible language OVAL has been also developed. ==History== The language was originally called Organiser Programming Language, developed by Psion Ltd for the Psion Organiser. Designed by Colly Myers with the first iteration implemented by Richard Harrison and Martin Stamp. The first implementation (without graphics) was for the original Psion Organiser (now referred to as the Psion Organiser I, 1984), and it came bundled with the Science, Finance and Math data packs. It became truly accessible as built-in software in the Psion Organiser II (1986), and the language went on to be used in the Psion Series 3 and later. After Psion retired from the portable digital assistant market, the project was delayed until 2003, when the fledgling Symbian Developer Program released it as open source. The language is now developed on SourceForge in the opl-dev project. The language is not available from Symbian OS v8 and later, mainly due to lack of interest and support from major Symbian licencees Nokia and Sony Ericsson. Hence, OPL will most likely never be made available for the newer generation of Symbian OS phones such as Sony Ericsson P990, M600, W950, P1i and Nokia E61i and E90. As of 2010, Nokia device developers are encouraged to use Python for S60 instead (See Python for S60). ==Examples== Here is the console version of a Hello world program: PROC main: PRINT \\"Hello World!\\" PAUSE 40 ENDP (Source code taken from the PCDevPrimer in the OPL Wiki.) And here is a GUI version for Nokia's Series 80 user interface: CONST KKeyEnter%=13 PROC hello: dINIT \\"Hello\\" dTEXT \\"\\",\\"Hello World!\\" dBUTTONS \\"OK\\",KKeyEnter% DIALOG ENDP OPL is a structured programming language. OPL programs contain PROCedures, which are much like functions in other programming languages. * The dINIT keyword in this example initializes a dialog box (intuitively enough, all dialog-box related functions begin with a letter 'd'; for clarity, this letter is in lower case, but the language is case independent). The first argument of the dialog is an optional string, which is used for the title of the dialog, displayed in the title bar. * The dTEXT function displays text, with two compulsory arguments: a left-aligned 'prompt' string, and a main string. * The dBUTTONS keyword allows you to put buttons on the dialog box - here there is a button with the text \\"OK\\". The second argument to each button is both the special notation of the shortcut key for that button and the dialog's return code, in this case the \\"Enter\\" key. * Finally, the DIALOG keyword is required for the previously initialized dialog box to be shown on the screen. ===Testing dialog responses=== An example: PROC test: dINIT \\"Your Challenge\\" dTEXT \\"\\",\\"Will your answer to this question be no?\\" dBUTTONS \\"Yes\\",%y,\\"No\\",%n IF DIALOG=%y PRINT \\"No it wasn't!\\" ELSE PRINT \\"Yes it was!\\" ENDIF GET ENDP In this cruel interrogative program, the Yes button is assigned the shortcut of Ctrl+y, while No has Ctrl+n, represented by %y and %n respectively. The user's input from the DIALOG is tested in the IF statement, PRINTing appropriate responses to the screen. Note that the 'GET' keyword, which gets user input without using a dialog box, is here used simply to wait for a keypress before terminating the program (otherwise it would end immediately without giving time for the user to read the text). The output from DIALOG can also be stored in a variable. Variables specific to a procedure must be declared with the LOCAL keyword; global variables are defined with the GLOBAL keyword. ===Variable types=== The table below uses an example variable called 'var'. { border=\\"1px\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"font-size: 85%; border: gray solid 1px; text-align: center;\\" ----- ! Data Type ! Syntax -----  Floating Point  var -----  Integer  var% -----  Long Integer  var& -----  String  var$(length) } ==Minutiae== OPL interfaced with advanced Psion Series 3 features by means of operating system CALLs, but in the later Psion Series 5mx this was changed to a so-called 'OPX' library, stored in the system ROM (the Z drive). 'OPX' libraries were also made available for the Nokia 9210, Nokia 9300 and Nokia 9500 Communicators, adding OPXs routines for handling SMS and managing Bluetooth communication. Other OPL features include those with a letter 'g' at the beginning, for graphical functions; those with a letter 'm', for menus; and those with a letter 'd', for dialogs. ==See also== *History of Symbian *Psion Organiser ==External links== *The opl-dev project *OPL wiki on Internet Archive containing documents detailing OPL keywords, OPX interfaces and much other information *OPL Blog by Symbian, now dead, but old versions are available from the Internet Archive *Russian site about OPL *OPL programming tutorial Category:Embedded systems Category:Free mobile software Category:Symbian OS Category:Procedural programming languages ","title":"Open Programming Language"},{"id":"832034","text":"The Air Force Distinguished Service Medal was created by an act of the United States Congress on July 6, 1960. The medal was intended as a new decoration of the United States Air Force to replace the policy of awarding the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Air Force personnel.Air Force Personnel Center Air Force Distinguished Service Medal The Air Force Distinguished Medal was first awarded in 1965. From 1947 to 1965 members of the U.S. Air Force who received the Distinguished Service Medal received the Distinguished Service Medal of the Army design. The Air Force Distinguished Service Medal is awarded to any member of the United States Air Force who has distinguished himself or herself by exceptionally meritorious service to the United States Government in a duty of great responsibility. The interpretation of the phrase \\"great responsibility\\" means that this medal is generally awarded only to officers who hold at least the rank of Major General. However, as is customary for most military decorations, the requirements for the Distinguished Service Medal are interpreted more liberally when awarded upon retirement. As a result, it is the typical decoration for a retiring Brigadier General, and in recent years it has also been awarded to the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force upon retirement. Cases of the award of this decoration to an individual who was not a general officer, or the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, are unusual. The medal is typically awarded to senior Air Force generals. Two notable exceptions are astronauts Buzz Aldrin who was awarded this decoration even though he retired as a colonel and Colonel David Scott (who flew on Gemini 8, Apollo 9, and Apollo 15) who was awarded the medal twice. Recipients during the medal's first 6 years included General Emmett E. \\"Rosie\\" O'Donnell, Jr. (a United States Air Force four-star general who served as Commander in Chief, Pacific Air Forces from 1959 to 1963). O'Donnell also led the first B-29 Superfortress attack upon Tokyo during World War II after the 1942 Doolittle Raid. Another early recipient of the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal was Major General Osmond J. Ritland, USAF, who received his medal on November 30, 1965, upon his retirement. Additional awards are denoted with oak leaf clusters. This award is comparable to the Department of the Air Force Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service given to civilian employees of the Department of the Air Force. ==Notable recipients== *General of the Army and General of the Air Force Henry H.

This fragmentation of political power was in part due to the peculiar parliamentary system of the Weimar Republic, and in part due to the many challenges facing German democracy in this period. ==Weimar political partiesLeft-wing=== *Kommunistische Arbeiter-Partei Deutschlands (KAPD) -- Was an ultraleftist party that split from the KPD in 1920. They rejected participation in the Parliament and called for immediate revolutionary action. Immediately after its formation the party endured a series of splinters and lost much of the little influence it had. *Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (KPD) -- Formed out of a number of left- wing groups, including the left wing of the USPD and the Spartacist League. It was a Marxist-Leninist party that advocated revolution by the proletariat and the creation of a communist regime according to the example of the Soviet Union. The party's major paper was the Die Rote Fahne (The Red Flag). (Against the government) *Vereinigte Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (VKPD) (Against the government) *Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (Opposition) (KPO) -- Split from the KPD in 1928, representing the \\"Right Opposition\\" of the Bukharinist against the Stalinist \\"Center\\" and the Trotskyist \\"Left Opposition\\". It never intended to be a real political party, but to influence the KPD. *Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (USPD) --, \\"Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany\\" - left wing faction that had split from the SPD in 1917. Parts of it split off, forming the Communist Party, while the majority reunited with the MSPD in 1922. It was a Marxist party that sought change through parliament and social progressive programs. (later splinter party) (Against the government) *Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands (SAPD) --, \\"Socialist Workers' Party of Germany\\" - left wing faction that had split from the SPD in 1931. Parts of the USPD and dissenters from the KPD and the KPO joined it, but it remained small. Its political positions were near to those of the USPD, wavering between the SPD and the KPD. (splinter party). *Sozialistischer Bund (splinter party). *Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD) -- (between 1917 and 1922 also called Mehrheitssozialdemokratische Partei (MSPD) - Majority Social Democrats); they supported the parliamentary system of democracy, and extensive social programs in the economy.

Its precursor, the German Workers' Party (Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920.It supported the ideas of Volksgemeinschaft, Pan-Germanism, Lebensraum and the 'Aryan Master Race.' And the party incorporated fervent antisemitism, anti-communism, anti-capitalism, scientific racism, and the use of eugenics into its creed. Headed by Adolf Hitler from 1921, the Nazi Party grew to be the largest political party in Germany by 1933. *Deutscher Volksverein -- the German People's League was started in 1881 by Max Liebermann von Sonnenberg, a former officer, and Bernhard F√∂rster, Nietzsche's brother in law. *Deutsches Landvolk. Cover name for the Christian National Peasant/Rural Party in the 1930 Reichstag elections. *Deutschsozialistische Partei (DSP) -- The German-Socialist Party.

In a controversial move, it dissolved itself in 1922 and many of its members entered the (then very new) Nazi Party. (Against the government) *Gro√üdeutsche Arbeiterpartei (GDAP) (Against the government) *National Bolsheviks -- Led by Ernst Niekisch, they combined ultranationalism with social radicalism by claiming to espouse both 'German' principles and much of the programme carried out by the Bolsheviks under Lenin. ===Other political organizations=== * League of Agrarians (Bund der Landwirte). It took the name Reichslandbund (RLB) after 1920. *Allgemeiner Deutscher Beamtenbund (ADB) a civil servants league started by the SPD. *Bavarian Peasants' League (Peasant League) operated throughout Germany but especially in its stronghold of Bavaria. It had democratic, anticlerical leanings and subscribed to a narrow Bavarian particularism *Bauernvereine.

SPD organized. (Pro-Weimar Republic) *Deutschnationaler Handlungsgehilfenverband (DHV) (National Association of Commercial Employees.) -- the conservative white collar worker union. The DHV leadership did not fully support the NSDAP because it didn't recognize the independence of unions. (Against the government) *Gesamtverband Deutscher Beamtengewerkschaften (GDB) was a conservative civil service union. *Gewerkschaftsbund der Angestellten (GdA) was a Hirsch-Duncker union. *Gewerkschaftsbund deutscher Angestelltenverb√§nde (Gedag) Conservative white- collar union *Reichsbund Deutscher Angestellten-Berufsverb√§nde Conservative white-collar union. *Vereinigung der chrislichen-deutschen Bauernvereine (Association of Christian-German Peasant Unions). *Zentralverband der Angestellten (ZdA), an association of white-collar unions started by the SPD.

The user can hop around on the toy, using the elastic properties of the ball to move forward. The term \\"space hopper\\" is more common in the United Kingdom; the toy is less familiar in the United States, and may be known as a \\"hoppity hop\\", \\"hippity hop\\" or a \\"sit n bounce\\". A similar toy popular in the United States in the 1980s was the pogo ball, which has a hard plastic ring encircling the ball instead of a handle. ==Use== The space hopper is a heavy rubber balloon about in diameter, with two rubber handles protruding from the top. A valve at the top allows the balloon to be inflated by a bicycle pump or car tire pump. A child can sit on top, holding the two handles, and bounce up and down until the balloon leaves the ground. By leaning, the driver can make the balloon bounce in a particular direction. In practical terms, this is a very inefficient form of locomotion, but its simplicity, ease of use, low cost and cheerful appearance appeal to children. ==History== Sun's Hoppity Horse, from The Children‚Äôs Museum of Indianapolis collection The space hopper was invented by Aquilino Cosani of Ledragomma, an Italian company that manufactured toy rubber balls. He patented the idea in Italy in 1968, and in the United States in 1971. Cosani called the toy \\"Pon-Pon\\". Space hoppers were introduced to the United Kingdom in 1969. The Cambridge Evening News newspaper, England, contained an advertisement for the hopper in November of that year and described it as a trend. The space hopper became a major craze for several years, and remained widely popular through the 1980s. They are sometimes considered a symbol of the 1970s. The original space hopper of the United Kingdom was manufactured by Mettoy (Mettoy-Corgi). Wembley made a similar model which had smooth handles rather than the ribbed original. The orange kangaroo design is now available in adult sized versions in the United Kingdom. In the United States, the first mass- marketed hopping ball (a version of an earlier European toy) was the Hoppity Hop, released by the Sun company around 1968. Because of the market and media saturation by this toy, any such ball regardless of origin, is now generally known in the United States by that name (or sometimes \\"hippity hop\\" as it was originally called in the United States). The earliest Hoppity Hops were made of rubber (usually red or blue) with a round ring handle on top and automotive tire valve for inflation. In the 1970s Sun introduced various character versions of the Hoppity Hop, such as the Hoppity Horse, Disney's Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck (with hard plastic versions of the character's head attached to the ball). The Hoppity Hop sold rather steadily for decades, but by the 1990s sales apparently started to slip due to increased competition from foreign hoppers. At some point, the Hoppity Hop came to be made of a vinyl like material, some molded in fluorescent colors. The Hoppity Hop now appears to have been discontinued, but the original ‚Äì sometimes still in the box ‚Äì comes up from time to time on online auction sites. According to advertising materials, the Hoppity Hop's original targets were both adults and children. Since the balls only inflated to around , however, it is doubtful that any but the shortest adults could have gotten much use out of one. Today, numerous versions can be found in most stores, ranging anywhere from . Many are manufactured in China. The European \\"Hop!\\" balls appeared in the beginning of the 1990s and are still available. Made by Italy's Ledragomma/Ledraplastic, these are essentially the quality exercise ball with a handle attached. The sizes of these balls range from the \\"Hop! 45\\" to the \\"Hop! 66\\" (66 cm, about 26 in). While it is still used for fun and exercise by many adults, the Hop! 66 is still borderline child sized. The demand for truly adult proportioned hopping balls was met with two notable items. The first of these was Kitt 2000 Velp, of the Netherlands Mega Skippyballs, a large hopping ball which by virtue of its size was intended only for adult use. There were three sizes: , and . The Mega Skippyballs are made of extra-strong vinyl, and in the Netherlands there are various Skippyball races and Skippyball championships. ==Popular culture== The British animated sketch show Monkey Dust features the recurring character Ivan 'The Meat-Safe Murderer' Dobsky, a man imprisoned in 1974 for a crime he didn't commit, being finally released in every episode with no possessions other than a variety of 1970s clothing and a space hopper called Mr. Hoppy. Mr. Hoppy is eventually revealed to be both sentient and responsible for the Meat-Safe Murders himself (as well as the murder of Dobsky's wife of several hours). The humorous science fiction novel and audio book Kangazang features space hoppers (referred to as 'Hoppas') who are depicted as an alien race living on the planet Profania Alpha. The space hopper character of Pon-Pon is instrumental in helping the two main characters save the universe. Space hoppers can be seen being used in the background of one scene in Episode 59 of Star Trek: The Original Series, \\"And the Children Shall Lead\\". Episode 12, season 2 (production number 19) of the popular British comedy from the 1970s The Goodies was mostly related to space hoppers. The plot of the episode (called \\"Charity Bounce\\") involved a charity bounce on space hoppers from London to Brighton. The space hopper lent its name and face to the Birmingham psychedelic trance parties that ran from the mid 1990s to 2000, and also appeared at the Glastonbury festival. In a Season 7 episode of Friends, \\"The One Where They All Turn Thirty\\", Phoebe bounced for one mile on a Hippity Hop, this being on a list she had made of things to do before turning 30. In Doctor Who Series 3, Episode 11 \\"Utopia\\", the Tenth Doctor refers to Captain Jack's Vortex Manipulator as a space hopper in contrast to his TARDIS, which he calls a sports car. The pornographic parody film Bat Pussy (1973) features the titular character using a space hopper for transportation. A character named Space Hopper, which resembles a toy space hopper, appears in Ian Stewart's book Flatterland. In The Comic Strip Presents post-apocalyptic / cyberpunk episode Slags (1984), the horns and part of a cut-up space hopper is used as a hood by one of the characters. In the British crime drama \\"Endeavour_(TV_series)\\", episode \\"Apollo\\" (2019), a child is seen bouncing on a Space Hopper in a scene contemporaneous with the 1969 Apollo mission, consistent with the toy's 1968/1969 release in the U.K. In 2018 the British eccentric Steven Payne completed the first crossing of the Alps by spacehopper from Bardoneccia in Italy to Grenoble in France, a world record journey of 122km (75 miles) which took 19 days. The trip received wide coverage on national and international TV, radio and in various newspapers. The space hopper is the inspiration of two emotes in the 2017 online multiplayer game Fortnite Battle Royale, which are the \\"Bouncer\\" and \\"Ollie Bounce\\". The former, introduced in the game's ninth season, involves the player character using the space hopper toy itself, while the latter is a special emote exclusive to an outfit based on one of the five elite agents of the game's twelfth season, Agent Skye, in which she takes off her hat, which transforms into a rotund creature named Ollie, and rides him like a space hopper. ==References== ==External links== * The Space Hopper Forums * History * \\"If you hadn't one, you were hopping mad\\" ‚Äì article on the toy Category:Physical activity and dexterity toys Category:Rubber toys ","title":"Space hopper"},{"id":"832132","text":"Frank James Malzone (February 28, 1930 ‚Äì December 29, 2015) was a Major League Baseball third baseman who played for the Boston Red Sox (1955‚Äì65) and California Angels (1966). ==Early years== Frank was signed as a free agent out of Samuel Gompers High School by the Boston Red Sox in 1947. ==Career== Malzone spent 11 seasons with Boston and is among the all-time Red Sox leaders in several categories. He batted .276 with 131 home runs and 716 runs batted in in 1359 games. A free agent at the end of 1965, he finished up with the Angels playing 82 games in 1966. Malzone in 1965 Malzone made his Boston debut in 1955, going 6-for-10 in a doubleheader against Baltimore. In 1957, in his first full season with the Red Sox, he had a career-high 103 RBI and tied an American League record for a third baseman with 10 assists in a game. He became the first player to lead the league at his position in games played, putouts, errors, assists, double plays and fielding percentage. Malzone led the league with 627 at-bats and hit a career-high .295 in 1958. Through 1961, he tied a record by leading AL third basemen in double plays over five straight seasons, enjoying his best season in 1962, batting .283 with 21 home runs and 95 RBI.

Institutionalized adultism, ageism, classism, elitism, ethnocentrism, nationalism, speciesism, racism, and sexism are some examples of structural violence as proposed by Galtung.Johan Galtung\\"Seeking Peace from Resolving Conflict between Buddhists and Muslims in Myanmar and Sri Lanka\\" by Prof. Dr. Johan Galtung According to Galtung, rather than conveying a physical image, structural violence is an \\"avoidable impairment of fundamental human needs\\".Johan Galtung, \\"Kulturelle Gewalt\\" (1993) Vol. 43 Der Burger im Staat p. 106 in Ho, Kathleen \\"Structural Violence as a Human Rights Violation\\" (2007). Essex Human Rights Review Vol. 4 No. 2 September 2007 As it is avoidable, structural violence is a high cause of premature death and unnecessary disability. Because structural violence affects people differently in various social structures, it is very closely linked to social injustice. Structural violence and direct violence are said to be highly interdependent, including family violence, gender violence, hate crimes, racial violence, police violence, state violence, terrorism, and war. In his book Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic, James Gilligan defines structural violence as \\"the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted with the relatively lower death rates experienced by those who are above them\\". Gilligan largely describes these \\"excess deaths\\" as \\"non-natural\\" and attributes them to the stress, shame, discrimination, and denigration that results from lower status. He draws on Sennett and Cobb, who examine the \\"contest for dignity\\" in a context of dramatic inequality. Bandy X. Lee wrote in her textbook Violence: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Causes, Consequences, and Cures, \\"Structural violence refers to the avoidable limitations that society places on groups of people that constrain them from meeting their basic needs and achieving the quality of life that would otherwise be possible. These limitations, which can be political, economic, religious, cultural, or legal in nature, usually originate in institutions that exercise power over particular subjects.\\" She goes on to say that it \\"is therefore an illustration of a power system wherein social structures or institutions cause harm to people in a way that results in maldevelopment and other deprivations.\\" Rather than the term being called social injustice or oppression, there is an advocacy for it to be called violence because this phenomenon comes from, and can be corrected by human decisions, rather than just natural causes. == Cause and effects == In The Sources of Social Power, Michael Mann makes the argument that within state formation, \\"increased organizational power is a trade-off, whereby the individual obtains more security and food in exchange for his or her freedom.\\" Sini≈°a Male≈°eviƒá elaborates on Mann's argument by saying, \\"Mann's point needs extending to cover all social organizations, not just the state. The early chiefdoms were not states, obviously; still, they were established on a similar basis‚Äîan inversely proportional relationship between security and resources, on the one hand, and liberty, on the other.\\" This means that although those who live in organized, centralized social systems are not likely subject to hunger or to die in an animal attack, they are likely to engage in organized violence, which could include war. These structures make for opportunities and advances that humans could not create for themselves, including the development of agriculture, technology, philosophy, science, and art; however, these structures take tolls elsewhere, meaning that these structures are both productive and detrimental. In our early history, hunter-gatherer groups used organizational power to acquire more resources and produce more food, but at the same time, this power was also used to dominate, kill, and enslave other groups in order to expand territory and supplies. Although structural violence is said to be invisible, it has a number of influences which shape it. These include identifiable institutions, relationships, force fields, and ideologies, including discriminatory laws, gender inequality, and racism. Moreover, this does not only exist for those of the lower class, although the effects are much heavier on them, including the highest rate of disease and death, unemployment, homelessness, lack of education, powerlessness, and shared fate of miseries. The whole social order is effected by social power, but these other groups have much more indirect effects on them, with the acts generally being less violent. Due to the social and economic structure in place today, specifically the division into rich and poor, powerful and weak, and superior and inferior, the excess premature death rate is between 10 and 20 million per year, which is over ten times the death rates from suicide, homicide, and warfare combined. ==Cultural violence== \\"Cultural violence\\" refers to aspects of a culture that can be used to justify or legitimize direct or structural violence, and may be exemplified by religion and ideology, language and art, empirical science and formal science.Galtung, Johan. \\"Cultural Violence,\\" Journal of Peace Research, Vol. 27, No. 3 (Aug., 1990), pp. 291‚Äì305 Cultural violence makes direct and structural violence look or feel \\"right\\", or at least not wrong, according to Galtung.Galtung 1990, p. 291 The study of cultural violence highlights the ways the act of direct violence and the fact of structural violence are legitimized and thus made acceptable in society. One mechanism of cultural violence is to change the \\"moral color\\" of an act from \\"red/wrong\\" to \\"green/right\\", or at least to \\"yellow/acceptable\\".Galtung 1990, p. 292 ==International scope== Petra Kelly wrote in her first book, Fighting for Hope (1984): The violence in structural violence is attributed to the specific organizations of society that injure or harm individuals or masses of individuals. In explaining his point of view on how structural violence affects the health of subaltern or marginalized people, medical anthropologist Paul Farmer writes: This perspective has been continually discussed by Paul Farmer, as well as by Philippe Bourgois and Nancy Scheper-Hughes. Theorists argue that structural violence is embedded in the current world system; this form of violence, which is centered on apparently inequitable social arrangements, is not inevitable. Ending the global problem of structural violence will require actions that may seem unfeasible in the short term. To some, this indicates that it may be easier to devote resources to minimizing the harmful impacts of structural violence. Others, such as futurist Wendell Bell, see a need for long-term vision to guide projects for social justice. Many structural violences, such as racism and sexism, have become such a common occurrence in society that they appear almost invisible. Despite this fact, sexism and racism have been the focus of intense cultural and political resistance for many decades. Significant reform has been accomplished, though the project remains incomplete. Paul Farmer notes that there are three reasons why structural violence is hard to see. 1\\\\. Suffering is exoticized--that is, when something/someone is distant or far away, individuals tend to not be affected by it. When suffering lacks proximity, it's easy to exoticise. 2\\\\. The weight of suffering is also impossible to comprehend. There is simply no way that many individuals are able to comprehend what suffering is like. 3\\\\. Lastly, the dynamics and distribution of suffering are still poorly understood. Women, Poverty & AIDS: Sex, Drugs and Structural Violence (Series in Health and Social Justice), with coauthor Margaret Connors, Common Courage Press; Reprint edition (September 1996), Anthropologist Seth Holmes studies suffering through the lens of structural violence in his ethnography Fresh Fruit Broken Bodies: Migrant Farmworkers in the United States. He analyzes naturalization physical and mental suffering, violence continuum, and structural vulnerability that the Mexican migrants experience in their everyday lives. Dr. Holmes uses examples such as governmental influences of structural violence such as US subsidizing corn industries which force Mexican farmers out of business, how this forces them to make the very dangerous trip across the border, US border patrol being hindering these immigrants chances of finding work in America, and the impact it has on the migrants bodies. ===Access to health care=== Structural violence affects the availability of health care in the sense that physicians often need to pay attention to broad social forces (racism, gender inequality, classism, etc.) to determine who falls ill and who will be given access to care. It is more likely for structural violence to occur in areas where biosocial methods are neglected in a country's health care system. Since structurally violent situations are viewed primarily as biological consequences, it neglects environmentally stimulated problems, such as negative social behaviours or inequality prominence. If biosocial understandings are forsaken when considering communicable diseases such as HIV, for example, prevention methods and treatment practices become inadequate and unsustainable for populations. However, the challenge is obvious: many countries cannot afford to stop the harmful cycle of structural violence. Paul Farmer argues that the major flaw in the dominant model of medical care is that medical services are sold as a commodity, remaining only available to those who can afford them. The concept of structural violence is used to show how medical professionals are not trained to understand the social forces behind disease, nor are they trained to deal with or alter them. Medical professionals have to ignore the social determinants that alter access to care, and as a result, medical interventions are significantly less effective in low-income countries. Structural violence is an issue not only in developing countries, but also in North America. For example, it has had a significant impact on diagnosis and treatment of AIDS in the United States. A 1990 study by Moore et al. found that blacks had a significantly lesser chance of receiving treatment than whites. Findings from another study suggest that the increased rate of workplace injury among undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States can be understood as an example of structural violence. Structural violence is the result of policy and social structures, and change can only be a product of altering the processes that encourage structural violence in the first place. Paul Farmer claims that \\"structural interventions\\" are one possible solution. Countries such as Haiti and Rwanda have implemented these interventions with positive outcomes. Examples include prohibiting the commodification of the citizen needs, such as health care, ensuring equitable access to effective therapies, and developing social safety nets. These initiatives increase citizen's social and economic rights, thus decreasing structural violence. However, for these structural interventions to be successful, medical professionals need to be capable of executing such tasks. Unfortunately, many of these professionals are not trained to perform structural interventions. Moreover, medical professionals continue to operate under conventional clinical intervention because physicians can rightly note that structural interventions are not their job. Therefore, the onus falls more on political and other experts to implement such structural changes. As noted, structural forces account for most if not all epidemic diseases (e.g., HIV). Medical professionals still continue to operate under the downstream phenomenon, with a focus is on individual lifestyle factors rather than general socio-economic, cultural, and environmental conditions. This paradigm obscures the structural impediments to changes because it tends to avoid the root causes that should be focused on. One response is to incorporate medical professionals and to acknowledge that such active structural interventions are necessary to address real public health issues. The lessons that have been learned from successful examples of structural interventions in these countries are fundamental. Although health disparities resulting from social inequalities are possible to reduce, as long as health care is exchanged as a commodity, those without the power to purchase it will have less access to it. Biosocial research should be the main focus. Sociology can better explain the origin and spread of infectious diseases, such as HIV or AIDS. Research shows that the risk of HIV is highly affected by one's behavior and habits. Although some structural interventions can decrease premature morbidity and mortality, the social and historical determinants of the structural violence cannot be omitted. Although the interventions have enormous influence on economical and political aspects of international bodies, more interventions are needed to improve access. Structural violence also exists in the area of mental health, where systems are designed to ignore the lived experiences of people with mental illnesses when making decisions about services and funding without consulting with the ill, including those who are illiterate, cannot access computers, do not speak the dominant language, are homeless, are too unwell to fill out long formal surveys, or are in locked psychiatric and forensic wards. Online-only consultation may be inappropriate for people with a lived experience of mental illness. Structural violence is also apparent when consumers in developed countries die from preventable diseases 15‚Äì25 years earlier than do people without a lived experience of mental health. ==Connection with poverty== For one major resource on the connection between structural violence & poverty, see the work of Yale-based German philosopher, Thomas Pogge, especially his book World Poverty and Human Rights (2002). ==See also== * Aggression * Cultural reproduction * Civil Rights Movement * Cycle of poverty * Economic violence * Global inequality * Global policeman * Imperialism * Institutional racism * Lawsuit * Monetarism * Neoconservativism * Neoliberalism * Red Scare * Political violence * Social inequality * Social murder * Structural abuse * Symbolic violence * War on Drugs * Washington consensus ==FootnotesReferences=== * Johan Galtung, \\"Violence, Peace, and Peace Research,\\" Journal of Peace Research, Vol. 6, No. 3.

Security police protect their agency's facilities, properties, personnel, users, visitors and operations from harm and may enforce certain laws and administrative regulations. Most security police have at least some arrest authority. The law enforcement powers of security police vary widely: in some cases limited to those of private persons yet in others amounting to full police powers equivalent to state/provincial, or local law enforcement. As distinct from general law enforcement, the primary focus of security police is on the protection of specific properties and persons. This causes some overlap with functions normally performed by security guards. However, security police are distinguished from guards by greater authority: often higher levels of training, and correspondingly higher expectations of performance in the protection of life and property. In other countries, 'security police' is the name given to the secret security and intelligence services charged with protecting the state at the highest level, including responsibilities such as personal protection of the head of state, counter-espionage, and anti- terrorism. ==Types of special police and similar organizations== Special police may include: # Campus police, who are often hired and sworn in as state law enforcement officers, such as the Los Angeles School Police Department or City University of New York Public Safety Department # Housing police, such as the New York City Housing Authority Police Department, who protect publicly owned housing or \\"housing projects\\" # Airport police such as the Los Angeles Airport Police # Hospital police such as the New York City Department of Health and Hospitals Police and the Texas Medical Center Police. # Park police, with full state police officer powers such as the New York State Park Police, who primarily protect the often vast properties of their employing agency # All uniformed United States federal police agencies such as Military Police units (MP), the U.S. Capitol Police, the Federal Protective Service, and the FBI Police, whose officers are sworn in as federal law enforcement officers with the duty to provide police and security services to federally owned buildings # Capitol police, who protect state properties such as legislative and executive buildings, which can also include executive protection functions # Some County police, such as the former Los Angeles County Office of Public Safety, who provide restricted services to local governments # Special police (also see Auxiliary police), in the protection of public properties, such as the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum which is protected by sworn Special Police Officers as authorized by D.C. Code, ¬ß 4-114 (1981) # Court officers, such as New York State Court Officers, who provide police and security services at court houses # Company police to provide security police services on company or private property by contract, where local law permits private organizations to contract for police powers; this for example includes railway police such as the Amtrak Police. 12\\\\. U.S. Federal Reserve Police, the U.S. Federal Reserve Police is the law enforcement unit of the Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States. ==Legal authority of Security Police Officers == All special police officers derive their authority from two sources: # the laws of their nation, territory and/or municipality # the property rights of their employing or contracting agency or activity, which may be public or private or a mixture of both These powers might include the power to detain, arrest, investigate criminal offenses, carry weapons, employ force, and/or take other actions to protect life and property beyond that of the ordinary citizen. One key distinction is between \\"sworn\\" (or bound by oath or affirmation to uphold the laws even at personal risk), and \\"non-sworn\\" or \\"civilian\\" who are ordinary employees with normal obligations to an employer. Some security police are full-fledged peace officers with the same powers as regular Peace Officers. Others have enhanced powers which are limited by law to the properties they protect, or a specified radius or distance. In some cases these powers are expanded by a Memorandum of Understanding or other legal document where other policing agencies delegate additional powers to enforce local law. Some special police have the more limited powers than a security guards in compliance with the laws of their jurisdiction. These distinctions are of particular importance to special police and their employers. === (special police) or Security police around the world===  Australia The RAAF Security Police is responsible for base security and policing the RAAF and they work closely with the Airfield Defence Guards. The Military Working Dog Unit also provides a further security function. Most state police force in Australia employs a team of officers known as Protective Security Officers (PSOs). Stationed in and around public or government buildings, these PSOs are armed (to varying degrees) and wear a slightly different uniform. They are also called upon by regular police officers if the need arises. They generally undergo training at the state police college and share many resources. Some police officers have used the PSO path as a stepping stone to their current roles. In New South Wales, an armed internal unit of the New South Wales Police Force is staffed by Special Constables who hold identical powers and immunities of a police officer at the rank of Constable. Special Constables wear a similar uniform to police officers, carry arms and appointments and are issued a warrant card and badge. Special Constables provide security services to select government and police complexes.https://www.policecareer.vic.gov.au/pso  Germany The Polizei beim Deutschen Bundestag (Polizei DBT, commonly known as Bundestagspolizei) is the smallest and least known police agency in Germany. It is responsible for the protection of the premises of the Bundestag in Berlin. Because the chief of the Bundestagspolizei is the president of the Bundestag and not the Minister of the Interior, it can not be called a federal police agency. The number of their officers is not published yet. The Bundestagspolizei recruit their staff from all German police agencies, only skilled officers are accepted.  Hong Kong A special division of the Hong Kong Police Force, known as the ASU, has been engaged by airports in Hong Kong, to provide security services. These personnel have higher fitness standards and are issued with heavier firepower, than ordinary HK police officers.  India The Indian central government maintains several security police forces: CISF is The Central Industrial Security Force (established in its present form: June 15, 1983) is a paramilitary security force in India. To protect public properties and private properties *CISF duties : **CISF to protect public sector. **CISF to protect private sector. **Airport Security It is one of the largest central paramilitary forces in India. Strength is nearly 105,000 and rivals other countries when it comes to a Government agency providing security to such a large number of industries. Many of the international airports in India were the responsibility of the city or district police. CSIA for example, was originally serviced by members of Mumbai Police (then known as Bombay Police), but contract for security has been handed over to the CISF. Railway Protection Force (RPF) known for protecting the railways of India and ensuring safety of citizens in trains. The Defence Security Force protects Ministry of Defence property.  Japan In Japan, Security Police, also known as \\"SP\\" are law enforcement officers that provide security for domestic and foreign dignitaries. Their role to dignitary protection is similar to that of the United States Secret Service.  Malaysia Police patrol personnel monitoring on the residence of VIP property. The police patrol mobile unit is a part of the C4-i Implementation System. The Royal Malaysia Police are generally responsible for protecting and policing the airports, seaports and government sites in Malaysia. Unlike several other countries, there is no state police for individual states. Portugal The Navy Establishments Police () is a small security police force responsible for protecting several of the facilities of the Portuguese Navy, including the Navy Central Administration buildings, the Lisbon Naval Base and the Navy Museum. The Navy Establishments Police is a non-military service, in contrast with the Naval Police (Pol√≠cia Naval) which is the Portuguese Navy's military police. South Africa During the 1960s the South African Security Police were known for detaining and interrogating members of the public, often leading to the victims death or disappearance, especially in the height of the Apartheid era. In 1980 it was replaced by the National Intelligence Service.  Sri Lanka During the 1990s the Sri Lanka Police created a sub unit with its members known as Police Security Assistants. They were mostly limited to protection of police and governmental facilities. Sweden Badge of a Swedish ordningsvakt. An Ordningsvakt is a person deputized by the Swedish Police Authority to act as a law enforcement officer with limited police powers. His main mission is to assist in maintaining public order. An ordningsvakt may carry baton, firearm, and handcuffs, and may use a police dog, and is authorized to use force if necessary to maintain order. An ordningsvakt may reject, remove and, if necessary, detain, a person who disturbs the public order in his area of responsibility. He may also detain persons suffering from alcohol intoxication, seize alcoholic beverages, make a citizen's arrest (as everyone else), seize evidence after a citizen's arrest, and search a detained person. Detained persons and evidence are to be turned over to the police, who has a general command authority over him. An ordningsvakt shall carry a special badge, and, since 2012, wear a standardized uniform (irrespective of employer).\\"Ordningsvakter.\\" Polisen. Retrieved 2018-02-12. Ordningsvakter are generally employed by security companies but are used for assignments that requires greater powers than normal security guards (v√§ktare).  Taiwan The Special Police (‰øùÂÆâË≠¶ÂØü, Bao-an Jingcha) is known as the Security Police of Taiwan. United Kingdom Northern Ireland The Northern Ireland Security Guard Service is a civilian armed guard service in which all civilian security officers are attested as Special Constables which provides security at Ministry of Defence establishments in Northern Ireland while the Belfast International Airport Constabulary is a small, specialised police force responsible for policing Belfast International Airport, Northern Ireland.  United States In the United States, the laws concerning peace officers vary widely from state to state within a larger federal system. Each state legislature with approval from the governor has the ability to modify the powers of peace officers in their state through legislation. Park rangers or Park police are generally stationed at the different National parks across the US. Federal Most, if not all, of the federal government's uniformed police officers are security police who primarily serve to protect federal property and personnel. An example would be the Federal Protective Service who protect federal buildings. Officers of the Transportation Security Administration look after the country's entry-exit points and may also work alongside local/state police, depending on that location. This department performs various duties, including luggage and passenger screening. Some officers are armed and have powers of arrest. Many officers get to travel on flights and wear civilian clothing to blend in with the surroundings. Their main purpose is to prevent terrorism or hijacking. There are a multitude of other agencies which perform security related roles in the Federal Government, including the US Secret Service (guarding the White House and certain Government buildings). See Federal law enforcement in the United States for a list of U.S. government security police forces. By States Some major cities such as Washington DC, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Boston have a security police service separate from their city police. These may be employees of a public agency or private contractors. California The complexity of special policing and special police authority is illustrated by these examples, which are not meant to be exhaustive. In California, peace officer powers are granted by the California Penal Code under a number of different code sections. Cities, counties and special districts are authorized to form their own law enforcement agencies. Peace officer training is regulated by a state agency, Peace Officer Standards and Training or POST. This training can consist of as little as a 40-hour PC 832 course (for park rangers, probation officers or fire investigators who might make an arrest in the course of their duties), or as much as a 700-hour POST Basic Academy (for entry level peace officers). Security guards (including off duty peace officers) may only carry firearms in private employment if licensed by the state licensing authority, the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services. Persons regularly employed by public agencies as security guards, however, may be exempt from BSIS regulation, if they have completed POST-certified training in accordance with PC 832 or other Penal Code sections. However, security guards employed by a private employer are still regulated by BSIS even though the client may be a public agency. Orange County Orange County Sheriff's Department Special Officers are duly sworn and dedicated California Peace Officers under California Penal Code section 830.33/36, who provide law enforcement and policing services for the department in connection with the county bus system, airport, the operations of the local courts and the custody of local prisoners. These Sheriff's Special Officers attend a 16-week training academy at the Orange County Sheriff's Regional Training Academy that instructs new Officers on laws of arrest, firearms training, arrest and control techniques, physical fitness, field and patrol tactics, first responder medical training, and corrections/custody training. Being duly sworn California Peace Officers, Orange County Sheriff's Special Officers maintain peace officer authority both on-and-off duty. Los Angeles In the Los Angeles metropolitan area, there are numerous examples of security police with different levels of authority and responsibility. * Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department - The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department employs Security Assistants (Security Officer I) and Security Officers (Security Officer II) who assist Deputy Sheriffs in the protection of various county government facilities. The LASD absorbed the Los Angeles County Office of Public Safety Police on June 30, 2010. ** Security Assistants are assigned to the Transit Services Bureau serve as fare inspectors. Security Assistants and Security Officers assigned to the Court Services Division provide weapons screening and general security of the county's superior and municipal courts. Security Officers assigned to the Community College Division provide campus security to the county's community colleges. Additionally Security Officers may also be assigned to provide security at other county facilities. ** Sheriff's Security Officers in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, such as peace officer (\\"POST\\") training, have limited peace officer powers while on duty and are outside the authority of the state security guard licensing agency, the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services (BSIS) with respect to their work for the County. * Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority - Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority Transit Security Officers are uniformed, 836.5 (a) PC Public Officers, who serve the MTA (Metro) by providing security for critical transportation infrastructure and internal revenue protection. Transit Security Officers undergo a selection process that is similar to that for police (including an identical background investigation, as well as a psychological review and physical agility test), as well as an 800-hour internal training program and POST-certified arrest and firearms course. Many Transit Security Officers have advanced training to serve in specialized functions, such as that of a dispatcher, K-9 handler, rangemaster, or armorer. Furthermore, several officers represent the department in IPSC and USPSA competition through their officially sanctioned shooting team. Transit Security personnel often work in conjunction with the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and Long Beach Police Department. * Others include the now defunct Los Angeles County Police and the Los Angeles General Services Police New York City The Co-op City Department of Public Safety (CCPD) is a public safety force in the Bronx borough of New York City whose duties are to protect the property and citizens of Co-op City, and to enforce state and city laws on Co-op City property. New Orleans The City of New Orleans Department of Police in accordance with New Orleans Home Rule Charter section 4-502 (2) (a) (b) and New Orleans Municipal Code 17-271 MCS 90-86, deputizes armed Security Officers, Private Investigators, College Campus Police, City, State, and Federal agencies, within the city limits, with limited Police Power as New Orleans Police Special Officers. New Orleans Municipal Code 17-271 MCS 30-1122 states It shall be unlawful for any person to act as an armed guard unless he is a Peace Officer. Louisiana R.S. 40:1379.1 (b) states the Special Officer, when performing those tasks requiring a Special Officer's commission, shall have the same powers and duties as a Peace Officer. Special Officers may make arrest for felony or misdemeanor offenses on the property or area they are to protect, patrol, or in relation to their direct assignment. The Special Officer when making an arrest may pat down the arrested subject for weapons. Special Officers are to turn over arrested subjects and pertaining evidence to a New Orleans Police Officer. Special Officers or to honor all subpoenas on arrest made and appear in court to testify. Special Officers when not on a particular assignment are regarded as private citizens and have no Police Power. However, Special Officers still may make an arrest for a felony, whether in or out of his presence, while not on a particular assignment, under Louisiana Law CCRP art.214 Arrest by private person; when lawful. Venezuela The Internal Security Division is a security police unit of the Bolivarian Service of National Intelligence. Dressed with black berets and armed with M16 and M4. This unit provides security at counterintelligence territorial bases and other facilities. They have police power. ==Obsolete usesNazi Germany=== * The Sicherheitspolizei, often abbreviated as SiPo, was a term used in Nazi Germany to describe the state political and criminal investigation security agencies. It was made up by the combined forces of the Gestapo (secret state police) and the Kripo (criminal police) between 1936 and 1939. As a formal agency, the SiPo was folded into the RSHA in 1939, but the term continued to be used informally until the end of the Third Reich. * The Reichssicherheitsdienst was the security police assigned to protect dignitaries. ===United States=== * Security police is a term once used for the United States Air Force Security Forces, who function as the military police of the United States Air Force. ==See also== * List of protective service agencies * Federal police * Security guard * United States Air Force Security Forces * Military police ** Provost ==Notes== ==References== * \\"A NEW MEMBER OF THE LASD FAMILY\\" by John Herrera, Star News, September 2006 * The Privatization of Police in America: An Analysis and Case Study.

More generally, one can define multilinear forms on a module over a commutative ring. The rest of this article, however, will only consider multilinear forms on finite-dimensional vector spaces. A multilinear k-form on V over \\\\mathbf{R} is called a (covariant) k-tensor, and the vector space of such forms is usually denoted \\\\mathcal{T}^k(V) or \\\\mathcal{L}^k(V).Many authors use the opposite convention, writing \\\\mathcal{T}^k(V) to denote the contravariant k-tensors on V and \\\\mathcal{T}_k(V) to denote the covariant k-tensors on V. == Tensor product == Given a k-tensor f\\\\in\\\\mathcal{T}^k(V) and an ‚Ñì-tensor g\\\\in\\\\mathcal{T}^\\\\ell(V), a product f\\\\otimes g\\\\in\\\\mathcal{T}^{k+\\\\ell}(V), known as the tensor product, can be defined by the property : (f\\\\otimes g)(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_k,v_{k+1},\\\\ldots, v_{k+\\\\ell})=f(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_k)g(v_{k+1},\\\\ldots, v_{k+\\\\ell}), for all v_1,\\\\ldots,v_{k+\\\\ell}\\\\in V. The tensor product of multilinear forms is not commutative; however it is bilinear and associative: : f\\\\otimes(ag_1+bg_2)=a(f\\\\otimes g_1)+b(f\\\\otimes g_2), (af_1+bf_2)\\\\otimes g=a(f_1\\\\otimes g)+b(f_2\\\\otimes g), and : (f\\\\otimes g)\\\\otimes h=f\\\\otimes (g\\\\otimes h). If (v_1,\\\\ldots, v_n) forms a basis for an n-dimensional vector space V and (\\\\phi^1,\\\\ldots,\\\\phi^n) is the corresponding dual basis for the dual space V^*=\\\\mathcal{T}^1(V), then the products \\\\phi^{i_1}\\\\otimes\\\\cdots\\\\otimes\\\\phi^{i_k}, with 1\\\\le i_1,\\\\ldots,i_k\\\\le n form a basis for \\\\mathcal{T}^k(V). Consequently, \\\\mathcal{T}^k(V) has dimensionality n^k. ==ExamplesBilinear forms=== If k=2, f:V\\\\times V\\\\to K is referred to as a bilinear form. A familiar and important example of a (symmetric) bilinear form is the standard inner product (dot product) of vectors. ===Alternating multilinear forms=== An important class of multilinear forms are the alternating multilinear forms, which have the additional property that : f(x_{\\\\sigma(1)},\\\\ldots, x_{\\\\sigma(k)}) = \\\\sgn(\\\\sigma)f(x_1,\\\\ldots, x_k), where \\\\sigma:\\\\mathbf{N}_k\\\\to\\\\mathbf{N}_k is a permutation and \\\\sgn(\\\\sigma) denotes its sign (+1 if even, ‚Äì1 if odd). As a consequence, alternating multilinear forms are antisymmetric with respect to swapping of any two arguments (i.e., \\\\sigma(p)=q,\\\\sigma(q)=p and \\\\sigma(i)=i, 1\\\\le i\\\\le k, i eq p,q ): : f(x_1,\\\\ldots, x_p,\\\\ldots, x_q,\\\\ldots, x_k) = -f(x_1,\\\\ldots, x_q,\\\\ldots, x_p,\\\\ldots, x_k). With the additional hypothesis that the characteristic of the field K is not 2, setting x_p=x_q=x implies as a corollary that f(x_1,\\\\ldots, x,\\\\ldots, x,\\\\ldots, x_k) = 0 ; that is, the form has a value of 0 whenever two of its arguments are equal. Note, however, that some authors use this last condition as the defining property of alternating forms. This definition implies the property given at the beginning of the section, but as noted above, the converse implication holds only when \\\\operatorname{char}(K) eq 2 . An alternating multilinear k-form on V over \\\\mathbf{R} is called a multicovector of degree k or k-covector, and the vector space of such alternating forms, a subspace of \\\\mathcal{T}^k(V), is generally denoted \\\\mathcal{A}^k(V), or, using the notation for the isomorphic kth exterior power of V^*(the dual space of V), \\\\bigwedge^k V^*.Spivak uses \\\\Omega^k(V) for the space of k-covectors on V. However, this notation is more commonly reserved for the space of differential k-forms on V. In this article, we use \\\\Omega^k(V) to mean the latter. Note that linear functionals (multilinear 1-forms over \\\\mathbf{R}) are trivially alternating, so that \\\\mathcal{A}^1(V)=\\\\mathcal{T}^1(V)=V^*, while, by convention, 0-forms are defined to be scalars: \\\\mathcal{A}^0(V)=\\\\mathcal{T}^0(V)=\\\\mathbf{R}. The determinant on n\\\\times n matrices, viewed as an n argument function of the column vectors, is an important example of an alternating multilinear form.  Exterior product  The tensor product of alternating multilinear forms is, in general, no longer alternating. However, by summing over all permutations of the tensor product, taking into account the parity of each term, the exterior product (\\\\wedge, also known as the wedge product) of multicovectors can be defined, so that if f\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}^k(V) and g\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}^\\\\ell(V), then f\\\\wedge g\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}^{k+\\\\ell}(V): : (f\\\\wedge g)(v_1,\\\\ldots, v_{k+\\\\ell})=\\\\frac{1}{k!\\\\ell!}\\\\sum_{\\\\sigma\\\\in S_{k+\\\\ell}} (\\\\sgn(\\\\sigma)) f(v_{\\\\sigma(1)}, \\\\ldots, v_{\\\\sigma(k)})g(v_{\\\\sigma(k+1)} ,\\\\ldots,v_{\\\\sigma(k+\\\\ell)}), where the sum is taken over the set of all permutations over k+\\\\ell elements, S_{k+\\\\ell}. The exterior product is bilinear, associative, and graded-alternating: if f\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}^k(V) and g\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}^\\\\ell(V) then f\\\\wedge g=(-1)^{k\\\\ell}g\\\\wedge f. Given a basis (v_1,\\\\ldots, v_n) for V and dual basis (\\\\phi^1,\\\\ldots,\\\\phi^n) for V^*=\\\\mathcal{A}^1(V), the exterior products \\\\phi^{i_1}\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge\\\\phi^{i_k}, with 1\\\\leq i_1<\\\\cdots form a basis for \\\\mathcal{A}^k(V). Hence, the dimensionality of \\\\mathcal{A}^k(V) for n-dimensional V is \\\\tbinom{n}{k}=\\\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!\\\\,k!}. ===Differential forms=== Differential forms are mathematical objects constructed via tangent spaces and multilinear forms that behave, in many ways, like differentials in the classical sense. Though conceptually and computationally useful, differentials are founded on ill-defined notions of infinitesimal quantities developed early in the history of calculus. Differential forms provide a mathematically rigorous and precise framework to modernize this long-standing idea. Differential forms are especially useful in multivariable calculus (analysis) and differential geometry because they possess transformation properties that allow them be integrated on curves, surfaces, and their higher-dimensional analogues (differentiable manifolds). One far-reaching application is the modern statement of Stokes' theorem, a sweeping generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus to higher dimensions. The synopsis below is primarily based on Spivak (1965) and Tu (2011).  Definition of differential k-forms and construction of 1-forms  To define differential forms on open subsets U\\\\subset\\\\mathbf{R}^n, we first need the notion of the tangent space of \\\\mathbf{R}^nat p, usually denoted T_p\\\\mathbf{R}^n or \\\\mathbf{R}^n_p. The vector space \\\\mathbf{R}^n_p can be defined most conveniently as the set of elements v_p (v\\\\in\\\\mathbf{R}^n, with p\\\\in\\\\mathbf{R}^n fixed) with vector addition and scalar multiplication defined by v_p+w_p:=(v+w)_p and a\\\\cdot(v_p):=(a\\\\cdot v)_p, respectively. Moreover, if (e_1,\\\\ldots,e_n) is the standard basis for \\\\mathbf{R}^n, then ((e_1)_p,\\\\ldots,(e_n)_p) is the analogous standard basis for \\\\mathbf{R}^n_p. In other words, each tangent space \\\\mathbf{R}^n_p can simply be regarded as a copy of \\\\mathbf{R}^n (a set of tangent vectors) based at the point p. The collection (disjoint union) of tangent spaces of \\\\mathbf{R}^n at all p\\\\in\\\\mathbf{R}^n is known as the tangent bundle of \\\\mathbf{R}^n and is usually denoted T\\\\mathbf{R}^n:=\\\\bigcup_{p\\\\in\\\\mathbf{R}^n}\\\\mathbf{R}^n_p. While the definition given here provides a simple description of the tangent space of \\\\mathbf{R}^n, there are other, more sophisticated constructions that are better suited for defining the tangent spaces of smooth manifolds in general (see the article on tangent spaces for details). A differential k-form on U\\\\subset\\\\mathbf{R}^n is defined as a function \\\\omega that assigns to every p\\\\in U a k-covector on the tangent space of \\\\mathbf{R}^nat p, usually denoted \\\\omega_p:=\\\\omega(p)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}^k(\\\\mathbf{R}^n_p). In brief, a differential k-form is a k-covector field. The space of k-forms on U is usually denoted \\\\Omega^k(U); thus if \\\\omega is a differential k-form, we write \\\\omega\\\\in\\\\Omega^k(U). By convention, a continuous function on U is a differential 0-form: f\\\\in C^0(U)=\\\\Omega^0(U). We first construct differential 1-forms from 0-forms and deduce some of their basic properties. To simplify the discussion below, we will only consider smooth differential forms constructed from smooth (C^\\\\infty) functions. Let f:\\\\mathbf{R}^n\\\\to\\\\mathbf{R} be a smooth function. We define the 1-form df on U for p\\\\in U and v_p\\\\in\\\\mathbf{R}^n_p by (df)_p(v_p):=Df_p(v), where Df_p:\\\\mathbf{R}^n\\\\to\\\\mathbf{R} is the total derivative of f at p. (Recall that the total derivative is a linear transformation.) Of particular interest are the projection maps (also known as coordinate functions) \\\\pi^i:\\\\mathbf{R}^n\\\\to\\\\mathbf{R}, defined by x\\\\mapsto x^i, where x^i is the ith standard coordinate of x\\\\in\\\\mathbf{R}^n. The 1-forms d\\\\pi^i are known as the basic 1-forms; they are conventionally denoted dx^i. If the standard coordinates of v_p\\\\in\\\\mathbf{R}^n_p are (v^1,\\\\ldots, v^n), then application of the definition of df yields dx^i_p(v_p)=v^i, so that dx^i_p((e_j)_p)=\\\\delta_j^i, where \\\\delta^i_j is the Kronecker delta.The Kronecker delta is usually denoted by \\\\delta_{ij}=\\\\delta(i,j) and defined as \\\\delta:X\\\\times X\\\\to\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\},\\\\ (i,j)\\\\mapsto \\\\begin{cases} 1, & i=j \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & i eq j \\\\end{cases}. Here, the notation \\\\delta^i_j is used to conform to the tensor calculus convention on the use of upper and lower indices. Thus, as the dual of the standard basis for \\\\mathbf{R}^n_p, (dx^1_p,\\\\ldots,dx^n_p) forms a basis for \\\\mathcal{A}^1(\\\\mathbf{R}^n_p)=(\\\\mathbf{R}^n_p)^*. As a consequence, if \\\\omega is a 1-form on U, then \\\\omega can be written as \\\\sum a_i\\\\,dx^i for smooth functions a_i:U\\\\to\\\\mathbf{R}. Furthermore, we can derive an expression for df that coincides with the classical expression for a total differential: : df=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n D_i f\\\\; dx^i={\\\\partial f\\\\over\\\\partial x^1} \\\\, dx^1+\\\\cdots+{\\\\partial f\\\\over\\\\partial x^n} \\\\, dx^n. [Comments on notation: In this article, we follow the convention from tensor calculus and differential geometry in which multivectors and multicovectors are written with lower and upper indices, respectively. Since differential forms are multicovector fields, upper indices are employed to index them. The opposite rule applies to the components of multivectors and multicovectors, which instead are written with upper and lower indices, respectively. For instance, we represent the standard coordinates of vector v\\\\in\\\\mathbf{R}^n as (v^1,\\\\ldots,v^n), so that v=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n v^ie_i in terms of the standard basis (e_1,\\\\ldots,e_n). In addition, superscripts appearing in the denominator of an expression (as in \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x^i}) are treated as lower indices in this convention. When indices are applied and interpreted in this manner, the number of upper indices minus the number of lower indices in each term of an expression is conserved, both within the sum and across an equal sign, a feature that serves as a useful mnemonic device and helps pinpoint errors made during manual computation.]  Basic operations on differential k-forms  The exterior product (\\\\wedge) and exterior derivative (d) are two fundamental operations on differential forms. The exterior product of a k-form and an ‚Ñì-form is a (k+\\\\ell)-form, while the exterior derivative of a k-form is a (k+1)-form. Thus, both operations generate differential forms of higher degree from those of lower degree. The exterior product \\\\wedge:\\\\Omega^k(U)\\\\times\\\\Omega^\\\\ell(U)\\\\to\\\\Omega^{k+\\\\ell}(U) of differential forms is a special case of the exterior product of multicovectors in general (see above). As is true in general for the exterior product, the exterior product of differential forms is bilinear, associative, and is graded- alternating. More concretely, if \\\\omega=a_{i_1\\\\ldots i_k} \\\\, dx^{i_1}\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge dx^{i_k} and \\\\eta=a_{j_1\\\\ldots i_{\\\\ell}} dx^{j_1}\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge dx^{j_{\\\\ell}}, then : \\\\omega\\\\wedge\\\\eta=a_{i_1\\\\ldots i_k}a_{j_1\\\\ldots j_\\\\ell} \\\\, dx^{i_1}\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge dx^{i_k}\\\\wedge dx^{j_1} \\\\wedge \\\\cdots\\\\wedge dx^{j_\\\\ell}. Furthermore, for any set of indices \\\\\\\\{\\\\alpha_1\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_m\\\\\\\\}, : dx^{\\\\alpha_1} \\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge dx^{\\\\alpha_p} \\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge dx^{\\\\alpha_q} \\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge dx^{\\\\alpha_m} = -dx^{\\\\alpha_1} \\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge dx^{\\\\alpha_q} \\\\wedge \\\\cdots\\\\wedge dx^{\\\\alpha_p}\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge dx^{\\\\alpha_m}. If I=\\\\\\\\{i_1,\\\\ldots,i_k\\\\\\\\}, J=\\\\\\\\{j_1,\\\\ldots,j_{\\\\ell}\\\\\\\\}, and I\\\\cap J=\\\\emptyset, then the indices of \\\\omega\\\\wedge\\\\eta can be arranged in ascending order by a (finite) sequence of such swaps. Since dx^\\\\alpha\\\\wedge dx^\\\\alpha=0, I\\\\cap J eq\\\\emptyset implies that \\\\omega\\\\wedge\\\\eta=0. Finally, as a consequence of bilinearity, if \\\\omega and \\\\eta are the sums of several terms, their exterior product obeys distributivity with respect to each of these terms. The collection of the exterior products of basic 1-forms \\\\\\\\{dx^{i_1}\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge dx^{i_k} \\\\mid 1\\\\leq i_1<\\\\cdots< i_k\\\\leq n\\\\\\\\} constitutes a basis for the space of differential k-forms. Thus, any \\\\omega\\\\in\\\\Omega^k(U) can be written in the form : \\\\omega=\\\\sum_{i_1<\\\\cdots where a_{i_1\\\\ldots i_k}:U\\\\to\\\\mathbf{R} are smooth functions. With each set of indices \\\\\\\\{i_1,\\\\ldots,i_k\\\\\\\\} placed in ascending order, (*) is said to be the standard presentation of \\\\omega. In the previous section, the 1-form df was defined by taking the exterior derivative of the 0-form (continuous function) f. We now extend this by defining the exterior derivative operator d:\\\\Omega^k(U)\\\\to\\\\Omega^{k+1}(U) for k\\\\geq1. If the standard presentation of k-form \\\\omega is given by (*), the (k+1)-form d\\\\omega is defined by : d\\\\omega:=\\\\sum_{i_1<\\\\ldots A property of d that holds for all smooth forms is that the second exterior derivative of any \\\\omega vanishes identically: d^2\\\\omega=d(d\\\\omega)\\\\equiv 0. This can be established directly from the definition of d and the equality of mixed second-order partial derivatives of C^2 functions (see the article on closed and exact forms for details).  Integration of differential forms and Stokes' theorem for chains  To integrate a differential form over a parameterized domain, we first need to introduce the notion of the pullback of a differential form. Roughly speaking, when a differential form is integrated, applying the pullback transforms it in a way that correctly accounts for a change-of-coordinates. Given a differentiable function f:\\\\mathbf{R}^n\\\\to\\\\mathbf{R}^m and k-form \\\\eta\\\\in\\\\Omega^k(\\\\mathbf{R}^m), we call f^*\\\\eta\\\\in\\\\Omega^k(\\\\mathbf{R}^n) the pullback of \\\\eta by f and define it as the k-form such that : (f^*\\\\eta)_p(v_{1p},\\\\ldots, v_{kp}):=\\\\eta_{f(p)}(f_*(v_{1p}),\\\\ldots,f_*(v_{kp})), for v_{1p},\\\\ldots,v_{kp}\\\\in\\\\mathbf{R}^n_p, where f_*:\\\\mathbf{R}^n_p\\\\to\\\\mathbf{R}^m_{f(p)} is the map v_p\\\\mapsto(Df_p(v))_{f(p)}. If \\\\omega=f\\\\, dx^1\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge dx^n is an n-form on \\\\mathbf{R}^n (i.e., \\\\omega\\\\in\\\\Omega^n(\\\\mathbf{R}^n)), we define its integral over the unit n-cell as the iterated Riemann integral of f: : \\\\int_{[0,1]^n} \\\\omega = \\\\int_{[0,1]^n} f\\\\,dx^1\\\\wedge\\\\cdots \\\\wedge dx^n:= \\\\int_0^1\\\\cdots\\\\int_0^1 f\\\\, dx^1\\\\cdots dx^n. Next, we consider a domain of integration parameterized by a differentiable function c:[0,1]^n\\\\to A\\\\subset\\\\mathbf{R}^m, known as an n-cube. To define the integral of \\\\omega\\\\in\\\\Omega^n(A) over c, we \\"pull back\\" from A to the unit n-cell: : \\\\int_c \\\\omega :=\\\\int_{[0,1]^n}c^*\\\\omega. To integrate over more general domains, we define an n-chain C=\\\\sum_i n_ic_i as the formal sum of n-cubes and set : \\\\int_C \\\\omega :=\\\\sum_i n_i\\\\int_{c_i} \\\\omega. An appropriate definition of the (n-1)-chain \\\\partial C, known as the boundary of C,The formal definition of the boundary of a chain is somewhat involved and is omitted here (see Spivak (1965), pp. 98‚Äì99 for a discussion). Intuitively, if C maps to a square, then \\\\partial C is a linear combination of functions that maps to its edges in a counterclockwise manner. The boundary of a chain is distinct from the notion of a boundary in point-set topology. allows us to state the celebrated Stokes' theorem (Stokes‚ÄìCartan theorem) for chains in a subset of \\\\mathbf{R}^m: > If \\\\omega is a smooth (n-1)-form on an open set A\\\\subset\\\\mathbf{R}^m and C > is a smooth n-chain in A, then\\\\int_C d\\\\omega=\\\\int_{\\\\partial C} \\\\omega. Using more sophisticated machinery (e.g., germs and derivations), the tangent space T_p M of any smooth manifold M (not necessarily embedded in \\\\mathbf{R}^m) can be defined. Analogously, a differential form \\\\omega\\\\in\\\\Omega^k(M) on a general smooth manifold is a map \\\\omega:p\\\\in M\\\\mapsto\\\\omega_p\\\\in \\\\mathcal{A}^k(T_pM). Stokes' theorem can be further generalized to arbitrary smooth manifolds-with-boundary and even certain \\"rough\\" domains (see the article on Stokes' theorem for details). ==See also== *Bilinear map *Exterior algebra *Homogeneous polynomial *Multilinear map ==References== Category:Abstract algebra Category:Linear algebra Category:Multilinear algebra ","title":"Multilinear form"},{"id":"832222","text":"A Thin Line Between Love and Hate is a 1996 American black comedy-romance film directed and co-written by Martin Lawrence, who also stars in the film. Lawrence co-wrote the screenplay alongside Kenny Buford and Bentley Kyle Evans, who has also written for Lawrence's hit television sitcom, Martin, and Kim Bass. In addition to Lawrence, the film's cast includes Lynn Whitfield, Regina King, Bobby Brown, and Della Reese. The film tells the story of Darnell Wright, a ladies' man who finds himself targeted by one of his obsessed lovers. The film was released on April 1996 and went on to gross over $30 million at the box office against a budget of $8 million. The film was shot on location entirely in the city of Los Angeles, California, from June 5 until August 11, 1995. The title for the film is taken from the 1971 song \\"Thin Line Between Love and Hate\\" by The Persuaders. R&B; trio H-Town recorded a cover version of this song that was included on the film soundtrack. The movie is comparable to Fatal Attraction. ==Plot== Nightclub manager Darnell Wright (Martin Lawrence) is a perpetual playboy and hopeless male chauvinist. He works for a nightclub called Chocolate City and aspires to be its owner. He trades VIP privileges at the club for favors from women. Though he is an expert at conning women, he sometimes worries about what his childhood sweetheart Mia (Regina King) thinks of his adventures. When the classy and elegant Brandi Webb (Lynn Whitfield) steps out of a limousine to enter the club, Darnell feels that he's met his ultimate prize. She rejects his come- ons, which only fuels his appetite. He pursues her, showing up with flowers at her real estate . He finally wins over Brandi, only to find out that he's really in love with Mia. One morning, Darnell wakes up to find Brandi in the kitchen making bacon and pancakes. She wants him to hold her but he pushes her off aggressively. But Brandi doesn't take kindly to rejection. She becomes an obsessed femme fatale stalking him, even taking all four wheels off his SUV to ground him from his rounds, shattering his windshield and setting his nightclub on fire. In one scene, she hits herself with a fruit hidden in a sock to cause bruises without fingerprints. When Darnell goes to see her at the hospital, he is arrested for a false domestic violence charge. She also threatens Mia's life. Ending his relationship with Mia is not enough to satisfy Brandi who finally administers Darnell's punishment for his misogyny. Darnell quickly learns the hard way that when you \\"play\\", you have to \\"pay.\\" The film ends much like the last verse of the song \\"A Thin Line Between Love and Hate\\", with an injured Darnell in the hospital with all his friends and family as well as Mia standing over him. He ponders over what happened to him and deciding to change, and a mugshot of Brandi and Darnell's voice saying \\"Damn I'm truly sorry about what happened to Brandi. I hope baby lands on her feet, but they better make damn sure they fix that dent in her heart before they let her out\\". ==Cast== * Martin Lawrence as Darnell Wright/Narrator * Lynn Whitfield as Brandi Webb * Regina King as Mia Williams * Bobby Brown as Tee * Della Reese as Mama Wright * Malinda Williams as Erica Wright * Daryl Mitchell as Earl * Roger E.

It was considered a trend-setting film at the time and was one of the year's biggest box-office hits. It follows a man in middle age who becomes infatuated with a young woman whom he has never met, leading to a comic chase and an encounter in Mexico. ==Plot== During a surprise 42nd birthday party for wealthy, well-known composer George Webber (Dudley Moore), thrown by his actress girlfriend Samantha Taylor (Julie Andrews), he finds he is coping badly with incipient middle age. From his car, George glimpses a bride-to-be (Bo Derek) and is instantly obsessed with her beauty, which he rates as \\"11\\" on a scale that goes up to 10. Following her to the church, he crashes into a police cruiser, is stung by a bee, and nearly disrupts the wedding ceremony. George visits the priest, and learns the woman is Jenny Miles, daughter of a prominent Beverly Hills dentist. Later that night, Sam and George have an argument about George's failure to give her the attention she needs, his use of the term \\"broad\\", and the fact that he uses a telescope to watch a neighbor (a porn producer) perform carnal acts. The final straw for Sam occurs when George makes a remark subtly impugning her femininity, at which point Sam leaves in a huff. The following day, George spies on his neighbor again, hits himself with the telescope, and falls down an embankment, causing him to miss Sam's phone call. Still obsessed with the young bride, George schedules a dental appointment with Jenny's father and learns that Jenny and her husband have gone to Mexico for their honeymoon. The examination reveals a mouthful of cavities, requiring fillings. The after-effects of the novocaine, aggravated by his heavy drinking, leave George completely incoherent. Sam finally reaches him on the phone, but mistakes him for an intruder and calls the police, who hold George at gunpoint while trying to understand his gibberish. Unnerved by the day's events, George visits his neighbor's house to take part in an orgy. Sam arrives at George's and spots him through his telescope, widening the rift between them. While his songwriting partner Hugh (Robert Webber) consoles Sam and says she will need to decide how long to wait for George to grow up, George impulsively boards a plane and follows the newlyweds to their exclusive resort in Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico. In the bar, George becomes acquainted with a friendly bartender, plays the piano, and encounters an old acquaintance, Mary Lewis (Dee Wallace), who suffers from a lack of self- confidence because she blames herself for a series of failed relationships. When they attempt a fling, Mary interprets George's inadequacy in bed as confirmation of her own insecurities. At the beach, George sees Jenny ‚Äï wearing a swimsuit with her hair braided in cornrows ‚Äï and is awestruck again by her beauty. He notices that David (Sam J. Jones), her husband, has fallen asleep on his surfboard. George learns that beyond a certain point are powerful currents that can sweep a swimmer or surfer dangerously far from land. He rents a catamaran, clumsily but successfully rescues David, and becomes a hero. Sam sees him on a TV newscast and tries to contact him, but George (unaware that it is Sam) refuses the call. David, badly sunburned, is hospitalized, allowing Jenny and George to spend time alone together. After dinner, in her room, Jenny smokes marijuana and then seduces George to the sounds of Maurice Ravel's Bol√©ro. Although George is initially elated to find all of his fantasies being fulfilled, he is horrified when Jenny takes a call from her husband while in bed with him and casually informs him of George's presence. He is even more confused when David responds with a complete lack of concern (he had called to thank George for saving his life). When Jenny explains their open relationship and mutual honesty, and that they only got married due to pressure from her conservative father, George is appalled; realizing that in contrast to the complete infatuation he has had with her, Jenny sees him as nothing more than a \\"casual lay,\\" so George gets dressed and leaves. After flying back home, George reconciles with Sam by apologizing and demonstrating a new maturity. His neighbor, watching this through his telescope, complains that he has had enough of providing erotic entertainment to George and getting nothing in return. He walks away from the telescope in disgust. George takes an idea from Jenny: he starts Bol√©ro on his phonograph, and he and Sam make love ‚Äî ironically, in full view of the neighbor's telescope. ==Cast== ==Casting== Dudley Moore was a last-minute replacement for George Segal. Edwards sued Segal and won $270,000. ==Release== 10 was released by Warner Bros. October 5, 1979, opening in 706 theaters. It was released on DVD through Warner Home Video May 21, 1997, and a Blu-ray edition was released February 1, 2011. The supplemental material consists of the original theatrical trailer and a four-minute promotional documentary, present on both media. ==Reception== 10 opened at number one in the United States, earning $3,526,692 ($ million today) its opening weekend. The film went on to make a total of $74,865,517 ($ million today) in United States, making it one of the top-grossing films of 1979. It received mostly positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 67% based on 24 reviews. On Metacritic it has a score of 68% based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Vincent Canby of The New York Times described it as \\"frequently hilarious\\", praising the performances of Moore and Andrews, and concluding that 10 \\"is loaded with odd surprises.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it a four-star review, calling it \\"one of the best films Blake Edwards has ever made\\". He named 10 one of the best films of 1979, ranking it 10th place on his yearly top ten list. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune called the film \\"a very funny comedy that couldn't be more serious about the plight of its lead character.\\" He also noted that the film \\"turns out to be a gentle essay on the problems of male menopause.\\" The New York Times placed the film on its Best 1000 Movies Ever list.The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made.

The film also brought renewed fame to the one- movement orchestral piece Bol√©ro by Maurice Ravel and resulted in massive sales of the work. Ravel's music was still under copyright at the time, and sales generated an estimated $1 million in royalties and briefly made him the best-selling classical composer 40 years after his death. Derek appeared in a 1984 film named Bolero, titled to capitalize upon the piece's regenerated popularity. ==References * Category:1979 films Category:1970s romantic comedy films Category:1970s sex comedy films Category:Adultery in films Category:American films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:American sex comedy films Category:Casual sex in films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Henry Mancini Category:Films directed by Blake Edwards Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films set in Mexico Category:Midlife crisis films Category:Orion Pictures films Category:Warner Bros. films Category:Films with screenplays by Blake Edwards Category:1979 comedy films ","title":"10 (film)"},{"id":"832240","text":"Fungus-growing ants (subtribe Attina) comprise all the known fungus-growing ant species participating in ant-fungus mutualism. They are known for cutting grasses and leaves, carrying them to their colonies' nests, and growing fungi on them on which they later feed. Their farming habits typically have large effects on their surrounding ecosystem. Many species farm large areas surrounding their colonies and leave walking trails that compress the soil and no longer grow plants. Attine colonies commonly have millions of individuals, though some species only house a few hundred. They are the sister group to the subtribe Dacetina. Leafcutter ants, including Atta and Acromyrmex, make up two of the genera. Their cultivars mostly come from the fungal tribe Leucocoprineae of family Agaricaceae. Attine gut microbiota is often not diverse due to their primarily monotonous diets, leaving them at a higher risk than other beings for certain illnesses. They are especially at risk of death if their colony's fungus garden is affected by disease, as it is most often the only food source used for developing larvae. Many species of ants, including several Megalomyrmex, invade fungus-growing ant colonies and either steal from and destroy these fungus gardens, or they live in the nest and take food from the species. Fungus-growing ants are only found in the Western Hemisphere. Some species stretch as far north as the pine barrens in New Jersey, USA (Trachymyrmex septentrionalis) and as far south as the cold deserts in Argentina (several species of Acromyrmex). This New World ant clade is thought to have originated about 60 million years ago in the South American rainforest. This is disputed, though, as they likely evolved in a drier habitat while still learning to domesticate their crops. == Evolution == Early ancestors of attine ants were probably insect predators. They likely began foraging for leaf sections, but then converted their primary food source to the fungus these leaf cuts grew. Higher attines, such as Acromyrmex and Atta, are believed to have evolved in Central and North America about 20 million years ago (Mya), starting with Trachymyrmex cornetzi. While the fungal cultivars of the 'lower' attine ants can survive outside an ant colony, those of 'higher' attine ants are obligate mutualists, meaning they cannot exist without one another. Generalized fungus farming in ants appears to have evolved about 55-60 Mya, but early 25 Mya ants seemed to have domesticated a single fungal lineage with gongylidia to feed colonies. This evolution of using gongylidia appears to have developed in the dry habitats of South America, away from the rainforests where fungus-farming evolved. About 10 million years later, leaf-cutting ants likely arose as active herbivores and began industrial-scaled farming. The fungus the ants grew, their cultivars eventually became reproductively isolated and co-evolved with the ants. These fungi gradually began decomposing more nutritious material like fresh plants. Shortly after attine ants began keeping their fungus gardens in dense aggregations, their farms likely began suffering from a specialized genus of Escovopsis mycopathogens. The ants evolved cuticular cultures of Actinobacteria that suppress Escovopsis and possibly other bacteria. These cuticular cultures are both antibiotics and antifungals. The mature worker ants wear these cultures on their chest plates and sometimes on their surrounding thoraces and legs as a biofilm. == Behavior  Mating === A still-winged fungus-growing alate Typically, one queen lives per colony. Every year after the colony is about three years old, the queen lays eggs of female and male alates, the reproductive ants that will pass on the genes of the queens. Before leaving the nest, queens stuff some of the fungus' mycelia in her cibarium. These winged males and queens then take their nuptial flights to mate high in the air. In some areas, species flights are synchronized with all local colonies' virgin royalty flying at the same time on the same day, such as Atta sexdens and Atta texana. Some species' queens mate with only one male, as in Seriomyrmex and Trachymyrmex, while some are known to mate with as many as eight or 10, such as Atta sexdens and many Acromyrmex spp. After mating, all males die, but their sperm stays alive and usable for a long time in the spermatheca, or sperm bank, of their mate, meaning that many ants technically father offspring years after their death. === Colony foundation === After their mating flights, queens cast off their wings and begin their descent into the ground. After creating a narrow entrance and digging straight down, she creates a small chamber. In here, she spits on a small wad of fungus and starts her colony's garden. After about three days, fresh mycelia are growing out of the fungus wad and the queen has lain three to six eggs. In a month, the colony has eggs, larvae, and often pupae surrounding the ever-growing garden. Until the first workers are grown, the queen is the sole worker. She grows the garden, fertilizing it with her fecal liquid, but does not eat from it. Instead, she gains energy from eating 90% of the eggs she lays, in addition to catabolizing her wing muscles and fat reserves. Though the first larvae feed on the eggs of the queen, the first workers begin growing and eating from the garden. Workers feed malformed eggs to the hungry larvae while the garden is still fragile. After about a week of this underground growth, workers open the closed entrance and begin foraging, staying close to the nest. The fungus begins growing at a much faster rate [] an hour. From this point on, the only work the queen does is egg-laying. Colonies grow slowly for the first two years of existence, but then accelerate for the next three years. After winged males and queens begin being produced at around five years, the growth of the colony begins to level out. The founding of a nest by these queens is highly difficult, and successful cases are not likely. After three months, newly founded colonies of Atta capiguara and Atta sexdens are 0.09% and 2.53% likely to still exist, respectively. Some species have better odds, such as Atta cephalotes, which are 10% likely to survive a few months. == Caste system == Attines have seven castes performing roughly 20-30 tasks, meaning the potential exists for development of more specialized castes performing individual tasks for Atta's future. For now, a reproductive caste, made of male drones and female queens, and a worker class, that vary greatly in size, are known. Queens have much larger ovaries than females in the working castes. Since their needs are constantly taken care of, queens rarely move from a single location, which is typically in a centralized fungal garden. Workers take their eggs and move them to other fungal gardens. Differences in size between worker castes begin to develop after a colony is well established. An Atta colombica queen surrounded by workers in a fungus garden === Workers ===  Description  Lower attines have very minor polymorphism within the minor workers, though higher attines commonly have very different sizes of worker ants. In the higher attines, though, head width varies eight-fold and dry weight 200-fold between different castes of workers. The size differences in workers is nearly nonexistent in newly founded colonies. Due to the variety of tasks needed to be performed by a colony, the widths of workers heads are important and good measures of what jobs workers are likely to perform. Those with the heads about wide tend to work as gardeners, although many with heads wide participate in brood care. Workers need heads only about 0.8 mm wide to do the work of caring for the very delicate hyphae of the fungus, which they care for by stroking with their antennae and moving with their mouths. These tiny workers are the smallest and most abundant and are called minim. Ants of appear to be the smallest workers that cut vegetation, but they cannot cut very hard or thick leaves. Most foragers have heads around wide. Attines, particularly the workers that cut leaves and grass, have large mandibles powered by strong muscles. On average, 50% of worker ants' head mass and 25% of their full body mass is the mandibular muscles alone.Different sizes of Atta insularis workers demonstrating the common polymorphism of higher attines  Behavior  Though all castes defend their nests in the event of invasion, a true soldier caste, with individuals called majors, exists. They are larger than other workers, and use their large, sharp mandibles, powered by huge adductor muscles, to defend their colonies from large enemies, such as vertebrates. When a foraging area is threatened by conspecific or interspecific ant competitor, the majority of respondents are smaller workers from other castes, since they are more numerous, and therefore better suited for territorial combat. Tasks are divided not only by size, but by the age of individuals workers, as well. Young workers of most subcastes tend to work inside the nest, but many older workers take on tasks outside. Minims, which are too small to cut or carry leaf fragments, are commonly found at foraging sites. They often ride from the foraging site to the nest by climbing onto the fragments carried by other workers. Most likely, they are older workers that defend carriers from parasitic phorid flies that attempt to lay eggs on the backs of the foragers. Smaller worker riding back to the nest on a leaf fragment carried by a forager All size groups defend their colonies from invaders, but older workers have been found to attack and defend territories most often. At least three of four physical castes of A. sexdens change their behavior based on their age. == Habitat == Lower attines mostly live in inconspicuous nests with 100-1000 individuals and relatively small fungus gardens in them. Higher attines, in contrast, live in colonies made of 5-10 million ants that live and work within hundreds of interconnected fungus- bearing chambers in huge subterranean nests. Some colonies are so large, they can be seen from satellite photos, measuring up to . == Farming == Workers carrying leaf fragments The majority of fungi that are farmed by attine ants come from the family Lepiotaceae, mostly from the genera Leucoagaricus and Leucocoprinus, though variance occurs within the tribe. Some species in the genus Apterostigma have changed their food source to fungi in the family Tricholomataceae. Some species cultivate yeast, such as Cyphomyrmex rimosus. Some fungi that have supposedly been vertically transmitted are believed to be millions of years old. It was previously assumed that the cultures are always transmitted vertically from colony to young queen, but some lower attines have been found to be growing recently domesticated Lepiotaceae. Some species transfer cultures laterally, such as Cyphomyrmex and occasionally some species of Acromyrmex, whether by joining a neighboring tribe, stealing, or invading another colony's garden. leafcutter worker taking a leaf to its colony Lower attines do not use leaves for the majority of the substrate for their gardens, and instead prefer dead vegetation, seeds, fruits, insect feces, and corpses. === Worker recruitment === The number of ants that are recruited to cut varies greatly based on the leaf quality available in addition to the species and location of the colony. Leaf quality is complex to measure because many variables exist, including \\"leaf tenderness, nutrient composition, and the presence and quantity of secondary plant chemicals\\" such as sugar. Early studies found the pheromones used to mark foraging trails come from poison gland sacs. Studies suggest there are two purposes for marking the trails this way: worker recruitment and orientation cues. The trail recruitment pheromone methyl-4-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylate (MMPC), was the first whose chemical structure was identified. It is also the main trail recruitment pheromone in all Atta species except Atta sexdens, which uses 3-ethyl-2,5-dimethylpyrazine. MMPC is incredibly potent and effective at attracting ants. One milligram is theoretically powerful enough to create a path that A. texana and A. cephalotes would follow three times the Earth's circumference [] and that 50% of A. vollenweideri foragers would follow 60 times around the Earth []. === Harvesting vegetation === Most harvesting sites are in tree canopies or patches of savanna grasses. After following the pheromone trail to vegetation, ants climb onto leaves or grass and begin cutting off sections. To do this, they place one mandible, called the fixed mandible, onto a leaf and anchor it. Then they open the other, called the motile mandible, and place it on the leaf tissue. The ant moves the motile jaw and pulls the fixed jaw behind it by closing them together until the fragment detaches. Which jaw is fixed and which is motile varies depending on the direction in which the ant chooses to cut a fragment. An A. colombica worker using its mandibles to cut a leaf The sizes of leaf fragments have been found in some studies to vary based on the size of ants due to the ants' anchoring of their hind legs while cutting, though other studies have not found correlations. This is likely because many factors affect how ants cut leaves, including neck flexibility, body axis location, and leg length. Load sizes that do not impact the running speed of the collecting ants are favored. Often, ants stridulate while cutting vegetation by raising and lowering their gasters in a way that makes a cuticular file on the first gastric tergite and a scraper on the postpetiole rub together. This makes a noise, audible by people with great hearing sitting very close to them and visible using laser-Doppler vibrometry. It also causes the mandibles to move like a vibratome and cut smoother through tender leaf tissue. The metabolic rate of the ants while and after cutting vegetation is above standard. Their aerobic scope is in the range of flying insects, which are among the most metabolically active animals. The behavior of the foragers that bring the material back to the nest varies greatly among species. In some species, especially those that harvest close to their nests, the harvesters bring the litter back to their colony themselves. Species such as A. colombica have one or more cache sites along a trail for foragers to grab litter. Other species, such as A. vollenweideri, that carry leaves as far as , have two to five carriers per leaf. The first carrier takes the segment a short distance toward the nest and then drops it. Another picks it up and drops it, and this repeats until the last carrier brings it the greatest distance until reaching the nest. Data does not show that this behavior maximizes load transportation, so scientists have explained this behavior in other ways, though the data are still inconclusive. One theory is that this type of task partitioning increases the efficiency of individual workers as they become specialists. Another is that the chains accelerate communication between ants about the quality and species of the plants being cut, recruits more workers, and reinforces territorial claims by reinforcing the scent markings. === Gardening process === First, foragers bring in to and drop leaf fragments on the nest's chamber floor. Workers that are usually slightly smaller clip these pieces into segments that are about across. Smaller ants then crush these fragments and mold them into damp pellets by adding fecal droplets and kneading them. They add the pellets into a larger pile of other prill. Smaller workers then pluck loose strands of fungus from dense patches and plant them on the surface of the freshly made pile. The smallest workers, the minim, move around and keep up the garden by delicately prodding the piles with their antennae, licking the surfaces, and plucking out the spores and hyphae of unwanted mold species. === Nutrition === Higher attine fungi grow gongylidia, which form clusters called staphylae. The staphylae are rich in carbohydrates and lipids. Though workers can also eat the hyphae of the fungi, which is richer in protein, they prefer staphylae and appear to live longer while eating them. Cellulose has been found to be poorly degraded and assimilated by fungus, if at all, meaning that the ants that eat the fungus do not get much energy from the cellulose in plants. Xylan, starch, maltose, sucrose, laminarin, and glycoside apparently play the important roles in ant nutrition. It is not known yet how ants can digest laminarin, but myrmecologists E.O. Wilson and Bert H√∂lldobler hypothesize that fungal enzymes may occur in the ants' guts, as evidenced by the enzymes found in larval extract. In a laboratory experiment, only 5% of workers' energy needs were met by fungal staphylae, and the ants also feed on tree sap as they collect greens. Larvae seem to grow on all or nearly all fungus, whereas queens obtain their energy from the eggs nonqueen females lay and workers feed to them. === Bacterial symbionts === The actinomycete bacterium Pseudonocardia is acquired by pupae from the workers that care for them two days after pupae eclose for metamorphosis. Within 14 days, the ants are covered in the bacteria, where they are stored in crypts and cavities found in the exoskeletons. The bacteria produce small molecules that can prevent the growth of a specialized fungus garden pathogen. Attine ants have very specialized diets, which seem to reduce their microbiotic diversity. === Impact of farming === The scale of the farming done by fungus- farming ants can be compared to human's industrialized farming. A colony can \\"[defoliate] a mature eucalyptus tree overnight\\". The cutting of leaves to grow fungus to feed millions of ants per colony has a large ecological impact in the subtropical areas in which they reside.Leafcutters transporting yellow flowers ==Genera== *Acanthognathus Mayr, 1887 *Acromyrmex Mayr, 1865 *Allomerus Mayr, 1878 *Apterostigma Mayr, 1865 *Atta Fabricius, 1804 *‚Ä†Attaichnus Laza, 1982 *Basiceros Schulz, 1906 *Blepharidatta Wheeler, 1915 *Cephalotes Latreille, 1802 *Chimaeridris Wilson, 1989 *Colobostruma Wheeler, 1927 *Cyatta Sosa-Calvo et al., 2013 *Cyphomyrmex Mayr, 1862 *Daceton Perty, 1833 *Diaphoromyrma Fern√°ndez, Delabie & Nascimento, 2009 *Epopostruma Forel, 1895 *Eurhopalothrix Brown & Kempf, 1961 *Ishakidris Bolton, 1984 *Kalathomyrmex Klingenberg & Brand√£o, 2009 *Lachnomyrmex Wheeler, 1910 *Lenomyrmex Fern√°ndez & Palacio, 1999 *Mesostruma Brown, 1948 *Microdaceton Santschi, 1913 *Mycetagroicus Brand√£o & Mayh√©-Nunes, 2001 *Mycetarotes Emery, 1913 *Mycetophylax Emery, 1913 *Mycetosoritis Wheeler, 1907 *Mycocepurus Forel, 1893 *Myrmicocrypta Smith, 1860 *Ochetomyrmex Mayr, 1878 *Octostruma Forel, 1912 *Orectognathus Smith, 1853 *Paramycetophylax Kusnezov, 1956 *Phalacromyrmex Kempf, 1960 *Pheidole Westwood, 1839 *Pilotrochus Brown, 1978 *Procryptocerus Emery, 1887 *Protalaridris Brown, 1980 *Pseudoatta Gallardo, 1916 *Rhopalothrix Mayr, 1870 *Sericomyrmex Mayr, 1865 *Strumigenys Smith, 1860 *Talaridris Weber, 1941 *Trachymyrmex Forel, 1893 *Tranopelta Mayr, 1866 *Wasmannia Forel, 1893 *Xerolitor Sosa-Calvo et al., 2018 ==See also== *Ant‚Äìfungus mutualism *Fungus-growing termites *List of leafcutter ants ==References Cited texts === * H√∂lldobler, Bert and Wilson, EO.

Many evaluations have found that by most measures VHA care is equal to, and sometimes better than, care provided in the private sector, when judged by standard evidence-based guidelines.Longman, Phillip. Best care anywhere. Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2010. The VHA is distinct from the U.S. Department of Defense Military Health System of which it is not a part. The VHA division has more employees than all other elements of the VA combined. == VHA Nationalized Healthcare System == The Veterans Health Administration is a form of nationalized healthcare service in the United States that provides healthcare to Veterans. What makes this type of healthcare different from other forms in the United States is that everything is owned by and operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs as opposed to private companies which is what we see in other parts of the health care market. This means that all the medical facilities that are part of the VHA are owned by the US Government and all the doctors and workers at the facilities are paid by the government. What is a more common model in the United States is that consumers have private health insurance and the medical facilities used are all privatized. As of 2017 the Census found that 67.2% of Americans have private health coverage. Since the VHA is nationalized they receive funding from the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is allocated funds by the federal government. Because of this, Veterans that qualify for VHA healthcare do not pay premiums or deductibles for their healthcare, but may have to make copayments depending on what procedure they are having. The funding the VA receives is split into mandatory, which is an amount of spending dictated by law, and discretionary spending, which is spending that can be adjusted year to year. In 2020 the budget given to the VA was $220.2 billion, of which 56% was mandatory spending and 44% was discretionary. From the discretionary funding, 87.6% was allocated to medical programs which came to a total VHA budget of $85 billion.Medical Program Budget Allocation 2015-2019. Data comes from VA budget submissions. ==History== The first Federal agency to provide medical care to veterans was the Naval Home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The home was created in 1812 and was followed by the creation of Soldiers Home in 1853 and St. Elizabeth's Hospital in 1855. Congress created the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers in 1865 in response to the high number of Civil War casualties. These homes were initially intended to be room and board for disabled veterans. However, by the late 1920s, the homes were providing a level of care comparable to hospital care. President Hoover created the Veterans Administration (VA) in 1930 to consolidate all veteran services. General Omar N. Bradley was appointed to VA administrator and Bradley appointed Major General Paul Hawley as director of VA medicine, both in 1945. Hawley successfully established a policy that affiliated new VA hospitals with medical schools. Hawley also promoted resident and teaching fellowships at VA hospitals. Ultimately, Hawley was responsible for starting the hospital-based research program at the VA. Bradley resigned in 1947. However, upon resignation, 97 hospitals were in operation and 29 new hospitals had been built. As a result, the VA health system was able to serve a much larger population of veterans than it had served in previous years. In 1988, President Reagan signed the Department of Veterans Affairs Act, which elevated the VA to Cabinet-level, then becoming known as the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Department of Veterans Affairs oversees the Veterans Health Administration. In the mid-1980s the VHA was criticized for their high operative mortality. To that end, Congress passed Public Law 99-166 in December 1985 which mandated the VHA to report their outcomes in comparison to national averages and the information must be risk-adjusted to account for the severity of illness of the VHA surgical patient population. In 1991 the National VA Surgical Risk Study (NVASRS) began in 44 Veterans Administration Medical Centers. By December 31, 1993 there was information for 500,000 non-cardiac surgical procedures. In 1994 NVASRS was expanded to all 128 VHA hospitals that performed surgery. The name was then changed to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Beginning in the mid-1990s VHA underwent what the agency characterizes as a major transformation aimed at improving the quality and efficiency of care it provides to its patients. That transformation included eliminating underutilized inpatient beds and facilities, expanding outpatient clinics, and restructuring eligibility rules. A major focus of the transformation was the tracking of a number of performance indicators‚Äîincluding quality-of-care measures‚Äîand holding senior managers accountable for improvements in those measures.Quality Initiatives Undertaken by the Veterans Health Administration Congressional Budget Office Report, August 2009 ===Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014=== In 2014, Congress passed the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie assured veterans that the VA wouldn‚Äôt be privatized and that veterans would still be able to get the same quality of care they had been receiving. Attia, Essam. 4 May 2020. https://indypendent.org/2020/05/as-covid-rages-will-the-va-be-there- for-future-generations-of-veterans/ In May 2014, major problems with scheduling timely access to medical care became public. According to a retired doctor at the center interviewed by CNN, at least 40 veterans died waiting for care at the Phoenix, Arizona Veterans Health Administration facilities. An investigation of delays in treatment throughout the Veterans Health Administration system was conducted by the Veterans Affairs Inspector General, but it only found six deaths during the delay. On May 30, 2014, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki resigned from office due to the fallout from the scandal. Despite the negative exposure and the subsequent vows by Washington lawmakers to take action, the major problems still exist.VA crisis: solutions exist, but haven't happened, panel hears ‚Äî CNNPolitics.comIG probes uncover more problems at VA hospitals  TheHill On June 24, 2014, Senator Tom Coburn, Republican from Oklahoma, and a medical doctor, released a report called Friendly Fire: Death, Delay, and Dismay at the VA which detailed the actions and misconduct of employees of the Department of Veteran Affairs. The report is based on yearlong investigations conducted by Senator Coburn's office on Veterans Health Administration facilities across the nation. The report details the many veterans who have died waiting for health care as a result of the VA misconduct. Secret waiting lists, poor patient care, the millions of dollars that are intended for health care that has gone unspent every year and reports of bonuses paid out to employees who have lied and covered up statistics are also detailed in the report.Friendly Fire: Death, Delay, and Dismay at the VA ‚Äì Stripes.com However, a VA Inspector General's report issued on August 26, 2014, reported that six, not forty, veterans had died experiencing ‚Äúclinically significant delays‚Äù while on waiting lists to see a VA doctor, and in each of these six cases, ‚Äúwe are unable to conclusively assert that the absence of timely quality care caused the deaths of these veterans.‚ÄùThe VA Isn‚Äôt Broken, Yet; Inside the Koch brothers‚Äô campaign to invent a scandal and dismantle the country‚Äôs most successful health care system. by Alicia Mundy, Washington Monthly, March/April/May 2016.Review of Alleged Patient Deaths, Patient Wait Times, and Scheduling Practices at the Phoenix VA Health Care System VA Office of Inspector General, Veterans Health Administration. August 26, 2014. Pub. No. 14-02603-267 Since the 2014 scandal in which the quality administration of health care by the VA was brought into question due to long wait times and secret waiting lists, the VA claims wait times have improved. According to a study conducted by the Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA, in 2014 the average wait times to receive health care from the VHA was a little longer, but still comparable to wait times to see private doctors. The 2014 wait times JAMA found were 22.5 and 18.7 days for the VHA and private doctors respectively. The study also found that three years later, in 2017, VHA wait times were significantly shorter than wait times to see a private doctor. The wait times in 2017 were 17.7 and 29.8 days for the VHA and private doctors respectively. ==VA Health Reform1993 Clinton Healthcare Reform=== The Clinton Healthcare Plan was a health care reform proposed by the Clinton Administration. Even though the reform was not successful, a task force was created in response to the Clinton Healthcare Reform proposal to determine if the VA was ready for managed care. The negative results of market research forced the VA system to re-evaluate its current operations. Research revealed that three out of four veterans would leave the VA network if a national healthcare system were adopted. They also found that there was a high demand for primary care throughout the VA system. Research showed that many VA facilities believed that 55 percent of patients would choose to receive primary care at the VA facility if a primary care system was fully implemented in 1993. The study also showed that the VA facilities believed that 83 percent of veterans would choose to receive primary care at the VA if fully implemented by 1998. These results made it clear to the administration that it was time for a reform. ===1994 VA Primary Care Directive=== This directive required all VA facilities to have primary care teams by year 1996.Ashton, C., Headley, E., Parrino, T., Starfield, B. (September 1995). Primary Care in VA. Boston: Management decision and Research Center. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Office of Research and Development. Health Services Research and Development Service As a result, percentage of patients receiving primary care at the VA increased from 38 percent to 45 percent to 95 percent, during 1993, 1996, and 1999. This mandate served as the foundation for the VA reorganization under Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer. ===Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer and the VA Reform=== Dr. Kizer, a physician trained in emergency medicine and Public Health, was appointed by President Bill Clinton as Director of U.S. Veterans Health Administration in 1994. He was hired to update and modernize the VA health system in order to eliminate negative perception and to align the system with current market trends. Core issues included: :Advancements in technology and biomedical knowledge :Aging and socioeconomically disadvantaged Medicare patients :Coordinating care :Rising healthcare costs There was much opposition to a major reform. Many legislators preferred an incremental change over a wide-scale reform. However, Kizer was known as being very innovative. To publicize his vision he expressed his mission and vision of the \\"new VHA\\" and outlined seven key principles to guide change. His ultimate goal was to provide coordinated, high quality care at a low cost. He launched his reorganization plan in 1995 by decentralizing the VA system. He organized all VA operating units into 22 geographic based networks known as Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs). This allowed networks to manage themselves and adapt to the demographics of their location. Patients were then assigned to a group of doctors who would provide coordinated care. One director was hired for each VISN network. Instead of hiring all directors internally, a third of the newly hired VISN directors were hired outside of the VA system. The directors were responsible for meeting performance goals and improving upon measurable key efficiency and quality indicators. Directors monitored performances and reports were generated to show each network's performance. Some of these indicators included: ::chronic disease quality ::prevention performance ::patient satisfaction ratings ::utilization management The reform also changed the procedure for allocating funds to the various VISNs. Historically, funds were distributed between hospitals based on historical costs. However, it was found that this method affected efficiency and quality of services. Therefore, funding for each VISN was distributed based on the number of veterans seen in each network, rather than on historical values.Kizer et al. (Jun 2000). Reinventing VA Healthcare: Systematizing Quality Improvement and Quality Innovation Medical Care 38(6 Suppl 1) The New England Journal of Medicine conducted a study from 1994‚Äì2000 to evaluate the efficacy of the healthcare reform. They gathered the results of the evaluated key indicators from each of the networks and interpreted the results. There were noticeable improvements, compared with the same key indicators used for the Medicare fee for service system, as soon as two years after the reorganization. These improvements continued through year 2000. These results indicate that the changes made throughout the VA healthcare system, under the leadership of Kizer, did improve the efficiency and quality of care in VA healthcare system. ==Use of electronic records== VHA is especially praised for its efforts in developing a low cost open source electronic medical records system VistA which can be accessed remotely (with secure passwords) by health care providers. With this system, patients and nurses are given bar-coded wristbands, and all medications are bar-coded as well. Nurses are given wands, which they use to scan themselves, the patient, and the medication bottle before dispensing drugs. This helps prevent four of the most common dispensing errors: wrong med, wrong dose, wrong time, and wrong patient. The system, which has been adopted by all veterans hospitals and clinics and continuously improved by users, has cut the number of dispensing errors in half at some facilities and saved thousands of lives.\\"Code Red\\" by Philip Longman, Washington Monthly, September 7, 2009 At some VHA medical facilities, doctors use wireless laptops, putting in information and getting electronic signatures for procedures. Doctors can call up patient records, order prescriptions, view X-rays or graph a chart of risk factors and medications to decide treatments. Patients have a home page that have boxes for allergies and medications, records every visit, call and note, and issues prompts reminding doctors to make routine checks. This technology has helped the VHA achieve cost controls and care quality that the majority of private providers cannot achieve. The Veterans Health Administration Office of Research and Development's research into developing better-functioning prosthetic limbs, and treatment of PTSD are also heralded. The VHA has devoted many years of research into the health effects of the herbicide Agent Orange used by military forces in Vietnam. In October 2012, the VHA announced a new goal \\"to care for and heal our wounded Veterans. In addition to repairing their damaged bodies and minds, VA has embarked on a unique campaign to repair their crumbling intimate relationships.\\"Relationship Retreats: Warriors to Soul Mates FatherhoodChannel.com, October 20, 2012PAIRS Essentials VA Program Support Guide, January 2013 ==Initiatives== The VHA has expanded its outreach efforts to include men and women veterans and homeless veterans. The VHA, through its academic affiliations, has helped train thousands of physicians, dentists, and other health professionals. Several newer VA medical centers have been purposely located adjacent to medical schools. The VHA support for research and residency/fellowship training programs has made the VA system a leader in the fields of geriatrics, spinal cord injuries, Parkinson's disease , and palliative care. The VHA has initiatives in place to provide a \\"seamless transition\\" to newly discharged veterans transitioning from Department of Defense health care to VA care for conditions incurred in the Iraq War or war in Afghanistan. The Veterans Health Administration Office of Research and Development's research into developing better-functioning prosthetic limbs, and treatment of PTSD are also heralded. The VHA has devoted many years of research into the health effects of the herbicide Agent Orange used by military forces in the Vietnam War. In October 2012, the VHA announced a new goal \\"to care for and heal our wounded Veterans. In addition to repairing their damaged bodies and minds, VA has embarked on a unique campaign to repair their crumbling intimate relationships.\\" The VHA has also adopted Boston University's Project RED program, designed to improve the discharge process for veterans in hopes that, by educating patients, the VHA will experience a reduced number of readmission among veterans and provide more information on telerehabilitation. == Services == Outpatent clinic in Petersburg, West Virginia === Mental health === The percentage of patients with a mental illness was 15 percent in 2007. The percentage of veterans with mental illnesses has trended up. The VHA allocated an extra $1.4 billion per year to mental health program between 2005 and 2008. Mental health services in 2006 were evaluated as a part of the Mental Health Strategic Plan.Watkins, K.E., Pincus, H.A. et al., (2011). Veterans Health Administration Mental Health Program Evaluation: Capstone Report, Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corporation, TR-956-VHA The report concluded: In 2009, the VA implemented an initiative called Suicide Assessment and Follow-Up Engagement: Veteran Emergency Treatment (SAFE VET) to identify and treat veterans at risk of suicide by providing care coordination for outpatient mental health services and community-based support. ===PTSD=== Veteran Affairs utilization rates among Iraqi and Afghanistan-war veterans in the mid-Atlantic region with PTSD diagnosis between 2002‚Äì2008 were tracked using ICD-9 codes of those newly diagnosed. When compared to veterans already being treated, veterans new to VA treatment program were less likely to complete follow up visits, and had fewer medication-possession days (74.9 days versus 34.9 days); also long wait times hindered VA medical utilization. Limitations to this study included: type of treatment intervention was not delineated; only looked at PTSD treatment over a short period of time (180 days). Another study found there was an increase in demand of the VA health system among veterans. Nearly 250,000 veterans were identified between 2001 and 2007; Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans had a 40 percent utilization rate, compared to only 10 percent of Vietnam veterans. Veterans were categorized into three groups: non-mental health diagnosis, non- PTSD mental diagnosis, and PTSD mental diagnosis. The most prevalent diagnosis was PTSD. The typical veteran affected by PTSD was male, from the Army or Marines, and a lower-ranked officer. Veterans with PTSD had a high utilization of the VA system at over 91 percent. While this was a comprehensive study, there is more to be studied and understood about the effects of PTSD on returning veterans from active combat. A major limitation is that this study only captured the utilization of veterans within the VA health system. There was no data on veterans who sought medical services outside of the VA health system. We can have a better understanding of the mental health needs of veterans returning to civilian life. Moreover, it would be beneficial to explore and examine how utilization of mental health services is affected by the stigma that persists among veterans. Additional awareness of medical resources available to veterans can help to erase the stigma of seeking mental health treatment. === Women === With the population of women veterans projected to rise from 1.6 million in 2000 to 1.9 million in 2020, the VA has worked to integrate quality women's medical services into the VA system.(2007). Women Veterans: Past, Present, and Future . Department of Veterans Affairs. However, studies show that 66.9 percent of women who do not use the VA for women's services consider private practice physicians more convenient. Also, 48.5 percent of women do not use women's services at the VA due to a lack of knowledge of VA eligibility and services. === Primary care === General care includes health evaluation and counseling, disease prevention, nutrition counseling, weight control, smoking cessation, and substance abuse counseling and treatment as well as gender-specific primary care, e.g., cervical cancer screens (Pap smears), breast cancer screens (mammograms), birth control, preconception counseling, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and menopausal support (hormone replacement therapy). Mental health includes evaluation and assistance for issues such as depression, mood, and anxiety disorders; intimate partner and domestic violence; elder abuse or neglect; parenting and anger management; marital, caregiver, or family-related stress; and post-deployment adjustment or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Veterans may have experienced sexual harassment or sexual assault, known as military sexual trauma (MST) during their service. Health services are available to victims. VHA provides free, confidential counseling and treatment for MST-related mental and physical health conditions. A 2017 study found that nearly one in five VHA women had experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) in the preceding year, and research has shown that many military women reporting IPV experiences in the past year use VHA primary care as their main source of healthcare.Dichter ME, Wagner C, Borrero S, Broyles L, Montgomery AE. Intimate partner violence, unhealthy alcohol use, and housing instability among women veterans in the Veterans Health Administration. Psychological Services. 2017; 14(2): 246-249. The VHA does not have an upper age limit for IPV screening, acknowledging that IPV is not limited by age. However, it is believed that early detection is helpful towards allowing victims to access much needed resources earlier and thus the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force suggests providers especially regularly screen women of childbearing age for IPV. The best care is provided when practitioners do not make assumptions about IPV on the basis of an individual's sexual orientation or other factors. No matter one's age, there are chronic health risks associated with IPV victimization, for both men and women.Cerulli C, Bossarte R, Dichter ME. Exploring intimate partner violence status among male veterans and associated health outcomes. American Journal of Men‚Äôs Health, 2014; 8: 66-73 Early detection is key to providing effective support systems to victims in the armed forces and reducing potential negative health consequences that are associated with such violence. Barriers to disclosure of IPV to providers in the VHA include lack of universal routine screening, patients not being comfortable about disclosure, and individual concerns over potential negative consequences on benefits or personal items, depending on how info is shared or used.Dichter ME, Wagner C, Goldberg EB, Iverson KM. Intimate partner violence detection and care in the Veterans Health Administration: Patient and provider perspectives. Women's Health Issues, 2015; 25(5): 555-560. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.whi.2015.06.006 Barriers to providing the most effective responses to IPV cases include providers lacking time and information to help, and untrained personnel creating more harm than good. === Specialty care === Management and screening of chronic conditions includes heart disease, diabetes, cancer, glandular disorders, osteoporosis and fibromyalgia as well as sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. Reproductive health care includes maternity care, infertility evaluation and limited treatment; sexual problems, tubal ligation, urinary incontinence, and others. VHA is prohibited from providing either in-vitro fertilization or abortion services. Rehabilitation, home care, and long-term care referrals are given to those in need of rehabilitation therapies such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language therapy, exercise therapy, recreational therapy, and vocational therapy. == Evaluations == \\"Patients routinely rank the veterans system above the alternatives\\", according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index. In 2008, the VHA got a satisfaction rating of 85 for inpatient treatment, compared with 77 for private hospitals. In the same report VHA outpatient care scored 3 points higher than for private hospitals.Vets Loving Socialized Medicine Show Government Offers Savings Bloomberg, October 2, 2009 \\"As compared with the Medicare fee-for-service program, the VA performed significantly better on all 11 similar quality indicators for the period from 1997 through 1999.

However, VHA compensation includes benefits not generally available to doctors in private practice, such as lesser threat of malpractice lawsuits, freedom from billing and insurance company payment administration, and the availability of the government's open source electronic records system VistA. Currently the VHA is experiencing a physician shortage and as of 2018 10% of jobs in the VHA remain unfilled. This shortage can be especially harmful to Veterans since a quarter of Veterans live in rural areas. These are the kind of areas that are most vulnerable to a shortage since they are already isolated and it can be hard to get access to the healthcare they need. == Eligibility for VA health care benefits == A VA Veteran identification VIC card for Veterans eligible for VA health care benefits To be eligible for VA health care benefit programs one must have served in the active military, naval or air service and separated under any condition other than dishonorable. Current and former members of the Reserves or National Guard who were called to active duty (other than for training only) by a federal order and completed the full period for which they were called or ordered to active duty also may be eligible for VA health care. The minimum duty requirements are that veterans who enlisted after September 7, 1980, or who entered active duty after October 16, 1981, must have served 24 continuous months or the full period for which they were called to active duty in order to be eligible. The minimum duty requirement may not apply to veterans who were discharged for a disability incurred in the line of duty, for a hardship or \\"early out.\\" The VA determines the minimum requirements when the veteran enrolls for VA health care benefits. To apply for entry into the VA health care system the veteran must complete VA Form 10-10EZ, Application for health care benefits. Eligible veterans will receive a VA Veterans Health Identification Card (VHIC) formerly Veteran identification card (VIC) for use at all VA medical facilities. By federal law, eligibility for benefits is determined by a system of eight priority groups. Retirees from military service, veterans with service- connected injuries or conditions rated by VA, and Purple Heart recipients are within the higher priority groups. Current and former members of the Reserves and the National Guard who were called to active duty (other than for monthly drills and annual training) by a federal executive order may be eligible for VA health care benefits.VA Health Care Eligibility & Enrollment Veterans without rated service-connected conditions may become eligible based on financial need, adjusted for local cost of living. Veterans who do not have service-connected disabilities totaling 50% or more may be subject to copayments for any care they received for nonservice-connected conditions. ==The Goodwill Grant== If a veteran has a private health plan contract for medical insurance, the Goodwill Grant is the veteran's volunteered permission of the veteran's private health insurance granted for VA's direct cost recovery at VA facilities. 38 U.S. Code ¬ß 1729 - Recovery by the United States of the cost of certain care and services. === Eligibility priority groups === { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" - !

Geriatric evaluation is the comprehensive assessment of a Veteran's ability to care for him/herself physical health and social environment, which leads to a plan of care. The plan could include treatment, rehabilitation, health promotion and social services. These evaluations are performed by inpatient Geriatric Evaluation Management (GEM) Units, GEM clinics, geriatric primary care clinics and other outpatient settings. * Adult Day Health Care. The adult day health care (ADHC) program is a therapeutic day care program, providing medical and rehabilitation services to disabled Veterans in a combined setting. * Respite Care. Respite care provides supportive care to Veterans on a short-term basis to give the caregiver planned relief from the physical and emotional demands associated with providing care. Respite care can be provided in the home or other institutional settings. * Home Care. Skilled home care is provided by VA and contract agencies to Veterans that are home bound with chronic diseases and includes nursing, physical/occupational therapy and social services. * Hospice/Palliative Care. Hospice/Palliative care programs offers pain management, symptom control and other medical services to terminally ill Veterans or Veterans in the late stages of the chronic disease process. Services also include respite care as well as bereaverement counseling to family members. ===Limited benefits=== * Nursing Home Care. VA provides nursing home services to Veterans through three national programs: VA owned and operated Community Living Centers (CLC), State Veterans' Homes owned and operated by the states, and the community nursing home program. Each program has admission and eligibility criteria specific to the program. Nursing home care is available for enrolled Veterans who need nursing home care for a service-connected disability, or Veterans or who have a 70 percent or greater service-connected disability and Veterans with a rating of total disability based on individual unemployability. VA provided nursing home care for all other Veterans is based on available resources. * Domiciliary Care. Domiciliary care provides rehabilitative and long-term, health maintenance care for Veterans who require some care, but who do not require all services provided in nursing homes. Domiciliary care emphasizes rehabilitation and return to the community. VA may provide domiciliary care to Veterans whose annual income does not exceed the maximum annual rate of VA pension or to Veterans who have no adequate means of support. ===Financial Assessment for Long-Term Care Services=== For Veterans who are not automatically exempt from making co-pays for long-term care services separates financial assessment (VA Form 10-10EC, APPLICATION FOR EXTENDED CARE SERVICES) must be completed to determine whether a Veteran qualifies for cost-free services or to what extent they are required to make long-care co-pays. Unlike co-pays for other VA health care services, which are based on fixed changes for all long-term care co-pay changes are individually adjusted based on each Veteran's financial status. ==Home health care== Home health care includes VA's Skilled Home Health Care Services (SHHC) and Homemakers and Home Health Aide Services (H/HHA). ===Skilled Home Health Care Services (SHHC)=== * SHHC services are in-home services provided by specially trained personnel, including nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists and social workers. Care includes clinical assessment, treatment planning and treatment provision, health status monitoring, patient and family education, reassessment, referral and follow- up. ===Homemakers/Home Health Aide Services (H/HHA)=== * H/HHA Services are personal care and related support services that enable frail or disabled Veterans to live at home. ===Family Caregivers Program=== * VA's Family Caregivers Program provides support and assistance to caregivers of post 9/11 Veterans and Servicemembers being medically discharged. Eligible primary Family Caregivers can receive a stipend, training, mental health services, travel and lodging reimbursement, and access to health insurance if they are not already under a health plan care. Each state has their own criteria and Board Members for approval, denial, and appeal. ==Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT)== The Department of Veterans Affairs' Office of Patient Care Services has a Primary Care Program Office that has implemented a new patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model at VHA primary care sites. This PCMH model is referred to as Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT). PAC Teams provide accessible, patient-centered care and are managed by primary care providers with the active involvement of other clinical and non-clinical staff. Veteran patients will be at the center of a \\"teamlet,\\" which will include a primary care provider, RN care manager, LPN/health tech, and a medical support assistant (MSA). This teamlet is supported by a broader \\"team,\\" which includes social workers, dieticians, pharmacists, and mental health specialists. Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs) are being implemented at all VA Primary Care Sites, including VA Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC). ==VA dental Care== For VA dental care a veteran must have a service-connected compensable dental disability or condition. Those who were prisoners of war (POWs) and those whose service-connected disabilities have been rated at 100 percent or who are receiving the 100 percent rate by reason of individual unemployability (IU) are eligible for any needed dental care, as are those veterans actively engaged in a 38 USC Chapter 31 vocational rehabilitation program and veterans enrolled who may be homeless and receiving care under VHA Directive 2007-039. ==Transplant service== If the need arises, veterans are eligible for transplant service. The request will be coordinated by the Primary Care Team. ==Vet Centers== The Vet Center Program was established by Congress in 1979 in response to the readjustment problems that a significant number of Vietnam-era veterans were continuing to experience after their return from combat. In subsequent years, Congress extended eligibility to all combat veterans who served on active duty from previous conflicts. All community based Vet Centers provide readjustment counseling, outreach services and referral services to help veterans make a satisfying post-war readjustment to civilian life. Services are also available for their family members for military related issues. Vet Centers are staffed with small multidisciplinary teams some of whom are combat veterans themselves. ==OEF/OIF/OND veteransOEF/OIF/OND Care Management Team=== The Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) Care Management Team helps returning service members achieve a smooth transition of health care services. A specialized OEF/OIF/OND care management team provides case management and care coordination for all severely ill, injured and impaired combat veterans, including those suffering from: * Mental illness * Traumatic brain injury * Spinal cord injury * Blindness * Burns * Amputation * Terminal Illness/Injury * Polytrauma * Other conditions not mentioned above that cause significant impairment to daily living ==Domiciliary Care Program== The Domiciliary Care Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs provides residential rehabilitative and clinical care to veterans who have a wide range of problems, illnesses, or rehabilitative care needs which can be medical, psychiatric, substance use, homelessness, vocational, educational, or social. The Domiciliary Care Program provides a 24-hour therapeutic setting utilizing a peer and professional support environment. The programs provide a strong emphasis on psychosocial rehabilitation and recovery services that instill personal responsibility to achieve optimal levels of independence upon discharge to independent or supportive community living. The VA Domiciliary Care Program also provides rehabilitative care for homeless veterans. * Eligibility: VA may provide domiciliary care to veterans whose annual gross household income does not exceed the maximum annual rate of VA pension or to veterans who the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines have no adequate means of support. The copays for extended care services apply to domiciliary care. ==VA travel reimbursement== Veterans may be eligible for mileage reimbursement or special mode transport in association with obtaining VA health care services if the veteran has a service-connected rating of 30 percent or more, or is traveling for treatment of a service-connected condition, receives a VA pension, the veteran's income does not exceed the maximum annual VA pension rate, the veteran is traveling for a scheduled compensation or pension examination, is in certain emergency situations. has a medical condition that requires a special mode of transportation and travel is pre-authorized, as are certain non-veterans when related to care of a veteran (caregivers, attendants and donors). ==Federal benefits for veterans, dependents and survivorsMedical programs=== * The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) is a health benefit program in which the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) shares the cost of certain health care services and supplies with eligible beneficiaries. The program is available to spouses and children of veterans with permanent and total service-connected disability ineligible for the DoD TRICARE. The surviving spouse or child of a veteran who died from a VA service-connected disability, or who at the time of death was rated permanently and total disabled. Similarly to TRICARE, CHAMPVA beneficiaries are also accepted by TRICARE providers. * The Spina Bifida Program (SB). Is a comprehensive health care benefits program administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs for birth children of certain Vietnam and Korea War veterans who have been diagnosed with spina bifida (except spina bifida occulta). The SB program provides reimbursement for inpatient and outpatient medical services, pharmacy, durable medical equipment, and supplies. * The Children of Women Vietnam Veterans (CWVV) Health Care Program. Is a federal health benefits program administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs for children of women Vietnam War veterans born with certain birth defects. The CWVV Program provides reimbursement for medical care related to covered birth defects and conditions associated with the covered birth defect except for spina bifida. == Controversies  Coronavirus (COVID-19) === In the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, 5,000,000 masks meant for hospitals of the Veterans Health Administration were seized by FEMA and redirected to the Strategic National Stockpile, stated Richard Stone, Executive in Charge, Veterans Health Administration. After an appeal from Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie to FEMA, the agency provided the VA with 500,000 masks. According to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News, at VA‚Äôs Greater LA Healthcare System, medical personnel caring for patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 would receive only a single surgical mask per shift rather than the N95 respirators recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those working in parts of the hospital without positive COVID-19 cases would be issued only a single surgical mask each week. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) has filed an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) complaint with the Department of Labor regarding safety or health hazards at VA facilities. Veterans Affairs lists current statistics on confirmed infections and deaths due to COVID-19. , VA has 9,771 confirmed cases and 771 deaths. ==See also== * Veterans benefits for post-traumatic stress disorder in the United States * EBenefits * Gerontology * Rehabilitation Research and Development Service ==References== ==External links== *Veterans Health Administration Category:Healthcare in the United States Category:United States Department of Veterans Affairs ","title":"Veterans Health Administration"},{"id":"832314","text":"Military Policlinic in Legionowo, Poland. A clinic (or outpatient clinic or ambulatory care clinic) is a health facility that is primarily focused on the care of outpatients. Clinics can be privately operated or publicly managed and funded. They typically cover the primary care needs of populations in local communities, in contrast to larger hospitals which offer more specialised treatments and admit inpatients for overnight stays. Most commonly, the English word clinic refers to a general practice, run by one or more general practitioners offering small therapeutic treatments, but it can also mean a specialist clinic. Some clinics retain the name \\"clinic\\" even while growing into institutions as large as major hospitals or becoming associated with a hospital or medical school. == Overview == A medpunkt (health care access point) delivers primary health care to the residents of the village of Veliki Vrag in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia. Clinics are often associated with a general medical practice run by one or several general practitioners. Other types of clinics are run by the type of specialist associated with that type: physical therapy clinics by physiotherapists and psychology clinics by clinical psychologists, and so on for each health profession. (This can even hold true for certain services outside the medical field: for example, legal clinics are run by lawyers.) Some clinics are operated in-house by employers, government organizations, or hospitals, and some clinical services are outsourced to private corporations which specialize in providing health services. In China, for example, owners of such clinics do not have formal medical education. There were 659,596 village clinics in China in 2011. Health care in India, China, Russia and Africa is provided to those regions' vast rural areas by mobile health clinics or roadside dispensaries, some of which integrate traditional medicine. In India these traditional clinics provide ayurvedic medicine and unani herbal medical practice. In each of these countries, traditional medicine tends to be a hereditary practice. == Etymology == The entrance to a surgery clinic in Greenwich, London. The word clinic derives from Ancient Greek klinein meaning to slope, lean or recline. Hence klinƒì is a couch or bed and klinikos is a physician who visits his patients in their beds.Œ∫ŒªŒπŒΩŒπŒ∫œåœÇ in A Greek‚ÄìEnglish Lexicon. Retrieved 2016-09-18.

An early use of the word clinic was \\"one who receives baptism on a sick bed\\".Clinic, Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, 1913. == Function == Policlinic in Karl-Marx-Stadt, German Democratic Republic. The function of clinics differs from country to country. For instance, a local general practice run by a single general practitioner provides primary health care and is usually run as a for-profit business by the owner, whereas a government-run specialist clinic may provide subsidised or specialised health care. Some clinics function as a place for people with injuries or illnesses to come and be seen by a triage nurse or other health worker. In these clinics, the injury or illness may not be serious enough to require a visit to an emergency room (ER), but the person can be transferred to one if needed. Treatment at these clinics is often less expensive than it would be at a casualty department. Also, unlike an ER these clinics are often not open on a 24/7/365 basis. They sometimes have access to diagnostic equipment such as X-ray machines, especially if the clinic is part of a larger facility. Doctors at such clinics can often refer patients to specialists if the need arises. == Large outpatient clinics == Children Policlinic in Moscow-Novokosino. Large outpatient clinics vary in size, but can be as large as hospitals. === Function === Typical large outpatient clinics house general medical practitioners (GPs) such as doctors and nurses to provide ambulatory care and some acute care services but lack the major surgical and pre- and post-operative care facilities commonly associated with hospitals. Policlinic in Vilnius-Karolini≈°kƒós, Lithuania. Besides GPs, if a clinic is a polyclinic, it can house outpatient departments of some medical specialties, such as gynecology, dermatology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, neurology, pulmonology, cardiology, and endocrinology. In some university cities, polyclinics contain outpatient departments for the entire teaching hospital in one building. === Internationally === Policlinic in P√≠sek, the Czech Republic. Large outpatient clinics are a common type of healthcare facility in many countries, including France, Germany (long tradition), Switzerland, and most of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (often using a mixed Soviet-German model), as well as in former Soviet republics such as Russia and Ukraine; and in many countries across Asia and Africa.Google In Europe, especially in the Central and Eastern Europe, bigger outpatient health centres, commonly in cities and towns, are called policlinics (derived from the word polis, not from poly-). Recent Russian governments have attempted to replace the policlinic model introduced during Soviet times with a more western model. However, this has failed. In Czechia, many policlinics were privatized or leasehold and decentralized in the post-communist era: some of them are just lessors and coordinators of a healtcare provided by private doctor's offices in the policlinic building.David Rath: Trnit√° cesta privatizace ƒçesk√©ho zdravotnictv√≠, Hospod√°≈ôsk√© noviny, 10 September 1996 India has also set up huge numbers of polyclinics for former defence personnel. The network envisages 426 polyclinics in 343 districts of the country which will benefit about 33 lakh (3.3 million) ex-servicemen residing in remote and far- flung areas. Polyclinics are also the backbone of Cuba's primary care system and have been credited with a role in improving that nation's health indicators.Cuba‚Äôs primary health care revolution: 30 years on, Bulletin of the World Health Organization === Mobile clinics === A mobile health clinic operated from a truck. Providing health services through mobile clinics provides accessible healthcare services to these remote areas that have yet to make their way in the politicized space. For example, mobile clinics have proved helpful in dealing with new settlement patterns in Costa Rica. Before foreign aid organizations or the state government became involved in healthcare, Costa Rica's people managed their own health maintenance and protection. People relied on various socio-cultural adaptations and remedies to prevent illnesses, such as personal hygiene and settlement patterns. When new settlements that sprang up along the coast became \\"artificial\\" communities, and due to lack of traditional home healing practices here, alternative methods such as mobile clinics had to be implemented in these communities for the protection and prevention of diseases. A study done in rural Namibia revealed the health changes of orphans, vulnerable children and non-vulnerable children (OVC) visiting a mobile clinic where health facilities are far from the remote villages. Over 6 months, information on immunization status, diagnosis of anemia, skin and intestinal disorders, nutrition, dental disorders was collected and showed that visits to mobile clinics improved the overall health of children that visited regularly. It concluded that specified \\"planning of these programs in areas with similarly identified barriers may help correct the health disparities among Namibian OVC and could be a first step in improving child morbidity and mortality in difficult-to-reach rural areas.\\" A mobile clinic run from a pickup truck in Yemen. Food supplementation in the context of routine mobile clinic visits also shows to have improved the nutritional status of children, and it needs further exploration as a way to reduce childhood malnutrition in resource-scarce areas. A cross-sectional study focussed on comparing acute and chronic undernutrition rates prior to and after a food-supplementation program as an adjunct to routine health care for children of migrant workers residing in rural communities in the Dominican Republic. Rates of chronic undernutrition decreased from 33% to 18% after the initiation of the food-supplementation program and shows that the community members attending the mobile clinics are not just passively receiving the information but are incorporating it and helping keep their children nourished. == Types == Storefront clinic in Manhattan. There are many different types of clinics providing outpatient services. Such clinics may be public (government-funded) or private medical practices. * A CLSC are in Quebec; they are a type of free clinic funded by the provincial government; they provide service not covered by Canada's healthcare plan including social workers * In the United States, a free clinic provides free or low-cost healthcare for those without insurance. * A retail- based clinic is housed in supermarkets and similar retail outlets providing walk-in health care, which may be staffed by nurse practitioners. * A general out-patient clinic offers general diagnoses or treatments without an overnight stay. * A polyclinic or policlinic provides a range of healthcare services (including diagnostics) without need of an overnight stay * A specialist clinic provides advanced diagnostic or treatment services for specific diseases or parts of the body. This type contrasts with general out-patient clinics. ** A sexual health clinic deals with sexual health related problems, such as prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections. ** A fertility clinic aims to help women and couples to become pregnant. ** An abortion clinic is a medical facility providing abortion and related medical services to women. ** An ambulatory surgery clinic offers outpatient or same day surgery services, usually for surgical procedures less complicated than those requiring hospitalization. **An ultrasound clinic offers medical ultrasound investigations for patients. An ultrasound clinic is normally run privately. === Examples === * Tavistock Clinic, part of the British NHS, was founded in the 1920s. One of its most celebrated members was R D Laing. * The Suitcase Clinic, the Berkeley Free Clinic, and the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic are examples of free clinics. * Christian Medical College & Hospital in Vellore, India has extensive roadside dispensaries and began as a one-bed clinic in 1900. * The Edmonton Clinic is a joint venture of the University of Alberta and government health care body Capital health, expected to be completed in 2011. * The Shyness Clinic founded by Zimbardo to assist those disabled by public or private shyness. * La Borde clinic in the Loire valley France, is an innovative psychiatric clinic where patients are liberated to actively participate in the running of the facility. * The Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Marshfield Clinic and Lahey Clinic are examples of comprehensive health care systems, all having begun as much smaller group practices that have since grown into large medical programs in the United States, whilst retaining their names. * The Gary Burnstein Community Health Clinic, a non-profit, volunteer-supported Free Clinic in Pontiac, Michigan. * The Balaji Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation Clinic \\"for muscle, joint, back pain, stroke and spine rehabilitation treatments\\"http://www.bprc.in/page/1 in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. == See also == * Healthcare provider * Health center * Health systems management * Healthcare system * Nurse-led clinic * Polyclinics in England * Walk-in clinic == References == Category:Types of health care facilities ","title":"Clinic"},{"id":"832326","text":"A colourfully decorated classical ballet tutu, on a dress form The tutu is a dress worn as a costume in a classical ballet performance, often with attached bodice.Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell, \\"Tutu,\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Dance (Oxford University Press, 2000). It may be made of tarlatan, muslin, silk, tulle, gauze, or nylon. Modern tutus have two basic types: the Romantic tutu is soft and bell-shaped, reaching the calf or ankle; the Classical tutu is short and stiff, projecting horizontally from the waist and hip. ==Etymology== The word tutu can refer to only the skirt part of the costume. The bodice and tutu make up what is, most of the time, the entire costume, but referred to as just the tutu. This employs synecdoche, where the part of the skirt can embody the whole. The derivation of the word tutu is unknown. The word was not recorded anywhere until 1881. One theory is that it is simply derived from the word tulle (one of the materials from which it is made). Tutu comes from the slang of French children that refers to the buttocks (cul). During that era, the abonn√©s (rich male subscribers at the Paris Opera Ballet) were encouraged to mix with the ballet girls in the foyer, and arrange assignations. It is suggested the expression came from the abonn√©s playfully patting the back of the tulle dress with the saying pan-pan cucul (French for I'll spank your bottom). A third, related theory suggests a derivation from the more vulgar French word, \\"cul\\" (which can be used to refer to the bottom or genital area). During this era, women (including dancers) wore pantalettes as underwear, which were open at the crotch. The abonn√©s favoured the very front rows in the hope of a scandalous view, and the skirt was modified for that reason. This is supported by the description by nineteenth-century balletomane, Charles Nuitter, who defined tutu as \\"a slang term for the very short petticoat worn by danseuses in the interest of modesty.\\" ==History== Marie Taglioni (1829) is believed to be the first person to sport the tutu, but the first designs of tutus actually originated two years before Taglioni performed on stage. Hippolyte Lecomte designed the basic silhouette of the Romantic tutu for Pauline Montessu in La Somnambule (1827); Taglioni‚Äôs Sylphide costume‚Äôs designs were not actually found. Ivor Guest points out the costume is very similar to what ballerinas would wear in class. The part of Creuse in Noverre‚Äôs ballet Jason et Med√©e was danced by Mlle Guimard who wore a pale dress in 1770. The La Sylphide tutu may have been inspired by the use of muslin petticoats to give the skirt volume instead of using the usual hoops. Towards the end of the 17th century, female dresses had higher waistlines and became slimmer as well; dancers appeared to begin dancing without panniers (hips hoops to accentuate skirt designs) for a more natural theme that displayed the human body and allowed more freedom in movements. These translated well in costumes in order to accent the lines of the dancers. Skin-colored tights were also worn with these evolved form-fitting costumes to preserve modesty, but replace the unseemly shapes of knickers. However, the skirt that became known specifically as the romantic tutu made its first appearance in 1832 at the Paris Opera, where Marie Taglioni wore a gauzy white skirt cut to reveal her ankles, designed by Eugene Lami in La Sylphide.Ivor Guest, The Romantic Ballet in Paris (Alton, Hampshire: Dance Books, 2008), From the late 19th century onwards, the tutu was steadily shortened, for ease of movement and to show off the dancer's legs. Romantic tutus were effective in portraying the ethereal creatures that exist in many ballet repertoires, but as ballet became more modernized, the flouncy but stiff tutus would be replaced by softer more relaxed skirts. The traditional tutu is a symbol of historical dance and its past. During the twentieth century, the tutu reached its peak form with a platelike shape; French critic Andr√© Levinson highlighted the contrast between the stiff and immobile features of the skirt and the energetic and alive movements of the dancers. At the end of the century, human bodies were able to move without being weighed down by heavy costumes. The tutu‚Äôs simple design and timeless class are the product of countless adaptations to finally present the dancer in a flattering light. Oftentimes, tutus and costumes evolved alongside fashion during their respective eras. Skirts became shorter, fuller, and necklines were even lowered in the 1870s to display ‚Äúsexual attractiveness.‚Äù Fashion designers have often been involved in design for ballet.Judith Chazin-Bennahum, The Lure of Perfection: Fashion and Ballet, 1780-1830 (New York: Routledge, 2005), Fashion designers including Cecil Beaton, Christian Lacroix, and Isaac Mizrahi in the United States have all designed tutus. Among the leading makers of tutus around the world, few designers have matched the reputation of Barbara Karinska (1886-1983), Ukrainian costumer for the New York City Ballet for many years, She designed and constructed tutus of extraordinary beauty and durability.Toni Bentley, Costumes by Karinska, with a foreword by Edward Gorey (New York: Abrams, 1995), ==Styles== The Romantic tutu is still based on Marie Taglioni's original costume, though modern materials mean it is lighter and may be more transparent. The hem falls between the knee and ankle.[https://www.thenational.ae/lifestyle/fashion/the-complete-history-of- the-tutu-1.768301 The complete history of the tutu], The National, Sarah Maisey, September 9, 2018 The Inverted Bell tutu is midway between the classical tutu and the Romantic tutu. It is made of several layers of tulle which jut out similar to a classical tutu, but the layers are longer and have a downward droop, usually to mid-thigh. There are several versions of the modern tutu: Classical tutu: a skirt made of 10-12 layers of stiff tulle sewn on to a pantie and basque at hip level. The lower, short layers of tulle support the top layers, making them jut out from the hip. Pancake tutu: this tutu is supported by a hoop and is very flat, with few ruffles.Wardrobes: Types of Tutus Pacific Nortwest Ballet, July 9, 2016 Platter tutu: similar to the pancake tutu but sitting at the waist instead of the hip.

Ford (March 1, 1913 ‚Äì September 23, 1992), aged 79, was an American investor, musician and amateur astronomer specializing in the observation of variable stars. Clinton B. Ford == Birth and family == Clinton Banker Ford, born on March 1, 1913, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was the son of Walter and Edith (Banker) Ford. Ford had one brother, Sylvester Ford (1906‚Äì1956). The Ford side of the family hailed from Oneonta, New York where it survived until the 1930s. Ford's mother's family came from Ovid, New York. Ford's father, Walter, was a mathematics professor at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Ford's first brush with the stars came in August 1927 when he went with his father to Boulder, CO to a meeting of the AMA. It was at this point in his life that Ford first saw the splendor the sky could show. == First brush with the stars == In the Spring of 1927 Professor Ralph Curtiss loaned Ford two books: Splendour of the Heavens and The Friendly Stars. In the back of the latter book's original edition there was an invitation by William Tyler Olcott of the AAVSO to contribute to the advancement of astronomy by observing variable stars. Ford took Olcott and the AAVSO up on that invitation and on September 23, 1927, he reported his first variable star estimate - 184205 R Scuti at 5.3 magnitude. Ford made over 60,000 variable star observations and became the youngest member of the American Association of Variable Star Observers at the age of fifteen. == The voyage to Europe == Ford, by virtue of a sabbatical his father took, was lucky enough to tour Europe, the Middle East, and Egypt when he was fifteen. Ford spent his sixteenth birthday in Alexandretta. Among several adventures Ford had at the time, one included climbing to the top of the Great Pyramid and carving his name into it. Ford also visited several observatories, astronomers, and museums. He used the 6\\" refractor at the University of Leiden, for example, to make 36 variable star estimates for the AAVSO at this time. Later he visited American astronomer George W. Ritchey then on staff at the Observatoire de Paris where Ritchey told Ford all about his wish to create the 300\\" Apalantic Supertelescope. We now know this general design today as the Ritchey-Chr√©tien telescope. Ford also attended a meeting of the Soci√©t√© Astronomique de France while in Paris. Ford's astronomical adventures in Europe were brought to a conclusion when he visited Greenwich Observatory and stood, on May 31, \\"right below the transit slit, with one foot at 23h 59m 59.999s and the other one at 00h 00m 00.001s.\\" == High school and college == Upon returning from Europe, and as he finished high school, Ford found himself working for the aging Professor Edwin B. Frost at Yerkes Observatory, partially on the strength of an article he'd written for Popular Astronomy magazine. While at Yerkes he managed to do some variable star observing with some of the smaller telescopes, trace copies of the AAVSO charts that were in the Yerkes files, and learn about developing astronomical plates. College saw Ford at the University of Michigan. Here he nearly decided to major in English and waited until his sophomore year to take his first astronomy course. In August and September 1932 Ford traveled to Maine to view the total solar eclipse on August 31. In the spring of 1933 Ford resolved to \\"return to science\\" with regard to his studies. A year later he gained Professor Heber D. Curtis, famous for his part in the Shapley-Curtis Debate on the nature of the galaxy, as his advisor. == Post-college == He served in the US Navy in World War II. Later in life, he played violin with the Stamford Symphony Orchestra of Stamford, Connecticut. He became a member of the Ithaca College Board of Trustees in 1966 and was awarded honorary status in 1988. The college has named its observatory in his honor.October 29, 1998 - Board names observatory He was famous in amateur astronomical circles for his quote: \\"Never sleep more than 90 feet from your telescope.\\" In 1987 he won the Amateur Achievement Award of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. The AAVSO: Headquarters headquarters of the AAVSO in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is named the Clinton B. Ford Astronomical Data and Research Center. When he died, aged 79, he bequeathed a substantial endowment to the AAVSO, which continues to serve as its primary source of operating income. == Ford Observatories == The AAVSO previously owned the Ford Observatory named in his honor in southern California, near Wrightwood (Observatory Code 674); it was donated to the Los Angeles Astronomical Society (LAAS) in 2012. Ithaca College in New York owns another observatory of the same name, Ford Observatory, named in his honor in 1998 (Observatory Code 845); it was previously known as Ithaca College Observatory. ==Amateur music== Ford was an avid amateur violinist and chamber music player. He carried his violin with him on travels and in every location sought out local players to join him in string quartet sessions. He was one of the leading amateur musicians in the Associated Chamber Music Players (ACMP), an organization that encourages amateur chamber music and publishes an international directory of chamber music players. On his death, he bequeathed 6 million dollars to ACMP to establish a fund to advance chamber music education. == See also == * List of observatory codes * Associated Chamber Music Players == Bibliography == * AAVSO, Some Stars, Some Music: The Memoirs of Clinton B.

A special constable, in most cases, is not a member of a special police force (SPF); in countries in the Commonwealth of Nations and often elsewhere, a special constable is a voluntary or part-time member of a national or local police force or a person involved in law enforcement who is not a police officer but has some of the powers of a police officer. ==Canada== \\"Special police\\" is not a term used in Canada. The closest term used is Special Constables, which exist in several forms with various degrees of Peace Officer powers according to their duties and employers (most government). In general, Special Constables do not carry firearms, but may employ other equipment for protection. ==China== In the People's Republic of China, the Special Police Units are the local equivalent of the U.S. SWAT teams. They are tasked with duties that normal patrol officers are not sufficiently equipped to handle, such as riot control and hostage situations. In addition, the Beijing Special Weapons and Tactics Unit and Snow Leopard Commando Unit also fulfill different duties. ==Croatia== ATJ Luƒçko In Croatia, Special Police serve as special operations forces trained primarily for anti-terrorism operations. Unlike many western SWAT teams, Croatian Special Police officers are full-time, professional operators with no secondary duties. A total of four Special Police units exist in cities of Osijek, Rijeka, Split and Zagreb covering their respective regions. A fifth and most elite unit, ATJ Luƒçko is stationed in Zagreb and has jurisdiction over the entire country. ==Former Yugoslavia== Special police of North Macedonia The Special Police were a branch of the Regular Police who were used for restoring peace and stability if it had been heavily disturbed, counter- terrorism, countering violent groups, and repressing riots (especially in prisons). The Special Police also provided security and public peace, investigated and prevented organized crime, terrorism and other violent groups; protected state and private property; and helped and assisted civilians and other emergency forces in cases of emergency, natural disasters, civil unrest and armed conflicts. ==Greece== Eidiki Katastaltiki Antitromokratiki Monada or EKAM (Special Anti-Terrorist Unit), was created in 1978 and became part of the Hellenic Police.

The National Crime Agency (whose full powers are limited to England and Wales) is not a police force but an agency responsible to a Secretary of State; however, officers are 'triple warranted' ‚Äì with powers of a police officer, immigration officer and customs officer. ==United States== In United States terminology, special police can mean: *Auxiliary police, members of volunteer, unpaid or paid, part-time civilian police, security officer units, interns; *Company police; *Fire police, members of specialized traffic control units responding with volunteer fire companies; *Security police; or *Special Law Enforcement Officers - used in New Jersey to supplement full-time police officers; The term can also refer to limited police power granted in some jurisdictions to lifeguards, SPCA personnel, teachers, and other public sector employees which is incidental to their main responsibilities. Special Police Officers (or SPO's) can be employed to protect large campuses such as theme parks, hospital centers, and commerce centers. Some states, such as Maryland,https://mdsp.maryland.gov/Organization/Pages/CriminalInvestigationBureau/LicensingDivision/ProfessionalLicenses/SpecialPolice.aspx New York, and the District of Columbia, grant full State Police/peace officer authority to SPOs for use in whatever area they are employed to protect. They can make traffic stops in their jurisdiction if they have had accredited training. They are also permitted to conduct traffic control and investigations pertaining to the area protected by them, while a majority of SPOS are armed with a firearm, some states permit the age for an SPO to be 18, while still they can not carry a sidearm. Special police can make a criminal arrest and run blue strobe lights on their vehicle. ===California=== The San Francisco Patrol Special Police is a neighborhood police force authorized in the City Charter, with officers appointed and regulated by the Police Commission after an initial security review by the San Francisco Police Department. Hourly rates for service are principally paid by private clients, with some cost to the City for general program administration concerning standards of professional performance, but not concerning day-to-day operations. Thus, the nature of this special police force is both quasi- private and quasi-public. The force has been in operation in the United States, city of San Francisco for over 162 years. By current City Code the force provides patrols on the streets of San Francisco as well as at fixed locations, and also provides a range of other safety services as requested by private clients. ===Kentucky=== In Kentucky, special police officers are Special Law Enforcement Officers (SLEO). They are sworn peace officers with limited jurisdiction. They have full legal police powers; explicitly including arrest authority, the ability to carry a weapon, and use emergency vehicles. However, their jurisdiction is specifically limited to public property that they have been hired to protect. While Kentucky law allows both the State and local governments to use SLEO's, most are used by the Kentucky State Police in the Facilities Security Branch. ===Massachusetts=== In Massachusetts, Special Police Officers are either similar to reserve or part-time police officers and part of a regular police department or they are Special State Police Officers and are part of a college or university police force. Special Police Officers attend and graduate from the MA Municipal Police Training Council Reserve & Intermittent Police Officers Academyhttp://www.wellesleypolice.com/index.cfm?pid=10402 There are also a plethora of special police officers who work in the city of Boston; these officers either work directly for the city (school police, municipal protective service, health commission police, housing police, or BFD arson investigators) or for private security companies. The city of Boston requires these agencies to attend a Boston Police approved academy, that is 160 hours. The state requires all reserve/intermittent officers to complete 372.5 hours of training, with an additional 56 hours for those carrying a weapon. === New Jersey === In New Jersey, Special Law Enforcement Officers are used to supplement full-time police officers. There are currently three classes of special law enforcement officers. Class I SLEO's are allowed to conduct routine traffic detail, spectator control, and similar duties, but are not authorized to carry a firearm while on duty. Class II SLEO patch, worn on the right shoulder of the uniform. Class II SLEO'S are permanent, regularly appointed full-time police officers. They're authorized to carry a firearm. Class III SLEO's are retired fully trained police officers who are under the age of 65 years old. They serve on a part-time basis and authorized to provide security while on school or college premises during hours when the school or college is normally in session or when occupied by students, teachers, or professors. These Officers do not replace regular law enforcement officers or school resource officers currently employed in schools. By law, all armed SLEO's must return their firearm to the station house unless the firearm is owned by the SLEO in compliance with unit policy on personally owned firearms. All Class II and Class III SLEO's are fully trained and certified police officers in the State of New Jersey. Class I SLEO's go through different certifications, but still have police officer status. Class Two Officers in Newark carry weapons off duty. ===New Orleans, Louisiana=== The Superintendent of the New Orleans Department in accordance with New Orleans Home Rule Charter section 4-502 (2) (a) (b) and New Orleans Municipal Code 17271 MCS 90-86, may deputize private Security Guards, within the city limits, with limited Police Power as New Orleans Police Special Officers. Louisiana R.S. 40:1379.1 (b) states the Special Officer, when performing those tasks requiring a Special Officer's commission, shall have the same powers and duties as a Peace Officer, however, that when not performing these tasks directly related to the special officer's commission, he shall be regarded as a private citizen and his commission shall not be in effect. Special Officers may make arrest for felony or misdemeanor offenses on the property or area they are to protect, patrol, or in relation to their direct assignment. However, Special Officers still may make an arrest, as a private person, for a felony, whether in or out of his presence, under Louisiana Law CCRP Art.214 Arrest by private person; when lawful. ===North Carolina=== In North Carolina, some private companies have their own special police forces. These include hospitals, hotels, race tracks, and shopping malls and are more properly referred to as \\"Company Police\\". There are also companies that offer contract special police services for a fee to anyone who has property they wish to protect. In the state of North Carolina, special police differ greatly from security companies. North Carolina Special police officers have full arrest powers on any property they are hired to protect within the state as granted by the North Carolina Attorney General. Special police officers must also attend and pass the Basic Law Enforcement Training program like all other police officers. Security officers do not have arrest powers as their job is to mainly observe and report. ===Oregon=== Historically, Oregon had many more special police officers than the state does presently, beginning in the 19th century. While the roles they served have largely been replaced by more conventional law enforcement officers, some special police officers and the authorities for commissioning them remain. For instance, under Oregon law, mayors or similar officials who oversee a municipal water supply system are permitted to appoint special police officers which possess police powers for the purposes of maintaining the purity of drinking water. The regional government Metro appoints special police for the purposes of enforcing parking laws and codes. The city of Portland also commissions special police officers for this purpose. ===Smithsonian Museum Special Police in NY, Virginia, & DC=== The Smithsonian museum utilizes federal employees designated as \\"special police\\" under the United States Code (Title 10, Chapter 63, ¬ß6306). These officers patrol Smithsonian property in New York, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Smithsonian Special Police Officers carry firearms, mace and handcuffs and have arrest authority on federal Smithsonian property. ===Texas=== The Texas Special Police were formed along with the Texas State Police during the administration of Texas Governor Edmund J. Davis on July 22, 1870, to combat crime statewide in Texas.Ann Patton Baenziger, \\"The Texas State Police during Reconstruction: A Reexamination,\\" Southwestern Historical Quarterly 72 (April 1969) There were thirty special policemen assigned as auxiliary officers throughout the state. On April 22, 1873, the law authorizing the state police was repealed by the newly-elected Democrat ic- controlled state legislature.John G. Johnson, \\"STATE POLICE,\\" Handbook of Texas Online (http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/jls02), accessed April 09, 2015. Uploaded on June 15, 2010. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. Texas state law authorizes mayors to appoint special police officers to enforce the municipality's laws, avert danger, or protect life or property; because of riot, outbreak, calamity, or public disturbance; or because of threat of serious violation of law or order, of outbreak, or of other danger to the municipality or its inhabitants. (¬ß 341.011. SPECIAL POLICE FORCE IN TYPE A GENERAL-LAW) ===Virginia=== Virginia possesses special police officers employed, typically, in the private police field. These officers are regulated by the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services and are termed special conservators of the peace (SCOP). These officers must meet specific training requirements and be sworn in by the district court judge or magistrate in the area where they request a commission. These officers, when so sworn and certified, are permitted to utilize the term 'police' and are permitted to operate emergency vehicles equipped with red flashing/strobing lights (municipal law enforcement operates either blue or combinations of blue and red). This class of officer should not be confused with armed security officers who in Virginia possess arrest authority on property they are employed to protect. Armed security officers do not have fresh pursuit authority (off of their grounds/property) whereas SCOP officers do. ===Washington DC=== Washington utilizes special police in both the public and private security sectors. Most work for private security companies although many security officers in the Washington DC area also have special police status. Special police are required to be licensed and are appointed by the Mayor ==Spain== GEO ===Catalonia=== Operations jurisdiction: GEI Special intervention group (GEI) in catalan: Grup Especial d'Intervenci√≥. this area It was created in 1984 with the collaboration of the Spezialeinsatzkommando (SEK) of Germany. ==Vietnam== The Ministry of Public Security has a High Command of Mobile Police Force.

Maritime geography is often discussed in terms of three loosely defined regions: brown water, green water, and blue water. ==Definitions== The elements of maritime geography are loosely defined and their meanings have changed throughout history. The USA's 2010 Naval Operations Concept defines blue water as \\"the open ocean\\", green water as \\"coastal waters, ports and harbors\\", and brown water as \\"navigable rivers and their estuaries\\". Robert Rubel of the US Naval War College includes bays in his definition of brown water, and in the past US military commentators have extended brown water out to from shore. During the Cold War, green water denoted those areas of ocean in which naval forces might encounter land-based aircraft and brown water, land-based artillery. The development of long-range bombers with antiship missiles turned most of the oceans to \\"green\\" and the term all but disappeared. After the Cold War, US amphibious taskforces were sometimes referred to as the green-water navy, in contrast to the blue- water carrier battlegroups. This distinction disappeared as increasing threats in coastal waters forced the amphibious ships further offshore, delivering assaults by helicopter and tiltrotor from over the horizon. This prompted the development of ships designed to operate in such waters - the Zumwalt class destroyer and the littoral combat ships. Rubel has proposed redefining green water as those areas of ocean which are too dangerous for high-value units, requiring offensive power to be dispersed into smaller vessels such as submarines that can use stealth and other characteristics to survive. Under his scheme brown water would be zones in which ocean-going units could not operate at all, including rivers, minefields, straits and other choke points. ==RegionsBrown water=== The brown water environment starts from the shoreline through to the end of the continental shelf. A brown-water navy focuses on coastal operations and primarily takes a defensive role. ===Green water=== The green water environment extends from the outer edge of the brown- water layer past any continental shelves, archipelagos and islands; perhaps a few hundred miles from shore. It is the most important maritime arena, including most coastal traffic and territorial waters, in which are found the great majority of a nation‚Äôs maritime police, customs, environmental, and economic concerns. A green-water navy is capable of defense of its nation in depth and is a significant offensive force within its territory. ===Blue water=== The blue water environment extends from the outer edge of the green- water zone to the deep ocean of the world. A blue-water navy can project its nation's power throughout the world. The blue water policy was a long-standing political philosophy in Britain in the 18th century, which sought to advance British power through use of the Royal Navy, although the term \\"blue water\\" did not appear until 1834.Shorter OED ==See also== *Littoral zone ==References== Category:Oceanography ","title":"Maritime geography"},{"id":"832465","text":"Der Hamburger und Germania Ruder Club (DHuGRC) is a rowing club from Rotherbaum, Hamburg, Germany.

He described many mollusks of the Pacific Northwest of America, and was for many years America's preeminent authority on living and fossil mollusks. Dall also made substantial contributions to ornithology, vertebrate and invertebrate zoology, physical and cultural anthropology, oceanography and paleontology. In addition he carried out meteorological observations in Alaska for the Smithsonian Institution. ==BiographyEarly life=== Dall was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His father Charles Henry Appleton Dall, (1816‚Äì86), a Unitarian minister, moved in 1855 to India as a missionary. His family however stayed in Massachusetts, where Dall's mother Caroline Wells Healey was a teacher, transcendentalist, reformer, and pioneer feminist. In 1862, Dall's father, on one of his few brief visits home, brought his son in contact with some naturalists at Harvard University, where he had studied, and in 1863, when Dall graduated from high school, he took a keen interest in mollusks. In 1863 he became a pupil of Louis Agassiz of Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology, in natural science. He encouraged Dall's interest in malacology, a field still in its infancy. He also studied anatomy and medicine under Jeffries Wyman and Dr. Daniel Brainerd.Short biography and bibliography of W.H. Dall ===First positions, first expeditions=== Village on the lower Yukon during fishing season, June 1868, from an original sketch by Dall Dall's 1875 map showing the distribution of native tribes in Alaska Dall about 1888 Dall took a job in Chicago. There he met the famous naturalist Robert Kennicott (1835‚Äì1866) at the Chicago Academy of Sciences Museum. In 1865 the Western Union Telegraph Expedition was mounted to find a possible route for a telegraph line between North America and Russia by way of the Bering Sea. Kennicott was selected as the scientist for this expedition, and with the influence of Spencer Fullerton Baird of the Smithsonian Institution, he took Dall as his assistant, because of his expertise in invertebrates and fish. Aboard the clipper Nightingale, under the command of the whaler and naturalist Charles Melville Scammon (1825‚Äì1911), Dall explored the coast of Siberia, with first several stops in Alaska (still Russian territory at that time). Scammon Bay, Alaska was named after Charles Scammon. In 1866, Dall continued this expedition to Siberia. On a stop at St. Michael, Alaska, he was informed that Kennicott had died of a heart attack on May 13, 1866, while prospecting a possible telegraph route along the Yukon River. Set on finishing Kennicott's Yukon River work, Dall stayed on the Yukon during the winter. Because of cancellation of his own expedition, he had to continue this work at his own expense until autumn 1868. Meanwhile, in 1867, the U.S. had acquired Alaska from Russia for 7.2 million dollars. This was uncharted country, with a fauna and flora still waiting to be explored and described, a task Dall took upon himself as a surveyor-scientist. Back at the Smithsonian in Washington, he started cataloguing the thousands of specimens he had collected during this expedition. In 1870 he published his account of his pioneering travels in Alaska and Its Resources, describing the Yukon River, the geography and resources of Alaska, and its inhabitants. Also in 1870, Dall was appointed Acting Assistant to the United States Coast Survey (renamed the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1878). Dall went on several more reconnaissance and survey missions to Alaska between 1871 and 1874. His official mission was to survey the Alaska coast, but he took the opportunity to acquire specimens, which he collected in great numbers. In 1871‚Äì72, he surveyed the Aleutian Islands. In 1874 aboard the U.S. Coast Survey schooner Yukon, he anchored in Lituya Bay, which he compared to Yosemite Valley in California, had it retained its glaciers. He sent his collection of mollusks, echinoderms, and fossils to Louis Agassiz at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology; plants went to Asa Gray at Harvard; archaeological and ethnological material went to the Smithsonian. In 1877‚Äì1878 he was associated with the Blake expeditions\\", along the East Coast of the United States. The major publications on the Blake Expeditions were published in the Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology Harvard. Dall was in Europe in August 1878, sent to a meeting in Dublin of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He took the opportunity to visit mollusk collections and meet European scholars. ===1880 and after=== Dall married Annette Whitney in 1880. They travelled to Alaska on their honeymoon. After arriving in Sitka, his wife went back home to Washington, D.C. He began his final survey season aboard the schooner Yukon. He was accompanied, among others, by the ichthyologist Tarleton Hoffman Bean (1846‚Äì1916). In 1882 Dall contributed for the Republican Congressional Campaign CommitteeBox 18 Folder 40 William Healey Dall Archives Smithsonian Archives In 1884, Dall left the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, having already written over 400 papers. In 1885 he transferred to the newly created U.S. Geological Survey, obtaining a position as paleontologist. He was assigned to the U.S. National Museum as honorary curator of invertebrate paleontology, studying recent and fossil mollusks. He would hold this position until his death. As part of his work for the U.S. Geological Survey, Dall made trips to study geology and fossils: in the Northwest (1890, 1892, 1895, 1897, 1901, and 1910), in Florida (1891), and Georgia (1893). In 1899 he and an elite crew of scientists, such as the expert in glaciology John Muir, were members of the Harriman Alaska Expedition, aboard the S.S. George W. Elder, along the glacial fjords of the Alaska Coast, the Aleutian Islands and to the Bering Strait. Many new genera and species were described. Dall was the undisputed expert on Alaska, and the scientists aboard were often surprised by his erudition, both in biology and in respect to the cultures of the native Alaskan peoples. His contributions to the reports of the Harriman Alaska Expedition, include a chapter Description and Exploration of Alaska, and Volume 13, Land and Fresh-water Mollusks. He spent two months at the Bishop Museum in Hawaii examining their shell collection. ===Societies and honors=== He was elected member of most of the U.S. scientific societies, vice-president of American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS) (1882, 1885), a founder of the National Geographic Society, and the Philosophical Society of Washington. In 1897 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. He was a Foreign Member of the Geological Society of London. His eminence also earned him several honorary degrees. Mount Dall, an peak in the Alaska Range, now in Denali National Park and Preserve, was named after Dall by A.H. Brooks of the U.S. Geological Survey in 1902. ==Publications== Dall published over 1,600 papers, reviews, and commentaries. He described 5,427 species, many of them mollusks.Florence A.

In an essay about McGinley, Wolf wrote, \\"The skateboarders, musicians, graffiti artists and gay people in Mr. McGinley's early work 'know what it means to be photographed. [...] His subjects are performing for the camera and exploring themselves with an acute self-awareness that is decidedly contemporary. They are savvy about visual culture, acutely aware of how identity can be not only communicated but created. They are willing collaborators.\\"Philip Gefter, The New York Times, Sunday, May 6, 2007 While he was a student at Parsons, McGinley was also the acting photo editor at Vice magazine from 2000 to 2002. McGinley has been long time friends with fellow Lower Manhattan artists Dan Colen and the late Dash Snow. McGinley said of Snow, \\"I guess I get obsessed with people, and I really became fascinated by Dash.\\"\\"\\", Ariel Levy, Chasing Dash Snow, New York, January 7, 2007 Ariel Levy, writing in New York magazine about McGinley's friend and collaborator, Snow, said, \\"People fall in love with McGinley ºs work because it tells a story about liberation and hedonism: Where Goldin and Larry Clark were saying something painful and anxiety producing about Kids and what happens when they take drugs and have sex in an ungoverned urban underworld, McGinley started out announcing that 'The Kids Are Alright,' fantastic, really, and suggested that a gleeful, unfettered subculture was just around the corner‚Äî'still'‚Äîif only you knew where to look.\\" McGinley's early work was primarily shot on 35mm film and using Yashica T4s and Leica R8s. Since 2004, McGinley's style has evolved from documenting his friends in real-life situations towards creating envisioned situations that can be photographed. He casts his subjects at rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll festivals, art schools, and street castings in cities.Horacio Silva (March 18, 2010), Studio Visit  Ryan McGinley T. In describing the essence of youth and adventure central to McGinley's work, Jeffrey Kluger wrote in TIME, \\"Photography is about freezing a moment in time; McGinley's is about freezing a stage in a lifetime. Young and beautiful is as fleeting as a camera snap‚Äî and thus all the more worth preserving.\\" In 2007, critic Philip Gefter wrote, \\"He was a fly on the wall. But then he began to direct the activities, photographing his subjects in a cinema-verite mode. 'I got to the point where I couldn't wait for the pictures to happen anymore,' he said. 'I was wasting time, and so I started making pictures happen. It borders between being set up or really happening. There's that fine line.'\\" This transition to creating work with an emphasis on heavy pre-production is embodied in McGinley's famous summer cross-country road trip series. In a 2014 feature, GQ wrote, \\"His road trips, legendary among city-dwelling creatives under 30 (they all know someone who knows someone who went on one), have been annual summer occasions for almost a decade. McGinley and his assistants start planning the journey in January. They consult maps, newspapers, travel books. It usually starts with a specific desire‚Äîwanting to shoot kids in a cypress tree with Spanish moss, say‚Äîand the trip itself is plotted according to where such a setting can be found.\\" As McGinley continued this series, he began incorporating different elements into his photos, such as shooting with fireworks, animals, and in extreme locations like caves. In conversation with filmmaker Gus Van Sant, McGinley described his practice of making photographs on the road and outside of his New York City based studio, \\"Such a big part of what I do is removing myself and other people from the city. Taking people to these beautiful and remote locations, being together for long periods of time, getting that intimacy, and doing all these intense activities together every day. In a way, it's like a bizarre summer camp or like touring in a rock band or traveling circus. It's all those things combined. Just taking everyone out of their element so you have their full attention.\\" In 2009, McGinley returned to the studio as he began experimenting within the confines of traditional studio portraiture. This was also the beginning of what would by 2010 become an all entirely digital photography practice. The result was his 2010 exhibition, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, at Team Gallery in NYC, where he displayed his first collection of black and white nudes. This series marked a significant shift in the style and production of McGinley's photographs. His continued work within the realm of digital studio portraiture eventually evolved into his Yearbook series. Team Gallery describes the 2014 installation as, \\"(...) a single artwork that consists of over five hundred studio portraits of some two hundred models, always in the nude, printed on vinyl and adhered to every available inch of the gallery's walls and ceilings. The installation's effect is hugely impressive in its standalone visual power, an enveloping entity flooding the entire space with bold color and form. Although the sheer abundance of available images renders a total \\"reading\\" impossible, there is never any sense of incompleteness, as each individual image functions autonomously, granting the viewer access to a delicate, once-private moment.\\" Yearbook is a traveling exhibition, and while it has evolved in size and application process, it has been exhibited internationally in various forms in San Francisco, Amersfoort, Basel, and Tokyo. Throughout his career, McGinley has worked with various high-profile charities. Influenced by the death of his brother in 1995 due to HIV/AIDS-related complications, McGinley is vocally passionate about raising funds for HIV/AIDS awareness and treatment research. At the 2014 amfAR Gala, a photograph donated by McGinley was purchased by Miley Cyrus, who narrowly outbid Tom Ford, for a record breaking price. Also in 2014 McGinley photographed Ines Rau, a transgender person, fully nude for a spread in Playboy magazine called \\"Evolution.\\" In recent years, McGinley has become well-known for the circle of successful younger artists surrounding him and his studio, prompting the New York Times to refer to him as, \\"The Pied Piper of the Downtown Art World\\". McGinley describes his mentorship practices as, \\"In a way, it's a curriculum, as I can give people advice because I‚Äôve been through it.\\" In 2014, McGinley delivered the commencement address at Parsons School of Design. To graduating students he offered the advice, \\"Say yes to almost everything and try new things. Don't be afraid to fail, and don't be afraid to work hard. Do your pictures‚Äîdon't try and do somebody else's pictures. Don't get lost inside your head, and don't worry what camera you‚Äôre using.\\" He continued, \\"I once heard the legendary indie director Derek Jarman had three rules for making his art films: 'Show up early, hold your own light, and don‚Äôt expect to get paid.' That always stuck with me. Approach art like it's your job. Show up for photography every day for eight hours. Take it as seriously as a doctor would medicine.\\" Since 2005, McGinley has periodically lectured and done critiques with MFA photography students at Yale University. He has also been a member of the School of Visual Arts Mentors program. ===Music=== McGinley is credited for the formation of the New York City based band The Virgins after introducing and photographing two of its members in Tulum in 2004. McGinley said of the band, \\"Their lyrics are really poetic and very much about New York and the life that we live.\\"Lauren Gitlin, Spin, November 2007 In 2008, the Icelandic post-rock band Sigur R√≥s used one of McGinley's images for their fifth album Me√∞ su√∞ √≠ eyrum vi√∞ spilum endalaust. The video for the first track from the album, \\"Gobbledigook\\", was inspired by his work. In 2012, McGinley reunited with the band to direct the video for \\"Var√∫√∞\\". The non-profit Art Production Fund partnered with the NYC Taxi Commission to show the film in 3,000 cabs. The following year, it was screened in Times Square as part of Art Production Fund's Midnight Moment series, in which every night at midnight for one month the video played simultaneously on electronic billboards and newspaper kiosks throughout Times Square. McGinley has photographed musicians for both album artwork and editorial projects. In 2012, he provided the artwork for Bat for Lashes's album The Haunted Man. In 2013, he created images for Katy Perry's fourth studio album, Prism. He had also photographed musicians Beyonce for BEAT Magazine, Lady Gaga for Rolling Stone, and Lorde for Dazed and Confused. ===Commercial and Editorial work=== McGinley has contributed editorial assignments to The New York Times Magazine, including his 2004 Olympic Swimmers,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/08/magazine/08OLYMPIC.html?ex=1249704000&en;=de16b8a8cfa99541&ei;=5090&partner;=rssuserland 2008 Oscars Portfolio,https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/magazine/20080210_OSCARS_FEATURE/ and 2010 Winter Olympics.https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/olympics/2010/highfliers/index.html?ref=magazine He has worked in fashion editorial and advertising. In 2009, McGinley helped launch Levi's \\"Go Forth\\" campaign. In 2012 and 2013, he worked with U2 singer Bono on producing a short film and photographs for fashion brand EDUN. Additionally, he has made photographs for beauty and fragrance campaigns by Calvin Klein, Dior, Herm√®s, and Stella McCartney. McGinley has also been featured as a model in campaigns by The Gap, Marc Jacobs, Salvatore Ferragamo, and Uniqlo. ===Short films=== * 2010: Friends Forever * 2010: Entrance Romance * 2010: Pringle of Scotland ‚Äì Spring Summer 2010, with Tilda Swinton (7:59 min.) * 2012: Beautiful Rebels * 2012: Var√∫√∞, for Sigur R√≥s * 2012: The Virgins: Prima Materia * 2013: Mind of its own, for Mercedes-Benz * 2015: We Three, with David Armstrong and Jack Pierson ==Exhibitions== In 2003, the Whitney Museum gave McGinley a solo show as part of their First Exposure series. He has also had solo shows at MoMA P.S.1 in New York (2004), and at the MUSAC in Leon, Spain (2005). In 2005, he was the laureate of the Rencontres d'Arles Discovery Award. In 2007 McGinley exhibited Irregular Regulars at Team Gallery in SoHo. Art critic David Velasco, in his review of the show, wrote, \\"McGinley went on a two-year road trip, traveling to dozens of Morrissey concerts in the US, the UK, and Mexico. The resultant photos, many of which are densely saturated in the concerts‚Äô colored lights, feature candid shots of fans, regularly zooming in for seductive close-ups of enamored youngsters‚Äîa celebration of the ecstatic cult of fame and its ardent enablers.\\"\\"\\", David Velasco, Artforum, January 5, 2007 In 2008 he exhibited I Know Where the Summer Goes, also at Team Gallery. Kluger, writing in Time magazine, said, \\"But his favorite subject remains youth, as his 2008 exhibit, 'I Know Where the Summer Goes,' proves. In that collection, McGinley's troupe travels the country as he photographs them, sometimes clothed and often not, while they leap fences, lounge in a desert, play together in a tree.\\"Jeffrey Kluger, Thursday, May 29, 2008 In 2010, McGinley debuted his first collection of black and white studio nudes, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, at Team Gallery in New York. Later in 2010, McGinley's exhibition Life Adjustment Center was held at Ratio 3 in San Francisco. There he debuted two new portfolios of black and white portraits and color photographs. In 2012, McGinley had simultaneous shows at Team Gallery's two SoHo locations. Animals and Grids juxtaposed two new series of photographs: nudes with animals and large grids of intimate portraits of young concert-goers. In 2013, McGinley exhibited his largest project to date,Yearbook. A collection of hundreds of colorful studio portraits but conceived as a single artwork, the installation covered every available inch of the walls of San Francisco's Ratio 3. In 2014, the exhibition grew larger, this time staged at Team Gallery. Yearbook continued to travel in 2015, showing at Kunsthal kAdE in Amersfoort and Art Unlimited at Art Basel. In 2015, McGinley's work further departed from his summer road trip series with bicoastal exhibitions Fall and Winter, at Team Gallery's SoHo and Venice Beach locations. McGinley's work was also featured in the Guggenheim Museum's 2015 exhibition, Storylines. The show was described as \\"an expansive view of the new paradigms for storytelling forged during the past ten years to communicate ideas about race, gender, sexuality, history, and politics, among other trenchant themes.\\" ==Collections== McGinley's work is held in the following public collections: *Solomon R.

Reform describes itself as \\"determinedly independent and strictly non-party\\". Reform publishes reports on a variety of different issues, adopting what it considers to be an evidence-based approach to public policy. It says that its key finding is that \\"the UK's public services and economy have structural problems which demand structural solutions\\" and that \\"those most in need of the support of public services lose out most from current provision.\\" It has published reports on health and education reform, Britain's regional economic performance, the economic position of young people, and on the tax and welfare system. It has also produced research that claims to show that the extra spending on public services between 2000 and 2006 has not shifted the trend performance of those services. Reform states that its vision is of a Britain with 21st-century healthcare, high standards in schools, a modern and efficient transport system, safe streets and a free, dynamic and competitive economy. Reform argues that in the longer term public spending should be reduced to the levels of Ireland and Australia (around 35% of GDP), and tax reduced so individuals can invest in themselves providing for their own and their families‚Äô welfare needs, so more efficiently obtaining high quality services. Other proposed cuts in public spending that Reform are very keen on implementing cuts to what they call \\"pensioner gimmicks\\" such as the winter fuel payment and free TV licensing for the over 75s.

Intellectualism refers to related mental perspectives that emphasize the use, the development, and the exercise of the intellect; and also identifies the life of the mind of the intellectual person. (Definition) In the field of philosophy, ‚Äúintellectualism‚Äù is synonymous with rationalism, knowledge derived from reason. (Oxford definition) Moreover, the term intellectualism can also have a socially negative connotation about a man or woman intellectual who gives ‚Äútoo much attention to thinking‚Äù (single-mindedness of purpose) and who shows an ‚Äúabsence of affection and feeling‚Äù (emotional coldness). (Definition) ==Ancient moral intellectualism== The Greek philosopher Socrates (c. 470‚Äì399 BC) proposed that intellectualism allows that ‚Äúone will do what is right or best just as soon as one truly understands what is right or best‚Äù; that virtue is a purely intellectual matter, because virtue and knowledge are related qualities that a person accrues, possesses, and improves by dedication to reason. (Definition and note on Socrates) So defined, Socratic intellectualism was an important philosophic component of Stoicism in which the problematic consequences of such a perspective are ‚ÄúSocratic paradoxes‚Äù, such as there is no weakness of will ‚Äî that no one knowingly does, or seeks to do, evil (moral wrong); that anyone who does, or seeks to do, moral wrong does so involuntarily; and that virtue is knowledge, that there are not many virtues, but that all virtues are one. Contemporary philosophers disagree that Socrates‚Äôs conceptions of the knowledge of truth, and of ethical conduct, can be equated with modern, post‚ÄìCartesian conceptions of knowledge and of rational intellectualism. As such, Michel Foucault demonstrated, with detailed historical study, that in Classical Antiquity (800 BC ‚Äì AD 1000), ‚Äúknowing the truth‚Äù is akin to ‚Äúspiritual knowledge‚Äù, in the contemporarily understanding of the concept; hence, without exclusively concerning the rational intellect, spiritual knowledge is integral to the broader principle of ‚Äúcaring for the self‚Äù. Typically, such care of the self- involved specific ascetic exercises meant to ensure that not only was knowledge of truth memorized, but learned, and then integrated to the self, in the course of transforming oneself into a good person. Therefore, to understand truth meant ‚Äúintellectual knowledge‚Äù requiring one‚Äôs integration to the (universal) truth, and authentically living it in one‚Äôs speech, heart, and conduct. Achieving that difficult task required continual care of the self, but also meant being someone who embodies truth, and so can readily practice the Classical-era rhetorical device of parrhesia: ‚Äúto speak candidly, and to ask forgiveness for so speaking‚Äù; and, by extension, practice the moral obligation to speak the truth for the common good, even at personal risk.Gros, Frederic (ed.)(2005) Michel Foucault: The Hermeneutics of the Subject, Lectures at the College de France 1981‚Äì1982. Picador: New York This ancient, Socratic moral philosophic perspective contradicts the contemporary understanding of truth and knowledge as rational undertakings. ==Medieval theological intellectualism== Medieval theological intellectualism is a doctrine of divine action, wherein the faculty of intellect precedes, and is superior to, the faculty of the will (voluntas intellectum sequitur). As such, Intellectualism is contrasted with voluntarism, which proposes the Will as superior to the intellect, and to the emotions; hence, the stance that ‚Äúaccording to intellectualism, choices of the Will result from that which the intellect recognizes as good; the will, itself, is determined. For voluntarism, by contrast, it is the Will which identifies which objects are good, and the Will, itself, is indetermined‚Äù. From that philosophical perspective and historical context, the Spanish Muslim polymath Averro√´s (1126‚Äì1198) in the 12th century, the Italian Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas (1225‚Äì1274), and the German Christian theologian Meister Eckhart (1260‚Äì1327) in the 13th century, are recognised intellectualists.Jeremiah Hackett, A Companion to Meister Eckhart, BRILL, 2012, p. 410. ==See also== *Anti-intellectualism *Chinese intellectualism *Intellectual *Intellectual movements in Iran *Intelligentsia * *Sanism == References == Category:Abstraction Category:Academia Category:Academic terminology Category:Analytic philosophy Category:Age of Enlightenment Category:Aptitude Category:Concepts Category:Concepts in ancient Greek aesthetics Category:Concepts in ancient Greek epistemology Category:Concepts in ancient Greek ethics Category:Concepts in ancient Greek logic Category:Concepts in ancient Greek metaphysics Category:Concepts in ancient Greek philosophy of mathematics Category:Concepts in ancient Greek philosophy of mind Category:Concepts in aesthetics Category:Concepts in epistemology Category:Concepts in ethics Category:Concepts in logic Category:Concepts in metaphilosophy Category:Concepts in metaphysics Category:Concepts in the philosophy of mind Category:Concepts in the philosophy of science Category:Continental philosophy Category:Creativity Category:Critical thinking Category:Deductive reasoning Category:Empiricism Category:Epistemological theories Category:Epistemology Category:Giftedness Category:History of education Category:History of ideas Category:History of logic Category:History of philosophy Category:History of science Category:Intelligence Category:Intelligence quotient Category:Knowledge Category:Logic Category:Metaphilosophy Category:Metaphysical theories Category:Metaphysics Category:Metaphysics of mind Category:Mind Category:Nerd culture Category:Ontology Category:Philosophical logic Category:Philosophical concepts Category:Philosophical movements Category:Philosophical theories Category:Philosophy of culture Category:Philosophy of education Category:Philosophy of life Category:Philosophy of logic Category:Philosophy of mind Category:Philosophy of science Category:Rationalism Category:Reasoning Category:Scholars Category:Secularism Category:Skepticism Category:Skills Category:Socrates Category:Theories Category:Theory of mind Category:Thought ","title":"Intellectualism"},{"id":"832519","text":"Bothwell Castle is a large medieval castle, sited on a high, steep bank, above a bend in the River Clyde in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is located between Bothwell and Uddingston, about south-east of Glasgow. Construction of the castle was begun in the 13th century by the ancestors of Clan Murray, to guard a strategic crossing point of the Clyde. Bothwell played a key role in Scotland's Wars of Independence, changing hands several times. The huge cylindrical donjon was built in the 13th century, but before the rest of the castle was completed it was severely damaged in a series of sieges. Rebuilding in the early 15th century enlarged the castle, but it was abandoned by the 18th century. The present ruin is rectangular, with the remains of the donjon to the west, and the later Great Hall to the east. The courtyard is enclosed by long curtain walls, with round towers at the south-east and south-west corners. The castle was described by Scottish archaeologist William Douglas Simpson as one of the \\"foremost secular structures of the Middle Ages in Scotland\\". ==History== King David I granted the barony of Bothwell to David Olifard (or Olifant), Justiciar of Lothian, in the mid 12th century. The lands passed to his descendants and by 1252 the barony became the property of Walter de Moravia, or Walter of Moray, who had married the last Olifard baron's heir. He began construction of the castle, but by the start of the Wars of Scottish Independence in 1296, only the main donjon, the prison tower, and the short connecting curtain wall were completed. Foundations of the remainder were probably in place, and would have been defended by a wooden palisade. ===Wars of Scottish Independence=== The forces of King Edward I of England invaded Scotland at the start of the war, and seized Bothwell, also capturing Walter's son, William Moray of Bothwell. The English garrison holding the castle was besieged by the Scots for 14 months in 1298--1299, and eventually capitulated. Edward I returned in 1301, capturing the castle once more with a force of 6800 men, and specially constructed siege engines. Bothwell became the headquarters of Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, Edward's appointed Warden of Scotland, and remained in English hands for several years. Plan of Bothwell Castle Following Robert the Bruce's victory at Bannockburn in 1314, the castle provided shelter for several English nobles. However, the castle's constable, Sir Walter FitzGilbert, surrendered the castle to the approaching Scots. For this act, he was granted the barony of Cadzow, where his descendants became the powerful Hamilton family. The Scots slighted the castle after its surrender. In 1336 the English returned again, this time under Edward III. The English king had the castle repaired, and again made it his headquarters in Scotland. The following year, however, Sir Andrew Murray, nephew of Sir William and the rightful owner of Bothwell, recaptured the stronghold, again using siege engines. Following his victory he slighted the castle once more, pulling down the west side of the donjon and tumbling it into the Clyde, in order that it could not be reoccupied by the enemy. The castle remained derelict until the 1360s. ===Douglas=== In 1362, Joan Moray of Bothwell, heiress of the Morays, married Archibald Douglas, nicknamed \\"the Grim\\" and later to be Lord of Galloway and Earl of Douglas. Douglas commenced rebuilding Bothwell, repairing the donjon and completing the walls. The work was continued by his son, Archibald, the 4th Earl. By 1424 they had constructed the Great Hall and adjacent chapel, with towers at the north-east and south- east corners, and curtain walls connecting to the donjon, enclosing the courtyard. The \\"Black\\" Douglases were forfeited in 1455, and their lands returned to the crown. James III granted Bothwell to Lord Crichton, and then to Sir John Ramsay, who were both forfeited in turn. In 1488 Bothwell was granted again to Patrick Hepburn, 2nd Lord Hailes, and the Earldom of Bothwell was created for him. Hepburn did not retain Bothwell Castle for long, however, exchanging it with Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus, known as \\"Bell-the- Cat\\", in return for Hermitage Castle in Liddesdale. James IV visited Bothwell in 1503 and 1504. Bothwell thus reverted to the Douglases, and descended through the Earls of Angus and Marquesses of Douglas to the Earls of Forfar. Archibald Douglas, 1st Earl of Forfar, began construction of a new mansion nearby, demolishing the castle's north-east tower for its stone. (His house was demolished in 1926 due to mining subsidence in the area). After the death of the 2nd Earl at Sheriffmuir in 1715, the castle reverted to the senior line of the Douglas family, represented by the 1st Duke of Douglas and his heirs. The castle then descended to the Earls of Home. In 1935 the 13th Earl gave Bothwell into state care. It is now managed by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument, and is open to the public (entrance charge). ==Design== While the castle was never completed to its original design, its design is similar to the strongholds of Coucy, Kildrummy and Dirleton as it has a round keep (or donjon). The keep, while currently in ruins, was originally high and in diameter with walls which were thick. Thick walls and a powerful gatehouse were later added to the structure and the castle was considered \\"one of the most important military strongholds in Scotland\\". ==Popular Culture== The castle features in The Scottish Chiefs. ==References== *Mason, Gordon The Castles of Glasgow and the Clyde, Goblinshead, 2000 * *Salter, Mike The Castles of South West Scotland, Folly Publications, 1993 * == External links == * Historic Environment Scotland: Visitor guide * Engraving of Bothwell Castle in 1693 by John Slezer at National Library of Scotland * Video footage of Bothwell Castle Category:Castles in South Lanarkshire Category:Scheduled Ancient Monuments in South Lanarkshire Category:Listed castles in Scotland *Castle Bothwell Category:Historic house museums in South Lanarkshire Category:Clan Murray Category:De Moravia family Category:Bothwell and Uddingston Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Clydesdale and South East Glasgow ","title":"Bothwell Castle"},{"id":"832525","text":"HPC may refer to: ==Computing== * High-performance computing ** HPC Challenge Benchmark * Hasty Pudding cipher, in cryptography ==Science and medicine== * Health Professions Council, a UK regulator, later Health and Care Professions Council * Hemangiopericytoma, a type of soft tissue sarcoma * Hilbert system, also referred to as Hilbert Propositional Calculus * History of presenting complaint, in a medical history in UK * Hot potassium carbonate, a method for carbon dioxide removal in gas streams * Hydroxypropyl cellulose, a derivative of cellulose * Heterotrophic Plate Count a procedure for estimating the number of live, culturable heterotrophic bacteria in water ==Other uses== * Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, under construction in England * Hmar People's Convention, a political party in India * Ho-Ping Power Company, an independent power producer in Taiwan * Hydraulic Press Channel, a YouTube channel * Hydrometeorological Prediction Center, former name of the US Weather Prediction Center * Croatian Orthodox Church (Croatian: ) ==See also== * Windows HPC Server 2008, an operating system for high-performance computing by Microsoft ","title":"HPC"},{"id":"832528","text":"Guillaume-Antoine Olivier (19 January 1756, Toulon - 1 October 1814, Lyon) was a French entomologist. ==Life== Olivier studied medicine in Montpellier, where he became good friends with Pierre Marie Auguste Broussonet.

At the age of 15, he attended evening classes at Cooper Union and later studied at the Art Students League of New York with sculptors Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Philip Martiny. He later served as an assistant to Charles Niehaus, Olin Warner, and Daniel Chester French. Weinman opened his own studio in 1904. Although Weinman is now best remembered as a medalist, when he once was introduced as such he vehemently denied being one and said that he was an architectural sculptor. His steadiest income was derived from the sale of small bronze reproductions of his larger works, such as Descending Night, originally commissioned for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, San Francisco, 1915.Descending Night Metropolitan Museum of Art, acc. no. 1994.501 Weinman was a member of the National Sculpture Society and served as its president from 1927 to 1930. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics. He served on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1929 to 1933.Luebke, Thomas E. (ed.) Civic Art: A Centennial History of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, 2013): Appendix B, p. 557. He was also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the National Institute of Arts and Letters, the National Academy of Design, and the New York City Art Commission, among other organizations. Weinman died in Port Chester, New York, on August 8, 1952. Following a mass at Manhattan's St. Patrick's Cathedral, he was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Queens. Weinman's papers are at the Smithsonian Archives of American Art. His son Robert Weinman was also a sculptor. == Work == Weinman's sculpture on the pediment of the Jefferson Memorial, featuring the Committee of Five Despite his objections, Weinman is still best remembered as the designer of the Walking Liberty Half Dollar (a design now used for the obverse of the American Silver Eagle one-ounce bullion coin) and the \\"Mercury\\" dime along with various medals for the Armed Services of the United States. Among these are the identical reverses of the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, and the American Campaign Medal. Weinman was one of many sculptors and artists who employed Audrey Munson as a model. As an architectural sculptor, Weinman's work can be found on the Wisconsin, Missouri, and Louisiana state capitol buildings. He became the sculptor of choice for the architectural firm McKim, Mead, and White and designed sculpture for their Manhattan Municipal Building, Madison Square Presbyterian Church (demolished), Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument, and the since-demolished Pennsylvania Railroad Station, all in New York City. A photograph of one of his angels, Day, in a landfill in New Jersey is one of the saddest reminders of the destruction of Penn Station in 1963, but two of his eagles were retained as trophies outside the entrance to the new subterranean Penn Station.One is illustrated in Walsh, Kevin. Forgotten New York: The Ultimate Urban Explorer's Guide to All Five Boroughs, 2006:169: \\"Others can be found in Kings Point and Hicksville and as far away as Philadelphia\\". Elsewhere he created the dramatic frieze on the Elks National Veterans Memorial in Chicago and executed sculpture for the Post Office Department Building, the Jefferson Memorial, and the interior of the U.S. Supreme Court, all in Washington, D.C. Weinman's non-architectural works include the Macomb and the Maybury monuments in Detroit. Another example of his non-architectural work is his Abraham Lincoln Statue (Kentucky) located in the center of Hodgenville, Kentucky. Weinman was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture International held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the summer of 1949. Weinman's works are mostly executed in a lyrical neoclassical style. His figures typically wear classical drapery, but there is a fluidity found in his work that is a harbinger of the Art Deco style that was to follow him. His bronze statuette The Nude Golfer epitomizes this style. This work evokes classical sculpture in its attention to anatomy and movement and the nude status of the athlete while the subject, a modern golfer, provides a modern twist. Weinman also taught; among his pupils was Eleanor Mary Mellon. == Selected works Sculpture=== *General Alexander Macomb (1906‚Äì1908), Detroit, Michigan. *Union Soldiers and Sailors Monument (1909), Wyman Park, Baltimore, Maryland. *Abraham Lincoln (1909), Hodgenville, Kentucky.

This species is commercially important and is also sought-after as a game fish. ==Characteristics== Red snapper from the Gulf of Mexico The northern red snapper's body is very similar in shape to other snappers, such as the mangrove snapper, mutton snapper, lane snapper, and dog snapper. All feature a sloped profile, medium-to-large scales, a spiny dorsal fin, and a laterally compressed body. Northern red snapper have short, sharp, needle-like teeth, but they lack the prominent upper canine teeth found on the mutton, dog, and mangrove snappers. They are rather large and are red in color. This snapper reaches maturity at a length of about . The common adult length is , but may reach . The maximum published weight is 50 lb, 4 oz (22.79 kg) and the oldest reported age is 100+ years. Coloration of the northern red snapper is light red, with more intense pigment on the back. It has 10 dorsal spines, 14 soft dorsal rays, three anal spines and eight to 9 anal soft rays. Juvenile fish (shorter than 30‚Äì35 cm) can also have a dark spot on their sides, below the anterior soft dorsal rays, which fades with age. == Distribution == L. campechanus, from the Gulf of Mexico The northern red snapper is found in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and the southeastern Atlantic coast of the United States and much less commonly northward as far as Massachusetts. In Latin American Spanish, it is known as ', ', ', or '. This species commonly inhabits waters from , but can be caught as deep as on occasion. They stay relatively close to the bottom, and inhabit rocky bottoms, ledges, ridges, and artificial reefs, including offshore oil rigs and shipwrecks. Like most other snappers, northern red snapper are gregarious and form large schools around wrecks and reefs. These schools are usually made up of fish of very similar size. The preferred habitat of this species changes as it grows and matures due to increased need for cover and changing food habits. Newly hatched red snapper spread out over large areas of open benthic habitat, then move to low- relief habitats, such as oyster beds. As they near one year of age, they move to intermediate-relief habitats as the previous year's fish move on to high- relief reefs with room for more individuals. Around artificial reefs such as oil platforms, smaller fish spend time in the upper part of the water column while more mature (and larger) adults live in deeper areas. These larger fish do not allow smaller individuals to share this territory. The largest red snapper spread out over open habitats, as well as reefs. ==Reproduction and growth== DiazDiaz, GA. (August, 2004) Allometric relationships of Gulf of Mexico red snapper. National Marine Fisheries Service publication SEDAR7-AW-02, reported weight vs. length data for L. campechanus for the National Marine Fisheries Service (US). As northern red snapper grow longer, they increase in weight, but the relationship between length and weight is not linear. The relationship between total length (L, in inches) and total weight (W, in pounds) for nearly all species of fish can be expressed by an equation of the form: W = cL^b\\\\\\\\!\\\\, Invariably, b is close to 3.0 for all species, and c is a constant that varies among species. Diaz reported that for red snapper, c=0.000010 and b=3.076. These values are for inputs of length in cm and result in weight in kg. Szedlmayer et al. reported length vs. age data for L. campechanus in a primarily artificial reef environment off the coast of Alabama, USA: TL(age) = 1,025 (1 ‚Äì e^( -0.15 age)), N=409, R = 0.96. For the first five years, growth can be estimated as being approximately linear: TL(age) = 97.7 age + 67.6, N = 397, R = 0.87 (for each equation, age is in years and total length is in mm). Removing a red snapper otolith (ear bone): Their age can be determined by counting annual growth rings on their otoliths, similar to counting growth rings in trees. Northern red snappers move to different types of habitats during their growth process. When they are newly spawned, red snapper settle over large areas of open benthic habitat(s). Below age 1, the red snapper move to low-relief habitats for food and cover. If available, oyster shell beds are preferred. The second stage is when these fish outgrow low-relief habitats and move to intermediate-relief habitats as age 1 snapper leave to move on to another growth stage. Next, at about age 2, snapper seek high-relief reefs having low densities of larger snapper. Next, at platforms, smaller snapper occupy the upper water column. Then, the larger, older snapper occupy the deeper areas of the platforms and large benthic reefs and they prevent smaller snapper and other fish from using these habitats. In spite of local habitat preferences, Szedlmayer reported that of 146 L. campechanus tagged, released and recaptured within about a year, 57% were still approximately at their respective release site, and 76% were recaptured within 2 km of their release site. The greatest movement by a single fish was 32 km. A northern red snapper attains sexual maturity at two to five years old, and an adult snapper can live for more than 50 years. Research from 1999‚Äì2001 suggested the populations of red snapper off the coast of Texas reach maturity faster and at a smaller size than populations off of the Louisiana and Alabama coasts. ==Commercial and recreational use== Global capture of wild northern red snapper in tonnes, 1950‚Äì2010, as reported by the FAOBased on data sourced from the FishStat database Northern red snapper are a prized food fish, caught commercially, as well as recreationally. It is used in Vietnamese canh chua (\\"Sour soup\\"). Red snapper is the most commonly caught snapper in the continental USA (almost 50% of the total catch), with similar species being more common elsewhere. They eat almost anything, but prefer small fish and crustaceans. They can be caught on both live and cut bait, and also take artificial lures, but with less vigor. They are commonly caught up to and in length, but fish over have been taken. Recreational fishing for northern red snapper has been popular for a long time, restricted mostly by fishing limits intended to ensure a sustainable population. The first minimum size limit was introduced in 1984, after a 1981 report described quickly declining harvests (both commercial and recreational)LSU Fisheries Page on Red Snapper management accessed 5 July 2011. From 1985 to 1990, the annual recreational catch of red snapper was about 1.5 million. From 1991 to 2005, the catch was substantially higher, varying from year to year from 2.5 to 4.0 million.Scott GP (August 2004). Estimates of historical red snapper recreational catch levels using US Census Data and Recreational Survey Information. National Marine Fisheries Service, SEDAR7-AW16 When northern red snapper bite on a line, they tend to be nibblers and pickers, and a soft touch is needed when trying to catch them.Red Snapper. TakeMeFishing.org Because the older red snapper like structure, anglers use bottom fishing over reefs, wrecks, and oil rigs, and use line and supplies in the 50-lb class. Since the anglers have to both choose the right bait and present it correctly, they tend to use multiple hooked baits. Favorite baits include squid, whole medium-sized fish, and small strips of fish such as amberjack. Although many northern red snapper are caught on the bottom, in some situations the larger fish are caught on heavy jigs (artificial lures), often tipped with a strip of bait or by freelining baits at the proper upper level.Schultz K. (2010) Essentials of Fishing: The only guide you need to catch freshwater and saltwater fish. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. p. 90. Interest in recreational fishing for northern red snapper, and in the Gulf of Mexico in general, has increased dramatically. From 1995‚Äì2003, the number of Louisiana fishing charter guide license holders increased eight-fold. Since 1990, the total catch limit for northern red snapper has been divided into 49% for recreational fishermen and 51% for commercial. Commercially, they are caught on multiple-hook gear with electric reels. Fishing for red snapper has been a major industry in the Gulf of Mexico, but permit restrictions and changes in the quota system for commercial snapper fishermen in the Gulf have made the fish less commercially available. Researchers estimate the bycatch of young red snapper, especially by shrimp trawlers, is a significant concern. Genetic studies have shown many fish sold as red snapper in the USA are not actually L. campechanus, but other species in the family. Substitution of other species for red snapper is more common in large chain restaurants which serve a common menu nationwide. In these cases, suppliers provide a less costly substitute (usually imported) for red snapper. In countries such as India, where the actual red snapper is not available in its oceans, John snapper, Russell snapper, or a tomato red snapper are sold as \\"red snapper\\".

Artificial reefs off the coast of Alabama have proven to be a favorite habitat of red snapper two years old and older. Gallaway et al. (2009) analyzed several studies and concluded, in 1992, 70 ‚Äì 80% of the age two red snapper in that area were living around offshore oil platforms. ==Other species mistaken for red snapper== * Sebastes, rockfish, are called red snapper or Pacific red snapper. * Several species of bigeye (Priacanthidae) * Lane snapper * Blackfin snapper ==References== ==External links== * Red snapper NOAA FishWatch.

He used several pseudonyms including Mac Ois√≠n and the Hindu name Jayaram.Cousins at Ricorso ==Life== Cousins was born at 18, Kevor Street in Belfast, Ireland, the descendant of Huguenot refugees. His father was James Cousins, a mariner, and Susan, n√©e Davis. Largely self-educated at night schools, he worked some time as a clerk became private secretary and speechwriter to Sir Daniel Dixon, 1st Baronet, the Lord Mayor of Belfast. In 1897 he moved to Dublin where he became part of a literary circle which included William Butler Yeats, George William Russell and James Joyce. He is believed to have served as a model for the Little Chandler character in Joyce's short story collection Dubliners. Cousins was significantly influenced by Russell's ability to reconcile mysticism with a pragmatic approach to social reforms and by the teachings of Madame Blavatsky. He had a lifelong interest in the paranormal and acted as reporter in several experiments carried out by William Fletcher Barrett, Professor of physics at Dublin University and one of the founders of the Society for Psychical Research. Cousins produced several books of poetry whilst in Ireland as well as acting in the first production of Cathleen N√≠ Houlihan (under the stage name of H. Sproule) with the famous Irish revolutionary and beauty Maud Gonne in the title role. His plays were produced in the first years of the twentieth century in the Abbey Theatre, the most famous being \\"the Racing Lug\\". After a dispute with W.B. Yeats, who objected to 'too much Cousins' the Irish National Theatre movement split with two-thirds of the actors and writers siding with Cousins against Yeats. He also wrote widely on the subject of Theosophy and in 1915 travelled to India with the voyage fees paid for by Annie Besant the President of the Theosophical Society. He spent most of the rest of his life in the sub-continent, apart from a year as Professor of English Literature at Keio University in Tokyo and another lecturing in New York. Towards the end of his life he converted to Hinduism. At the core of Cousins's engagement with Indian culture was a firm belief in the \\"shared sensibilities between Celtic and Oriental peoples\\". Whilst in India he became friendly with many key Indian personalities including poet Rabindranath Tagore, Indian classical dancer Rukmini Devi Arundale, painter Abdur Rahman Chughtai and Mahatma Gandhi. He was the person who brought change into the life of poetry of the Great Renowned Kannada Poet and Writer Kuvempu. He wrote a joint autobiography with his wife Margaret Elizabeth Cousins (formerly Gretta Gillespie), a suffragette and one of the co-founders of the Irish Women's Franchise League and All India Women's Conference (AIWC). In his The Future Poetry Sri Aurobindo has acclaimed Cousins' New Ways in English Literature as \\"literary criticism which is of the first order, at once discerning and suggestive, criticism which forces us both to see and think.\\" He has also acknowledged that he learnt to intuit deeper being alerted by Cousins' criticisms of his poems. In 1920 Cousins came to Pondicherry to meet the Mother and Sri Aurobindo. The appreciation is palpable in the following citations: From The Future Poetry by Sri Aurobindo: > \\"It will be more fruitful to take the main substance of the matter for which > the body of Mr.Cousins' criticism gives a good material. Taking the > impression it creates for a starting-point and the trend of English poetry > for our main text, but casting our view farther back into the past, we may > try to sound what the future has to give us through the medium of the poetic > mind and its power for creation and interpretation.

That possibility is the discovery of a closer approximation to > what we might call the mantra in poetry that rhythmic speech which, as the > Veda puts it, rises at once from the heart of the seer and from the distant > home of the Truth, ‚Äî the discovery of the word, the divine movement, the > form of thought proper to the reality which, as Mr. Cousins excellently > says, \\" lies in the apprehension of a something stable behind the > instability of word and deed, something that is reflection of the > fundamental passion of humanity for something beyond itself, something that > is a dim foreshadowing of the divine urge which is prompting all creation to > unfold itself and to rise out of its limitations towards its Godlike > possibilities.

Motel 6 also operates Studio 6, a chain of extended-stay hotels. The hotel brand is owned by The Blackstone Group, which established G6 Hospitality as the management company for Motel 6 and Studio 6. ==History== The first Motel 6 in Santa Barbara, California, remains in business. Motel 6 was founded in Santa Barbara, California, in 1962, by two local building contractors: William Becker and Paul Greene. The partners developed a plan to build motels with rooms at low cost rates. They decided on a $6 room rate per night (equivalent to $ in ), which would cover building costs, land leases, and janitorial supplies; hence the company name \\"Motel 6\\". Becker and Greene had specialized in building low-cost housing developments, and they wanted to provide an alternative to other major hotel chains, such as Holiday Inn, whose locations were becoming increasingly upscale in quality and price in the 1960s, after starting out with a budget-oriented concept. Becker and Greene spent two years formulating their business model and searched for ways to cut costs as much as possible. During the chain's early years, Motel 6 emphasized itself as a \\"no-frills\\" lodging chain with rooms featuring coin- operated black-and-white television receivers instead of the free color televisions found in the more expensive motels, along with functional interior decor, to reduce the time it took to clean the rooms. The first location in Santa Barbara had no restaurant on-site, a notable difference from other hotels of the era. To this day, most motels have no on-site dining, though there is usually a choice of restaurants nearby. As the 1960s progressed, the Motel 6 idea became very popular in the lodging industry, and other chains began to imitate the concept, as Motel 6 was slowly beginning to take a small share of the market away from the traditional hotels. In 1965 Motel 6 opened its 15th property, and first location outside California, in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. Realizing the need to move quickly, Becker and Green set out on an ambitious expansion program and had opened its 25th location in Gilroy, California, by 1966. The occupancy rate by then was about 85 percent, well above the industry average, and as a result of their success, Motel 6 became an attractive acquisition target. Becker and Greene sold the chain to an investment group in 1968. In the early 1970s Motel 6 opened its largest location, Motel 6 Tropicana, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Additionally, the chain moved east and opened a location in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1972. By 1980 Motel 6 had reached 300 locations. It was sold to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 1985, who moved the chain away from its \\"no frills\\" approach and began including amenities such as telephones and color television. A Motel 6 in Lima, Ohio Market share declined throughout the 1980s, in part because of increased competition from other budget hotels. During this time, it bought out the Sixpence Inn chain in the western U.S., and Envoy Inn (formerly Bargaintel) in the Midwestern United States and Pennsylvania. Regal 8 Motels were acquired in 1991. In 1990, the company was bought by the French-based Accor. In 1993, it opened its first high-rise location ‚Äî Motel 6 LAX in Los Angeles, California. Unlike the majority of hotel chains, Motel 6 directly owns and operates most of its locations. To expand more rapidly outside its traditional Western United States base, the chain started franchising in 1994. Accor management also took over motels that had been franchised by other chains. Motel 6 began to renovate all bedrooms, sold under-performing locations, and upgraded door locks and other security measures. Newer properties, as well as acquisitions, have interior corridors. Its competitors include America's Best Value Inn, Days Inn, Econo Lodge, and Super 8 Motels. In 1999, Motel 6 launched Studio 6 Extended Stay, hotels with suites that are designed for longer stays and feature kitchenettes. In 2000 Motel 6 went international by opening its first location outside the U.S. in Burlington, Ontario, Canada. Then, in 2002 Motel 6 celebrated its 40th anniversary at its first location in Santa Barbara, California. In 2006, Accor and Motel 6 invested more than $6 million in properties to help rebuild New Orleans and Gulfport following Hurricane Katrina. One of the Motel 6 co-founders, William Becker, died of a heart attack at the age of 85 the next year. In October 2012, Accor Hotels concluded the sale of the Motel 6 chain to The Blackstone Group for $1.9 billion. In September 2017, immigration attorneys accused Motel 6 desk clerks at two locations in the area of Phoenix, Arizona of notifying U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement when guests checked in with identification from Mexico. The attorneys said court records showed that federal immigration agents arrested at least 20 people at the Motel 6 locations over the course of seven months in 2017. Motel 6 said the practice was \\"implemented at the local level without the knowledge of senior management\\" and every location had been given a directive that they were \\"prohibited from voluntarily providing daily guest lists to ICE.\\" Motel 6 was sued for discrimination and privacy violations in connection with the case and on November 2, 2018 agreed to settle with the Plaintiffs for $7.6 million. Additionally, Washington state filed a lawsuit in January 2018 against Motel 6 for giving the names of thousands of other motel guests to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. In April 2019, Motel 6 agreed to pay $12 million to settle the lawsuit. On April 24, 2018 the American Customer Satisfaction Index published a study of America's most popular hotel chains, placing G6 Hospitality's Motel 6 at the bottom of the category for the second year in a row.https://www.theacsi.org/news-and-resources/customer- satisfaction-reports/reports-2018/acsi-travel-report-2018 == Services == Motel 6 locations offer guests free basic wireless internet access, and some locations offer an upgrade to premium wireless internet access with the charge not exceeding $4.99. ==Studio 6 (extended stay)== Since 1999, Motel 6 also operates Studio 6, a chain of extended-stay hotels that offers more amenities than a standard Motel 6 location, while also offering weekly and monthly rates. Studio 6 provides an expanded kitchenette area, including a full-sized refrigerator, coffeemaker, toaster, microwave oven, electric cooktop and a set of dishes/utensils, in all its rooms. Studio 6 allows pets with certain restrictions. Studio 6 hotels are located in 15 U.S. states and Canada. Its competitors include Extended Stay Hotels, and Choice Hotels' Suburban Extended Stay Hotels. Some Studio 6 locations have been converted from other brands, such as Homestead Studio Suites. ==Room renovations== An updated Motel 6 room in Santa Barbara, California In March 2008, Motel 6 began a system-wide renovation program called the \\"Phoenix Project\\" to update the look and amenities of all bedrooms. Before the remodel most rooms had colorful road- trip inspired bed covers, carpeted floors, shower curtains, CRT televisions and beige furnishings. Stained carpets and dirty shower curtains were a common complaint on online customer reviews. The remodel was designed with an eye towards not only modernizing rooms but keeping room rates low for years to come. Designers accomplished this by making the rooms more energy efficient, easy to clean, and easier to keep clean in the long term (keeping housekeeping and maintenance costs low). The remodel earned Motel 6 Travel & Leisure magazine's 2010 design award for Best Large Hotel. ==Advertising campaign== Beginning in 1986, Motel 6 has advertised through radio commercials featuring the voice of writer and National Public Radio commentator Tom Bodett, with the tagline \\"We'll leave the light on for you.\\" The ads were created by Dallas advertising agency The Richards Group. They feature a tune composed by Tom Faulkner, performed by him on guitar and Milo Deering on fiddle. The first spots were conceived and written by David Fowler. In 1996, the ads won a Clio Award. The campaign itself has won numerous national and international awards and was selected by Advertising Age magazine as one of the Top 100 Advertising Campaigns of the Twentieth Century. ==ReferencesStudio 6 website Category:Hotel chains in the United States Category:Motels in the United States Category:Motels in Canada Category:Franchises Category:Companies based in Carrollton, Texas Category:Hotels established in 1962 Category:Hospitality companies established in 1962 Category:1962 establishments in California Category:Privately held companies based in Texas Category:Kohlberg Kravis Roberts companies Category:The Blackstone Group companies ","title":"Motel 6"},{"id":"832571","text":"==D09A Medicated dressingsD09AA Medicated dressings with antiinfectives=== :D09AA01 Framycetin :D09AA02 Fusidic acid :D09AA03 Nitrofural :D09AA04 Phenylmercuric nitrate :D09AA05 Benzododecinium :D09AA06 Triclosan :D09AA07 Cetylpyridinium :D09AA08 Aluminium chlorohydrate :D09AA09 Povidone-iodine :D09AA10 Clioquinol :D09AA11 Benzalkonium :D09AA12 Chlorhexidine :D09AA13 Iodoform ===D09AB Zinc bandages=== :D09AB01 Zinc bandage without supplements :D09AB02 Zinc bandage with supplements ===D09AX Soft paraffin dressings=== ==References== D09 ","title":"ATC code D09"},{"id":"832575","text":"Long Ashton is a village and civil parish in Somerset, England. It falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset and is one of a number of large villages just outside the boundary of city of Bristol urban area. The parish has a population of 6,044. The parish includes the hamlet of Yanley, and the residential area of Leigh Woods (although most of the woods themselves are in the neighbouring parish of Abbots Leigh). The village is built on the south- facing slopes of a valley running from east to west, and on the old road from Bristol to Weston-super-Mare. ==History== Prehistoric and Roman artefacts have been found in the area, at the site of the Gatcombe Roman Settlement, but the village originated in Saxon times. The Domesday Book records it as Estune (the place by the ash tree) and, afterwards, it was granted to Bishop Geoffrey of Coutances. The village is near two waterways being The Longmoor Brook and The Ashton Brook, thus the name Long Ashton. The parish was part of the hundred of Hartcliffe. The manor house dates to 1265 and, in the late 15th century shares in the estate were purchased by Richard Amerike (one of the possible sources of the name America). Previously the manor had passed through the hands of the Lyons, Choke and finally Smyth families. By 1603 the Smyths had become the principal landowners in the parish and were lords of Long Ashton for four centuries‚Äîthe estate finally being sold in 1946. A deserted medieval farmstead and part of a Romano-British field system north of Fenswood Farm has been identified including three enclosures which are thought to be the foundations of buildings, each surrounded by rubble banks. The parish church of All Saints dates from about 1380, and the arms of its founder (Thomas de Lyons) are on the outside of the tower. The interior has some fine tombs, and some relatives of the poet Robert Southey are buried in the churchyard. The other Church, Hebron Church was founded in 1934 by Ernest Dyer, who cycled to the village from Keynsham to run a Sunday School. Many of the people who have grown up in the village passed through this Sunday School. Since the earliest recorded times, agriculture has been the major occupation of the parish, and there are still several working farms, some just outside the village. The Ashton Court estate provided occupations such as gamekeepers and foresters, and there have been several mills in the parish including a snuff-mill on the Land Yeo at Gatcombe in 1769, however the current building dates from the early 19th century. By 1846 it had been converted to grind mustard, annatto and drugs, but by 1874 was a flour mill. The internal machinery is still in place and the mill has been designated as a Grade II listed building. Kincott Mill had stood since at least the 13th century. By the early 19th century rented out for snuff grinding and in the 1830s a steam engine was installed to power a flour and corn mill. Later it was owned by an iron founder, who made edge tools and other farm implements and installed cast-iron water wheels. Stone has been quarried for lime burning, as well as for building and road making. There was an iron foundry in the 19th century and coal mines ‚Äî the Bedminster-Ashton coalfield finally closed in 1924. The Angel Inn, near the church, is the oldest pub in the village, dating from 1495 and originally being a church- house. There are several other historic pubs in the area, very popular with visitors from Bristol‚Äîa horse-drawn bus ran from Redcliffe Street, Bristol to the Bird-in-Hand several times a week in the late 19th century. The National Fruit and Cider Institute opened at Fenswood on the edge of the village in 1903. It became the Agricultural and Horticultural Research Station in 1912, and was known as Long Ashton Research Station until it was closed in 2003. During the Second World War it developed rose hip syrup and Ribena. Panorama of eastern Long Ashton from Weston Road A Parochial School opened in 1818 and moved several times ‚Äî the current Primary School, called Northleaze, opened in 1867 and moved to new premises in Brook Close in 2006. There have been other schools in the village, including boarding schools for \\"Young Gentlemen\\". Long Ashton railway station was opened by the Great Western Railway in Yanley Lane, where the Bristol to Taunton Line passes below the village, on 12 July 1926 but it was closed on 6 October 1941. Colonel Reginald Dyer CB (9 October 1864 ‚Äì 23 July 1927) spent his last two years in Long Ashton. As a temporary brigadier-general he was responsible for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar on 13 April 1919. The massacre was depicted in the 1982 film, Gandhi. ==Governance== The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within their area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. They are also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, Trading Standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service. North Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters are in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Long Ashton Rural District. The village falls within the 'Wraxall and Long Ashton' electoral ward. The ward starts in the west at Wraxall and proceeds easterly to Long Ashton. The total population of the ward as at the 2011 census was 7,793. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North Somerset constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, currently Liam Fox of the Conservative Party. ==Cricket== Long Ashton Cricket Club plays in Yanley Lane. It runs two Saturday sides as well as a number of junior teams. The team won the Bristol & District Cricket Association League in 1977. Famous players have included Chris Broad, who went on to become international cricketer of the year. Shane Warne, who was named as one of the five cricketers of the 20th century, played a few games for Long Ashton on tour in Cornwall in the early 1980s. The famous Victorian cricketer W G Grace attended school in Long Ashton. ==Open spaces== Leigh Woods has been built on since 1865, and the land south of Nightingale Valley was fully developed by 1909. The rest has been preserved by gifts of land by the Wills family and is now owned by the National Trust. The Clifton Suspension Bridge was opened in 1864 and provided an alternative route to Bristol; in 1906, a swing bridge was opened to give access to Hotwells. Traffic continued to grow throughout the 20th century, and a bypass was opened in 1968. Ashton Court is a large estate that lies at the east end of the village. It was originally owned by the Smyth family until they were forced to donate it to Bristol City Council in lieu of inheritance tax. Ashton Court is host to several festivals each year, including the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta and the scenic landscaped grounds with views of Bristol are widely used by local residents for walking, golf and mountain biking. Dawsons walk is an area of green space donated to the people of Long Ashton. It has been developed into a circular woodland and countryside walk. Access to the walk is from Lampton Road or from public footpath between Bourton Mead and 40 Long Ashton Road. The Long Ashton Footpath Users Group have replaced 29 stiles on the public rights of way around the village with kissing gates to create a complete circular walk around the village, accessible to older people and those with mobility problems, although it can be muddy in places. The route, way marked with yellow Village Circular Walk discs, takes in views of the valley, passing through local farms and woodland. Land next to the recreation ground has been turned into a public space in memory of Andr√©e Peel (13 February 1905 ‚Äì 5 March 2010). Known as Agent Rose, she was a member of the French Resistance during World War II and spent her last years in the village. She died peacefully at the Lampton House nursing home on 5 March 2010. ==Notable residents== * Ferdinando Gorges (1565-1647) Had legal ownership of coastal Maine, the U.S. State.

Al-Jabali, who held the rank of Major general at the close of his tenure in the Palestinian security forces, had been a police commander and chief of the Gaza police since the early 1990s. Since 1994 he has been the target of repeated attacks by Palestinian groups opposed to the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority, including gunfire aimed at his offices and a bomb that destroyed part of his house. He has also been the subject of a 1997 arrest warrant and extradition request from Israel, based on accusations that he ordered Palestinian police officers to attack an Israeli checkpoint in July 1997. Al-Jabali was the target of protests after the shooting deaths of three Palestinian teenagers during clashes with police forces; demonstrators claimed that al-Jabali had given police officers orders to shoot protesters throwing stones during a Hamas organized demonstration in support of Osama bin Laden. Al-Jabali resigned from his post as chief of police in Gaza in June 2002, during a security forces shake-up that also saw the dismissal of Colonel Jibril Rajoub and the resignation of Colonel Mohammed Dahlan. Along with his resignation he announced his intention to oppose Yaser Arafat as a candidate for president of the Palestinian Authority. He was appointed chief of Palestinian Civil Police Forces in both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in October 2003. A February 2004 gunfight Gaza police headquarters was construed by some officials as an attempt on al-Jabali's life. Other officials blamed violence on his rival Mohammad Dahlan members of the body he formerly commanded, Preventive Security Service.

Some researchers, such as Pflug and Narbonne, suggest that a natural taxon Rangeomorpha may include all similar- looking fossils. Rangeomorphs appear to have had an effective reproductive strategy, based on analysis of the distribution pattern of Fractofusus, which consisted of sending out a waterborne asexual propagule to a distant area, and then spreading rapidly from there, just as plants today spread by stolons or runners. Rangeomorphs are a key part of the Ediacaran biota, which survived about 30 million years, until the base of the Cambrian, which was . They were especially abundant in the early Ediacaran Mistaken Point assemblage found in Newfoundland. ==Body plan== Rangeomorphs consist of branching \\"frond\\" elements, each a few centimetres long, each of which is composed of many smaller branching tubes held up by a semi-rigid organic skeleton. This self- similar structure proceeds over four levels of fractality, and could have been formed using fairly simple developmental patterns. ==Ecology== Rangeomorphs dwelt in shallow to abyssal marine environments, were unable to move, and had no apparent reproductive organs. They possibly reproduced asexually by dropping off new fronds. There is little evidence of a gut or mouth, while the organisms have high surface area to volume ratios, which has led to the hypothesis that they gathered nutrients from seawater by osmosis. However, others argue this is implausible and suggest filter feeding or other mechanisms. Most were attached to the sea floor by a stalk or holdfast, although others (such as the spindle-shaped Fractofusus) lay flat on the sediment surface. ==Affinity== Rangeomorph communities are similar in structure to those of modern, suspension-feeding animals, but it is difficult to relate their morphology to any modern animals. They have at times been aligned to a range of modern animal and protist groups, but none of these classifications has withstood scrutiny; they probably represent an extinct stem group to either the animals or fungi. Whilst the fractal construction may represent a convergent adaptation to osmotic feeding, most workers now consider it to be an apomorphy which establishes the rangeomorph clade as a valid taxonomic entity. The quilted construction suggests a close affinity to the erniettomorphs. ==References== ==External links== *Article in New Scientist *Artist's reconstruction at LiveScience Category:Ediacaran biota Category:Incertae sedis ","title":"Rangeomorph"},{"id":"832579","text":"South Ruislip is an area of west London in the London Borough of Hillingdon, south-east of Ruislip, north-west of Northolt, and west of South Harrow.

The track alignments were improved to allow higher speed running at the junction for the services from Marylebone, and the pointwork which had allowed trains from Paddington to call at the westbound Chiltern station platform was removed. All eastbound services were moved to the former through road; the eastbound road, which had formerly extended from the platform road at West Ruislip, was closed and lifted, and the eastbound platform widened. The alignment of the turnout towards Marylebone was improved to allow higher-speed running. Fragments of the old trackwork can still be seen to the north of the line at this point.

During a 10-year baseball career, he played for the Boston Bees (1937‚Äì1938), Cincinnati Reds (1939‚Äì1940), Pittsburgh Pirates (1940‚Äì1945), Philadelphia Phillies (1945‚Äì1946), and New York Giants (1946). Vince was the oldest brother of Joe and Dom DiMaggio. ==Early life== DiMaggio was born in Martinez, California. Older than Joe and Dom, Vince was discovered first, and the teenage Joe used to enviously watch him play professional ball. Blessed with some power and good fielding, Vince once claimed that he could run rings around Joe in the outfield. ==CareerMinor leagues (1932‚Äì1936)=== DiMaggio began his professional career in 1932 with the Tucson Lizards of the Class-D Arizona‚ÄìTexas League, hitting .347 with 25 homers and 81 RBI. He led the Arizona‚ÄìTexas League in home runs, with eight more than runner-up Cal Lahman. He played 94 games with the Lizards that year, finishing the season with the San Francisco Seals of the Class-AA Pacific Coast League. With the Seals, he hit .270 with 6 home runs in 59 games. In 1933, DiMaggio hit .333 with 11 home runs and 65 runs batted in for San Francisco and the Hollywood Stars. He played with the Stars through 1935, joining the San Diego Padres in 1936. ===Major League Baseball=== On December 4, 1936, DiMaggio was traded by San Diego of the PCL to the Boston Bees for Tiny Chaplin, Tommy Thompson and cash. DiMaggio was a regular outfielder for the Bees in 1937 and 1938. In 1937, he hit .256 with a .311 on-base percentage and .387 slugging percentage with 13 home runs. In 1938, Vince hit only .228/.313/.369, but led the Bees with 14 home runs on a team that hit 54 home runs in total. He was tenth in the National League (NL) in homers, sixth in steals (11) and eighth in walks (65). In both 1937 and 1938, he led the NL in strikeouts. His 134 strikeouts in 1938 set a NL record for most strikeouts in one season, breaking Gus Williams' record of 120 set in 1914. On February 4, 1939, the Boston Bees sent DiMaggio to the New York Yankees to complete an earlier deal made on August 10, 1938, where the Bees sent players to be named later, Gil English, Johnny Riddle and cash to the Yankees for Eddie Miller. DiMaggio did not play for the Yankees, as they assigned him to their American Association affiliate, the Kansas City Blues. On August 5, 1939, DiMaggio was traded by the Yankees to the Cincinnati Reds for players to be named later and $40,000. The Reds sent Frenchy Bordagaray and Nino Bongiovanni to the Yankees on January 27, 1940 to complete the trade. DiMaggio appeared in eight games with the 1939 Reds and only two games for the 1940 Reds before the Reds traded DiMaggio to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Johnny Rizzo on May 8, 1940. DiMaggio spent the majority of his MLB career with the Pirates. In between, he was selected to the All-Star Game in 1943 and 1944. In the 1943 game, DiMaggio collected a home run, triple, single, a pair of runs and one RBI over three at-bats.1943 All-Star Game Box Score. Baseball Reference. Retrieved on December 28, 2018. On March 31, 1945, he was traded by the Pirates to the Philadelphia Phillies for Al Gerheauser. He then hit four grand slams for the Phillies. On May 1, 1946, he was traded by the Phillies to the New York Giants for Clyde Kluttz. In his ten-year MLB career, Vince DiMaggio batted .249 with 125 home runs and 584 RBI in 1110 games. ===Return to the minors=== DiMaggio played for the Oakland Oaks of the PCL in 1947. In 1948, he moved to the Stockton Ports of the California League as a player-manager. He also played for and managed the Pittsburg Diamonds of the Class-D Far West League from 1949 through 1951. He finished the 1951 season, and his professional career, with the Tacoma Tigers of the Class-B Western International League. ==Personal life== DiMaggio was married with two children, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He died in North Hollywood, California, at age 74 of colon cancer. DiMaggio worked at the California Shipbuilding Corporation during World War II. \\"He's one of the many former athletic stars who are helping to smash the Axis by building the equipment needed by America's fighting men,\\" according to the Library of Congress.https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/oem2002007794/PP/ According to Joe DiMaggio biographer Richard Ben Cramer, the iconic younger brother \\"didn't deal with Vince at all\\", never maintaining any meaningful relationship with him.

He helped rebuild the power of the empire by rooting out corruption and reorganizing the Ottoman army. As he introduced these changes, K√∂pr√ºl√º also expanded the borders of the empire, defeating the Cossacks, the Hungarians, and most impressively, the Venetians. K√∂pr√ºl√º's effectiveness was matched by his reputation. He founded the city of K√∂pr√ºl√º (now Veles, North Macedonia) in Rumelia, where his eldest son, K√∂pr√ºl√º Fazƒ±l Ahmed, was born.Rahmi Tekin, Osmanli Atlasi, Istanbul 2003 ==BiographyEarly life=== He was born in the village of Rudnik in the Sanjak of Berat, Albania to Albanian parents. He entered the sultan's service as a dev≈üirme youth and was trained in the palace school. K√∂pr√ºl√º began as a kitchen boy in the imperial kitchen before transferring to the imperial treasury and then the offices of the palace chamberlain. Other officials reportedly found it difficult to work with K√∂pr√ºl√º, and he was transferred to the sipahi (cavalry) corps in the provinces. ===Rise through the imperial service=== He was first stationed in the town of K√∂pr√º in northern Turkey, which was later named Vezirk√∂pr√º in his honour. He quickly rose in rank, keeping the name K√∂pr√ºl√º, meaning from K√∂pr√º. K√∂pr√ºl√º's former mentor, H√ºsrev Pasha, rose in the imperial service and promoted K√∂pr√ºl√º to increasingly important offices. When H√ºsrev was assassinated, however, K√∂pr√ºl√º built up his own following. He eventually held important offices as head of the market police in Constantinople, supervisor of the Imperial Arsenal, chief of the Sipahi corps, and head of the corps armorers. K√∂pr√ºl√º managed to attach himself to powerful men and somehow survived their falls without being destroyed himself. K√∂pr√ºl√º continued to hold important offices. He eventually rose to the rank of pasha and was appointed the beylerbey (provincial governor) of the Trebizond Eyalet in 1644. Later he was to rule the provinces of Eƒüri in 1647, of Karaman in 1648, and of Anatolia in 1650. He served as vizier of the divan for one week in 1652 before being dismissed due to the constant power struggle within the palace. Over the years, K√∂pr√ºl√º had cultivated many friendships at the sultan's court, especially with the Queen Mother Turhan Hatice Sultan , mother of the minor sultan Mehmed IV. In 1656, the political situation in Ottoman Empire was critical. The war in Crete against the Venetians was still continuing. The Ottoman Navy under Kapudan Pasha (grand admiral) Kenan Pasha, in May 1656, was defeated by the Venetian and Maltese navy at the Battle of Dardanelles (1656) and the Venetian navy continued the blockade of the √áanakkale Straits cutting the Ottoman army in Crete from Constantinople, the state capital. There was a political plot to unseat the reigning Sultan Mehmed IV led by important viziers including the Grand Mufti (≈ûeyh√ºlislam) Hocazade Mesut Efendi. This plot was discovered, and the plotters were executed or exiled. The Mother Sultana Turhan Hatice conducted consultations and the most favored candidate for the post of Grand Vizier came out as the old and retired but experienced K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha. Mehmed Efendi, the chief of scribes, and the chief architect convinced the sultan that only K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha could avert disaster. ===Grand Vizier=== The Ottoman Empire reached the peak of its expansion during the administration of the K√∂pr√ºl√º household. K√∂pr√ºl√º was called to Istanbul, where he accepted the position of Grand Vizier on 14 September 1656. As a condition of his acceptance, K√∂pr√ºl√º demanded that the sultan decree only what K√∂pr√ºl√º approved, allow him to make all the appointments and dismissals, and refuse to hear or accept any malicious stories that might be spread about him. He was given extraordinary powers and political rule without interference, even from the highest authority of the Sultan. K√∂pr√ºl√º had acquired the reputation of being an honest and able administrator, but he was 80 years old when he assumed office. As the Grand Vizier, his first task was to advise Sultan Mehmed IV to conduct a life of hunts and traveling around the Balkans and to reside in the old capital of Edirne, thus stopping his direct political involvement in the management of the state. On 4 January 1657, the household cavalry Sipahi troops in Constantinople started a rebellion and this was cruelly suppressed by K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha with the help of Janissary troops. The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople was proven to be in treasonous contacts with the enemies of Ottoman state and K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha approved of his execution. Rivals and unfriendly religious leaders were banished or executed. The support of the Janissaries was obtained once he was secure in his office. K√∂pr√ºl√º centralized power in the empire, reviving traditional Ottoman methods of governing. He ordered those who were suspected of abusing their positions or who proved to be corrupt to be removed or executed. Those who failed at their tasks were punished severely, and unsuccessful military commanders often paid the supreme price. When Grand Admiral Topal Mehmed Pasha failed to break the Venetian blockade of the Dardanelles on 17 July 1657, K√∂pr√ºl√º executed him and his principal officers on the spot. When rivals complained to Mehmed IV about the Grand Vizier's methods, K√∂pr√ºl√º resigned, complaining that the Sultan had violated their agreement. Mehmed immediately asked K√∂pr√ºl√º to return as Grand Vizier, because his methods showed such success at restoring Ottoman power. ===War with Venice=== Battle of the Dardanelles on 19 July 1657. Since the resurgence of the Republic of Venice was the immediate crisis that had prompted K√∂pr√ºl√º's appointment as grand vizier, it was important that he demonstrate his effectiveness as a leader against the Venetians. He started on a military expeditions against the Venetian blockade of Dardanelles Straits. The Ottoman navy had a victory against Venice in the Battle of the Dardanelles on 19 July 1657. This allowed Ottomans to regain some of the Aegean islands, including Bozcaada and Limni (15 November) and to open the sea-supply routes to the Ottoman Army still conducting the sieges of Crete. ===War with Transylvania and the Habsburgs=== In 1658 he conducted a successful campaign in Transylvania. In Transylvania, Prince George II R√°k√≥czi renounced his erstwhile allegiance to the sultan. He attempted to make his state into a major power, allying himself with other Protestant princes in an attempt to conquer Hungary and Poland. While R√°k√≥czi invaded Poland in 1657, however, K√∂pr√ºl√º sent the Crimean Tatars to attack Transylvania. They forced R√°k√≥czi to retreat from Poland, but he refused to resume his obedience to the sultan. In response, in 1658, K√∂pr√ºl√º himself led a large Ottoman army into Transylvania. This force defeated R√°k√≥czi and forced him to flee to Habsburg lands. War with Habsburgs continued, but Ottoman control over Transylvania was confirmed in a temporary peace. He also annexed Yanova (Jen√∂) on 1 August 1660 and V√°rad on 27 August. === Revolt of Abaza Hasan Pasha === K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha's campaign against Transylvania was cut short by the large-scale revolt of several eastern provincial governors under the leadership of Abaza Hasan Pasha, then the governor of Aleppo. The rebels opposed K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed's violent purges of the military and demanded that he be killed. However, Sultan Mehmed IV remained steadfast in his support for K√∂pr√ºl√º and dispatched an army against the rebels under the command of Murtaza Pasha, who was then guarding the Safavid frontier. Despite assembling a force of 30,000 men and defeating Murtaza Pasha in battle, the harsh winter and fading morale eventually forced the rebels to capitulate. Abaza Hasan's revolt was finally brought to an end in February 1659 with the assassination of all the rebel commanders in Aleppo, despite promises that they would be spared. ===Ayazmakapi Fire=== In July 1660 there was a big fire in Istanbul (the Ayazmakapi Fire) causing great damage to persons and buildings, leading later to a food scarcity and plague. K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha became personally involved in the reconstruction affairs. The honesty and integrity in conducting state affairs by K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha is shown by an episode in this task.Sakaoglu, 281 The burnt-out Jewish quarters from the Ayazmakapi Fire were decided to be compulsorily purchased by the state. ===Death and legacy=== Despite K√∂pr√ºl√º's advanced age, he continued to display energy until the end of his life. When he fell mortally ill in 1661, the sultan came to his bedside. K√∂pr√ºl√º convinced him to appoint his son, K√∂pr√ºl√º Fazƒ±l Ahmed Pasha, as the next grand vizier. He also allegedly advised the sultan never to take advice from a woman, never to appoint a minister who was too wealthy, to always keep the treasury full, and to always keep the army on the move. K√∂pr√ºl√º died on 31 October 1661. He left behind a well-tuned administrative machine, having restored to the Ottoman Empire its reputation for military aggressiveness and its former prestige and power internally and externally. K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed's victories in Transylvania would push the Ottoman border closer to Austria. ==See also== * K√∂pr√ºl√º era * K√∂pr√ºl√º family * List of Ottoman Grand Viziers ==References== * N.

It is located in Enschede, Netherlands, at the Business & Science Park, near the University of Twente. The stadium has an all-seated capacity of 30,205 with a standard pitch heating system and has a promenade instead of fences around the stands. It hosted the final of the UEFA Women's Euro 2017. ==History== De Grolsch Veste replaced the old Diekman Stadion as FC Twente's home ground on 22 March 1998. Plans had been afoot to expand and to renovate the old and now demolished Diekman Stadion. However, with a growing fan capacity and with arguments that the location of the Diekman stadium was not strategic enough, the idea was conceived to build a new arena for the FC Twente fans. The Diekman ground also faced problems with its seating plans as a result of previous FIFA regulations which imposed a necessity to construct a seating tribune behind each goal post. The cost of the construction is estimated to have been around 33 million guilders and it took fourteen months to complete, with its foundation stone having been laid on 31 January 1997. Due to the tight budget available, the layout of the stadium was constructed in such a way that future expansions would be possible without the necessity to tear down entire stands. The first match played at the stadium was a 3‚Äì0 victory by the home team against PSV on 10 May 1998 in an Eredivisie match. The first goal in the new stadium was scored in the 14th minute by FC Twente player Chris De Witte. On 1 October 2006, the stadium was updated with two big flatscreen video-walls. In May 2008 the Arke Stadion was renamed to De Grolsch Veste with beer brewery Grolsch as sponsor. The brewery is located in the club's hometown Enschede. The name \\"Veste\\" (fortress) is a reference to Groenlo, a former fortified town that was often besieged and where Grolsch was first brewed. On 5 September 2009 for the first time ever an international (friendly) match was played in the FC Twente stadium when the Netherlands beat Japan 3‚Äì0. ===Expansion=== In 2006 plans were unfolded to increase the stadium capacity to 24,000 seats. The expansion started in January 2008 and was completed in September 2008, just in time for the start of the 2008‚Äì2009 season. FC Twente is aiming to start a new phase in the stadium expansion in the summer of 2011 which will result in a capacity of 32,000 seats. As part of the combined Netherlands and Belgium bidhttp://www.thebid.org/?lang=nl to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the stadium was one of five stadiums in the Netherlands selected by the KNVB to host games. This would mean that the stadium capacity needed to be expanded to the minimum required seating of 44,000. The city of Enschede announced on 11 September 2009 that it would officially be a candidate city and that it would fully support FC Twente's ambition to expand the stadium capacity to the minimum required seating of 44,000. In December 2009, IAA Architecten released computer generated images of the proposed 44,000+ stadium with an arched 3rd tier, to complete the main stand. ===Roof collapse=== The Grolsch Veste was expanded during the summer of 2011. On 7 July, when working on the construction of the stand, the roof suddenly collapsed, killing two workers and injuring 14 people. The collapse was probably caused by too much weight on the unfinished roof. After an investigation of a month, the roof was taken away and work continued. FC Twente played the first few competition matches partly without a roof. The new stadium was officially opened on 29 October with a competition match against PSV Eindhoven (2-2). A year after the accident, a monument was unveiled. ==Gallery== File:Grolsch Veste 1.jpg Outside view File:De_Grolsch_Veste_-_main_stand.jpgMain stand File:De_Grolsch_Veste_-_outside_corner.jpgOutside corner File:Arke_Stadion_Vak_P.jpgP-side File:De_Grolsch_Veste_-_sign.jpgSign File:Noaberpoort.jpgNoaberpoort File:Arke_Stadion_Enschede_2.jpgPrevious Arke stadium File:Station Enschede Drienerlo.jpgThe Enschede Kennispark railway station next to the stadium ==References== ==External links== * Category:Football venues in the Netherlands Category:Buildings and structures in Enschede Category:FC Twente Category:Sports venues in Overijssel Category:UEFA Women's Euro 2017 venues Category:Sports venues completed in 1998 Category:1998 establishments in the Netherlands ","title":"De Grolsch Veste"},{"id":"832632","text":"David Hunter Hubel (February 27, 1926 ‚Äì September 22, 2013) was a Canadian American neurophysiologist noted for his studies of the structure and function of the visual cortex. He was co-recipient with Torsten Wiesel of the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (shared with Roger W. Sperry), for their discoveries concerning information processing in the visual system. For much of his career, Hubel was the John Franklin Enders University Professor of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School. In 1978, Hubel and Wiesel were awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University.In 1983, Hubel received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. == Early life and education == David H. Hubel was born in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, to American parents in 1926. His grandfather emigrated as a child to the United States from the Bavarian town of N√∂rdlingen. In 1929, his family moved to Montreal, where he spent his formative years. His father was a chemical engineer and Hubel developed a keen interest in science right from childhood, making many experiments in chemistry and electronics. From age six to eighteen, he attended Strathcona Academy in Outremont, Quebec about which he said, \\"[I owe] much to the excellent teachers there, especially to Julia Bradshaw, a dedicated, vivacious history teacher with a memorable Irish temper, who awakened me to the possibility of learning how to write readable English.\\" He studied mathematics and physics at McGill University, and then entered medical school there.David H. Hubel, Torsten N. Wiesel. Brain and Visual Perception: The Story of a 25-Year Collaboration. Oxford University Press, 2004. == Information == In 1946, he moved to the United States to work at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine as an assistant resident in Neurology. He was later drafted by the army and served at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR). There, he began recording from the primary visual cortex of sleeping and awake cats. At WRAIR, he invented the modern metal microelectrode out of Stoner-Mudge lacquer and tungsten, and the modern hydraulic microdrive, which he had to learn basic machinist skills to produce. In 1958, he moved to Johns Hopkins and began his collaborations with Wiesel, and discovered orientation selectivity and columnar organization in the visual cortex. One year later, he joined the faculty of Harvard University. In 1981, Hubel became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. From 1988 to 1989 he was the president of the Society for Neuroscience. ==Research== Hubel in his lab, 1980 The Hubel and Wiesel experiments greatly expanded the scientific knowledge of sensory processing. The partnership lasted over twenty years and became known as one of the most prominent research pairings in science. In one experiment, done in 1959, they inserted a microelectrode into the primary visual cortex of an anesthetized cat. They then projected patterns of light and dark on a screen in front of the cat. They found that some neurons fired rapidly when presented with lines at one angle, while others responded best to another angle. Some of these neurons responded to light patterns and dark patterns differently. Hubel and Wiesel called these neurons simple cells.\\" Still other neurons, which they termed complex cells, detected edges regardless of where they were placed in the receptive field of the neuron and could preferentially detect motion in certain directions., Chapter 4, pg 16 These studies showed how the visual system constructs complex representations of visual information from simple stimulus features. Hubel and Wiesel received the Nobel Prize for two major contributions: firstly, their work on the development of the visual system, which involved a description of ocular dominance columns in the 1960s and 1970s; and secondly, their work establishing a foundation for visual neurophysiology, describing how signals from the eye are processed by visual parcels in the neo-cortex to generate edge detectors, motion detectors, stereoscopic depth detectors, and color detectors, building blocks of the visual scene. By depriving kittens of using one eye, they showed that columns in the primary visual cortex receiving inputs from the other eye took over the areas that would normally receive input from the deprived eye. This has important implications for the understanding of deprivation amblyopia, a type of visual loss due to unilateral visual deprivation during the so-called critical period. These kittens also did not develop areas receiving input from both eyes, a feature needed for binocular vision. Hubel and Wiesel's experiments showed that the ocular dominance develops irreversibly early in childhood development. These studies opened the door for the understanding and treatment of childhood cataracts and strabismus. They were also important in the study of cortical plasticity. Furthermore, the understanding of sensory processing in animals served as inspiration for the SIFT descriptor (Lowe, 1999), which is a local feature used in computer vision for tasks such as object recognition and wide-baseline matching, etc. The SIFT descriptor is arguably the most widely used feature type for these tasks. Hubel was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1982. ==Personal life== Hubel married Ruth Izzard in 1953; she died February 17, 2013.Boston Globe: Shirley Ruth (Izzard) Hubel Legacy.com.

Because the metal detectorist reported finding the gold cup, professional archaeologists from Canterbury Archaeological Trust were able to properly excavate the site. This work has revealed a previously unsuspected funerary complex of Early Bronze Age date (approximately 2300 BC) had stood at the site. It is thought that the cup was not a grave good itself, as it was found independent of any burial and away from the centre of the mound as part of the mound material context. It has been suggested by Canterbury Archaeological Trust, that the cup may have been a votive offering placed within the mound during its construction. However, the mound had suffered extensive disturbance due to the actions of burrowing animals and the cup may have been moved from its original position. No contemporary burials have in fact been found at the site although later Iron Age ones have since been found along with a Saxon cemetery. Excavation work has continued at the site, funded by English Heritage, the BBC, the British Museum and the Kent Archaeological Society. This work has indicated that the now ploughed-away barrow was as high as 5m and had a diameter of more than 40m. The flat-bottomed ditch that surrounded it was 5‚Äì6 m wide and 1.35 m deep. Considerable evidence of much earlier Neolithic activity has now been found on the site including by far the largest assemblage of grooved ware in the county. Current theories now focus on the site having been significant long before and after the barrow being built and that the ditch may have been that of an older henge or, more likely, hengiform monument. ==External links== *The excavation at the find site *The Ringlemere Cup: Precious Cups and the Beginning of the Channel Bronze Age - available online, Editors: Stuart Needham, Keith Parfitt and Gillian Varndell; Contributors: Aaron Birchenough, Chris Butler, Caroline Cartwright, Stuart Needham, Susan La Niece, Keith Parfitt, Gillian Varndell, British Museum Research Publication 163, Category:Barrows in the United Kingdom Category:Anglo-Saxon archaeology Category:Archaeological sites in Kent Category:Dover District Category:Iron Age sites in England Category:Stone Age sites in England Category:Bronze Age sites in Kent ","title":"Ringlemere barrow"},{"id":"832725","text":"The Holy Cross dispute occurred in 2001 and 2002 in the Ardoyne area of north Belfast, Northern Ireland. During the 30-year conflict known as the Troubles, Ardoyne had become segregated ‚Äì Ulster Protestants and Irish Catholics lived in separate areas. This left Holy Cross, a Catholic primary school for girls, in the middle of a Protestant area. In June 2001‚Äîduring the last week of school before the summer break‚ÄîProtestant loyalists began picketing the school, claiming that Catholics were regularly attacking their homes and denying them access to facilities. The picket resumed on 3 September, when the new school term began. For weeks, hundreds of loyalist protesters tried to stop the schoolchildren and their parents from walking to school through their area. Hundreds of riot police, backed up by British soldiers, escorted the children and parents through the protest each day. Some protesters shouted sectarian abuse and threw stones, bricks, fireworks, blast bombs and urine- filled balloons at the schoolchildren, their parents and the police. The \\"scenes of frightened Catholic schoolgirls running a gauntlet of abuse from loyalist protesters as they walked to school captured world headlines\\".Heatley, Colm. Interface, Flashpoints in Northern Ireland. Chapter 1: Alliance Avenue and Holy Cross Dispute. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) Death threats were made against the parents and school staff by the Red Hand Defenders, a loyalist paramilitary group. The protest was condemned by both Catholics and Protestants, including politicians. Some likened the protest to child abuse and compared the protesters to North American white supremacists in the 1950s. During this time, the protest sparked bouts of fierce rioting between Catholics and Protestants in Ardoyne, and loyalist attacks on police. On 23 November, the loyalists ended the protest after being promised tighter security for their area and a redevelopment scheme. The security forces remained outside the school for several months after. In January 2002, a scuffle between a Protestant and a Catholic outside the school sparked a large-scale riot in the area and attacks on other schools in north Belfast. The picket was not resumed and the situation has been mostly quiet since then. The following year, the BBC aired a documentary-drama about the protests. ==Beginnings== One of the \\"peace lines\\" in Ardoyne, segregating Catholic and Protestant neighbourhoods Holy Cross is a girls-only Catholic primary school in the Ardoyne area of north Belfast. Ardoyne was one of the most deprived areas of Northern Ireland.

Prof. Frank Gaffikin. Queen‚Äôs University Belfast Before the outbreak of the Troubles in the late 1960s, the area was \\"mixed\\", with Catholics and Protestants living alongside each other. However, after violence broke out between the two communities, the area became segregated. The area to the south of Alliance Avenue became almost wholly populated by Catholics (who were mostly Irish nationalist and republican) while the area to the north (known as Glenbryn) became wholly populated by Protestants (who were mostly unionist and loyalist). This left Holy Cross in the middle of a Protestant area and some of the schoolchildren had to walk through it to get to school. A wall (known as a \\"peace line\\") was built to separate the two communities. During the Troubles, almost 20 people were killed near the peace line by loyalists, republicans and the British Army. In the mid-1990s, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the main loyalist paramilitary groups‚Äîthe Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF)‚Äîdeclared ceasefires. In 1998, the Good Friday Agreement was signed, which set up a government in which Irish nationalists/republicans and unionists/loyalists were to share power. However, the political situation remained tense. So-called dissident republicans and dissident loyalists continued to wage small-scale violent campaigns. In December 2000, Protestant taxi driver Trevor Kell was shot dead in Ardoyne. The IRA were suspected of involvement as forensic evidence linked the gun with an IRA shooting in 1997. This would make it the first sectarian killing for almost two years.McKittrick, David. Lost Lives: The Stories of the Men, Women and Children who Died as a Result of the Northern Ireland Troubles. p.1487 The next day, loyalists retaliated by shooting dead Catholic man Gary Moore as he was renovating a house in Newtownabbey. Later, the IRA was blamed for the \\"punishment shooting\\" of two men, one of whom is believed to have been questioned over Kell's death.\\"Ardoyne stories: Behind nationalist lines\\". BBC News, 4 September 2001. Retrieved 3 September 2012.\\"Ardoyne Stories: Peace lines and division\\". BBC News, 3 September 2001. Retrieved 3 September 2012. The protesters claimed their homes were being regularly attacked by Catholics and that they were being denied access to facilities in the Catholic area, such as shops and playgrounds. However, Catholics claimed that their homes were regularly being attacked also. The Protestant population of Glenbryn had dropped significantly since the ceasefires and some Protestants believed they were being driven out. Other protesters alleged that IRA members were using the children's journey to-and-from school to gather intelligence. Anne Bill, a community worker who was centrally involved in the protest, said \\"Protestants felt they weren't getting a fair deal under the Good Friday Agreement. People in Glenbryn kept telling the Government about attacks on their houses and how vulnerable they felt but we weren't being listened to. That is why people protested on the Ardoyne Road, the focus wasn't so much the school itself [...] The community in Glenbryn is in decline and it is fearful of Ardoyne. That does encourage a siege mentality\\". Tension built and youths from both communities raised more and more flags along Ardoyne Road. On 19 June, a fight broke out between men putting up loyalist paramilitary flags and the occupants of a passing car. Loyalists allege that the car from republican Ardoyne estate rammed the ladder and knocked the two men off. How the episode started remains disputed.Crimes of loyalty, Page 270\\"Violence engulfs friendly schools\\". The Guardian, 22 June 2001.

In the summer of 2001, the RUC received intelligence that UDA members were planning to \\"exploit community tensions\\" to kill Irish nationalists, Catholics and/or police officers. ==Summer 2001== The entrance to Holy Cross Girls Primary School On Tuesday 19 June, Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers had to protect children and parents entering the school after they were attacked by loyalist stone throwers. Police described the attack as \\"vicious\\". Following the incident, a blockade of the school developed, with loyalists standing across the road and RUC officers keeping the children and their parents away.A Chronology of the Conflict: 2001, Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) The following day, the school was forced to close when loyalists blocked the entrance. During the evening, hundreds of loyalists and nationalists (up to 600) clashed with each other and with the police. Shots were also fired at the police and over 100 petrol bombs were thrown. During the riots the police fired a number of the new 'L21 A1' plastic baton rounds for the first time. 39 RUC officers were injured. Nine shots in total were fired - six from loyalists and three from republicans. The trouble came after an explosion at the rear of Catholic homes next to a peace line. Both loyalist and nationalist politicians blamed each other for the violence. This would be the first of many large riots to take place in Belfast within more than a year. The morning blockade continued on Thursday 21 June. About 60 of the school's 230 pupils entered the school through the grounds of another school. Senior Sinn F√©in member Gerry Kelly said: \\"It's like something out of Alabama in the 1960s\\". Three Protestant families left their homes in Ardoyne Avenue, saying they were afraid of a nationalist attack. During the evening and night there were serious disturbances in the area around the school. Loyalists fired ten shots, and threw six blast bombs and 46 petrol bombs at police lines. Two Catholic homes were attacked with pipe bombs, and a child was thrown against a wall by one of the blasts.\\"Violence engulfs friendly schools\\". The Guardian, 22 June 2001. Retrieved 3 September 2012. 24 RUC officers were hurt. On Friday 22 June, a number of schoolchildren again had to enter the school through the grounds of another school. This was the last day of school before the summer break. Talks between the protesters and the schoolchildren's parents took place over the summer, but no agreement was reached. On 20 August, a 'paint bomb' was thrown at the home of a Protestant man in Hesketh Park, smashing a window and causing paint damage to furniture. The man had taken part in the loyalist protest. ==Autumn 2001== Part of Ardoyne Road A street in Glenbryn, the Protestant area The protest resumed on Monday 3 September, the first day of the Autumn school term. The RUC, supported by the British Army, were by then better prepared and managed to force a path through the protesters. Loyalists jeered and shouted sectarian abuse as the children, some as young as four, were escorted into the school by their parents and the police. Stones and bottles were thrown at the children and their parents; one woman was injured. A mother of one of the schoolgirls said: \\"It was absolutely terrifying. They were shouting 'dirty tramps', 'your kids are animals', 'Fenian scum', 'you Fenian bastards'. And all we were trying to do was get our kids to school\\". Unionist politicians claimed a \\"heavy-handed\\" police presence had inflamed the situation, while the Progressive Unionist Party's Billy Hutchinson alleged that five known IRA men had been allowed to walk with the children through the Protestant area.\\"All we wanted was to get our kids to school\\". The Guardian, 4 September 2001. Retrieved 3 September 2012. Later in the day the Red Hand Defenders (RHD), an illegal loyalist paramilitary group, warned parents and children to stay away from the Ardoyne Road. A threat was also issued against police officers. During the evening there was violence near the school as youths from both sides attacked each other and the security forces. Three Catholic-owned homes on Newington Avenue were badly damaged in a loyalist pipe bomb attack. The blast caused an oil tank to catch fire and the flames spread to three houses, one of which was completely destroyed. Another pipe bomb exploded in the garden of a house in the White City area. There was also violence on North Queen Street and Limestone Road. The following is a timeline of the major events during the Autumn protest. ;Week one *Tuesday 4 September: Loyalist protesters tried to block access to the school, but riot police forced a path through the protesters and lined the road with armoured vehicles, creating a cordon for the children and parents to walk through. Loyalists attacked riot police with a blast bomb (an improvised grenade), injuring one officer.\\"Violence returns to disputed Belfast school\\". The Guardian. 4 September 2001. As the children and parents made their way through the cordon, loyalist protesters shouted abuse and threw stones at them. Some of the children were forced to turn back. There was more rioting near the school during the evening and night. A crowd of loyalists attacked police with bricks, bottles, stones, fireworks, ballbearings and blast bombs. A volley of shots was also heard in the Glenbryn estate. Police figures stated that 41 police officers and two soldiers had been injured, fifteen blast bombs and 250 petrol bombs had been thrown, and four civilian cars had been damaged. *Wednesday 5 September: As the parents and their children passed Glenbryn Parade, loyalists threw a blast bomb towards them. The device exploded, injuring four police officers and a police dog. Panic ensued. Children began screaming and \\"weeping uncontrollably\\" and one mother suffered a panic attack.\\"Eyewitness: Bomb blast at school\\". BBC News, 5 September 2001. Retrieved 3 September 2012. All were taken to hospital. The Red Hand Defenders (RHD) said it was responsible for the attack. Afterward, Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) politician Billy Hutchinson said he was \\"ashamed to be a loyalist today after seeing these people attack young Catholic girls\\". However, he says he continued to stand with the protesters each morning to show leadership. John Reid, the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, called the attack \\"barbaric\\" and called for the protest to end immediately.\\"Anger over school protest blast\\". BBC News. 5 September 2001. *Thursday 6 September: The protest was peaceful but very noisy as protesters used air horns (klaxons), blew whistles, and banged metal bin lids as the children passed through the security cordon. Four parents in the 'Right to Education' group were notified that death threats had been made against them by the RHD, who said they would be killed if they were seen taking their children to the school. John Reid, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, cut short his holiday and returned to Northern Ireland because of the situation. *Friday 7 September: Loyalists held a silent protest as children and parents passed through the security cordon. The silent protest was a mark of respect for Thomas McDonald (16), a Protestant killed in a hit-and-run incident after he had attacked a car with bricks and stones in another part of north Belfast on Tuesday. Catholic parents also held a minute's silence before beginning their walk to the school. Inside the school grounds, prayers involving clergymen from both denominations were said. ;Week two *Monday 10 September: The protesters were quiet as the children and their parents passed, but when the parents returned home the protesters used air horns (klaxons), blew whistles, and banged metal bin lids. Some of the protesters shouted \\"Fenian scum\\" at the parents. In London, Richard Haass, the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland, discussed the protest with John Reid. Senior Sinn F√©in member Gerry Kelly introduced a private members' motion in the Northern Ireland Assembly, proposing that \\"the Assembly supports the right to education of children attending the Holy Cross Primary School in north Belfast\\". Unionist members proposed an amendment to the motion to make it apply to all schools in the area. The Assembly passed the amended motion. *Tuesday 11 September: The protest followed the pattern of yesterday. Father Aidan Troy, Chairman of the school's Board of Governors, together with a local Protestant clergyman, held a meeting with representatives of the Concerned Residents of Upper Ardoyne (CRUA) who were organising the protest. John Reid also held a meeting with the representatives. Fr Troy said of the protest: \\"I really found it hard to comprehend the hatred that was shown to the school girls ... I walked with them and because of that I was spat on by the protesters. They held up posters accusing me of being a paedophile and they showed the children pornographic images. The intensity of the protest was hard to comprehend; I don't think people can really understand that from watching it on television\\". *Wednesday 12 September: The protest followed the pattern of Monday and Tuesday. However, before going to the school the children and parents held a prayer service and a minute's silence for the victims of the September 11 attacks. On Friday, the protesters halted their protest for one day as a mark of respect for the victims of 11 September attacks. ;Week three *Thursday 20 September: Protesters reverted to the earlier tactic of making a lot of noise as the children passed. Six men appeared before Belfast Magistrates Court on public order offences related to the school protest. The six men were remanded on bail but told not to take part in the protest. As a result of the arrests, the group representing the protesters, CRUA, announced that it had \\"suspended all business until further notice\\". ;Week four *Wednesday 26 September: Protesters threw fireworks at children and parents returning from the school during the afternoon. That evening, a loyalist protest which blocked the nearby Crumlin Road turned into a riot. Police said they moved to protect Catholic homes from loyalists and were attacked by gunfire, pipe bombs and petrol bombs. They responded with plastic bullets, and 33 officers were injured. There was further violence in the area the following night, and police came under fire from loyalists on Cambrai Street. Thirteen officers were injured in the violence and a woman was shot in the leg. ;Week five *Monday 1 October: Protesters continued their noisy protest as children and parents entered and left the school. Some protesters threw urine-filled balloons at the children and parents. Cups of cold tea and water were also thrown by protesters.\\"How my daughter was cast into a maelstrom of hatred\\". The Guardian, 9 November 2003. Retrieved 3 September 2012. Reg Empey (Ulster Unionist Party), then Acting First Minister of Northern Ireland, and Seamus Mallon (Social Democratic and Labour Party), then Acting Deputy First Minister, met with local representatives to discuss the situation. Empy said there was no excuse for the ongoing protest. *Tuesday 2 October: British Conservative MP Quentin Davies, then Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, accompanied parents and children as they returned home through the protest. Davies called the protest \\"utterly unacceptable\\". ;Week six *Tuesday 9 October: Aidan Troy, chairman of the school's Board of Governors, said he was considering taking legal action to try to end the protest. He said: \\"The weeks of suffering for these small girls were never justified ... This is no longer a legitimate protest; it is a form of child abuse\\". The cost of policing the protest was reported as having reached ¬£1 million. *Wednesday 10 October: Many of the protesters had begun to hide their identity and some were wearing masks of characters from horror movies. Local doctor Michael Tan said that some of the schoolchildren's families were near \\"breaking point\\" and parents and children were in need of professional psychological care. Bryce Dickson, head of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, visited the scene of the protest. He spoke to some of the protesters but was criticised by some of the parents of the children for not walking the route with them as Quentin Davies had done. One of the protesters displayed a threatening letter allegedly sent by a group called the \\"Catholic Reaction Force\\". Meanwhile, it was announced that the security wall between the loyalist and nationalist areas would be extended. ;Week seven *Monday 15 October: Bryce Dickson again visited the protest and called for it to end. He said \\"The treatment of these children is inhumane and their right to effective education is being affected\\". Protestant parents in north and west Belfast said that there had been rising attacks on buses carrying Protestant schoolchildren. *Wednesday 17 October: As children and parents were returning home from the school, a loyalist bomb exploded at the back of a house on Alliance Avenue. No one was injured but the householder, and a number of parents and children, were described as being \\"in shock\\". ;Week eight *Wednesday 24 October: There were disturbances on the Crumlin Road, not far from the school. Loyalists blocked the main road at about 4:30PM, stopping Catholic schoolchildren from getting home. Catholic families arrived to try to escort their children home. Bricks and bottles were thrown by both groups and police moved in to keep the sides apart. The Crumlin Road is the 'alternative' route that loyalists want the Holy Cross children and their parents to use when going to and from the school. *Friday 26 October: Two people were arrested during the protest outside the school. Loyalists had tried to block the road and stop children parents from getting to the school. That night, loyalists threw a pipe bomb at a group of soldiers and police on the road, badly wounding a soldier and injuring several officers. The school was closed the following week after Halloween. ;Week nine *Monday 5 November: Protesters said they had reached an \\"understanding\\" with the Police Service of Northern Ireland (the former RUC, now renamed) over the weekend. As a result, the police were not wearing full riot gear when the protest took place. *Wednesday 7 November: The mother of a child attending the school began legal proceedings against John Reid and the police. The mother said that police had not given enough protection to her daughter and had failed to identify, arrest, or prosecute protesters who broke the law in full public view. While on a visit to Northern Ireland, Archbishop Desmond Tutu met some of the schoolchildren and their parents. Tutu also met some of those involved in the protest. *Friday 9 November: The protest was halted for one day. Some of the schoolchildren sat their \\"11-plus\\" exams. Mary McAleese, then President of Ireland, called for an end to the protest. ;Week ten *Monday 12 November: There was a change in the policing tactics used at the protest. Instead of gathering together all the Catholic parents and children and escorting them to the school as a group, the police specified a time period in which parents could walk to the school. About 400 police officers (an eighth of the total in Belfast) were there to ensure that the children could get to school. The day's operation cost an estimated ¬£100,000. Some Catholic parents complained that the new police tactics left them more exposed to the protesters. Police arrested a nationalist who was taking a video of the protesters. ;Week eleven *Monday 19 November: The media reported that the father of one of the schoolgirls had begun a hunger strike. The man said that he felt so frustrated by the protest that he was refusing food in an attempt to end the blockade. It was also revealed that a split had occurred in CRUA, the protest group. It was reported that as many as five of its committee members may have resigned. They are believed to include spokesmen Stuart McCartney and Jim Potts. *Tuesday 20 November: The Belfast Education and Library Board (BELB) provided two buses for those schoolchildren and parents who wished to use them to get through the protest. However, most of them made their way to the school on foot. *Thursday 22 November: David Trimble (UUP), then First Minister, and Mark Durkan (SDLP), then Deputy First Minister, held a meeting with the protest group. Before calling an end to the protest the protesters asked for CCTV to be introduced, along with road-calming measures, and tighter security in the area. *Friday 23 November: In the afternoon there was a rally in the middle of Belfast in support of the schoolchildren. About 500 people attended. In the evening the protest group held a meeting and announced that the protest would be \\"suspended\\". For months after the protest ended, police and British Army armoured vehicles sat outside the school and at the junction of Alliance Avenue each day. However, eventually parents were able to walk their children to school without a police and Army escort. == January 2002 == On Wednesday 9 January 2002, there were confrontations outside the school during the early afternoon. Disturbances and rioting quickly spread throughout Ardoyne during the evening and into the night. Catholic parents and Protestant residents each claimed that the other side had started the trouble. Catholic parents said that they had faced increased verbal abuse since Monday during their walks to and from school and that they were attacked while leaving the school on Wednesday afternoon. A Catholic mother claimed she was punched in the face as she walked home from the school with her child. Police officers said they arrived at a confrontation between a Protestant woman and a Catholic woman near the school. The police moved to make an arrest but the person was protected by other residents. Police officers said they had to draw their weapons. There was a report that loyalists had driven a car at the school gates in an attempt to break in. Some schoolchildren had to be taken home through the grounds of another school while a bus carrying other children was attacked on its way down Ardoyne Road. Protestant residents claimed the trouble started when Catholics removed a wreath from a lamp-post.A Chronology of the Conflict: 2002, Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) Up to 500 loyalists and nationalists were involved in the disturbances on the Ardoyne Road, Crumlin Road and Brompton Park areas. About 130 petrol bombs, acid bombs and fireworks were thrown. Four Catholic youths were hospitalised after being hit by shotgun pellets at Hesketh Park; loyalists petrol-bombed and destroyed a police vehicle; Catholic homes were attacked on the Upper Crumlin Road; a Catholic woman was knocked-down by a car on Twaddell Avenue; a Catholic man was struck by a police vehicle, and a 13-year-old Protestant schoolboy was injured when a bus was attacked. The police fired eight plastic bullets and arrested three people. As the trouble worsened, 200 police officers, backed by 200 soldiers, were deployed. At least 14 police officers were injured. The following day, the Holy Cross school was forced to close for the day. Some other schools in the area closed early due to fears about the safety of schoolchildren. In the morning, six loyalists, one with a gun, rampaged through the grounds of Our Lady of Mercy Catholic girls' secondary school, smashing 18 cars with crowbars. Parents rushed to collect their hysterical daughters. In the afternoon, Protestant pupils from Boys' Model Secondary School were ferried home in police armoured Land Rovers past nationalist crowds on Crumlin Road.\\"More schools caught in cycle of hate\\". The Guardian, 11 January 2002. Retrieved 3 September 2012. Catholic parents and Protestant residents held separate meetings to discuss the situation. On Friday 11 January, the Red Hand Defenders issued a death threat against all Catholic teachers and all other staff working at Catholic schools in north Belfast. That weekend, two Catholic schools were set on fire and teachers' cars were attacked. On Monday, more than 750 armed police officers and soldiers were sent to guard Catholic schools in north Belfast while armoured vehicles lined Ardoyne Road.\\"Armed guards deployed to protect Catholic teachers\\". The Guardian, 15 January 2002. Retrieved 3 September 2012. There was no protest outside the school and there was no serious violence, although there were a few minor scuffles. The Northern Ireland Office announced that permanent CCTV cameras would be installed on the Ardoyne Road. A temporary system was to be put in place while waiting for the permanent installation. In February 2002, Holy Cross schoolchildren travelled to County Galway for a free holiday as guests of Peacock's Hotel. The owners of the hotel had made the offer of the holiday following the 2001 protests. Twenty of the schoolchildren also met Bertie Ahern, then Taoiseach, during a short visit to Dublin. Ahern said it would show support for the children from the people of the Republic. In June, James Adair‚Äîbrother of Ulster Defence Association leader Johnny Adair‚Äîwas jailed for six months for riotous behaviour and given a concurrent sentence of four months for obstructing police during the riots.\\"Adair's brother jailed over Holy Cross riots\\", Irish Independent, 13 June 2002. Retrieved 4 August 2009. ==Outcomes== The Holy Cross protest was said to have heightened sectarian tensions in Northern Ireland in a way not seen since the Drumcree dispute in the mid-1990s. PUP politician Billy Hutchinson said \\"The protest was a disaster in terms of putting their cause forward but it was a genuine expression of their anger and frustration and fear over what is happening in that part of North Belfast\\". A month before the protest was ended the Department of Social Development announced a housing redevelopment package for Glenbryn. This angered some Catholics and nationalists, particularly in north Belfast, where almost 80% of those on the housing waiting list were Catholics. They saw the package as a \\"buy-off\\" for Glenbryn residents. Ardoyne Sinn F√©in councillor Margaret McClenaghan says the common perception was that loyalists were being rewarded for intimidating schoolgirls. However, one Protestant community activist said \\"There is no victory for our area despite all the hype. It is actually a strategy of social political engineering between the NlO and the Housing Executive, to solve the issue of interface tension\\". He explained that 186 houses would be demolished and that only about 20% would be replaced. This, he said, would mean a shrinking of the Protestant population in Glenbryn. During the protest, a number of schoolchildren were moved to other schools. Applications for enrolment at Holy Cross had dropped by almost half. Since the end of the protest, steps have been taken to heal relations. The North Belfast Community Action Unit was set up to foster inter-community talks, focusing on social and economic issues of interest to Ardoyne and Glenbryn. Nevertheless, community workers from both sides admit progress has been slow. ===Effect on the schoolchildren=== Brendan Bradley, head of the Survivors of Trauma group (which deals with victims of Troubles-related violence), said that the \\"trauma\\" experienced by the children was \\"almost without parallel\\" in the history of the Troubles: > It wasn't as though this abuse lasted for a couple of days or was a one-off; > it went on for months. Many needed counselling, some long-term counselling, > in the wake of it all. Parents told how their daughters had changed from > being fun-loving to being very withdrawn. Fr Aidan Troy said that some of the schoolgirls had been \\"put on heavy tranquillizers such as diazepam ... because of the trauma they were experiencing\\". Parents spoke of how their children had been wetting the bed and had started to throw tantrums and become withdrawn. When Holy Cross teachers asked girls in Primary 6 (aged 9‚Äì10) to draw a picture many had drawn mothers and fathers crying, surrounded by people with angry faces. ==Later incidents== In 2003, Loyalists placed a pipe bomb at the entrance of the school, it was defused and there were no injuries.\\"Holy Cross pipe bomb raises fear that loyalists may revive dispute\\", David McKitterick, The Independent, 7 January 2003. Retrieved 4 August 2009. In 2003, a BBC televised drama called Holy Cross was made about the dispute, though it was filmed in Liverpool.\\"Holy Cross dispute in BBC film drama\\", Marie Louise McCrory, The Irish News, 25 June 2003. Retrieved 4 August 2009 (Google Cache).\\"Belfast priest protests at BBC re-enactment of sectarian hatred outside Holy Cross school\\", Ian Burrell, The Independent, 6 November 2003. Retrieved 4 August 2009. Fr Aidan Troy, head of the board of governors of the school, expressed concern that the drama could reignite the problem. In April 2013, loyalists erected Union Jacks and loyalist flags outside the school and painted the kerbstones at its entrance red, white and blue. On 25 April the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) were called to the school to disperse a loyalist protest being held outside it. The protest was sparked by false rumours on social networks that Belfast City Council employees were due to arrive to remove the flags and the paint.No 'Holy Cross II' vows DUP following loyalist protest outside school, Belfast Telegraph, 27 April 2013 In the early hours of Sunday 23 April 2017, a bomb was found by a police patrol outside the gates of Holy Cross Boys' Primary School in Ardoyne. The police said the bomb was \\"significant in terms of its [undisclosed] shape\\", and that police on foot patrol were the likely target. A sense of outrage was reported in the area. ==References== ==External links== * BBC Q & A on the Holy Cross dispute * - CAIN Chronicle of the Conflict for 2001 * - Guardian map of the disputed route Category:2001 in Northern Ireland Category:2002 in Northern Ireland Category:2000s in County Antrim Category:21st century in Belfast Category:Anti-Catholicism in Northern Ireland Category:Attacks on schools in Europe Category:Crime in Belfast Category:Crimes against children Category:Education in Northern Ireland Category:Militant unionism Category:Protests in Northern Ireland Category:Riots and civil disorder in Northern Ireland Category:Sectarian violence Category:The Troubles in Belfast ","title":"Holy Cross dispute"},{"id":"832743","text":"Jeremy John Le Mesurier Wolfenden (26 June 1934, England ‚Äì 28 December 1965) was a foreign correspondent and British spy at the height of the Cold War. ==Biography== The son of John Wolfenden, chairman of the Wolfenden Report which recommended the legalisation of male homosexual acts in Britain, Jeremy Wolfenden was himself homosexual.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, article on John Wolfenden.

He won a scholarship to Eton where he was known as 'cleverest boy in England', then to his father's alma mater Magdalen College, Oxford, where he obtained a first class degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. He subsequently became a Prize Fellow of All Souls.

It was claimed he had fainted in the bathroom, cracked his head against the washbasin and died of a cerebral haemorrhage.

Unlike their benthic relatives the ascidians, thaliaceans are free- floating (pelagic) for their entire lifespan. The group includes species with complex life cycles with both solitary and colonial forms. ==Anatomy== The three orders of thaliaceans are filter feeders. Pyrosomes are colonial animals, with multiple tiny ascidian-like zooids arranged in a cylinder closed at one end. All of the atrial siphons point inwards, emptying into a single, common cloaca in the centre of the cylinder. As the water exhaled by the zooids exits through a common opening, the water movement slowly propels the pyrosome through the sea. Salps and doliolids have a transparent barrel-shaped body through which they pump water, propelling them through the sea and from which they extract food. The bulk of the body consists of the large pharynx. Water enters the pharynx through the large buccal siphon at the front end of the animal, and is forced through a number of slits in the pharyngeal wall into an atrium lying just behind it. From here, the water is expelled through an atrial siphon at the posterior end. The pharynx is both a respiratory organ and a digestive one, filtering food from the water with the aid of a net of mucus slowly pulled across the slits by cilia. Doliolids and salps alternate between asexual and sexual life stages. Salp colonies can be several meters in length. Doliolids and salps rely on muscular action to propel themselves through surrounding sea water. Thaliaceans have complex lifecycles. Doliolid eggs hatch into swimming tadpole larvae, which are the common larval stage for other urochordates. Pyrosomes are ovoviviparous, the eggs develop inside the \\"mother\\" without the tadpole stage. Salps are viviparous, the embryos are linked to the \\"mother\\" by a placenta. This then develops into an oozoid, which reproduces asexually by budding to produce a number of blastozoids, which form long chains (see image). The individual blastozoids then reproduce sexually to produce the eggs and the next generation of oozoids. The dorsal, hollow nerve cord and notochord found in Chordata has been lost, except for a rudimentary one in some doliolid larvae.Tunicates - Science Direct === The jell pump and the carbon cycle === Thaliaceans play an important role in the ecology of the sea. Their dense faecal pellets sink to the bottom of the oceans and this may be a major part of the worldwide carbon cycle.Thaliaceans and the carbon cycle ==Taxonomy== The class is a relatively small one, and is divided into three orders: Class Thaliacea World Register of Marine Species.

It has a population of around 2.2 million, almost three-quarters of the whole of Wales, including 400,000 in Cardiff, 250,000 in Swansea and 150,000 in Newport. Generally considered to include the historic counties of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, South Wales extends westwards to include Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire. In the western extent, from Swansea westwards, local people would probably recognise that they lived in both south Wales and west Wales.. The Brecon Beacons National Park covers about a third of South Wales, containing Pen y Fan, the highest British mountain south of Cadair Idris in Snowdonia. Pen y Fan 2,907 ft (886 metres) ==History== Between the Statute of Rhuddlan of 1284 and the Laws in Wales Act 1535, crown land in Wales formed the Principality of Wales. This was divided into a Principality of South Wales and a Principality of North Wales. The southern principality was made up of the counties of Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire, areas that had previously been part of the Welsh kingdom of Deheubarth ('the southern land'). The legal responsibility for this area lay in the hands of the Justiciar of South Wales based at Carmarthen. Other parts of southern Wales were in the hands of various Marcher Lords. The Laws in Wales Acts 1542 created the Court of Great Sessions in Wales based on four legal circuits. The Brecon circuit served the counties of Brecknockshire, Radnorshire and Glamorgan while the Carmarthen circuit served Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire. Monmouthshire was attached to the Oxford circuit for judicial purposes. These seven southern counties were thus differentiated from the six counties of north Wales. The Court of the Great Sessions came to an end in 1830, but the counties survived until the Local Government Act 1972 which came into operation in 1974. The creation of the county of Powys merged one northern county (Montgomeryshire) with two southern ones (Breconshire and Radnorshire). There are thus different concepts of south Wales. Glamorgan and Monmouthshire are generally accepted by all as being in south Wales. But the status of Breconshire or Carmarthenshire, for instance, is more debatable. In the western extent, from Swansea westwards, local people might feel that they live in both south Wales and west Wales. Areas to the north of the Brecon Beacons and Black Mountains are generally considered to be in Mid Wales. A further point of uncertainty is whether the first element of the name should be capitalized: 'south Wales' or 'South Wales'. As the name is a geographical expression rather than a specific area with well-defined borders, style guides such as those of the BBCBBC Academy, 'Grammar, spelling and punctuation'. Retrieved 27 December 2015. and The GuardianThe Guardian, ' Guardian and Observer style guide: C '. Retrieved 27 December 2015. use the form 'south Wales'. The South Wales Valleys and upland mountain ridges were once a very rural area noted for its river valleys and ancient forests and lauded by romantic poets such as William Wordsworth as well as poets in the Welsh language, although the interests of the latter lay more in society and culture than in the evocation of natural scenery. This natural environment changed to a considerable extent during the early Industrial Revolution when the Glamorgan and Monmouthshire valley areas were exploited for coal and iron. By the 1830s, hundreds of tons of coal were being transported by barge to ports in Cardiff and Newport. In the 1870s, coal was transported by rail transport networks to Newport Docks, at the time the largest coal exporting docks in the world, and by the 1880s coal was being exported from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan. upright=0.7 The Marquess of Bute, who owned much of the land north of Cardiff, built a steam railway system on his land that stretched from Cardiff into many of the South Wales Valleys where the coal was being found. Lord Bute then charged fees per ton of coal that was transported out using his railways. With coal mining and iron smelting being the main trades of south Wales, many thousands of immigrants from the Midlands, Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall and even Italy came and set up homes and put down roots in the region. Very many came from other coal mining areas such as Somerset, the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire and the tin mines of Cornwall such as Geevor Tin Mine, as a large but experienced and willing workforce was required. Whilst some of the migrants left, many settled and established in the South Wales Valleys between Swansea and Abergavenny as English-speaking communities with a unique identity. Industrial workers were housed in cottages and terraced houses close to the mines and foundries in which they worked. The large influx over the years caused overcrowding which led to outbreaks of Cholera, and on the social and cultural side, the near- loss of the Welsh language in the area. The 1930s inter-war Great Depression in the United Kingdom saw the loss of almost half of the coal pits in the South Wales Coalfield, and their number declined further in the years following World War II. This number is now very low, following the UK miners' strike (1984‚Äì85), and the last 'traditional' deep-shaft mine, Tower Colliery, closed in January 2008. Despite the intense industrialisation of the coal mining valleys, many parts of the landscape of South Wales such as the upper Neath valley, the Vale of Glamorgan and the valleys of the River Usk and River Wye remain distinctly beautiful and unspoilt and have been designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest. In addition, many once heavily industrialised sites have reverted to wilderness, some provided with a series of cycle tracks and other outdoor amenities. Large areas of forestry and open moorland also contribute to the amenity of the landscape. Cwm Llwch from Corn Du, in the Brecon Beacons ==Industrialised areas in the 19th and 20th centuries== Merthyr Tydfil () grew around the Dowlais Ironworks which was founded to exploit the locally abundant seams of iron ore, and in time it became the largest iron-producing town in the world. New coal mines were sunk nearby to feed the furnaces and in time produced coal for export. By the 1831 census, the population of Merthyr was 60,000‚Äîmore at that time than Cardiff, Swansea and Newport combined‚Äîand its industries included coal mines, iron works, cable factory, engine sheds and sidings and many others. The town was also the birthplace of Joseph Parry, composer of the song Myfanwy. The Heads of the Valleys towns, including Rhymney, Tredegar and Ebbw Vale, rose out of the industrial revolution, producing coal, metal ores and later steel. Aberfan: The Merthyr Vale colliery began to produce coal in 1875. Spoil from the mine workings was piled on the hills close to the village which grew nearby. Tipping went on until the 1960s. Although nationalised, the National Coal Board failed to appreciate the danger they had created. In October 1966, heavy rain made the giant coal tip unstable, resulting in the Aberfan disaster. The recent dumping of small particles of coal and ash known as 'tailings' seems to have been partly responsible. A black wave tore downhill across the Glamorganshire Canal and swept away houses on its path towards the village school. 114 children and 28 adults were killed. The Rhondda Valleys (Rhondda Fach and Rhondda Fawr) housed around 3,000 people in 1860, but by 1910 the population had soared to 160,000. The Rhondda had become the heart of a massive South Wales coal industry. Mining accidents below ground were common, and in 1896 fifty-seven men and boys were killed in a gas explosion at the Tylorstown Colliery. An enquiry found that the pit involved had not been properly inspected over the previous 15 months. Ebbw Vale, the valley of the Ebbw River which stretches from the town of Ebbw Vale to Newport, includes the mining towns and villages of Newbridge, Risca, Crumlin, Abercarn and Cwmcarn. The Carboniferous Black Vein coal seams in the area lay some 900 feet (275 metres) below the surface and the mining activity associated with it was responsible for many tragic subsurface explosions, roof collapses and mining accidents. Now the Valleys' heavy industrial past is overprinted with urban regeneration, tourism and multi-national investment. Large factory units, either empty or turned over to retail use, bear witness to the lack of success in replacing older industries. ==Language== The native language of the majority of people in South Wales is English, but there are many who also speak Welsh. In western parts of Glamorgan, particularly the Neath and Swansea Valleys, there remain significant Welsh-speaking communities such as Ystradgynlais and Ystalyfera, which share a heritage with other ex-anthracite mining areas in eastern Carmarthenshire, as much as with the Glamorgan valleys. The local slang, dialect and phrases of the South Wales Valleys communities have been referred to as 'Wenglish', and are often used with comic effect. The dialect is found in such coastal towns as Barry, as featured in the BBC comedy series, Gavin & Stacey. Welsh is now a compulsory language up to GCSE level for all students who start their education in Wales. Several secondary schools offering Welsh medium education operate in this area, for example Ysgol Gyfun Llanhari in Pontyclun, Ysgol Gyfun Y Cymmer in Porth in the Rhondda, Ysgol Gyfun Rhydywaun in Penywaun in the Cynon Valley, Ysgol Gyfun Gwynllyw in Pontypool, Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhymni in Blackwood, Ysgol Gymraeg Plasmawr in Cardiff and Ysgol Gyfun Garth Olwg in Church Village. A significant number of people from ethnic minority communities speak another language as their first language, particularly in Cardiff and Newport. Commonly spoken languages in some areas include Punjabi, Bengali, Arabic, Somali and Chinese, and increasingly Central European languages such as Polish. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a vigorous literary and musical culture centred round eisteddfodau... Despite a few timid attempts to emulate this literature in English, it can be argued that few writers seem to connect with either the landscape or the literary tradition.. The one exception, to some extent, can be considered to be Dylan Thomas.. ==Religion== The south Wales landscape is marked by numerous chapels, places of worship (past and present) of the various Christian Nonconformist congregations. The Baptist congregation at Ilston, Gower, moved to Swansea, Massachusetts, but after the restoration of the Anglican worship with the issue of the Book of Common Prayer in 1662, several \\"gathered\\" churches survived belonging to the Baptist, Independent and Presbyterian denominations. In the 18th century members of some of these congregations became dissatisfied with the theological innovations of some trained ministers, and created new congregations such as that at Hengoed near Ystrad Mynach.. In the same century, churches were sometimes involved in the Methodist movement, especially at Groeswen and Watford near Caerphilly, which both received frequent visits from John Wesley. The largest denomination, however, became the Calvinist Methodists (later the Presbyterian Church of Wales), whose distinctive grey stone chapels can be seen in many parts. These were mainly Welsh-language congregations. Anglicanism in south Wales became autonomous from the Church of England with the Welsh Church Act 1914, but the immediate demise of the denomination feared at that time has not taken place in the Church in Wales... There are a number of Brethren Assemblies in Cardiff and in the Swansea area and Free Presbyterian Churches in Rhiwderin, near Newport and at Merthyr Tydfil. The Roman Catholic community, despite systematic persecution, survived in the 17th to 19th centuries, especially in Brecon and among minor gentry such as the Vaughans of Welsh Bicknor, on the Monmouthshire‚ÄìHerefordshire border... Among members of foreign origin of later urban Catholic congregations were the Bracchi, Italians in the caf√© and catering trades often from Bardi in the Apennines. Post-war diversity has brought mosques, especially in Cardiff and Newport, Sikh gurdwaras, including one on the mountain near Abercynon and a growing number of Evangelical and Pentecostal congregations. These often add a strongly international element into local life, such as the \\"Pont\\" twinning project between Pontypridd and Mbale, Uganda, and the creation of \\"Fairtrade\\" relationships with primary producers worldwide. ==Industry today== The former heavy industries of coal and iron production have disappeared since the economic struggles of the 1970s, with the closures of that decade continuing sharply into the 1980s, and by July 1985 just 31 coal pits remained in the region.. Further closures left the region with just one deep mine by the early 1990s,. and this finally closed in January 2008, by which time it had transferred to private ownership after being sold off by the National Coal Board.. These industries have since largely been replaced by service sector industries. The cities along the M4 corridor are home to a number of high-profile blue-chip companies such as Admiral Insurance, Legal & General and the Welsh-based Principality Building Society. A large number of telephone call centres are located in the region and in particular in the Valleys area. Merthyr Tydfil is home to the principal UK call centre for German mobile telephone company, T-Mobile. Many jobs are also provided in small-scale and family businesses.Business analysis with the former INDIS, Mid Glamorgan industrial information unit It is clear from anecdotal personal contacts, apart from official figures, that the new industries have so far failed to cope with the task of providing stable employment for the large number of employable people resident in the area. The television and film sectors are fast becoming a major industry in South Wales, with the development, by the BBC, of a vast dedicated production studio in Nantgarw, near Pontypridd, for the highly successful Doctor Who series. Lord Attenborough is shortly due to open the first completely new film studio in the UK in over fifty years. Dragon International Film Studios, a huge purpose- built studio complex located alongside the M4 motorway between Bridgend and Llantrisant, contains a number of large soundstages which have already attracted the interest of a number of Hollywood directors and producers alike, looking for suitable facilities in Europe. ==Railways== Great Western Railway operate services from Cardiff Central, Newport and Swansea to London Paddington with Class 800s.

Rainfall afterwards resulted in flooding of Poop√≥ with muddy waters from the Desaguadero River. The lower photo shows the extent of flooding of the western salt flats, sufficient to create an ephemeral island ‚Äì as shown by the rectangle. Lake Poop√≥ ( ) was a large saline lake located in a shallow depression in the Altiplano Mountains in Oruro Department, Bolivia, at an altitude of approximately . Because the lake was long and wide (), it made up the eastern half of the department, known as a mining region in southwest Bolivia. The permanent part of the lake body covered approximately and it was the second-largest lake in the country. The lake received most of its water from the Desaguadero River, which flows from Lake Titicaca at the north end of the Altiplano. Since the lake lacked any major outlet and had a mean depth of less than , the surface area differed greatly on a seasonal basis. In 2002 the lake was designated as a site for conservation under the Ramsar Convention.11 July 2002 By December 2015, the lake had completely dried up, leaving only a few marshy areas. Although the lake has dried up completely a couple of times in the past, it does not appear that it will recover this time. Suggested causes of the decline are the melting of the Andes glaciers and loss of their waters, because of a drought due to climate change, as well as continued diversion of water for mining and agriculture. ==Archaeological evidence== Archaeological investigations conducted by the San Andr√©s University of La Paz, Bolivia, shows the influence of the Wankarani culture in the Poop√≥ area. Complex central urban areas, such as villages and towns, were developed that expanded into the Poop√≥ basin during the Late Formative period, (200 BC ‚Äì 200 AD), probably in conjunction with changing patterns of agriculture. Herders and the life style of llama caravan merchants coexisted with more sedentary farmers in a harmonious system of exchange of goods and services. Other investigators examining the following period, the Early Regional Developments ( 300 ‚Äì 900 AD), have concluded that the size of the inhabited areas increased. The South Poop√≥ inhabitants developed a unique style of ceramics style with triangular spirals. The east portion of the lake has evidence of an important Tiwanaku enclave, with ceramic styles from the core Titicaca area and surrounding styles, demonstrating the interactions between different peoples in the area. == Lake dynamics == The main inlet of Lake Poop√≥ (roughly 92% of the water) comes from the Desaguadero River, which enters the lake at the north end. It flows south from Lake Titicaca. There are numerous smaller inlets along the eastern shore of the lake, many of which are dry most of the year. At times of very high water levels, Poop√≥ is connected to the salt desert Salar de Coipasa in the west. A minor outlet leads to Salar de Uyuni in the far south of the Altiplano, but as the lake lacks any major outlet, it is classified as an endorheic basin. Historic Levels of Lake Poop√≥ When the water level of Lake Titicaca is below , the flow of Desaguadero River is so low it can no longer compensate for the massive water losses due to evaporation from the surface of Lake Poop√≥. At this point, the lake volume begins to decrease. At its maximum in 1986, the lake had an area of . During the years that followed, the surface area steadily decreased until 1994, when the lake disappeared completely. The time period between 1975 and 1992 is the longest period in recent times when the lake had a continuous water body. Renewed rainfalls in the mid 1990s revitalized the lake again. Action has been taken in order to make the area ecologically sustainable again, with the help of funding from the European Union. But the efforts have not been unable to offset other changes: since 1995 regional temperatures have risen and consequently tripled the evaporation rates. In addition, water was drawn off for mining and irrigation, compounding the problems. On 20 January 2016 the area was declared a disaster zone by the Bolivian government. === Salinity and geology === Fishing in Lake Poop√≥ is low scale and is carried out using rowing boats and small nets. The image shows boats owned by fishermen from Llapallapani. The water of Lake Poop√≥ is highly saline. The salinity is a result of the endorheic nature of the hydrological system on the Altiplano, which allows all weathered ions to remain in the system. The salinity of Lake Poop√≥ is further increased by the arid climate and the high evaporation from the lake surface. In the northern end of Lake Poop√≥, dilution of the salinity occurs due to freshwater flow from the Desaguadero River. The salt gradient of the water increases towards the south. The salinity varies with water volume. During October and November 2006, the salinity in the north end of the lake varied between brackish and saline (15‚Äì30,000 mg/l). In the south end of the lake the water was classified as a brine (105,000‚Äì125,000 mg/l). The water type is a 4‚Äì2 Na-(Mg)-Cl-(SO4). Geological sources of sodium chloride (NaCl), such as halite and feldspars, are present in the drainage area. These could also contribute to the salinity of Lake Poop√≥. The lake body is situated on top of Cenozoic deposits, consisting mainly of unconsolidated material. These sediments are the remains of extensive prehistoric lakes, which covered the Altiplano during at least five glaciation periods. === Mining and heavy metals === There is a long tradition of mining in the Poop√≥ Basin. Extraction of metals was ordered in the 13th century to support the Inca army. After Spanish colonization in the 16th century, the mining operations increased in scale. At this point the region became known as one of the mining centres of Bolivia. In the late 19th century, mining was taken over by the Col√≥n Poop√≥ Extraction Company. Salt crystals in footprints on the shore of Lake Poop√≥ The mining districts are situated at the foothills of the Cordillera Oriental along the eastern border of the Poop√≥ basin. The most important minerals to the economy are silver and tin. Studies have shown elevated concentrations of heavy metals in surface and ground waters of the Poop√≥ basin. These metals are naturally present in the bedrock, from which they are released through weathering processes. The mining activities in the area further contributes to the heavy metal pollution. Acid leaching from mines and mechanical processing of ore speed up the process. The major part of the heavy metals transported to Lake Poop√≥ seem to be immobilized in the bottom sediments. But concentrations of arsenic, lead, and cadmium in the lake water exceed Bolivian and World Health Organization guideline values for drinking water. == Flora and fauna == There are only three fish species in the system: the native pupfish Orestias agassizii and catfish Trichomycterus rivulatus, and the introduced silverside Odontesthes bonariensis. The lake had a relatively large fish population, but by 2017 pollution and the near-complete reduction of water had all but decimated the locally important fishing industry. The aquatic bird life was very diverse, with a total of 34 species. Most famous are the three species of flamingo (Andean, James's and Chilean), which mainly lived in the shallow lagoons in the northern and eastern parts of the lake. An inventory of the bird population, made in 2000 in cooperation with BirdLife International, identified 6 threatened species and others that are near-threatened. Among these are the Andean flamingo and the Andean condor. A total of 17 higher plants and 3 species of alga were identified in and around Lake Poop√≥. Due to the constant drought and flooding, the littoral zone experiences great disturbances. As a result, there was hardly any vegetation to be found on the shores of the lake. ==Effects of the loss of the lake== The sparse communities nearby have suffered financially due to the local economy being dependent on lake fishing. Moreover, many bird species native to Bolivia and internationally have been affected due to loss of food, and an annual migration area. == See also == * Desertification * Ouki == References == * Drever, James I: The Geochemistry of Natural Waters, 3rd edition, Prentice Hall, 1997. * Montes de Oca; Geografia y Recursos Naturales de Bolivia, 3rd Edition, EDOBOL, La Paz, 1997. * Rocha, O.O.

Born to poor parents, he attended newly founded Deerfield Academy, where he was later principal, from 1815 to 1818. In 1821 he was ordained as a Congregationalist pastor and served as pastor of the Congregational Church in Conway, Massachusetts, 1821-25. He left the ministry to become Professor of Chemistry and Natural History at Amherst College. He held that post from 1825 to 1845, serving as Professor of Natural Theology and Geology from 1845 until his death in 1864. In 1845, Hitchcock became President of the College, a post he held until 1854. As president, Hitchcock was responsible for Amherst's recovery from severe financial difficulties. He is also credited with developing the college's scientific resources and establishing its reputation for scientific teaching. In addition to his positions at Amherst, Hitchcock was a well-known early geologist. He ran the first geological survey of Massachusetts, and in 1830 was appointed state geologist of Massachusetts (he held the post until 1844). He also played a role in the geological surveys of New York and Vermont. His chief project, however, was natural theology, which attempted to unify and reconcile science and religion, focusing on geology. His major work in this area was The Religion of Geology and Its Connected Sciences (1851). In this book, he sought out ways to re-interpret the Bible to agree with the latest geological theories. For example, knowing that the earth was at least hundreds of thousands of years old, vastly older than the 6,000 years posited by Biblical scholars, Hitchcock devised a way to read the original Hebrew so that a single letter in Genesis‚Äîa \\"v\\", meaning \\"afterwards\\"‚Äîimplied the vast timespans during which the earth was formed. Randy Moore described Hitchcock as \\"America's leading advocate of catastrophism-based gap creationism.\\"Moore, Randy; Decker, Mark; Cotner, Sehoya. (2010). Chronology of the Evolution- creationism Controversy. Greenwood Press. p. 99. Hitchcock left his mark in paleontology. He discovered some of the first fossil fishes in the United States. He published papers on fossilized tracks in the Connecticut Valley, including Eubrontes and Otozoum, that were later associated with dinosaurs, though he believed, with a certain prescience, that they were made by gigantic ancient birds. In the Hitchcock Ichnological Cabinet he established a remarkable collection of fossil footmarks. His son, Edward \\"Doc\\" Hitchcock, named one of the earliest dinosaurs discovered in North America and the United States, Megadactylus polyzelus. Later it was reclassified as the type specimen of Anchisaurus polyzelus (ACM 41109), a prosauropod. This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation E.Hitchc. when citing a botanical name. As he had researched the geologic lake which once filled the Connecticut River basin, this prehistoric lake was named after him. Since he had done geological research on the Holyoke Range, one of the mountains there, Mount Hitchcock, was named after him.Brief History of Geology at Amherst: The Latest Holocene, Amherst College He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1834. From 1856 to 1861, Hitchcock was the State Geologist for Vermont. His collections, a bust and portrait can be viewed at the Amherst College Museum of Natural History. The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst holds his papers.Edward and Orra White Hitchcock Papers, Amherst College Archives and Special Collections In 1821, he married Orra White, one of the earliest women botanical and scientific illustrators in the U.S. The two worked closely together, and she contributed more than 1,000 illustrations to his many scientific publications. ==Paleontological chart== Fold-out paleontological chart of Edward Hitchcock in Elementary Geology (1840) He inserted a paleontological chart in his Elementary Geology (1840). It shows a branching diagram of the plant and animal kingdom against a geological background. He referred to it as a tree. This \\"tree of life\\" is the earliest known version that incorporates paleontological and geological information.Archibald, J. David. (2009). \\"Edward Hitchcock's Pre-Darwinian (1840) 'Tree of Life'\\". Journal of the History of Biology 42: 561-592. Hitchcock was an advocate of gap creationism.McIver, Thomas Allen. (1989). Creationism: Intellectual Origins, Cultural Context, and Theoretical Diversity. University of California, Los Angeles. Hitchcock saw God as the agent of change. He explicitly rejected evolution and a religious six-day creation. He perceived that new species were introduced by a Deity at the right time in the history of the earth. The chart is present in all editions between 1840 and 1859. After Charles Darwin (1859) published his On the Origin of Species, a tree of life image was generally interpreted as an evolutionary tree. In the 1860 edition of Elementary Geology Hitchcock dropped the chart. In 1863 Hitchcock wrote an article in which he criticized Darwin‚Äôs theory of natural selection. After his death in 1864, his son Charles Henry Hitchcock (1836‚Äì1919) published a new edition (1870) also without a paleontological chart. Charles then published books and articles of his own. ==Writings== * Geology of the Connecticut Valley (1823) * \\"Retrospection: A Sermon Delivered at Amherst, MA, at Close of Spring Term\\".

This strategy was a matter of some controversy within republicanism; some Sinn F√©in and IRA members and supporters who disagreed with the strategy left to form Republican Sinn F√©in and the Continuity IRA in 1986. Armalite refers to the AR-15 and AR-18 ArmaLite rifles. Both were originally manufactured by the Armalite corporation, later Colt. The IRA smuggled significant quantities of these rifles into Northern Ireland during the early 1970s and the \\"Armalite\\" became a symbol of republican armed struggle. Through the AR-18's mass use by the IRA and volunteers' love of the weapon for its accuracy and compact nature, the rifle became known as the \\"Widowmaker\\". The AR-18 ==History== The strategy emerged after the 1981 Irish hunger strike as a response to the electoral success of Bobby Sands in the April 1981 Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election and pro-hunger strike campaigners in the Northern Ireland local elections and Republic of Ireland D√°il √âireann elections of the same year. It was first formulated by Sinn F√©in organiser Danny Morrison at the party's Ard Fheis (Annual Conference) in 1981, when he said: The strategy was a mixed success. Sinn F√©in had a solid core of 9-13 percent of the vote in Northern Ireland, which gave the party some credibility on the international stage. However at home it highlighted the dominance at the time of the non-violent Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) in Northern nationalist politics, while Sinn F√©in's vote in the Republic remained tiny once the emotion generated by the 1981 hunger strike subsided. In the longer term it had two important political consequences, each of which fed in to the emergent Northern Ireland peace process.A Secret History of the IRA, 2nd Edition, Page 33, Ed Moloney, Penguin Books, 2002, 2007. When the governments of the UK and Ireland drafted the Anglo-Irish Agreement, this convinced many in Sinn F√©in that it was possible to make political gains without violence. However, the electoral setbacks suffered by Sinn F√©in, such as the loss of 16 of the party's 59 council seats in 1989 pushed the emphasis of the Republican movement away from the Armalite and towards an election-focused strategy. For some time after the IRA ceasefires of 1994 and 1997, opinion in Northern Ireland remained divided on whether the armalite and ballot box strategy had ended. However, with the cessation of large-scale political violence, the complete decommissioning of weaponry by the IRA and a statement from the Army Council that 'the war is over', the majority of unionists have overcome their scepticism and now believe that the strategy has been abandoned. The strategy has also been attributed as having inspired members of the Loyalist Ulster Defence Association such as John McMichael to seek a similar route into electoral politics through vehicles such as the Ulster Loyalist Democratic Party (later Ulster Democratic Party (UDP)). However, parties directly linked to Loyalist paramilitaries had minimal success in elections in Northern Ireland, with the UDP's and Progressive Unionist Party's (PUP) combined electoral share failing to exceed 1% before the May 1996 elections for the Northern Ireland Forum. ==Notes and references== Category:The Troubles (Northern Ireland) Category:Irish republicanism ","title":"Armalite and ballot box strategy"},{"id":"832941","text":"Brookfield Asset Management Inc. is an alternative asset management company focusing on real estate, renewable power, infrastructure and private equity. The company's headquarters are located in Toronto, and it also has corporate offices in New York City, London, Rio de Janeiro and Sydney. ==History== The company was founded in 1899, as the S√£o Paulo Tramway, Light and Power Company by William Mackenzie and Frederick Stark Pearson. Operating as in construction and management of electricity and transport infrastructure in Brazil. In 1904, the Rio de Janeiro Tramway, Light and Power Company was founded by Mackenzie's group. In 1912, Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company was incorporated in Toronto as a public company to develop hydro-electric power operations and other utility services in Brazil, becoming a holding company for S√£o Paulo Tramway Co. and Rio de Janeiro Tramway Co. In 1916, Great Lakes Power Company was incorporated to provide hydro-electric power in Sault Ste. Marie and the Algoma District in Ontario. In 1966, Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company changed its name to Brazilian Light and Power Company, and again in 1969, changed its name to Brascan Limited. Brascan is a portmanteau of \\"Brasil\\" and \\"Canada\\". In 1979, the company's Brazilian assets were transferred to Brazilian ownership (Eletropaulo and Light S.A.), the company meanwhile having diversified to other areas. The company provided electricity and tram services in S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and the Brazilian side after a later restructuring still operates as Light S.A., short for Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Co. Ltd. In 2005, after 37 years, Brascan Corp. was renamed to Brookfield Asset Management Inc. In November 2008, in a process supervised by the Alberta courts, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed receiver of a separate public company, Birch Mountain Resources, after Birch Mountain had defaulted on its debts. Birch Mountain's assets of $50 million were transferred to Tricap Partners Ltd, which operates under the Hammerstone Corporation, a subsidiary of Brookfield Special Situations Group.\\"Birch Mountain names receiver\\" ,Calgary Herald, Canada, 7 November 2008 Retrieved 22 July 2012 In September 2010, a group called Birch Mountain Shareholders for Justice filed a lawsuit with the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada, against Brookfield Asset Management challenging this acquisition and transfer of assets.Gray, Jeff. \\"Squeezed-out Birch Mountain shareholders take on Brookfield\\",The Globe and Mail, Canada, 15 November 2011 Retrieved 22 July 2012 After five years of litigation the case was dismissed.McDonald v Brookfield Asset Management Inc , 2015 ABQB 281 In May 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal which was also dismissed. In 2009, Brookfield sued financial and insurance giant American International Group (AIG) in a Manhattan federal court, alleging that AIG's collapse caused default provisions in interest-rate swaps. The suit stemmed from AIG's acceptance of a $182.3-billion bailout package from the federal government. The lawsuit backfired and the litigation ended with Brookfield agreeing to pay $905 million to settle the lawsuit. In 2013, a Brazilian prosecutor filed charges against the company's local division, alleging the company paid bribes to local officials, which is also a violation of U.S. federal criminal law. The bribes were allegedly used to pave the way for Brookfield to build a shopping center in S√£o Paulo. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also opened a formal investigation into the company about the bribery charges. The company denied the charges. The U.S. Department of Justice also opened a criminal investigation into the company regarding these allegations, and did not end up making any arrests. According to the Stanford Law School Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Clearinghouse, which studied the case, the investigation and filing of charges was initiated by a whistleblower and anonymous tip. The company disclosed the investigations on several 6-K forms between 2013 and 2015. By 2018, Brookfield's major public subsidiaries included Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, Brookfield Renewable Partners, Brookfield Property Partners, and Brookfield Business Partners In August 2018, Brookfield signed a 99-year lease on Jared Kushner's financially troubled 666 Fifth Avenue skyscraper. The deal raised suspicions that the Qatar Investment Authority, a major investor in Brookfield, was attempting to influence the Trump administration. In August 2018, Brookfield purchased Westinghouse Electric Company, a manufacturer of large nuclear reactors, out of bankruptcy for $4.6 billion. On March 13, 2019, Brookfield Asset Management announced that it had agreed to buy most of Oaktree Capital Management for about $4.7 billion, creating one of the world's largest alternative money managers.

Ross is considered by many to be the most intelligent member of the group and is noted for his goofy but lovable demeanor. His relationship with Rachel Green was included in TV Guides list of the best TV couples of all time, as well as Entertainment Weeklys \\"30 Best 'Will They/Won't They?' TV Couples\\". Kevin Bright, one of the executive producers of the show, had worked with Schwimmer before, so the writers were already developing Ross's character in Schwimmer's voice; hence, Schwimmer was the first person to be cast on the show. ==Appearances== Ross is a paleontologist and has a Ph.D. from Columbia University. His romantic feelings toward Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), which began as a high-school infatuation, are an ongoing theme of his narrative arc. Likewise, their on- again, off-again romantic relationship is a nearly constant theme of Friends. Born in 1967 and raised on Long Island, Ross is the elder brother of Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), and son of Jack (Elliott Gould) and Judy Geller (Christina Pickles). Ross and Monica are Jewish and see themselves as at least cultural Jews, with Ross taking a more active role in wanting to teach his son, Ben, about the faith. Ross gets divorced and is newly single in the very first episode because his wife, Carol (Jane Sibbett), has realized she's a lesbian. Later in the series, he dates Rachel, but they split up when he sleeps with another woman the night they decide their relationship is \\"on a break\\". After his relationship with Rachel ends, Ross marries Emily Waltham (Helen Baxendale), the niece of Rachel's boss. However, because Ross says \\"I take thee Rachel\\" instead of Emily during the nuptials, the marriage doesn't last long. In season 5, Ross and Rachel drunkenly marry in Las Vegas, and ultimately that marriage results in a divorce as well; however, they confess that if they ever got married properly it would be the one that lasted. Throughout the series, Ross gets divorced three times. In the first episode of Joey, the spinoff series, it is hinted that Ross and Rachel may have gotten married again, as Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) tells his sister Gina (Portia de Rossi) that all of his friends are married. A running theme in Ross' narrative is his competition with Monica, manifested through wrestling and paranoia. As children, they took part in a family football game for the \\"Geller Cup\\" every Thanksgiving. This tradition ended in its sixth year, after Monica \\"accidentally\\" broke Ross's nose. The siblings came up with a dance in primary school called \\"The Routine\\", which they performed as adults at Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve in a New Year's Eve TV broadcast. When they were children, Monica felt that their parents favored Ross, but as time passed and they grew up, she actually liked Ross as a person and loved him more than out of a sense of family obligation. As adults they became close, though the competition between them was still visible as seen in the season three episode, \\"The One with the Football\\". Ross often comes into conflict with Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow). His rationality and Phoebe's eccentricity lead to conflict over evolution, gravity, and whether Phoebe's mother was reincarnated as a cat. It is also revealed that Phoebe once mugged Ross (stealing a copy of the comic book Science Boy that Ross had created) when they were teenagers. The two are roommates for a few weeks when a fire forces Phoebe to move out of her apartment. She first moves into Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) and Monica's apartment, but then decides she wants to give the newly engaged couple some privacy, so she moves in with Ross. In a \\"flashback\\" episode, they are alone at a bar and start kissing, but the moment quickly passes when Ross keeps bumping his head. Phoebe also helps Ross on numerous occasions, ultimately making him realize that he loves Rachel and they both are meant to be together. Since college, Ross' best friend has been Chandler Bing. In college, they were in a band called Way/No Way, and Ross blamed Chandler when he was caught smoking marijuana. They become brothers-in-law after Chandler marries Monica. Though they are best friends, at times Chandler gets annoyed with Ross's geeky behavior. Ross is friends with Rachel Green, whom he has had a crush on since high school. Rachel viewed Ross as ‚ÄòMonica‚Äôs geeky older brother‚Äô during high school. During the first episode of the series, when they meet after years apart, he rediscovers his feelings for her. They become close and have an on-and-off romantic relationship through the series. In the final season of the show, Rachel tells him that he means more to her than any other member of their group. He is also close friends with Joey Tribbiani and helps him with auditions. He kisses Joey once in order to help him practice a role as a gay man, only to find out that Joey had already done the audition and didn't get the part. Joey and Ross also briefly try to cut Chandler out of their friend group after Chandler ignores them. They once fall asleep together on the couch after watching Die Hard. Toward the end of the series, however, Ross and Joey become closer friends, often hanging out together after Chandler gets married. Ross often tries to bring out the best of his friends in difficult situations. For instance, in season 2, he encourages Joey to audition for Another World after being fired from Days of Our Lives despite Joey's refusal to audition for a two-line part of a secondary character. In season 7, he buys Phoebe the bicycle of her dreams but threatens to take it away from her because of her reluctance to learn how to ride it. Also, when he discovers that Joey has a crush on Rachel, he tells him to go for it, even though he finds it difficult to accept the idea of Joey and Rachel being together. Above all, Ross is portrayed as a very sweet, loving and adorable character who is always looking out for everyone's best interests and often the most mature compared to the rest of the gang (despite his ego, outbursts, and paranoia). He has two children. Ross's son, Ben, was conceived while Ross and Carol were still married and born at the end of Season 1. Ross shares joint custody of Ben with his ex-wife Carol and her wife Susan (Jessica Hecht). Ben appeared in a total of 24 episodes (25 including uncut episodes) and was played chronologically as follows: as an infant by Michael Gunderson Season 1 to 2, by brothers Charles Thomas Allen and John Christopher Allen from Season 3 to 5, and by Cole Sprouse from Season 6 to 8. Ross' daughter with Rachel, Emma Geller-Green, was born at the end of Season 8. Rachel's pregnancy was originally revealed in the season finale of Season 7. The conception of Emma was predominantly the result of a one-night stand, which was later revealed in the Season 8 episode, \\"The One With The Videotape\\". Ross claims to have \\"given up a career in basketball\\" to become a paleontologist, and claims that the ideas for Jurassic Park and Die Hard were stolen from him. He also had major interest in music, playing keyboard for hours in the basement of their house in Long Island. Ross had a pet in the earlier seasons of the show: a white-headed capuchin monkey named Marcel. ==Relationships== Over the course of the show, Ross dates a considerable number of women. He married three times and is divorced three times. His proclivity to marry and divorce is a running gag within the series. *Julie: An old graduate school colleague, portrayed by Lauren Tom. She first appears in the final scene of the season 1 finale, returning with Ross from an archeological dig in China. They start dating in season 2 but break up after Ross discovers Rachel's feelings for him and decides he wants to be with her instead. It is heavily implied that she starts a relationship with Russ, an ex-boyfriend of Rachel's with an uncanny resemblance to Ross. *Bonnie: A love interest (played by Christine Taylor) introduced to Ross by Phoebe, Bonnie is formerly a militant bald woman who no longer shaves her head. She enjoyed a sex-filled relationship with Ross, until a conniving Rachel broke them up by first encouraging Bonnie up to shave her head again, which she knows will bother Ross, and later by revealing she was interested in reuniting with Ross. *Mona: A love interest he met at Monica and Chandler's wedding (portrayed by Bonnie Somerville). Ross becomes paranoid after Mona proposes to send out Christmas cards together, and in a panic decides to give her a key to his apartment. It is later revealed that Mona is unable to say \\"I love you\\" yet, and delivers what the female friends refer to as \\"an emotional slap in the face\\" with \\"I love spending time with you\\". The relationship ends when Mona discovers that Rachel is living in Ross's apartment, after Ross neglects to tell her this himself. When he hides in her apartment to retrieve his shirt while she is on a date with another man, Mona, under the belief that Ross wanted to win her back, admits she still has feelings for him but states that they both need to move on. *Chloe: Ross's only relationship with Chloe (referred to in a few prior episodes as \\"The cute girl from the copy place with the belly button ring\\") was a one-night stand during a break with his relationship with Rachel, which interferes with their attempt to get back together. Although only covered over two episodes in season 3, Ross' fling with Chloe would be the basis of the \\"We were on a break!\\" running joke that would last until the very end of the series. *Janice: Ross has a brief fling with Janice, Chandler's ex- girlfriend, in season 5. Phoebe said they would have very hairy children. Janice ironically dumps Ross because he whines too much. Ross, worried about how he would react, tells Chandler, who laughs, but chooses to forgive him. *Elizabeth Stevens: A pretty 20-year-old student who Ross teaches during his first year as a professor. The two go through a tremendous amount of effort to keep their relationship a secret from the faculty, as Ross would get fired for dating a student. He even tries to get on good terms with Elizabeth's father Paul (Bruce Willis), who in turn threatens to report him to the university. Ross eventually manages to blackmail Paul into pretending to like him by threatening to reveal Paul's embarrassing mirror dance routine to Rachel (who dates him briefly). Despite Paul no longer being a threat, Ross eventually realizes he sees no future in his relationship with Elizabeth and decides to break up with her due to her immaturity. *Charlie Wheeler: Ross meets Charlie (Aisha Tyler) in \\"The One With The Soap Opera Party\\". She is a paleontologist who has recently joined Ross's department. She initially dates Joey before breaking up with him and gravitating toward Ross, after realizing she has more things in common with Ross. She eventually reconciles with her ex-boyfriend and breaks up with Ross. *Cheryl: A very attractive woman that Ross briefly dates. He decides he wants to pursue a relationship with her, but is stifled by her incredibly filthy apartment. Despite her own living quarters being littered with garbage and infested with all kinds of pests, she can't stand the \\"weird smell\\" of Ross' apartment, which is why she doesn't like being there. After Ross breaks off the relationship after being covered in all kinds of trash in an attempt to make out with Cheryl, Monica later visits her and offers to clean her apartment, revealing she \\"couldn't sleep\\" after Ross told her about it. *Jill Green: Ross very briefly dates Rachel's spoiled younger sister Jill (played by Reese Witherspoon) after her father sends her to New York to take lessons from Rachel in self-sufficiency. Although Jill actually finds Ross a geek, she dates him out of spite because Rachel is uncomfortable with it and tells her \\"she's always wanted what she couldn't have\\". Ross, upon realising he is being used, breaks it off with Jill because he does not want to end any possibility there could be of him and Rachel getting back together. ===Rachel Green=== Rachel is Ross's most significant relationship during the series. His attraction to her is established early on; Ross met Rachel through his sister Monica, who was Rachel's best friend in high school. He developed an unrequited crush on her, but never followed through on it. After leaving college, Ross married Carol, whom he had met at college, and had seemingly put his feelings for Rachel aside before he met her again in The Pilot. They have an on-again, off-again dynamic throughout most of the show. In the Season 1 finale, Ross has to go to China for his work so he asks Chandler to give Rachel a present on her birthday which he had bought for her. Chandler does give the present to Rachel during her birthday celebration while Ross is in China but also accidentally reveals Ross's feelings for Rachel, prompting Rachel to panic and start thinking about Ross in a romantic way. After Ross arrives back from China, Rachel goes to the airport to receive him on realising that she likes him, but she sees him with Julie and reluctantly backs off. In the season 2 episode \\"The One Where Ross Finds Out\\", Rachel is on a date with a guy when she confesses to Ross over the phone in a drunken state that she had feelings for him but now she is over him. Ross hears this message the next day at Monica's apartment with Rachel begging him not to check his messages. Later, in the same episode they share a passionate kiss at the doors of Central Perk. Later he breaks up with Julie but Rachel decides she does not want to be with him after finding out that he had made a list, on the insistence of Chandler, comparing the good and bad qualities about her and Julie. In the later episode \\"The One with the Prom Video\\" it is revealed that Ross, despite being two years senior to Rachel, had decided to be her date on her and Monica's prom, as Rachel's date had not arrived, only to be left disappointed as her date arrives and they both along with Monica and her date take off for the prom. Touched by this, Rachel kisses Ross on learning this revelation, and the two begin dating. However, they take a break from their relationship on their one-year anniversary together after Rachel's overtime work prevents them from spending time together. That same night, Ross has a one-night stand with Chloe, which causes Rachel to officially end their relationship. They get together again at the end of season 3 but again break up at the start of season 4. Some of the later episodes show them to be still in love with each other such as when Ross cancels his Discovery channel show appearance to be with Rachel when she breaks her rib or when Rachel flies to London to tell Ross before his wedding with Emily, that she is still in love with him, only to realize that it would be better not to tell. However, Ross accidentally says Rachel's name at the altar and the marriage soon dissolves. In the season 5 finale \\"The One in Vegas\\", Ross and Rachel marry each other after getting drunk in Las Vegas. This marriage ends in a divorce after a failed application for an annulment; the two sadly admit that they thought if they ever married each other it would last. In the seventh season premiere \\"The One with Monica's Thunder\\", after the news of Monica and Chandler's engagement, a passionate moment between them leads to Ross and Rachel kissing. Monica is hurt by this as she believed that Rachel was trying to ‚Äústeal her thunder‚Äù. The kiss is later revealed to have happened because Rachel is upset that she is ‚Äúnot even close‚Äù to being engaged. At the end of season 7 at Monica and Chandler's wedding, it is revealed that Rachel is pregnant. The father is revealed to be Ross in the second episode of season 8, and Rachel tells him in the next episode. They decide to have the baby, but the two do not resume their romantic relationship. In the middle of the season, Joey asks Rachel to move in with Ross so Ross can be more involved with her pregnancy. In the season 8 finale, Ross's daughter with Rachel named Emma Geller-Green is born. Rachel soon moves out of Ross's apartment in the middle of season 9 when she realizes their situation is not working. In the final episode of the show, when Rachel is moving to Paris for her job with a new fashion brand, Ross tells her at the airport that he loves her and asks not to leave. Rachel initially does not heed his feelings, but when the plane is about to take off, she realizes that she loves him too and gets off the plane. They profess their love for each other and decide to be together once and for all. In the first episode of the spin-off/sequel Joey, it is hinted that Ross and Rachel were remarried shortly after the events of season 10 as Joey tells his sister Gina that all of his friends have married. In the fifteenth episode, Ross is mentioned, though not by name, in discussion when Joey tells his sister Gina that he confessed his love to Rachel but she was pregnant with Ross's baby and eventually ended up with him, the reason why Joey becomes reluctant to confess the same feelings to his girlfriend, Sarah. ===Carol Willick=== Carol (Anita Barone for pilot episode, Jane Sibbett thereafter) is Ross's first wife and the mother of his son Ben. In the very first episode, Carol has just moved out of their apartment after coming out of the closet as a lesbian and leaving Ross for a woman named Susan Bunch, whom she later marries. In the early days, however, Ross and Carol seemed to have had a very passionate relationship. Carol is the only woman he's ever had sex with (and hence lost his virginity to) at the start of the series. It is also revealed they shared a steamy session at Disneyland behind the \\"Dutch children\\" in It's a Small World, which got them a lifetime ban from the theme park. In the third-season episode, \\"The One with the Flashback\\", it is revealed that Carol met Susan at her gym, and it is implied that they had a short affair before Carol could no longer bring herself to cheat on Ross, who innocently believed they were just friends, and told him the truth. Ross maintains a fairly healthy relationship with Carol after their divorce and both decide to raise Ben together through shared parenting, but he doesn't hide his contempt for Susan as he believes she destroyed their marriage and since she initially wanted to keep him out of Ben's life, having once told him to his face that the baby was not his and would not have the surname \\"Geller\\". He briefly considers getting back together with Carol and they even share a kiss at a sushi restaurant, but Carol makes it clear that she can't reciprocate his feelings and has chosen to be with Susan. In the second season, when Carol and Susan briefly call off their wedding due to Carol's homophobic parents' refusal to bless their relationship, Ross gives Carol away at the wedding and shares a dance with Susan, who develops a newfound respect for him. In the alternate timeline episode \\"The One that Could have Been\\" (season 6), Carol and Susan are portrayed in a far more negative light. Exploring what could have happened if Ross and Carol never got divorced, it is revealed that they have been on a sexual dry spell that has lasted for months. During ideas to improve their sex life, Carol suddenly becomes very excited when Ross proposes that they have a threesome with another woman. Picking Susan, whom she met at her gym just like in the real timeline, the two women immediately proceed to have sex without Ross right in front of him, seemingly indifferent to his feelings. Ross later explains to Joey that he felt like a third wheel, just having sex with Carol while Susan kept kicking him away, and ended up being so bored he made himself a sandwich. Ross realizes his wife is a lesbian when Rachel states outright that Carol \\"sounds gay.\\" ===Emily Waltham=== During the fourth season, Ross meets and falls in love with Emily Waltham (Helen Baxendale), a British woman who is set up with Ross by Rachel. Six weeks into their relationship, Ross spontaneously asks Emily to move in with him. This escalates into a marriage proposal. The two plan a wedding in London, to which Rachel is invited. During the ceremony, Ross, upon seeing Rachel, has a slip of the tongue and says Rachel's name instead of Emily's during his vows. Emily is furious and exits her own wedding. Later, however, she decides to forgive Ross, and reaches the airport in time to leave for their honeymoon, but is upset when she sees Ross and Rachel boarding the plane together after Ross, having given up on meeting Emily at the airport, invites Rachel on their honeymoon as friend. She flees again, and Ross unsuccessfully tries to follow her, and Rachel ends up going on the honeymoon alone. Emily, later, calls Ross only to confront him by saying that he has to stop calling and harassing her relatives, but Ross makes her reveal her love for him. She said that she will return only if Ross stops being friends with Rachel. Unable to do so, Ross ends his marriage with Emily. Shortly before Emily gets remarried to an anonymous man (although it might be assumed it is former lover Colin, whom she previously dumped to be with Ross), she gets cold feet and calls Ross to ask if their divorce was a mistake. While Ross is on a police ride-a-long with Phoebe's cop boyfriend Gary, Rachel hears and accidentally deletes Emily's message on the answering machine. Despite Monica pleading to keep Ross in the dark about it, Rachel tells him that Emily called, as she believes he should be in charge of his own happiness. When he starts to doubt whether or not he should return Emily's call, however, Rachel is quick to convince him not to. From this point onwards, Emily is never seen in the show again. == Reception == Ross Geller has become a well-known figure in pop culture, in particular due to his relationship with Rachel Green, his neurotic nature, and his love for dinosaurs. In 2015, a play titled Ross & Rachel debuted at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. In October 2016, Ross Geller was voted \\"the Best Friends Character\\" in an international poll held by Comedy Central, during six weeks of \\"FriendsFest\\" on the channel. == See also == * List of Friends and Joey characters ==References== ==External links== Category:Friends (1994 TV series) characters Category:Fictional professors Category:Fictional paleontologists Category:Fictional characters from New York City Category:Fictional American Jews Category:Television characters introduced in 1994 Category:American male characters in television ","title":"Ross Geller"},{"id":"832973","text":"Streatham Common, looking west towards Streatham High Road. The tower in the distance is that of Immanuel Church. Streatham Common is a large open space on the southern edge of Streatham in the London Borough of Lambeth. The shallow sloping lower (western) half of the common is mostly mowed grass, and the upper (eastern) half is mostly woodland with some small areas of gorse scrub and acid grassland. The eastern half has been designated a Local Nature Reserve. ==History== Streatham Common Streatham Common is one of two former areas of common land in the former parish of Streatham. The other is now known as Tooting Bec Common. After enclosure, the Common was purchased in 1883 for use as a public open space under the powers conferred under the Metropolitan Commons Act 1878. It was at this time that most of the trees lining the edges of the lower common were planted. The Common was conveyed to the Metropolitan Board of Works and was subsequently administered by the London County Council and Greater London Council before maintenance responsibility passed to the London Borough of Lambeth in 1971. The Common had a long tradition of cricket playing from the 18th century, and the right to play cricket is enshrined in the Supplementary Act that brought the common into public ownership. Thomas Ripley the famous architect built and lived at 10 Streatham Common South, now known as Ripley House. Henry Tate, founder of the Tate Gallery and the Tate & Lyle sugar company lived at Park Hill by the Common. ==The Rookery== The Rookery Adjacent to the historic common, there is a formal garden, The Rookery, formerly the grounds of a large house that housed visitors to one of Streatham's historic mineral wells. The Rookery is well known for its old cedar trees in the main garden. There is also a rock garden - with a cascade and lower water garden dominated by giant Gunnera. A series of walled gardens were created in part of the former kitchen gardens, including an Old English Garden and a White Garden - which predates the more famous garden in the same style at Sissinghurst Castle. The remaining parts of the kitchen gardens, which had been used as a council plant nursery, but had been abandoned for twenty years, are now managed by Streatham Common Community Garden for community food growing, and are open to the public on most Sundays. The Rookery and the adjacent Hilly Four Acres field was purchased by public subscription in 1911 to save the site from residential development, presented to the London County Council, and opened as a public park in 1913. The south east end of Streatham Common and The Rookery abut Norwood Grove within the London Borough of Croydon. The appeal committee that had bought The Rookery was reformed in 1923 to save Norwood Grove from development, and there is now an almost continuous series of green spaces along the ridge line from Streatham to Crystal Palace. The gently sloping lawns of The Rookery are used as an open-air theatre in the summer. ==Management== A Management Advisory Committee (MAC) was set up in 1996. The MAC subsequently developed a Vision Statement for the conservation of Streatham Common and The Rookery, resulting in the designation of the nature reserve and subsequent detailed habitat management plans. A separate Friends of Streatham Common group promotes events on the Common and in The Rookery, including a very successful annual kite festival. The MAC's functions have been carried out by the Friends group since 2011. The Streatham Common Co-operative (SCCoop) was set up by members of the Friends to provide local management of the Common that would provide greater local accountability than the borough-wide parks maintenance contracts. After several years preparation, management of The Rookery transferred to SCCoop in 2015. After Lambeth budget cuts threatened closure of the paddling pool, SCCoop accepted responsibility for managing the pool from Summer 2016 and the associated fund-raising. During 2017, SCCoop has also taken on conservation work in the nature reserve areas of the Common. Following the 2016 \\"in- sourcing\\" of Lambeth's parks maintenance from Veolia to a new Lambeth Landscapes DSO, plans for a further transfer of maintenance functions have been deferred. The London Wildlife Trust is currently working with Lambeth Council and the Friends of Streatham Common to improve the site for wildlife, as a part of The Great North Wood Project. In 2010, Streatham Common was saved from the threat of a \\"temporary\\" ice rink being built on it while Tesco redeveloped the former Streatham ice rink by a vigorous local campaign under the umbrella group 'Hands Off Our Common'. ==See also== *Streatham Common railway station *Streatham-Croydon RFC ==References== ==External links== *Streatham Common Kite Day *Friends of Streatham Common *Streatham Common Co- operative (SCCoop) *Streatham Common Community Garden *The Natural History Exploration of Streatham Common Category:Parks and open spaces in the London Borough of Lambeth Category:Common land in London Category:Local nature reserves in Greater London Category:Streatham Category:History of the London Borough of Lambeth ","title":"Streatham Common"},{"id":"833003","text":"Yuzu (Citrus junos, from Japanese or ) is a citrus fruit and plant in the family Rutaceae of East Asian origin. It is believed to have originated in central China as a hybrid of mandarin orange and the ichang papeda. The yuzu is called yuja (from Korean ) in Korean cuisine. Both Japanese yuzu and Korean yuja are borrowings of the Chinese y√≤uzi (), though this Chinese word now refers to the pomelo. == Description == The fruit looks somewhat like a small grapefruit with an uneven skin, and can be either yellow or green depending on the degree of ripeness. Yuzu fruits, which are very aromatic, typically range between 5.5cm (2.16in) and 7.5cm (2.95in) in diameter, but can be as large as a regular grapefruit (up to 10cm (3.93in) or larger). Yuzu forms an upright shrub or small tree, which commonly has many large thorns. Leaves are notable for a large, leaf-like petiole, resembling those of the related kaffir lime and ichang papeda, and are heavily scented. Yuzu closely resembles sudachi (Citrus sudachi, a Japanese citrus from Tokushima Prefecture, a yuzu‚Äìmandarin orange cross) in many regards, though unlike the sudachi, yuzu eventually ripen to an orange colour and there are subtle differences between the flavours of the fruit. File:Citrus junos fruits.jpgCitrus junos fruits and cross sections File:Yuzu tree 4 years old.jpgThe leaves have large leaf-like petioles. File:Yuzuandmandarine.JPGYuzu (left) compared to mandarin orange (right) == Cultivation == The yuzu originated and grows wild in central China and its Tibet region. It was introduced to Japan and Korea during the Tang dynasty, and is still cultivated there. It grows slowly, generally requiring 10 years to fruit. To shorten duration to fruiting, it may be grafted onto karatachi (P. trifoliata). It is unusual among citrus plants in being relatively frost-hardy, due to its cold-hardy Ichang papeda ancestry, and can be grown in regions with winters as low as ‚àí9 ¬∞C (15 ¬∞F) where more sensitive citrus would not thrive. == Varieties and similar fruits == In Japan, an ornamental version of yuzu called \\"flower yuzu\\" is also grown for its flowers rather than its fruit. A sweet variety of yuzu known as the yuko, only present in Japan, became severely endangered during the 1970s and 1980s; a major attempt has been made to revive this varietal in southern Japan. Another variety of yuzu in Japan, with knobby skin, is called .photo Dangyuja, a Korean citrus fruit from Jeju Island, is often considered a type of yuzu due to its similar shape and flavour, but it is genetically a variety of pomelo. == Use East Asia===  Culinary use   Japan  A bottle of yuzu vinegar Though rarely eaten as a fruit, yuzu is a common ingredient in Japanese cuisine, where the aromatic zest (outer rind) as well as juice are used much in the same way that lemons are used in other cuisines. The yuzu's flavour is tart and fragrant, closely resembling that of the grapefruit, with overtones of mandarin orange. It is an integral ingredient (along with sudachi, daidai, and other similar citrus fruits) in the citrus-based sauce ponzu, and yuzu vinegar is also produced. Yuzu is often combined with honey to make ()‚Äîa kind of syrup that is used to make yuzu tea (), or as an ingredient in alcoholic drinks such as the yuzu sour (). (also , literally \\"yuzu and pepper\\"), is a spicy Japanese sauce made from green or yellow yuzu zest, green or red chili peppers, and salt. It is used to make liquor (such as , ) and wine. Slivered yuzu rind is used to garnish a savoury, salty egg-pudding dish called chawanmushi, as well as miso soup. It is often used along with and . Yuzu is used to make various sweets including marmalade and cake. It is used extensively in the flavouring of many snack products, such as Doritos.  Korea  In Korean cuisine, yuja is most commonly used to make (, yuja marmalade) and yuja tea. can be made by sugaring peeled, depulped, and thinly sliced yuja, and (yuja tea) can be made by mixing hot water with . (, yuja punch), a variety of (fruit punch), is another common dessert made with yuja. Yuja is also a common ingredient in Korean-style western food, such as salads.

In Japan, bathing with yuzu on T≈çji, the winter solstice, is a custom that dates to at least the early 18th century. Whole yuzu fruits are floated in the hot water of the bath, sometimes enclosed in a cloth bag, releasing their aroma. The fruit may also be cut in half, allowing the citrus juice to mingle with the bathwater. The yuzu bath, known commonly as yuzu yu (ÊüöÂ≠êÊπØ), but also as yuzu buro (ÊüöÂ≠êÈ¢®ÂëÇ), is said to guard against colds, treat the roughness of skin, warm the body, and relax the mind. The body of the taepyeongso, a Korean traditional oboe, close to the Chinese Suona or the Zurna, is often made from jujube, mulberry or yuzu wood. === Elsewhere === Beginning in the early 21st century, yuzu has been increasingly used by chefs in the United States and other Western nations, achieving notice in a 2003 article in The New York Times. In the United States the Department of Agriculture banned the import of fresh yuzu from abroad ‚Äî both the fruit and the trees. == See also == * Calamansi * Dangyuja == References == Category:Citrus Category:Fruits originating in Asia Category:Japanese fruit Category:Korean cuisine ","title":"Yuzu"},{"id":"833023","text":"The Quick Professorship of Biology is one of the senior professorships in biology at the University of Cambridge. Frederick James Quick (1836-1902) was a wealthy coffee merchant who was employed in the London law-firm Quick, Reek and James at the time of his death. He bequeathed the majority of his wealth to the University of Cambridge (he had been a law student at Trinity Hall, graduating in 1859) to be used in the 'study of vegetable and animal biology'. After much debate, it was decided that the professorship should primarily cover the field of protozoology, and in 1906 George Nuttall became the first holder of the chair. From 1907 to 1921 there was a laboratory associated with the chair, known as the Quick Laboratory: it was a single room, divided into cubicles, on the ground floor of the Cambridge Medical School building. In 1919, after an appeal for funds by the Quick Professor, the Molteno Institute of Parasitology was established. In 1920 the scope of the chair was broadened to the study of parasitology. In 1931 the chair was offered to David Keilin for study of cell biology. == Quick Professors == * George Nuttall (1906) * David Keilin (1932) * Vincent Brian Wigglesworth (1952) * Robin Coombs (1966) * Christopher Craig Wylie (1988) * Stephen Philip Jackson (1995) ==References== Category:Professorships at the University of Cambridge Category:Faculty of Biology, University of Cambridge Category:Professorships in biology Category:1906 establishments in England ","title":"Quick Professor of Biology"},{"id":"833042","text":"Culloden (known as The Battle of Culloden in the US) is a 1964 docudrama written and directed by Peter Watkins for BBC TV. It portrays the 1746 Battle of Culloden, which resulted in the British Army's destruction of the Scottish Jacobite rising of 1745 and, in the words of the narrator, \\"tore apart forever the clan system of the Scottish Highlands.\\" Described in its opening credits as \\"an account of one of the most mishandled and brutal battles ever fought in Britain,\\" Culloden was hailed as a breakthrough for its presentation of a historical event in the style of modern TV war reporting, as well as its use of non-professional actors. The film was based on John Prebble's study of the battle. ==Production== Culloden was Watkins's first full-length film. It was also his first use of his docudrama style in which actors portray historical characters being interviewed by filmmakers on the scene as though it were happening in front of news cameras. The film was produced on a low budget, with only a handful of extras and a single cannon. Watkins made use of carefully planned camera angles to give the appearance of an army. Watkins also \\"wanted to break through the conventional use of professional actors in historical melodramas, with the comfortable avoidance of reality that these provide, and to use amateurs‚Äîordinary people‚Äîin a reconstruction of their own history.\\" He accordingly used an all-amateur cast from London and the Scottish Lowlands for the Hanoverian forces, and people from Inverness for the Jacobite army. This later became a central technique of Watkins's filmmaking. According to an estimate by the cinematographer for the film, Dick Bush, about 85% of all camerawork in Culloden was hand-held.Welsh, James Michael. Peter Watkins: a guide to references and sources. G. K. Hall & Co., Boston, 1986.

Culloden looked like a documentary of an event that occurred long before the film camera was invented. ==Reception== Culloden won in 1965 both a Society of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) TV Award for Specialised Programmes BAFTA TV awards for 1965 and the British Screenwriters' Award of Merit. In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, Culloden was placed 64th.

He came to prominence as a writer, winning two O. Henry Awards and penning screenplays for Hollywood films. His 1929 essay \\"Seven Minutes in Eternity\\" marked a turning point in Pelley's career, earning a major response in The American Magazine where it was published as a popular example of what would later be called a near-death experience. His experiences with mysticism and occultism drifted towards the political, and in 1933 Pelley founded the Silver Legion of America, a fascist, para-military league. He ran for president of the U.S. in 1936 as the candidate for the Christian Party. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison for sedition in 1942, and released in 1950. Upon his death, The New York Times assessed him as \\"an agitator without a significant following\\". ==Early life== Born in Lynn, Massachusetts, William Dudley Pelley grew up in poverty, the son of William George Apsey Pelley and his wife, Grace (n√©e Goodale). His father was initially a Southern Methodist Church minister, later a small businessman and shoemaker. ==Early career== Largely self- educated, Pelley became a journalist and gained respect for his writing skills; his articles eventually appeared in national publications like The Chicago Tribune. Two of his short stories received O. Henry awards: \\"The Face in the Window\\" in 1920 and \\"The Continental Angle\\" in 1930. He was hired by the Methodist Centenary to study Methodist missions around the world. He joined the Red Cross in Siberia, where he helped the White Russians during the Russian Civil War. His opposition to Communism grew, and he began to subscribe to the conspiracy theory of Jewish Communism. Upon returning to the United States in 1920, Pelley wrote novels and short stories in addition to his journalism, and went to Hollywood, where he became a screenwriter, writing the Lon Chaney films The Light in the Dark (1922) and The Shock (1923).\\"IMDb profile:William Dudley Pelley.' IMDb. Retrieved: May 9, 2016. Pelley became disillusioned with the film industry. What he regarded as unfair treatment by Jewish studio executives increased his antisemitic inclinations. He moved to New York, and then to Asheville, North Carolina in 1932, and began publishing magazines and essays detailing his new religious system, the \\"Liberation Doctrine\\". ==Spiritualism== In May 1928, Pelley gained notoriety when he claimed he had an out-of-body experience in which he travelled to other planes of existence devoid of corporeal souls. He described his experience in an article titled \\"My Seven Minutes in Eternity\\", published in book form in 1933 as Seven Minutes in Eternity: With the Aftermath, originally probably appearing in The American Magazine in the late 1920s. In later writings, he described the experience as \\"hypo-dimensional\\".Abella and Gordon 2002, p. 241. He wrote that during this event, he met with God and Jesus, who instructed him to undertake the spiritual transformation of America. He later claimed that the experience gave him the ability to levitate, see through walls, and have out-of-body experiences at will. His metaphysical writings greatly boosted his public visibility. Some of the early members of the original Ascended Master Teachings religion, the \\"I AM\\" Activity, were recruited from the ranks of Pelley's organization, the Silver Legion. Pelley's religious system was a mixture of theosophy, spiritualism, Rosicrucianism, and pyramidism. He considered it to be a perfected form of Christianity, in which \\"Dark Souls\\" (Jews, Communists and Papists) represented the forces of evil. ==Political activism== When the Great Depression struck America in 1929, Pelley became active in politics. After moving to Asheville, Pelley founded Galahad College in 1932. The college specialized in correspondence courses on \\"Social Metaphysics\\" and \\"Christian Economics\\". He also founded Galahad Press, which he used to publish various political and metaphysical magazines, newspapers, and books. On January 30, 1933, Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany. Pelley, an admirer of Hitler, founded the Silver Legion, an antisemitic organization whose members, known as Silver Shirts and Christian Patriots, wore Nazi-style silver uniform shirts. Their insignia was a scarlet L, emblazoned on their flags and uniforms. Biographer Scott Beekman noted that Pelley was \\"one of the first Americans to create an organization celebrating the work of Adolf Hitler.\\" Pelley traveled throughout the United States, holding recruitment rallies, lectures, and public speeches. He founded Silver Legion chapters in almost every state in the country. Membership peaked at 15,000 in 1935, dropping to below 5,000 by 1938. His political ideology consisted of anti-Communism, antisemitism, patriotism, white supremacy, corporatism, isolationism and British Israelism, themes which were the primary focus of his numerous magazines and newspapers, which included Liberation, Pelley's Silvershirt Weekly, The Galilean and The New Liberator. He became fairly well known as the 1930s went on.Lobb, David. \\"Fascist apocalypse: William Pelley and millennial extremism.\\" Department of History, Syracuse University, November 1999. Retrieved: May 8, 2015. Sinclair Lewis mentioned him by name in his novel It Can't Happen Here (1935) about a fascist takeover in the U.S. Pelley is praised by the leader of the fictional movement as an important precursor. Pelley opposed Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the New Deal. He founded the Christian Party in 1935, and ran an unsuccessful campaign as candidate for president in 1936, winning only 1,600 votes. He engaged in a long dispute with the United States House of Representatives' Dies Committee, predecessor to the House Un-American Activities Committee. In 1940, federal marshals conducted a raid on Pelley's headquarters in Asheville, and they arrested his followers and seized his property. Despite serious financial and material setbacks within his organization, which resulted from lengthy court battles, Pelley continued to oppose Roosevelt, especially as diplomatic relations between the United States and the Empire of Japan and Nazi Germany became strained in the early 1940s. Pelley accused Roosevelt of being a warmonger and advocated isolationism. Roosevelt enlisted J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI to investigate Pelley. Subsequently, the FBI interviewed subscribers to Pelley's newspapers and magazines. Although the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 led Pelley to disband the Silver Legion, he continued to attack the government in his magazine, Roll Call,\\"Strange doings in Noblesville.\\" Time Magazine, January 27, 1941. which alarmed Roosevelt, Attorney General Francis Biddle, and the House Un-American Activities Committee. After stating in one issue of Roll Call that the devastation of the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor was worse than the government claimed, Pelley was arrested at his new base of operations in Noblesville, Indiana, and in April 1942, he was charged with 12 counts of high treason and sedition. One charge was dropped, but he was tried in Indiana and convicted of the other 11 charges, mostly for making seditious statements and for obstructing military recruiting and fomenting insurrection within the military. Pelley was sentenced to 15 years in prison. After serving eight years, he was paroled and released in 1950. While still incarcerated, he was one of 30 defendants in the \\"Mass Sedition Trial\\" of Nazi sympathizers, which culminated in a mistrial after the death of the judge, Edward C. Eicher, in November 1944. ==Later life== In his final years, Pelley dealt with charges of securities fraud that had been brought against him while he was living in Asheville. The terms of Pelley's parole stipulated that he remain in central Indiana, and desist from all political activity. He developed an elaborate religious philosophy called \\"Soulcraft\\", based on his belief in UFOs and extraterrestrials, and published Star Guests in 1950. One of his associates, George Hunt Williamson, had several articles published in science fiction magazines. Pelley died at his home in Noblesville on June 30, 1965.\\"William Dudley Pelley, 75, dies; Founded fascist Silver Shirts.\\" The New York Times, July 2, 1965.

He has been credited for having presented the rich universe of Northeastern musical genres to all of Brazil, having created the musical genre bai√£o and has been called a \\"revolutionary\\" by Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim. According to Caetano Veloso, he was the first significant cultural event with mass appeal in Brazil. Luiz Gonzaga received the Shell prize for Brazilian Popular Music in 1984 and was only the fourth artist to receive this prize after Pixinguinha, Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim and Dorival Caymmi. The Luiz Gonzaga Dam was named in his honor. Gonzaga's son, Luiz Gonzaga do Nascimento Jr, known as Gonzaguinha (1945‚Äì91), was also a noted Brazilian singer and composer. ==Biography== The son of a farmer, Gonzaga was attracted to the accordion at a very early age, and he used to accompany his father at parties and religious celebrations. He later went to do his military service, where he learned to play the cornet. On leaving the army he decided to remain in Rio de Janeiro, performing in the streets and in bars. After noticing that the north-eastern people living in Rio de Janeiro missed the music from their home states, he started to give listeners the sort of music they craved to hear: xaxados, bai√µes, chamegos and cocos. At Ary Barroso's talent show, Luiz Gonzaga played his chamego \\"Vira e Mexe\\" and was acclaimed by the audience and by the host, who gave him the highest score. After discovering this niche in the market, Gonzaga became a regular at radio shows and started making records. In 1943, he dressed up in typical north-eastern costumes for the first time to perform live, and got hyped. Later on, as well as playing popular tunes on the accordion, he began to sing his own material, and his skills as a songwriter were revealed. His greatest hit ever, \\"Asa Branca\\" (written with Humberto Teixeira), was recorded in 1947 and covered countless times by many artists. He worked on the radio until 1954, enjoying huge popularity. He became (in the words of Caetano Veloso, Caderno de Confess√µes Brasileiras, 1988) a \\"pop music\\" star, taking a genre straight from folklore to the pop music, creating with the combination of accordion, zabumba, and triangle (which became later the basic ensemble for Forr√≥) one of the western world's first \\"small pop music ensembles\\", ten years before the popularization of the rock music ensemble by the Beatles. He is widely recognized for single- handedly taking the bai√£o style and the accordion to a wide audience. RCA (now BMG), his recording label, was almost exclusively dedicated to printing his singles and albums . During the 1960s, as the public taste shifted to bossa nova and i√™-i√™-i√™, he found himself increasingly stranded from big city stages, so he toured the countryside, where his popularity never abated. In the 1970s and 1980s, he slowly re-emerged, partly due to covers of his songs by famous artists like Geraldo Vandr√©, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, his son Gonzaguinha and Milton Nascimento. Some of his greatest hits are \\"Vozes da Seca\\" (\\"Voices From Drought\\"), \\"Algod√£o\\" (\\"Cotton\\"), \\"A Dan√ßa da Moda\\" (\\"The Dance in Fashion\\"), \\"ABC do Sert√£o\\" (\\"The ABC of Sert√£o\\"), \\"Derramaro o Gai\\" (\\"They Spilt the Gas\\"), \\"A Letra I\\" (\\"The 'i' letter\\"), \\"Imbalan√ßa\\" (\\"Shake It\\"), \\"A Volta da Asa-Branca\\" (\\"The Return of The Picazuro Pigeon\\"), \\"Cintura Fina\\" (\\"Slender Waist\\"), \\"O Xote das Meninas\\" (\\"The Girls' Schottische\\", written with Z√© Dantas, and \\"Juazeiro\\", \\"Para√≠ba\\", \\"Mangaratiba\\", \\"Bai√£o-de- Dois\\", \\"No Meu P√© de Serra\\" (\\"There in My Homeland\\"), \\"Assum Preto\\" (\\"Blue- back Grassquit\\"), \\"L√©gua Tirana\\" (\\"Tyrannical league\\"), \\"Qui Nem Jil√≥\\" (\\"Like Solanum gilo\\", written with Humberto Teixeira. Other successful collaborations resulted in \\"T√° Bom Demais\\" (\\"It's So Good\\") (with Onildo de Almeida), \\"Danado de Bom\\" (\\"Damn Good\\") (with Jo√£o Silva), \\"Dezessete e Setecentos\\" (\\"Seventeen And Seven hundred\\") and \\"Cortando o Pano\\" (\\"Cutting Cloth\\") (both with Miguel Lima). The surname Gonzaga is an ancient noble surname in Brazil, Portugal and Italy. Gonzaga died of natural causes in 1989 at the age of 76. ==Discography== *A dan√ßa da moda, Luiz Gonzaga and Z√© Dantas (1950) *A feira de Caruaru, Onildo Almeida (1957) *A letra I, Luiz Gonzaga and

Retrieved 28 December 2018. ==Life== Born at Bromley, near Bow, she was the youngest daughter of Thomas Drane, an East Indian mercantile executive, and brought up in the Anglican faith. She was taught initially at home and then for two years at a Kensington school. Her father's extensive library encouraged her reading and studying habits. The family moved to Babbacombe, Devon when she was 14. Drane was influenced by Tractarian teachings and joined the Roman Catholic Church in Tiverton around 1850. In 1852, after a six-month stay in Rome, she joined the third order of St Dominic, to which she belonged for over forty years. She was prioress of the convent in Stone, Staffordshire, where she died aged 70. ==Works== Drane wrote, and published anonymously, an essay questioning the morality of Tractarianism, which was attributed to John Henry Newman. Her major works in prose and verse are: The History of Saint Dominic (1857; enlarged edition, 1891); The Life of St Catherine of Siena (1880; 2nd ed., 1899); Christian Schools and Scholars (1867); The Knights of St John (1858); Songs in the Night and Other Poems (1876); and the Three Chancellors (1859), a sketch of the lives of William of Wykeham, William of Waynflete and Sir Thomas More.

His first job was at the San Francisco Union Iron Works. He was later hired by the Honolulu Iron Works. In 1911 he began working for James Dole at the Hawaiian Pineapple Company. After inventing the \\"Ginaca Machine\\", Ginaca and his brothers returned to California in 1914. He died on October 19, 1918, in Hornitos, California during the Spanish flu epidemic. == The \\"Ginaca Machine\\" == Ginaca was hired by James Dole in 1911 to build a machine that could make canning pineapples more efficient. By 1913, Ginaca built a machine that removed the pineapple skin, then cored and sliced the fruit so that it would fit neatly in the can. Cannery workers would then inspect the sliced pineapple to trim away any thing that wouldn't fit in a can. The machine exponentially increased the number of pineapples that could be cored in one minute from 15 pineapples to 35. A higher speed machine was later invented that could peel and core 100 pineapples per minute. This revolutionized the fruit canning industry by making pineapple Hawaii's second-largest crop, after sugarcane. == References == Category:1876 births Category:1918 deaths Category:American inventors Category:People from Hawaii Category:Deaths from Spanish flu ","title":"Henry Gabriel Ginaca"},{"id":"833121","text":"The King Edward VII Professorship of English Literature is one of the senior professorships in literature at the University of Cambridge, and was founded by a donation from Sir Harold Harmsworth in 1910 in memory of King Edward VII who had died earlier that year. ==King Edward VII Professors== * Arthur Woollgar Verrall (1911) * Arthur Thomas Quiller-Couch (1912‚Äì1944) * Basil Willey (1946) * Lionel Charles Knights (1965) * John Frank Kermode (1974) * Christopher Bruce Ricks (1982) * Marilyn Butler (1986) * Gillian Patricia Kempster Beer (1994) * David Trotter (2002) * Clair Wills (2019) ==References== Category:Professorships at the University of Cambridge Category:School of Arts and Humanities, University of Cambridge Category:Professorships in literature Category:1910 establishments in England ","title":"King Edward VII Professor of English Literature"},{"id":"833141","text":"The Schr√∂der Professorship of German is the senior professorship in the study of the German language at the University of Cambridge, and was founded in 1909 by a donation of ¬£20,000 from Sir John Henry Freiherr von Schr√∂der, Bt. of J.

They provide vision and leadership to all stakeholders in the school and create a safe and peaceful environment to achieve the mission of learning and educating at the highest level. They guide the day to day school business and oversee all activities conducted by the school. They bear the responsibility of all decision making and are accountable for their efforts to elevate the school to the best level of learning achievements for the students, best teaching skills for the teachers and best work environment for support staff. ==Role== While some head teachers still do some teaching themselves, in most larger schools, most of their duties are managerial and pastoral. They are often used to discipline misbehaving students, help organize school sponsored activities and department heads report to them. In Australia, the head teacher is sometimes in charge of one (in the case of a major subject) or multiple (often in smaller schools) specific departments, such as English, history, maths, science, writing, technology, etc., but maintains full teaching duties and status. They are considered part of the school executive, and often a head teacher position is a stepping-stone into administration. ==Executive head== ==Deputy head== ==Assistants== In larger schools, the principal is assisted by one or more \\"vice-principals\\", \\"assistant principals\\", \\"associate principals\\", or \\"deputy principals\\". Their position is secondary to the principal with regard to school governance. Assistant principals generally perform specific duties such as handling student discipline, curriculum, student council or student activities whereas the principal has the ultimate responsibility for the school as a whole (including faculty and staff, physical plant, etc.). ==Regional information Australia and New Zealand === In many Australian and New Zealand schools, a headmaster/principal is the head administrator of a school who has been appointed to her/his position by the school board, superintendent, or other body. The principal, often in conjunction with the school board, makes the executive decisions that govern the school, as well as having the authority over the employment (and in some cases firing) of teachers. The principal is often the chief disciplinarian of the students. ===United States=== In 1999, there were about 133,000 principals and assistant principals in the United States.Digest of Education Statistics 2001 In the early decades of public education, the full title was \\"principal teacher\\", which accounts for the present day title having an adjectival form, essentially being a shortened version of the original full title. Yet the terms head(master/mistress) and head of school are still used in older schools, such as in Louisiana and some southern small towns. School principals in the United States are sometimes required to have school administrator licensing, and, often, a master's degree in educational administration.Kate Rousmaniere, The Principal's Office: A Social History of the American School Principal (State University of New York Press; 2013) 197 pages ==Impact of school principals== While there has been considerable anecdotal discussion about the importance of school principals, there has been very little systematic research into their impact on student outcomes. Recent analysis in the United States has examined how the gains in student achievement at a school change after the principal changes. This outcome-based approach to measuring effectiveness of principals is very similar to the value-added modeling that has been applied to the evaluation of teachers. Such research in the state of Texas found that principals have a very large impact on student achievement.Gregory Branch, Eric Hanushek, and Steven G. Rivkin, \\"School Leaders Matter: Measuring the impact of effective principals,\\" ‚Äò‚ÄôEducation Next‚Äô‚Äô 13(1), Winter 2013. Effective school principals have been shown to significantly improve the performance of all students at the school, at least in part through their impacts on selection and retention of good teachers. Ineffective principals have a similarly large negative effect on school performance, suggesting that issues of evaluation are as important for school administrators as they are for teachers. The impact of principals has also been measured in non-traditional ways. Some principals have focused their efforts on creating more inclusive schools for students with disabilities.DeMatthews, D.

Best known for the company she kept, she numbered among her closest friends Goethe, Beethoven, and P√ºckler and tried to foster artistic agreement among them. Many leading composers of the time, including Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Johanna Kinkel, and Johannes Brahms, admired her spirit and talents. As a composer, von Arnim's style was unconventional, molding and melding favorite folk melodies and historical themes with innovative harmonies, phrase lengths, and improvisations that became synonymous with the music of the era. She was closely related to the German writers Clemens Brentano and Achim von Arnim: the first was her brother, the second her husband. Her daughter Gisela von Arnim became a prominent writer as well. Her nephews, via her brother Christian, were Franz and Lujo Brentano. ==Family and early life== Bettina von Arnim was born at Frankfurt am Main, into the large family of an Italian merchant. Her grandmother, Sophie von La Roche, was a novelist, and her brother was Clemens Brentano, the great poet known for his lyric poems, libretti, and Singspiele. He was a mentor and protector to her and inspired her to read the poetry of the time, especially Goethe. From an early age Bettina was called 'the kobold' by her brothers and sisters, a nickname that she maintained later on in Berlin society. After being educated at an Ursulines convent school in Fritzlar from 1794 to 1797, Bettina lived for a while with her grandmother at Offenbach am Main and from 1803 to 1806 with her brother-in-law, Friedrich von Savigny, the famous jurist, at Marburg. She formed a friendship with Karoline von G√ºnderrode. The two friends acknowledged only natural impulses, laws, and methods of life, and brooded over the \\"tyranny\\" of conventionalities. In 1806, G√ºnderrode committed suicide on account of a passion for the philologist Georg Friedrich Creuzer. In 1807 at Weimar Bettina made the acquaintance of Goethe, for whom she entertained a significant passion, which the poet did not requite, though he entered into correspondence with her. Their friendship came to an abrupt end in 1811, owing to Bettina's behaviour with Goethe's wife. In 1811, Bettina married Achim von Arnim, the renowned Romantic poet. The couple settled first at the Wiepersdorf castle, and then in Berlin. They had seven children. Achim died in 1831, but Bettina maintained an active public life. Her passion for Goethe revived, and in 1835, after lengthy discussions with the writer and landscape gardener Hermann von P√ºckler-Muskau, she published her book Goethe's Correspondence with a Child (), which purported to be a correspondence between herself and the poet. The book is in large part fictitious. Genuine sonnets of Goethe in it were addressed, not to her, but to Minna Herzlieb. As a work of fiction, the book has been praised. She continued to write, inspire, and publish until 20 January 1859, when she died in Berlin, aged 73, surrounded by her children. Her grave is in the Wiepersdorf churchyard. ==Career== During the years of 1806 to 1808, von Arnim helped gather the folk songs that made up Des Knaben Wunderhorn, the collaborative work of her brother and her future husband, Achim von Arnim. Some of the songs were later put to music by a number of composers, among them Gustav Mahler. The collection became a touchstone of the Romantic musical and poetic style. From 1808 to 1809 she studied voice, composition, and piano in Munich under Peter von Winter and Sebastian Bopp. She published her first song under the pseudonym Beans Beor, which she occasionally used later as well. Bettina sang briefly in the Berliner Singakademie and composed settings of Hellenistic poems by Amalie von Helvig. Though domestic duties connected to her 1811 marriage to von Arnim diminished her productivity, several art songs from the period have been recovered and have been published in Werke und Briefe. Von Arnim was the first composer to set the poet H√∂lderlin's work to music. She was a muse to the progressives of Prussia, linked to the socialist movement and an advocate for the oppressed Jewish community. She published two politically dissident works but evaded chastisement because of her friendship with the King of Prussia. After the 1831 death of her husband, Bettina continued her dedication to the creative community. She published a collection of seven songs in public support of Prussian music director Gaspare Spontini, under duress at the time. ==Works== * Goethes Briefwechsel mit einem Kinde, 1835 (Goethe's correspondence with a child ‚Äì English translation) * Die G√ºnderode, 1840 [Miss G√ºnderode] (a fictionalized correspondence with her friend, the poet Karoline von G√ºnderrode (1780‚Äì1806)) * Dies Buch geh√∂rt dem K√∂nig, 1843 (This Book Belongs to the King) * Clemens Brentanos Fr√ºhlingskranz, aus Jugendbriefen ihm geflochten, wie er selbst schriftlich verlangte, 1844 (Clemens Brentano's Spring Wreath, woven for him from the letters of his youth, as he requested in writing) (genuine letters to and from her brother) * Ilius Pamphilius und die Ambrosia, 1848 * An die aufgel√∂ste Preu√üische Nationalversammlung, 1849 * with Gisela von Arnim: Das Leben der Hochgr√§fin Gritta von Rattenzuhausbeiuns, 1840 * Enid Gajek and Bernhard Gajek, eds., Bettine von Arnim, Hermann von P√ºckler-Muskau, ¬ªDie Leidenschaft ist der Schl√ºssel zur Welt¬´.

Located near the juncture of Elm Creek and the Llano River, it lasted only a year. No trace of the Bettina community survives, though two of its three founders subsequently became prominent: Gustav Schleicher, later a U.S. congressman and namesake of Schleicher County, and Dr. Ferdinand Ludwig Herff, who in 1854 became the first surgeon to use anesthesia in Texas.Lyman Wight's Mormon Colony in Texas excerpt from \\"Mormon Trails\\" chapter in Hill Country travel guide by Richard Zelade. Accessed 6 August 2007. The community's third founder was Hermann Spiess. Part of von Arnim's design for a colossal statue of Goethe, executed in marble by the sculptor Carl Johann Steinh√§user (1813‚Äì1878), was displayed in the museum at Weimar in 1911. From 1991 until 31 December 2001, her portrait was on the German 5-Mark bill. In 2006, the German government turned K√ºnstlerhaus Schloss Wiepersdorf, the estate of the von Arnims, into a literary institute. The institute contains a museum devoted to the von Arnims' literary legacy. ==References== == External links == * * Category:1785 births Category:1859 deaths Category:19th-century German composers Category:19th-century German women writers Bettina Category:German female composers Category:German illustrators Category:German-language poets Category:German women novelists Category:People from the Free City of Frankfurt Category:Writers from Hesse Category:19th-century women composers ","title":"Bettina von Arnim"},{"id":"833188","text":"Hafner may refer to: ==Surname== *Anton Hafner (born 1918), German former Luftwaffe fighter ace *Benjamin Hafner (1821‚Äì1899), American locomotive engineer *Christian Hafner (born 1972), Italian luger *Dorinda Hafner, optician, nurse, storyteller, actress, dancer, writer, television chef *Edo Hafner (born 1955), retired Slovenian professional ice hockey player *Frank Hafner (1867‚Äì1957), Major League Baseball player *Fritz Hafner (1877‚Äì1964), Austrian-German painter and visual arts educator *Genevieve Hafner, French photographer based in New York City *Gerald H√§fner (born 1956), German politician *Herta Hafner, Italian luger *Ingrid Hafner (1936‚Äì1994), British actress *Josef Anton Hafner (1709‚Äì1756), German painter *Kai H√§fner (born 1989), German handball player *Katie Hafner, journalist, writes books and articles about technology and society *Ludwig Hafner (1921‚Äì1942), German Luftwaffe ace *Nuala Hafner, Australian media personality *Philipp Hafner (1735‚Äì1764), Austrian farce writer *Raoul Hafner (1905‚Äì1980), Austrian-born British helicopter pioneer and engineer *Reinhard Hafner (born 1952), German footballer and coach *Sabrina Hafner (born 1984), Swiss bobsledder *Thomas Hafner, realistic and fantastic art painter *Travis Hafner (born 1977), left- handed hitting designated hitter *Wolfgang Hafner (born 1965), German jazz drummer ==Other uses== *Gro√üer Hafner, a mountain in the Alps *Grosser Hafner, Prehistoric pile dwelling settlement in Switzerland *Kleiner Hafner, Prehistoric pile dwelling settlement in Switzerland *Hafner Manufacturing Company, Chicago maker of clockwork-powered O gauge toy trains *Hafner A.R.III Gyroplane, British 1930s experimental autogyro *Hafner Rotabuggy, British experimental aircraft *Hafner Rotachute, British 1940s experimental one-man rotor kite *Hafner-Sarnak-McCurley constant, mathematical constant ==See also== *Haffner (disambiguation) *Hefner (disambiguation) *Hafer ","title":"Hafner"},{"id":"833192","text":"Agnes Mary Frances Robinson (known as Agnes-Marie-Fran√ßois Darmesteter after her first marriage, and Agnes Mary Frances Duclaux after her second; 27 February 1857 ‚Äì 9 February 1944) was a poet, novelist, essayist, literary critic, and translator. She was the elder sister of the novelist and critic Frances Mabel Robinson. ==Life== Agnes Mary Frances Robinson was born in Leamington, Warwickshire, on 27 February 1857 to a wealthy architect. After a few years, the family moved to become a part of the artistic community growing in London. Robinson and her younger sister, Frances Mabel Robinson, shared an education under governesses and in Brussels until they attended one year at University College, London. The Robinson house became a central location for painters and writers of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, such as William Michael Rossetti, William Morris, William Holman Hunt, Edward Burne-Jones, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Arthur Symons, Ford Madox Brown, and Mathilde Blind, to meet and cultivate a community of artists. In 1876, Robinson met John Addington Symonds, who provided literary advice as she began her writing. Robinson's first book of poems, A Handful of Honeysuckle was published in 1878 and was greeted with much success. In 1880, the family travelled to Italy, where Robinson first met Vernon Lee (Violet Paget). During the 1880s, Robinson published a book of poetry almost every year, as well as her one novel Arden. She received most of her acclaim through her lyrics. In 1888, Robinson married James Darmesteter, a Jewish professor at the College de France and moved to Paris, France. Darmesteter translated much of Robinson's works into French during their marriage, and Robinson improved her own French where she eventually published her first original work in French, Marguerites du Temps Pass√©. During her stay in Paris, Robinson and her husband became involved in the Parisian literary society which included Hippolyte Taine, Ernest Renan, and Gaston Paris. After a brief 6 years married, Darmesteter died on 19 October 1894 from a short illness and left Robinson widowed at age 38. Robinson remained in France after Darmesteter died, and she wrote articles for the Revue de Paris, translated her late husband's work, and researched for a biography she wrote for Ernest Renan. Robinson mingled with the scientific community of France as well, and in 1902 she married Emile Duclaux, a student of the biologist and chemist Louis Pasteur. Robinson became a part of Duclaux's scientific studies and assisted him in his writings. After Duclaux died in 1904, Robinson continued to delve more in France and French life, living among her stepchildren from Auvergne to Paris. For the next 20 years, Robinson wrote biographies of prominent artists, reviews of literature, and poetry collections. When war broke out in 1939, her stepchildren moved Robinson and her sister Mabel to a hiding place in Aurillac where she remained safe, peacefully writing French and English poetry. In 1943, Robinson underwent an operation for the removal of a double cataract from her eyes, but died 4 months later on 9 February 1944. Robinson died at the age of 87 and was buried in Aurillac. ==Personal Relationships== Robinson formed many intimate relationships throughout her life. Her longest intimate relationship was shared with Vernon Lee (the pen name of Violet Paget). The two of them travelled between England, France, and Italy for 8 years until Robinson settled into married life with Darmesteter in Paris. Lee broke down after the initial marriage announcement and although she never fully recovered, she did renew her friendship once more through letters and some visits to Paris. In Biblioth√®que nationale in Paris, 1,253 folio pages still exist of letters between Lee and Robinson and 1,100 of the pages are from 1880-1887 before Robinson's marriage to Darmesteter. The letters contain intimate terms such as \\"dear love\\" and \\"dear glory of my life\\" demonstrating the romantic connection the women shared. Robinson and Lee also shared a close relationship with the author John Addington Symonds, who published articles on male homosexuality and worked closely with Havelock Ellis on his work Sexual Inversion. Although Symonds was married and openly homosexual, his letters show his appreciation of Robinson. He states in one such letter that Robinson was \\"a charming friend in every possible way: a more beautiful and gentle spirit I have never met with.\\" Symonds mentored Robinson through her study of Greek language and literature at University College London. Symonds shared an intellectual relationship with Robinson and Lee, taking on the role of a teacher and critique of their works. ==Work== Robinson wrote hundreds of poems and ballads that are published in many different journals and books. Robinson published books of her own collected works in both English and French, and also wrote the first full-length biography of Emily Bront√´ to positive reviews. Robinson's poetry and lyrics were considered mostly part of the aestheticism intellectual movement. The movement reflects the significance of poetry as beautiful with no deeper meaning. In 1902, Robinson published Collected Poems, lyrical and narrative which held a short \\"Preface\\" written on the subject of poetry and authorship. Although Robinson comments that poetry should be written in at one's limit or \\"extremity\\", she admits this collection of poems were written over the span of 23 years and were \\"re-considered\\", \\"revised\\", and \\"re-written.\\" She accepts that poets do not look for recognition today but \\"may find an audience to-morrow\\", recognizes her status in the sights of great poets such as Byron, Hugo, and Keats. Robinson takes pride in being a lesser known poet that may create the minor works of sincerity. She says: \\"We cannot all be great poets; but the humblest, if they be sincere, may give a genuine pleasure.\\" Robinson writes from what she sees and knows, and her aesthetic lyrics form as she comments \\"[t]hat life has been an Ode, of which these pages are the scattered fragments.\\" Robinson's most controversial collection of poems of her time was The New Arcadia. This collection of poems told the stories of a series of characters living in rural England. The poems tried to raise awareness to the rural poverty caused by the agricultural depression of the 1870s. Robinson investigated, with Lee, how poetry could invoke sympathetic compassion and understanding in the reader. == List of Works == * A Handful of Honeysuckle (1878) * The Crowned Hippolytus (1881) * Arden (1883) * Emily Bront√´ (1883) * The New Arcadia and Other Poems (1884) * An Italian Garden (1886) * Margaret of Angoul√™me, Queen of Navarre (1886) (England) * Margaret of Angoul√™me, Queen of Navarre (1887) (America) * Po√©sies (1888) (translated to French by Darmesteter) * Songs, Ballads and a Garden Play (1888) * The End of the Middle Ages (1889) * The New Arcadia (1890) * Lyrics Selected from the Works of A.

His most famous novel is Jacob the Liar, which has been made into two films. He lived in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ during World War II for about two years and survived the Holocaust. ==Childhood== Jurek Becker was born, probably, in 1937. His birth date is not entirely clear because his father gave a birth date that was intended to protect the child from deportation. After the war Becker was claimed by a father, but Jurek was never sure if he was his real father, and who said he no longer remembered Jurek's correct birth date. It is probable that Jurek Becker was some years younger than is generally reckoned. He lived in the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto as a child. When he was five, he was sent to the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp and later to Sachsenhausen. His mother died in the Holocaust, but his father survived; father and son were reunited after the war and settled together in East Berlin. ==Career== After completing his national service in the East German army in the 1950s, during which time he became firm friends with the actor Manfred Krug, Becker studied philosophy in East Berlin but was expelled for expressing non-conformist views. In the 1960s he wrote film scripts, one of which, Jakob der L√ºgner (\\"Jacob the Liar\\"), he turned into a novel when the film production was halted. It was made into a film by the East German film company DEFA in 1974, and in 1975 became the only East German film ever to be nominated for an Academy Award (in the foreign-language film category), though it did not win. A 1998 remake, starring Robin Williams in the title role, had limited success. By the mid-1970s differences of opinion with the GDR authorities were becoming apparent, and Becker was one of the original twelve signatories of the petition against the expulsion of writer and singer Wolf Biermann in November 1976. In 1977 he moved from East to West Berlin, though somewhat unusually he retained his East German citizenship. He continued to publish novels and short stories, some on Jewish themes, others not. Becker died in 1997 of colon cancer that was diagnosed in December 1995. ==WorksIn German=== Becker was primarily a novelist, but he also wrote film and TV scripts.

The chair was discontinued on the retirement of the incumbent in 1909. == Cambridge == At Cambridge the chair was initially founded as a readership. Before it was upgraded to a professorship before or in 1815 it was usually combined with the Sir Thomas Adams's Professor of Arabic chair and held by the same person. The chair, \\"which for two centuries\\" had \\"a distinguished record, but carried only a nominal stipend\\", was discontinued on the death of the incumbent, Professor Anthony Ashley Bevan, in 1933.The Manchester Guardian, 12 December 1933, p. 9. ===Lord Almoner's Readers=== * David Wilkins (1724) * Leonard Chappelow (1729) * Samuel Hallifax (1768) * William Craven (1770) ===Lord Almoner's Professors=== * George Cecil Renouard (1815‚Äì1821) * Thomas Musgrave (1821) * Thomas Robinson (1837‚Äì1854) * Theodore Preston (1855) * Edward Henry Palmer (1871‚Äì1882) * William Robertson Smith (1883) * Ion Grant Neville Keith- Falconer (1886) * Robert Lubbock Bensly (1887) * Anthony Ashley Bevan (1893) - contributor to the Encyclopaedia Biblica == References == Category:Professorships at the University of Cambridge Category:School of Arts and Humanities, University of Cambridge Category:Professorships at the University of Oxford Category:1724 establishments in England Category:1933 disestablishments in England Arabic Category:Arabists ","title":"Lord Almoner's Professor of Arabic"},{"id":"833282","text":"BT Communications (Ireland) Limited is a telecommunications and internet company in Ireland. It is a subsidiary of BT Group plc. ==HistoryEsat Telecom=== The company was founded in 1990 by a consortium headed by business magnate Denis O'Brien and was originally known as Esat Telecom. The name Esat, said to be an abbreviation of \\"√âireann Satellite\\" and connected to O'Brien's bid for Ireland's communications satellite licence under the 1977 ITU frequency plans, would become much more associated with telecommunications in Ireland, however. Esat Telecom applied a number of times for a telecommunications licence to the Department of Communications and was finally granted a limited one in March 1993. The company officially launched its services on 20 April 1994. It was the first domestic competitor to Bord Telecom √âireann (now Eircom) and, after initially reselling leased lines from that company, used \\"autodiallers\\" to route calls onto its network. These devices proved controversial, with Telecom threatening legal action and the Department contending that these were a breach of Esat's limited licence. However, an Esat complaint to the European Commission was upheld, and eventually in 1997, the new Director of Telecommunications Regulation (now called ComReg) regularised Esat's position by ordering Telecom √âireann to provide a service to switch calls onto Esat's network. In 1996, Esat Telecom, in conjunction with Telenor AB, bid successfully for the second GSM mobile telecommunications licence, against five other consortia. This became known as Esat Digifone. The Moriarty Tribunal found in 2008 that the awarding of the licence was influenced by payments made by O'Brien to Michael Lowry, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. On 7 November 1997, Esat Telecom Group plc held an initial public offering and was listed on the Irish Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange, and NASDAQ Stock Market. Originally the company targeted just corporate customers, but from 1 December 1998, when the Irish telecommunications market was fully deregulated, domestic customers were also targeted, under the Esat Clear brand name. 1,300 customers signed up before it had even launched. In 1999, Esat entered the Internet Service Provider market, initially through the purchase of EUnet Ireland, which became Esat Net. However, it was the acquisition of Ireland On-Line from An Post that year which made Esat the biggest ISP in the country for a time. Also in 1999, Esat bid for Cablelink Limited, the cable and television company owned jointly by Telecom √âireann and RT√â. However, NTL won. In 1999, Esat Telecom was the first wholly owned Irish company to lay two optical submarine cables between Ireland and the UK. No other company had achieved such a milestone and since then, only operators from outside the state have managed to install their own optical submarine cables. ===Esat BT=== In 1999, relations became tense between Esat and Telenor over how Esat Digifone, their mobile joint venture, should be operated. Telenor tried to remove Denis O'Brien as chairman of Esat Digifone and remove the Esat name from the company. Esat for its part retaliated by threatening to sue Telenor, and making repeated offers to buy the Norwegian company out. Eventually, in November 1999, Telenor bid for the entire share capital of Esat Telecom Group plc as a way of solving the situation. The bid was rejected by the Esat board and so became a hostile takeover attempt. To defend this, in January 2000, British Telecommunications plc (now BT Group plc) made a friendly takeover offer for the company which was backed by the Esat board. Esat became a wholly owned subsidiary of BT and was delisted from the stock market. When BT acquired Esat, they began integrating the business along with its Northern Ireland subsidiary, BT (NI). The combined unit was then registered as BT Communications (Ireland) Limited. The company's main business is in fixed line telecommunications where it owns its own network in Northern Ireland and owns a network built along the Iarnr√≥d √âireann rail network in the Republic of Ireland and along the road which complementes its rail network. The network build phase started in August 1997 and it also leases capacity from its fixed line incumbent, Eircom. Following the company's acquisition by BT, Esat Telecom was rebranded as Esat BT in 2002, and replaced its own logo with the BT piper. ===BT Ireland=== In late 2004, it was announced from April 2005, the name of the company would change from \\"Esat BT\\" to just \\"BT Ireland\\". The company has performed well, winning some high-profile corporate clients. However, Eircom still commands over a 73% share of fixed-line telecommunications in the Republic of Ireland. All company names in the Esat BT Group were officially re-registered with the Companies Registration Office as BT in March 2005, and on 12 April, the company was officially rebranded as \\"BT Ireland\\". On 22 July 2009, BT Ireland agreed to transfer most of its consumer and small business operations in Ireland, other than its remaining dial-up internet operations, to Vodafone Ireland. Large industrial and commercial customers will remain with BT. Under the partnership, Vodafone will provide voice and broadband internet services over BT's network. The deal is subject to the Competition Authority's approval. BT Ireland do not own any infrastructure in Northern Ireland, being owned by BT Group (UK) directly. ==Esat Digifone== Esat Digifone, a GSM mobile phone network which was the first competitor to Eircell (then a Telecom √âireann subsidiary) was originally a joint venture between Esat Telecom and Telenor, however when Esat was sold to BT, the mobile division became part of BT Wireless, which was eventually spun off as O2 plc, which in turn was bought by Spanish-based Telef√≥nica in 2005https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/31/o2_telefonica/ (EU approved in 2006).https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/11/o2_eu_roam/ The company is now officially registered as Telef√≥nica O2 Ireland Limited, but trades as O2. In June 2013, Hutchison Whampoa announced it would acquire the Irish arm of O2 for ‚Ç¨780m. O2 is now merged with Hutchison Whampoa's subsidiary Three Ireland following the completion of the sale. ==See also== * List of Irish companies * Communications in Ireland * BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition ==ReferencesSources=== * O'Kelly, Brendan, (2001) The Esat Story.

From 1999 to 2009, she was member of the European Parliament from Germany, serving with Die Linke. Feleknas Uca was at one time the world's only Yazidi parliamentarian until the Iraqi legislature was elected in 2005. In June 2015, she was elected as a Member of Parliament in Turkey representing Diyarbakƒ±r. ==Life and work== Feleknas Uca was born in Celle, Lower Saxony, West Germany to an immigrant Yazidi family originally from Turkey. She graduated from Comprehensive School in Celle before taking an apprenticeship as a doctor's assistant, and completed her Abitur by distance learning. In 2010 she established the Feleknas Uca Foundation which focuses of the women and children rights. Uca was also the local spokesperson for representative of Terre des Femmes. Until July 2014, Feleknas Uca lived in Celle until she relocated to Diyarbakir in Turkey. ===In the European Parliament=== In 1999, aged 22, she was elected to the European Parliament fifth of six places on the Party of Democratic Socialism national list. In the 5th European Parliament (1999‚Äì2004), she sat on the Parliament's committees on Culture, Education and the Media and Equal Opportunities. She maintained close links with pro-Kurdish groups in Turkey. She was a member of the EU-Turkey joint parliamentary committee. In the PDS' selection of candidates for elections to the 6th European Parliament (2004‚Äì2009), Uca slipped to seventh place on the PDS national list, putting her seat under severe pressure. However, in the elections, she was returned in the last successful place. While serving in the European Parliament, she attracted controversy within Turkey for her pro- Kurdish stances. In 2005, the Democratic People's Party (DEHAP) was investigated by Turkish police for a speech given by Uca in the Kurdish language in which she called for the decrease of the electoral threshold from 10%, declare a general amnesty and suspend all military actions. In 2009, Uca left the European Parliament. In 2012, she was detained in Turkey's Istanbul Airport for attempting to take a large number of B-1 vitamins to Kurdish prisoners in Turkish prisons and was deported to Germany. ===In Turkey=== In July 2014, Uca resettled in Diyarbakƒ±r, the largest Kurdish populated city in Turkey. On 7 April 2015, Uca was nominated by the HDP to their electoral list for the upcoming parliamentary election as one of a number of Yazidis running for office. In the general elections on 7 June 2015 and 1 November 2015 she was elected to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. Turkish press reports write that she is the first ever Yazidi member of the Assembly along with Ali Atalan. In 2017 she was prosecuted for spreading terror propaganda She got re- elected in the Parliamentary Elections on 24 June 2018. She is a member of the EU-Turkey partner delegation for Turkey. == See also == *Yazidis in Turkey ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:People from Celle Category:The Left (Germany) MEPs Category:Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey) politicians Category:German Yazidis Category:Kurdish women Category:German politicians of Turkish descent Category:MEPs for Germany 1999‚Äì2004 Category:MEPs for Germany 2004‚Äì2009 Category:20th-century women MEPs for Germany Category:21st-century women MEPs for Germany Category:Members of the 25th Parliament of Turkey Category:Deputies of Diyarbakƒ±r Category:Turkish Yazidis Category:Members of the 26th Parliament of Turkey Category:Members of the 27th Parliament of Turkey Category:Turkish women in politics ","title":"Feleknas Uca"},{"id":"833306","text":"Lef√®vre d‚Äô√âtaples Jacques Lef√®vre d'√âtaples (Latinized as Jacobus Faber Stapulensis; c. 1455 ‚Äì c. 1536) was a French theologian and a leading figure in French humanism. He was a precursor of the Protestant movement in France. The \\"d'√âtaples\\" was not part of his name as such, but used to distinguish him from Jacques Lef√®vre of Deventer, a less significant contemporary, a friend and correspondent of Erasmus. Both are also sometimes called by the German version of their name, Jacob/Jakob Faber. He himself had a sometimes tense relationship with Erasmus, whose work on Biblical translation and in theology closely paralleled his own.Chapter 1, p. 19 ff, of Lindberg, Carter. The Reformation theologians: an introduction to theology in the early modern period, Blackwell Publishing, 2002, , , analyses their relationship at length Although he anticipated some ideas that were important to the Protestant Reformation, Lef√®vre remained a Roman Catholic throughout his life, and sought to reform the Church without separating from it. Several of his books were condemned as heretical, and he spent some time in exile. He was, however, a favorite of the King of France, Francis I, and enjoyed his protection. ==Life== He was born of humble parents at √âtaples, Picardy. He appears later to have been possessed of considerable means. He had already been ordained a priest when he entered the University of Paris for higher education. Hermonymus of Sparta was his master in Greek. He visited Italy before 1486, for he heard the lectures of John Argyropoulos, who died in that year; he formed a friendship with Paulus Aemilius of Verona. In 1492 he again travelled in Italy, studying in Florence, Rome and Venice, making himself familiar with the writings of Aristotle, though greatly influenced by the Platonic philosophy. Returning to the University of Paris, he became a professor in the Coll√®ge du Cardinal Lemoine. Among his famous pupils were Fran√ßois Vatable, Charles de Bovelles, and Guillaume Farel; his connection with the last drew him closer to the Calvinistic side of the movement of reform. Farel joined Lef√®vre at Meaux to help in the training of preachers, before Farel left for Switzerland where he was one of the founders of the Reformed churches. In 1507 he took up his residence in the Benedictine Abbey of St Germain des Pr√©s, near Paris; this was due to his connexion with the family of Bri√ßonnet (one of whom was the superior), especially with Guillaume Bri√ßonnet, cardinal bishop of Saint-Malo, father of Guillaume Bri√ßonnet, the later bishop of Meaux. He now began to give himself to Biblical studies, the first-fruit of which was his Quintuplex Psalterium: Gallicum, Romanum, Hebraicum, Vetus, Conciliatum (1509); the Conciliatum was his own version. This was followed by S. Pauli Epistolae xiv. ex vulgata editione, adjecta intelligentia ex Graeco cum commentariis (1512), a work of great independence and judgment. His De Maria Magdalena et triduo Christi disceptatio (1517), which argued that Mary the sister of Lazarus, Mary Magdalene and the penitent woman who anointed Christ's feet were different people, provoked violent controversy and was condemned by the Sorbonne (1521) and Saint John Fisher. He had left Paris during the whole of 1520, and, removing to Meaux, was appointed (1 May, 1523) vicar-general to Bishop Bri√ßonnet, and published his French version of the New Testament (1523). This (contemporary with Luther's German version) has been the basis of all subsequent translations into French. From this, in the same year, he extracted the versions of the Gospels and Epistles \\"a l'usage du diocese de Meaux\\". The prefaces and notes to both these expressed the view that Holy Scripture is the only rule of doctrine, and that justification is by faith alone. He incurred much hostility, but was protected by Francis I and his intellectual sister Marguerite d'Angoul√™me. After Francis was taken captive at the battle of Pavia (25 February, 1525), Lef√®vre was condemned and his works suppressed by commission of the parlement; these measures were quashed on the return of Francis some months later. He issued Le Psautier de David (1525), and was appointed royal librarian at Blois (1526); his version of the Pentateuch appeared two years later. His complete version of the Bible (1530), on the basis of Jerome's Vulgate, took the same place as his version of the New Testament. The publication and its revised edition based on the Hebrew and the Greek texts were printed by Merten de Keyser in Antwerp in 1534.Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh√°sz, Guido Latr√© (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Turnhout: Brepols, 2002, , pp. 130-135. Marguerite (now queen of Navarre) led him to take refuge (1531) in N√©rac from persecution. He is said to have been visited (1533) by John Calvin on his flight from France. He died c. 1536 in N√©rac. ==Works== ;Aristotelian works (selected) * Paraphrases of the Whole of Aristotle's Natural Philosophy [Johannes Higman:] Parisii, 1492Begin.

He completed a translation of the Old Testament in 1528, and was famous for his French translation of the Psalms and the Pauline epistles, which he finished early in his career. His completed translation of the entire Christian Bible, published in 1530, was the first in the French language. * Psalterium quintuplex ; gallicum, romanum, hebraicum, v√™tus, conciliatum, 1509 and 1515, published by Henri Estienne, fol. with footnotes * Commentaires sur saint Paul, avec une nouvelle traduction latine, Paris, 1512 and 1531. This work, in which one notices the lack of progress which had been made in criticism, was criticised by Erasmus for the grammatical section, and by Beda for the theological section, however this did not prevent it from being valued and studied * Commentaires sur les √âvangiles, Meaux, 1525; his doctrine appears here to be very orthodox on the points disputed by the innovators, although the syndic Beda reproached him for errors in this respect *Commentaires sur les √©pitres canoniques, Meaux, 1525; all his commentaries on the New Testament were put on the Index by the Roman inquisitors, under Pope Clement VIII. He distanced himself from ancient barbarism *Traduction fran√ßaise du Nouveau Testament, Paris, Colines, 1523, 5 vols. 8vo, anonymous extremely rare, particularly the last volume. The translation was made from the Vulgate, because he intended it for the use of the faithful. It appeared again in his complete version of the Bible, Antwerp, fol.; later editions 1529 and 1532, 4 vol. 4to.; 1528, 4 vol. 8vo. The edition revised by the doctors of Louvain is the most correct and also the rarest because it was suppressed as was the edition of 1511. It is remarkable that while the Cordeliers of Meaux attacked Lef√®vre because of his translations, those of Antwerp approved it in 1528, for printing and for sale. It is true that they did not have in their edition l'√âpitre exhortatoire, which principally displeased the doctors of Paris * Exhortations en fran√ßais sur les √©vangiles et les √©pitres des dimanches, Meaux, 1525, condemned by the Parlement ;Music theory * Musica libris demonstrata quattuor, published together with Nemorarius, Arithmetica decem libris demonstrata and Boethius, De Arithmetica, Paris: Johannes Higman and Wolfgang Hopyl, 22 July 1496Lesure Volume 1 p.492 Full text of 1551 edition ;Other works * Arithmetica decem libris demonstrata, the De elementis arithmetice artis of Jordanus Nemorarius (Jordanus de Nemore) with commentary and demonstrations, published together with Musica libris demonstrata quattuor and Boethius, De Arithmetica, Paris: Johannes Higman and Wolfgang Hopyl, 22 July 1496 * Traduction latine des livres de la foi orthodoxe de saint Jean de Damas ; the first translation of this work * De Maria Magdalena, 1517, followed in 1519 by another entitled: De tribus et unica Magdalena.

Dorst lived and worked in Munich. His farces, parables, one-act- plays and adaptations were inspired by the theatre of the absurd and the works of Ionesco, Giraudoux and Beckett. His monumental drama Merlin oder das w√ºste Land, which was premiered in 1981 in D√ºsseldorf, has been compared to Goethe's Faust. Some critics see it as the first major drama of the 1980s. In his tribute to Tankred Dorst on the occasion of the conferment of the Georg B√ºchner Prize in 1990, Georg Hensel remarked that Dorst's plays all have a direct connection to the present: \\"For 30 years Dorst's plays have responded to the great transformations. He has always been a companion to the times.\\" Dorst first directed the Ring of the Nibelung in Bayreuth in 2006. ==Biography== Tankred Dorst was born in Oberlind near Sonneberg, Thuringia. Conscripted into the German army as a pupil at the age of 17, he was soon captured and incarcerated as a prisoner of war. Until 1947 he remained in British and American hands. By the time he was released from war captivity, his birthplace had become part of the Soviet sector of Germany. He met his family in West Germany and completed his schooling. In 1950 he began studying German literature, art history and theatre in Bamberg and Munich. Through the 1950s he wrote his first plays for the marionette theatre Das Kleine Spiel, (some together with composer Wilhelm Killmayer). After breaking off his studies, he worked in various capacities in theatre, film, radio and publishing houses. His first major plays were performed in 1960 in L√ºbeck, Mannheim and Heidelberg. Since then, his plays have been performed in the whole world. Dorst's work has been recognized with many prizes and distinctions, including the Gerhart Hauptmann Prize (1964), Prize of the City of Florence (1970), Literature Prize of the Bayerische Akademie der K√ºnste (1983), M√ºlheimer Dramatikerpreis (1989), Georg B√ºchner Prize (1990), E.T.A. Hoffmann Prize (1996) and the city of Zurich's Max Frisch Prize (1998). In 2006, he was awarded the Samuel Bogumil Linde Prize. He was awarded the European Prize for Literature (2008). Dorst held visiting professorships at universities in Germany, Australia and New Zealand.

He was born at Cranbrook, Kent, and was baptized on 8 April 1582. ==Life== He was admitted a scholar of Eton, and in 1600 entered King's College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. in 1604, and M.A. in 1608, and was one of the contributors to Sorrow's Joy (1603). His pastoral drama, Sicelides, or Piscatory was written (1614) for performance before James I, but only produced after the king's departure at King's College. He had been ordained priest and before 1611 became a fellow of his college, but he left Cambridge before 1616, apparently because certain emoluments were refused him. He became chaplain to Sir Henry Willoughby, who presented him in 1621 to the rectory of Hilgay, Norfolk, where he married and spent the rest of his life. ==Works== Phineas Fletcher wrote throughout his life. At his death he left behind a body of literature larger than that of his Renaissance contemporaries: in fact, his work rivals in size the canons of Spenser and Milton. The collected works of Phineas Fletcher include three volumes of religious prose, an epic, an epyllion, a drama, several medium-length verse narratives, pastoral eclogues, verse epistles, epithalamia, hymns, psalms, translations, various songs, occasional pieces, lyrics, and devotional poems. In scope, variety, and quality, his writings are second to none of that age. In 1627 he published Locustae, vel Pietas Jesuitica (The Locusts or Apollyonists), two parallel poems in Latin and English furiously attacking the Jesuits. Grosart saw in this work one of the sources of Milton's conception of Satan. Next year appeared an erotic poem, Brittain's Ida, with Edmund Spenser's name on the title page. It is certainly not by Spenser, and is printed by Grosart with the works of Phineas Fletcher. Sicelides was printed in 1631. In 1632 appeared two theological prose treatises, The Way to Blessedness and Joy in Tribulation, and in 1633 his magnum opus, The Purple Island. The book was dedicated to his friend Edward Benlowes, and included his Piscatorie Eclogues and other Poetical Miscellanies. He died in 1650 in Hilgay, Norfolk, and his will was proved by his widow on 13 December that year. The Purple Island, or the Isle of Man, is a poem in twelve cantos describing in cumbrous allegory the physiological structure of the human body and the mind of man. The intellectual qualities are personified, while the veins are rivers, the bones the mountains of the island, the whole analogy being worked out with great ingenuity. The manner of Spenser is preserved throughout, but Fletcher never lost sight of his moral aim to lose himself in digressions like those of the Faerie Queene. What he gains in unity of design, however, he more than loses in human interest and action. The chief charm of the poem lies in its descriptions of rural scenery. The Piscatory Eclogues are pastorals, the characters of which are represented as fisher boys on the banks of the Cam, and are interesting for the light they cast on the biography of the poet himself (Thyrsil) and his father (Thelgon). > ... the influence of Phineas Fletcher and his brother Giles is far greater > than has generally been realized.

A complete edition of Phineas Fletcher's works (4 vols.) was privately printed by A. B. Grosart (Fuller Worthies Library, 1869). The standard work available in print remains F.S.

He first became famous in Germany for publishing the \\"Kalender f√ºr Sternfreunde\\" from 1948 until 1988, an annual calendar of astronomical events. The minor planet 3181 Ahnert is named in his honor. Ahnert was born in Chemnitz, Kingdom of Saxony. During the First World War he served as an ordinary German field-soldier. After the war he became a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and was a committed opponent of the rise of militarism and right wing revanchism in Germany. Between 1919 and 1933 he worked as an elementary school teacher. In addition to this he was an ambitious amateur astronomer and in 1923 his first article was published in the scientific journal Astronomische Nachrichten (AN 219 (1923), 165-170). He reported about long period variables he had observed from his private observatory. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor in 1933 the Nazi regime removed Paul Ahnert from his post. He was arrested and imprisoned for a few months in a concentration camp. Released from imprisonment he had to earn his living by doing occasional jobs. But in 1938 he had a lucky escape for his real profession. Cuno Hoffmeister invited him to the Sonneberg Observatory, where he worked during the Second World War as a computer (performing calculations) and assistant observer in a long term sky patrol and field survey program. After the war he met the astronomer Eva Rohlfs at Sonneberg Observatory and married her in 1952. His second marriage lasted only two years, because Eva died in 1954 in age of 41. During the 1950s Paul Ahnert advanced from an assistant observer to an astronomer with international reputation, who made important observations of variable stars and solar activity. He received an honorary doctor in astrophysics at the University of Jena in 1957. His name became well known in Germany, when he started to edit the \\"Kalender f√ºr Sternfreunde\\", an annual calendar of astronomical events. The first volume was printed in 1949. Paul Ahnert edited it for over 40 years until he retired from this task, aged 90, and passed the work to younger hands. Paul Ahnert died in age of 91 in Sonneberg (Free State Thuringia). == Bibliography == * Die ver√§nderlichen Sterne der n√∂rdlichen Milchstra√üe. Part 4. (with C.

Nf3 d6 The opening is named after the famous 18th-century player Fran√ßois- Andr√© Danican Philidor, who advocated it as an alternative to the common 2...Nc6. His original idea was to challenge White's centre by the pawn thrust ...f7‚Äìf5. Today, the Philidor is known as a solid but passive choice for Black, and is seldom seen in top-level play except as an alternative to the heavily analysed openings that can ensue after the normal 2...Nc6. It is considered a good opening for amateur players who seek a defensive strategy that is simpler and easier to understand than the complex positions that result from an opening such as the French Defence. The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings code for Philidor Defence is C41. ==Use== The Philidor occurred in one of the most famous games ever played, \\"The Opera Game\\" played in 1858 between the American chess master Paul Morphy and two strong amateurs, the German noble Duke Karl of Brunswick and the French aristocrat Count Isouard. The game continued 3.d4 Bg4, a deviation from modern standard lines. The Philidor Defence declined in popularity as became more developed, and it had almost completely vanished from top-tier chess by World War I. , there are no top players who employ the Philidor with any regularity, although √âtienne Bacrot and Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu have occasionally experimented with it. Its popularity in master play has increased slightly over the last 20 years, however.The Philidor at Chessgames.com ==Main line: 3.d4 == With 3.d4 White immediately challenges Black in the . Black has several options. ===3...exd4=== The most common Black response is 3...exd4 which relieves the central tension, although it gives up the centre. After 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3, Black normally continues ...Be7 and ...0-0 (the Antoshin Variation) and achieves a strong defensive position. A sample line is: 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Be7 6. Bc4 0-0 7. 0-0 c5, and the position is equal. In this line Black can also fianchetto his bishop to g7, although this is uncommon. Bent Larsen tried this in a few games, including a draw against Mikhail Tal in 1969. Instead of 4. Nxd4, White can play 4. Qxd4, as Paul Morphy favoured, intending 4... Nc6 5. Bb5 Bd7 6. Bxc6 Bxc6 7. Nc3 Nf6 8. Bg5 followed by 0-0-0. This line was played in many 19th-century games. ===Hanham Variation=== The other main option for Black is to maintain the central tension and adopt a setup with ...Nd7, ...Be7, and ...c6. This plan is named the Hanham Variation' (after the American chess master James Moore Hanham) and was favoured by Aron Nimzowitsch. A common line is: 3... Nf6 4. Nc3 Nbd7 5. Bc4 Be7 6. 0-0 (6.Ng5 is an interesting alternative: after 6...0-0 7.Bxf7+ Rxf7 8.Ne6 Qe8 9.Nxc7 Qd8 10.Nxa8, White is up, but Black can develop a strong initiative after, for example, 10...b5 11.Nxb5 Qa5+) 6... 0-0 7. a4 (to prevent ...b5) ' (see diagram). Grandmaster Larry Kaufman notes that the Hanham Variation aims to maintain Black's pawn on e5, analogously to closed lines of the Ruy Lopez, and opines that \\"it would be quite popular and on a par with the major defences to 1.e4, except for the annoying detail that Black can't actually reach the Hanham position by force.\\"Kaufman 2004, p. 65. As an alternative to 4.Nc3 in response to Black's 3...Nf6, according to both Kaufman and Grandmaster Christian Bauer, White retains some advantage with: 4. dxe5! Nxe4 5. Qd5! (the Rellstab Variation;Hooper & Whyld 1996, p. 334. Rellstab Variation. 5.Nbd2 is the Sokolsky VariationHooper & Whyld 1996, p. 378. Sokolsky Variation.) 5... Nc5 6. Bg5 Be7 Qxd6 8. Nc3.Kaufman 2004, p. 69.Bauer 2006, p. 32. Alternative move order Black sometimes tries 3... Nd7 intending 4.Nc3 Ngf6, reaching the Hanham Variation. But then 4. Bc4! is awkward for Black to meet, since 4...Ngf6 loses to 5.Ng5, and 4...Be7 loses a pawn to 5.dxe5 Nxe5 (5...dxe5 6.Qd5! wins) 6.Nxe5 dxe5 7.Qh5!Bauer 2006, p. 16. So 4... c6 is best for Black, but leaves White with the advantage of the bishop pair after 5. 0-0 Be7 6. dxe5 dxe5 (6...Nxe5 loses a pawn to 7.Nxe5 dxe5 8.Qh5) 7. Ng5! Bxg5 8. Qh5! Qe7 and now 9.Bxg5 or 9.Qxg5.Bauer 2006, pp. 17‚Äì22. Black experiments to reach the Hanham Variation In recent years, Black has experimented with other move orders in an attempt to reach the Hanham Variation while avoiding 3...Nf6 4.dxe5! and 3...Nd7 4.Bc4! * One such line is 1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 intending 4.Nf3 e5. White can deviate, however, with 4.f4!?Bauer 2006, p. 179.Kaufman 2004, p. 199. or even 4.g4!?Bauer 2006, pp. 197‚Äì206. * Another try is 1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 e5 which transposes to the Hanham after 4.Nf3 Nbd7, but White can instead try to gain a small advantage with 4. dxe5 (Kaufman opines that 4.Nge2 is \\"also promising\\") 4... dxe5 5. Qxd8+ Kxd8 6. Bc4. After 4.dxe5, Bauer concludes that \\"White stands a trifle better\\" but that \\"provided he plays accurately, Black doesn't have much to fear following 6.Bc4, by choosing any of the three valid replies, 6...Ke8, 6...Bb4, or 6...Be6. Then 7.Bxe6 fxe6 his position remains a hard nut to crack.\\"Bauer 2006, p. 174. ===Philidor Countergambit: 3...f5 === A more aggressive approach for Black after 3.d4 is 3...f5 (see diagram), Philidor's original intention and recommendation. In the 19th century, 3...f5 was also played by Paul Morphy. The move can lead to more than the other lines, but is often considered dubious.Kaufman 2004, p. 22.Bauer 2006, pp. 22‚Äì32. Others maintain that 3...f5 is a valid idea. Grandmaster Tony Kosten considers the move respectable in his monograph on the opening.Tony Kosten, Winning with the Philidor, Batsford Chess, 1992. The move was also played by David Bronstein and by Teimour Radjabov. After 3...f5 White has several ways to proceed: * 4. Nc3 (the Zukertort VariationHooper & Whyld 1996, p. 460.

In baseball, a foul ball is a batted ball that: * Settles on foul territory between home and first base or between home and third base, or * Bounds past first or third base on or over foul territory, or * First falls on foul territory beyond first or third base, or * While on or over foul territory, touches the person of an umpire or player, or any object foreign to the natural ground. By interpretation, a batted ball that touches a batter while in his batter's box is foul regardless of whether it is over foul territory. A foul fly shall be judged according to the relative position of the ball and the foul line, including the foul pole, and not as to whether the fielder is on foul or fair territory at the time he touches the ball. If the foul ball gets caught, then it would be judged as an out. Additionally, ballpark ground rules may specify that batted balls striking certain fixed objects such as railings, nets, or a roof if present are foul balls. Foul territory or foul ground is defined as that part of the playing field outside the first and third base lines extended to the fence and perpendicularly upwards. Note: the foul lines and foul poles are not part of foul territory. In general, when a batted ball is ruled a foul ball, the ball is dead, all runners must return to their time-of-pitch base without liability to be put out, and the batter returns to home plate to continue his turn at bat. A strike is issued for the batter if he had fewer than two strikes. If the batter already has two strikes against him when he hits a foul ball, a strike is not issued unless the ball was bunted to become a foul ball, in which case a third strike is issued and a strikeout recorded for the batter and pitcher. A strike is, however, recorded for the pitcher for every foul ball the batter hits, regardless of the count. If any member of the fielding team catches a foul ball before it touches the ground or lands outside the field perimeter, the batter is out. However, the caught ball is in play and base runners may attempt to advance. A foul ball is different from a foul tip, in which the ball makes contact with the bat, travels directly to the catcher's hands, and is caught. In this case, the ball remains live and a strike is added to the batter's count. If a foul tip is strike three, the batter is out. ==Strategies== Bill Miller gives the hand signal for a foul ball On rare occasions, such as in extra innings or the ninth inning of a tie game when a runner is on third base, with less than two outs, fielders have been known to let long foul flies drop rather than risk losing the game on a sacrifice fly. Sometimes, in that situation, a fielder will not try to catch a ball that is close to the foul line in the hope that the ball will go foul at the last second. In different situations, a foul ball may be considered a positive or negative outcome of a pitch or swing. When there are zero or one strikes, a foul ball counts as a strike, benefiting the pitcher. However, a foul ball may reveal to the batter that he has timed a pitch well and need only make adjustment to the location of his swing on the next such pitch; this is often called a good cut or simply a good swing. Foul balls with two strikes are generally considered positive for the batter, since he thus avoids strike three on a potentially difficult pitch. Also, foul balls with two strikes increase the pitcher's pitch count, adding to his/her fatigue, thus providing some small advantage to the offense. A strategy of swinging on any ball to try to produce additional fouls and prolong an at-bat is often used against strong pitchers to try to drive them from the game sooner (and also the possibility of the pitcher throwing a pitch a hitter can get a hit on); this does, however, have the disadvantage of generating more strikeouts. ==See also== *Baseball Rule, legal doctrine from 1913 court case that generally prevents spectators from holding teams liable for injuries from foul balls ==References== Category:Baseball rules ","title":"Foul ball"},{"id":"833399","text":"In baseball, a fair ball is a batted ball that entitles the batter to attempt to reach first base. By contrast, a foul ball is a batted ball that does not entitle the batter to attempt to reach first base. Whether a batted ball is fair or foul is determined by the location of the ball at the appropriate reference point, as follows: * if the ball leaves the playing field without touching anything, the point where the ball leaves the field; * else, if the ball first lands past first or third base without touching anything, the point where the ball lands; * else, if the ball rolls or bounces past first or third base without touching anything other than the ground, the point where the ball passes the base; * else, if the ball touches anything other than the ground (such as an umpire, a player, or any equipment left on the field) before any of the above happens, the point of such touching; * else (the ball comes to a rest before reaching first or third base), the point where the ball comes to a rest. If the ball is on or above fair territory at the appropriate reference point, it is fair; else it is foul. Fair territory or fair ground is defined as the area of the playing field between the two foul lines, and includes the foul lines themselves and the foul poles. However, certain exceptions exist: * A ball that touches first, second, or third base is always fair. * Under Rule 5.09(a)(7)-(8), if a batted ball touches the batter or his bat while the batter is in the batter's box and not intentionally interfering with the course of the ball, the ball is foul. * A ball that hits the foul pole without first having touched anything else off the bat is fair. * Ground rules may provide whether a ball hitting specific objects (e.g. roof, overhead speaker) is fair or foul. On a fair ball, the batter attempts to reach first base or any subsequent base, runners attempt to advance and fielders try to record outs. A fair ball is considered a live ball until the ball becomes dead by leaving the field or any other method. ==References== Category:Baseball rules ","title":"Fair ball"},{"id":"833410","text":"The Ely Professorship of Divinity was one of the professorships in divinity at the University of Cambridge.

He was a founding member of the first Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and later a probationary member of the Lords Cardinal of the Hellfire Club, where he played an important role in \\"The Dark Phoenix Saga\\". After Wyngarde's death from the Legacy Virus, his three daughters appeared: two possessing his illusion-creating abilities, Mastermind (Martinique Jason) and Lady Mastermind (Regan Wyngarde), and the X-Man Pixie.

After his death, Mastermind appeared in a flashback sequence that revealed that he was paid by the supervillain known as \\"the General\\" to put one of his illusions into the mind of Sentry, making the Sentry \\"...so scared to use his powers, [That] he'll think the world will be attacked by the devil if he does.\\" This would make Mastermind responsible for the creation of the Void itself, the evil counterpart of the Sentry who is actually the manifestation of the inhibitions that Mastermind implanted in the Sentry to prevent him from using his powers.New Avengers #9.

Marvel Comics. ==Powers and abilities== Mastermind's mutant ability is to cast exceptionally powerful realistic psionic illusions. He can psionically cause other people to see, hear, feel, smell, and/or taste things that do not actually exist but only in their heads. He can also cause people to sense things in ways that they would not naturally; for example, he can make himself look and sound like a different person, or look and feel like a wall, or even seem invisible. For this to work, these people have to be within a range of his powers. With artificial aids, Mastermind can cause only one person among many who are present to see his illusions. He is even capable of affecting telepaths as powerful as Professor Xavier and Jean Grey, although to manipulate Dark Phoenix he required an amplifying device called a \\"mind-tap mechanism\\" provided by the White Queen that enabled him to project illusions directly into the entity's mind, so that the entity \\"saw\\" them, and to monitor the entity's thoughts, both over great distances. Emma Frost described his abilities to the Sentry in the New Avengers storyline as something akin to a psionic virus, which he plants in to the mind of the victim and allows to grow and change according to their view and feelings. It would appear that these \\"viruses\\" can continue to function even without his influence, as the illusions placed in to the mind of the Sentry remained after Mastermind's death. Jason Wyngarde was a slight man with matted grey hair. He frequently used his illusory abilities to assume the appearance of a younger, more handsome man. In his favorite disguise, he sported Victorian era style whiskers. ==The Daughters of Mastermind== Mastermind's name and powers still live on through his daughters: Martinique Jason and Regan Wyngarde. Both appear to be stronger than the original Mastermind; Martinique can create citywide illusions that even hypnotize people to believe they are in a whole new era and Regan's lethal illusions can continue even after she has been rendered unconscious. The X-Man Pixie's mother teleports herself to the Wyngarde Mansion, where Regan and Martinique are fighting one another. Pixie's mother claims Pixie is their sister, revealing Jason is her father.X-Men: Pixie Strikes Back #2.

Years later, he joines Forge's Outcasts, a resistance cell traveling under the cover of a theater troupe. He was ultimately killed by the bounty hunter Domino. In the alternate timeline seen in the 2005 storyline \\"House of M\\", Mastermind is mentioned to be a business rival of Tony Stark.House of M: Iron Man #1. Marvel Comics.

He projects illusions of Mephisto, Psyklop, Annihilus, and Zarathos/Ghost Rider. * Mastermind appears in X-Men: The Animated Series episode, The Dark Phoenix Saga parts 1‚Äì3, voiced by Nigel Bennett. He appears as a member of the Inner Circle/Hellfire Club. Wyngarde is also a member of the Mutant Resistance in the alternate reality shown in the first part of the episode \\"One Man's Worth\\". * Mastermind appears in the animated series X-Men: Evolution voiced by Campbell Lane. He appears as an occasional lackey of Magneto and a member of the Acolytes upon being recruited by Magneto. In one episode, he alters the memories of Magneto's daughter Scarlet Witch so that she believes that her father had brought her up when in reality he sent her to an asylum when he found himself unable to cope with her powers. * Mastermind appears in Marvel Anime: X-Men, voiced by Haruhiko J≈ç in the Japanese version and by Travis Willingham in the English version. Here, he is the leader of the Inner Circle (unlike his comic counterpart). At the beginning of the anime, he and his fellow Inner Circle agents, Rat, Marsh and Neuron manipulate Jean Grey into becoming the Phoenix, which later ends with her sacrificing herself to save the world. Also, Mastermind uses his powers of illusion to project an image of Emma Frost for Cyclops to see, to make it look like Emma (who was a member of the Inner Circle in the past before leaving them) had something to do with Jean's death. A month later, Mastermind travels with the rest of the Inner Circle to Honshu, Japan, where he uses his psionic powers to disguise himself as Japanese researcher named Jun Sanada. As Jun, he works for Dr. Yui Sasaki and her lab assistants, Riko Narasaki and Koichi Kaga at the closed Sasaki Academy. But what they don't know is that Mastermind is only working for Yui to get close to her son Takeo, an Omega-Level mutant, who has the ability to warp reality, and Mastermind intends to use Takeo's power to make mutants rule the world. As the months go by, he \\"works\\" on Takeo's mind and continues break it down. At the same time, Mastermind forms a secret alliance with the U-Men and their leader Sublime. But since the U-Men hate mutants and \\"harvest\\" their organs (butcher them to be more precise), he uses his disguise as Jun to keep them from noticing his true self and also learns that Yui has had the U-Men working for her too, in order to create a cure for both Takeo and other mutants. Nine months later, the X-Men are brought back together by Charles Xavier to investigate what's wrong with mutants in Honshu. Mastermind sends Sublime and the other U-Men to destroy the X-Men, but when the U-Men are finally taken of and when Sublime is killed in a self-destruct explosion, Mastermind brings Rat, Marsh and Neuron out of hiding and they engage the X-Men instead. After Yui introduces the X-Men to herself and her staff, Mastermind (as Jun) distances himself from the heroes. Later, when Riko and Koichi transform into hideous monsters caused by Yui's cure (now a virus), they're defeated by the X-Men. After Koichi is defeated, Emma Frost, now a member of the team, notices Mastermind's projection on Jun Sanada and goes after him, at the underground chamber where Takeo is being kept. Mastermind reveals himself to Emma and reveals his plans to her, as well as admitting to framing her for Jean Grey's death. The other X-Men then arrive with Yui, and so do Rat and Marsh. Mastermind and Marsh manage to escape, but Rat is killed by Wolverine and Storm. The X-Men, along with Yui, Riko and Koichi (who have now recovered), then corner Mastermind, where he reveals his plans and what he's been up to as Jun Sanada. Afterwards, Neuron arrives, kills Riko and Koichi, and traps Wolverine and Beast in a cocoon. Mastermind then uses his powers of illusion to make Takeo warp reality in constant pain, while Marsh restrains Cyclops, Storm, Emma, Armor and Yui. After Armor manages to free herself and the other X-Men, Cyclops kills Marsh by using his Optic Blasts to evaporate him. Meanwhile, Wolverine uses his Berserker Rage to kill Neuron. After all this, Mastermind entraps Cyclops in an illusion, which centers around him not killing Jean and allowing mutantkind (and the other X-Men) to die. However, the real Jean's spirit encourages Cyclops to let her go and break free of Mastermind's illusion. The X-Men then prepare to face Mastermind, but he's then killed and crushed to death by an out-of-control Takeo. ===Video games=== * Mastermind appears as a playable character in Lego Marvel Super Heroes, voiced by Travis Willingham.

A foul tip is considered a strike and the ball remains \\"in play\\". A foul tip is not the same as a foul ball, although many people mistakenly use the term to refer to any pitch at which the batter swings and makes slight contact, regardless of whether it is caught by the catcher. However, the rules are very narrow: it is not a foul tip if the ball touches anything else on the way to the catcher's hand or glove or if it is not legally caught and held. Anything else is technically a foul ball, including if the ball is caught after popping up into foul territory. The rules treat a foul tip as equivalent in every respect to a pitch at which the batter swings and misses. * A foul tip is always a strike, regardless of the existing ball-and-strike count. ** A player with two strikes against him is automatically struck out, unless the catcher does not successfully catch the tipped ball, then it is ruled a foul. ** A player with fewer than two strikes against him is not out. * The ball remains alive and runners may advance or be thrown out on the bases. In contrast, a foul ball counts as a strike only if the batter does not already have two strikes against him/her.

Penkovsky is known for informing the United Kingdom about the Soviet emplacement of missiles in Cuba, thus providing both the UK and the United States with the precise knowledge necessary to address rapidly developing military tensions with the Soviet Union. He was the highest-ranking Soviet official to provide intelligence for the UK up until that time, and is one of several individuals credited with altering the course of the Cold War. He was arrested by the Soviets in October 1962, then tried and executed the following year. ==BiographyEarly life and military career=== Penkovsky's father died fighting as an officer in the White Army in the Russian Civil War. Penkovsky graduated from the Kiev Artillery Academy with the rank of lieutenant in 1939. After taking part in the Winter War against Finland and in World War II, he reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel. A GRU officer, in 1955 Penkovsky was appointed military attach√© in Ankara, Turkey. He later worked at the Soviet Committee for Scientific Research. Penkovsky was a personal friend of GRU head Ivan Serov and Soviet marshal Sergei Varentsov.Oleg Gordievsky and Christopher Andrew (1990). KGB: The Inside Story. Hodder & Stoughton. ; cited from Russian edition of 1999, pp. 476-79 ===Overtures to the West=== Penkovsky approached American students on the Moskvoretsky Bridge in Moscow in July 1960 and gave them a package, which was delivered to the Central Intelligence Agency. CIA officers delayed in contacting him because they believed they were under constant surveillance. Penkovsky eventually persuaded the British spy Greville Wynne to arrange a meeting for him with two American and two British intelligence officers during a visit to London in 1961. Wynne became one of his couriers. In his autobiography, Wynne says that he was carefully developed by British intelligence over many years with the specific task of making contact with Penkovsky. The delay in CIA contact proved to be regrettable to the US. However, the British would later share intelligence from Penkovsky with their American allies. For the following eighteen months, Penkovsky supplied a tremendous amount of information to his British Secret Intelligence Service handlers in Moscow, Ruari and Janet Chisholm, and to CIA and SIS contacts during his permitted trips abroad. Most significantly, he provided President John F. Kennedy with the information that the Soviet nuclear arsenal was much smaller than previously thought, that the Soviet fueling systems were not fully operational, and that the Soviet guidance systems were not yet functional. Peter Wright, a former British MI-5 officer, believed that Penkovsky was a fake defection. Wright noted that, unlike Igor Gouzenko and other earlier defectors, Penkovsky did not reveal the names of any Soviet agents in the West but only provided organizational detail, much of which was known already. Some of the documents provided were originals, which Wright thought could not have been easily taken from their sources. Wright scathingly condemned the leadership of British intelligence throughout nearly the whole Cold War period. He reportedly believed that the British/Soviet agents (Philby, Maclean, Burgess, and Blunt) could all have been identified more quickly using the scientific methods which he had proposed. In Wright's view, British intelligence leaders became more paralyzed when Philby and the others defected to the Soviet Union. British intelligence became so fearful of another fiasco that they avoided taking risks. Wright believes that the Soviets were aware of this and planted Penkovsky to buoy up the sagging fortunes of their ineffective‚Äîand therefore highly useful‚Äîcounterparts in British intelligence. In his memoir Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer (1987), written with journalist Paul Greengrass.Spy Catcher, p. 212, Wright said: Wright was more complimentary of the CIA and even of the FBI, whose agents were initially suspicious (and remained suspicious) of Penkovsky. British agent Greville Wynne seems convinced that Penkovsky was genuine and that Wynne's own sacrifices, including 18 months in the Lubyanka Prison, were worthwhile. Former KGB major- general Oleg Kalugin does not mention Penkovsky in his comprehensive memoir about his own career in intelligence against the West. KGB defector Vladimir Sakharov suggests Penkovsky was genuine, saying, \\"I knew about the ongoing KGB reorganization precipitated by Oleg Penkovsky's case and Yuri Nosenko's defection. The party was not satisfied with KGB performance ... I knew many heads in the KGB had rolled again, as they had after Stalin.\\" While the weight of opinion seems to be that Penkovsky was genuine, the debate underscores the difficulty faced by all intelligence agencies of determining information offered from the enemy. In a meeting with Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, the head of Russia's foreign intelligence service, Mikhail Fradkov named Penkovsky as Russia's biggest intelligence failure. ===Role in Cuban Missile Crisis=== Soviet leadership started the deployment of nuclear missiles in the belief that Washington would not detect the Cuban missile sites until it was too late to do anything about them. Penkovsky provided plans and descriptions of the nuclear rocket launch sites on Cuba to the West. This information allowed the West to identify the missile sites from the low-resolution pictures provided by US U-2 spy planes. The documents provided by Penkovsky showed that the Soviet Union was not prepared for war in the area, which emboldened Kennedy to risk the operation in Cuba. Former GRU captain Viktor Suvorov, who defected to the UK in 1978, later wrote in his book on Soviet intelligence, \\"historians will remember with gratitude the name of the GRU Colonel Oleg Penkovsky. Thanks to his priceless information the Cuban crisis was not transformed into a last World War.\\" Penkovsky's activities were revealed by Jack Dunlap, an NSA employee and Soviet double-agent working for the KGB. The top KGB officers had known for more than a year that Penkovsky was a double agent, but they prioritised protecting their source, a highly placed mole in MI6. Jack Dunlap was just another source they had to protect. They worked hard, shadowing British diplomats, to build up a \\"discovery case\\" against Penkovsky so that they could arrest him without throwing suspicion on these moles. Their caution in this matter may have led to the missiles being found out earlier than the Soviets would have preferred. After a West German double agent overheard a remark at Stasi headquarters, paraphrased as \\"I wonder how things are going in Cuba,\\" he passed it on to the CIA.Tennent H. Bagley, Spymaster: Startling Cold War Revelations of a Soviet KGB Chief, Skyhorse Publishing, 2013, Penkovsky was arrested on 22 October 1962. This was prior to President Kennedy's address to the US revealing that U-2 spy plane photographs had confirmed intelligence reports, and that the Soviets were installing medium-range nuclear missiles on Cuba, in what was known as code name Operation Anadyr. President Kennedy was deprived of information from a potentially important intelligence agent who might have lessened the tension during the ensuing 13-day stand-off; such as reporting that Nikita Khrushchev was already looking for ways to defuse the situation.Aleksandr Fursenko and Timothy Naftali, Khrushchev's Cold War, 2006. Such information might have reduced the pressure on Kennedy to launch an invasion of the island. Such an invasion risked Soviet use of Luna class tactical nuclear weapons against U.S. troops. ===Penkovsky's fate=== Penkovsky flanked by Soviet officers in 1963 Penkovsky's American contacts received a letter from Penkovsky notifying that a Moscow dead drop had been loaded. Upon servicing the dead drop, the American handler was arrested, signaling that Penkovsky had been apprehended by Soviet authorities. Alexander Zagvozdin, Chief KGB interrogator for the investigation, stated that Penkovsky had been \\"questioned perhaps a hundred times\\" and that he had been shot and cremated.The Cold War. Prod. Jeremy Isaacs & Pat Mitchell. CNN, 1998. DVD A similar description was later included in Ernest Volkman's popular history book about spies, and Tom Clancy's novel Red Rabbit. But in a 2010 interview, Suvorov denied that the man in the film was Penkovsky and said that he had been shot.–î–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ–π –Ω–∞—à –ù–∏–∫–∏—Ç–∞ –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–µ–≤–∏—á : –î–µ–ª–æ –ü–µ–Ω—å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ (in Russian) Greville Wynne, in his book The Man from Odessa, claimed that Penkovsky committed suicide. Wynne had worked as Penkovsky's contact and courier, and both men were arrested by the Soviets in October 1963. ==Portrayal in popular culture== Penkovsky was portrayed by Christopher Rozycki in the 1985 BBC television serial Wynne and Penkovsky. His spying career was the subject of episode 1 of the 2007 BBC Television docudrama Nuclear Secrets, entitled \\"The Spy from Moscow\\" in which he was portrayed by Mark Bonnar. The programme featured original covert KGB footage showing Penkovsky photographing classified information and meeting with Janet Chisholm, a British MI-6 agent stationed in Moscow. It was broadcast on 15 January 2007. Penkovsky was referred to in three of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan espionage novels: The Hunt for Red October, The Cardinal of the Kremlin, and Red Rabbit. In the Jack Ryan universe, he is described as the agent who recruited Colonel Mikhail Filitov as a CIA agent (code-name CARDINAL), and had urged Filitov to betray him in order to solidify his position as the West's top spy in the Soviet hierarchy. The \\"cremated alive\\" hypothesis appears in several Clancy novels, though Clancy never identified Penkovsky as the executed spy. Penkovsky's fate is also mentioned in the Nelson DeMille spy novel The Charm School. Penkovsky was portrayed by Eduard Bezrodniy in the 2014 Polish thriller Jack Strong, about Ryszard Kukli≈Ñski, another Cold War spy. His character's execution was the opening scene for the movie. Penkovsky was portrayed by Merab Ninidze in the 2020 British film The Courier, in which Benedict Cumberbatch played Greville Wynne. ==See also== *George Kisevalter ==References== ==Further reading== * Oleg Penkovsky, The Penkovskiy Papers: The Russian Who Spied for the West, Doubleday, New York, 1966. :Note: The book was commissioned by the Central Intelligence Agency see .

After concrete solidifies, tendons apply compressive stress to concrete 5\\\\. Prestressed beam without load 6\\\\. Prestressed beam with load Prestressed concrete is a form of concrete used in construction. It is substantially \\"prestressed\\" (compressed) during production, in a manner that strengthens it against tensile forces which will exist when in service. Post-tensioned concreted is \\"structural concrete in which internal stresses have been introduced to reduce potential tensile stresses in the concrete resulting from loads.\\" This compression is produced by the tensioning of high-strength \\"tendons\\" located within or adjacent to the concrete and is done to improve the performance of the concrete in service. Tendons may consist of single wires, multi-wire strands or threaded bars that are most commonly made from high-tensile steels, carbon fiber or aramid fiber. The essence of prestressed concrete is that once the initial compression has been applied, the resulting material has the characteristics of high-strength concrete when subject to any subsequent compression forces and of ductile high-strength steel when subject to tension forces. This can result in improved structural capacity and/or serviceability compared with conventionally reinforced concrete in many situations. In a prestressed concrete member, the internal stresses are introduced in a planned manner so that the stresses resulting from the superimposed loads are counteracted to the desired degree. Prestressed concrete is used in a wide range of building and civil structures where its improved performance can allow for longer spans, reduced structural thicknesses, and material savings compared with simple reinforced concrete. Typical applications include high-rise buildings, residential slabs, foundation systems, bridge and dam structures, silos and tanks, industrial pavements and nuclear containment structures. First used in the late-nineteenth century, prestressed concrete has developed beyond pre- tensioning to include post-tensioning, which occurs after the concrete is cast. Tensioning systems may be classed as either monostrand, where each tendon's strand or wire is stressed individually, or multi-strand, where all strands or wires in a tendon are stressed simultaneously. Tendons may be located either _within_ the concrete volume (internal prestressing) or wholly _outside_ of it (external prestressing). While pre-tensioned concrete uses tendons directly bonded to the concrete, post-tensioned concrete can use either bonded or unbonded tendons. ==Pre-tensioned concrete== Pre-tensioning process Pre-tensioned concrete is a variant of prestressed concrete where the tendons are tensioned _prior_ to the concrete being cast. The concrete bonds to the tendons as it cures, following which the end-anchoring of the tendons is released, and the tendon tension forces are transferred to the concrete as compression by static friction. Pre-tensioned bridge girder in precasting bed, with single-strand tendons exiting through the formwork Pre-tensioning is a common prefabrication technique, where the resulting concrete element is manufactured remotely from the final structure location and transported to site once cured. It requires strong, stable end-anchorage points between which the tendons are stretched. These anchorages form the ends of a \\"casting bed\\" which may be many times the length of the concrete element being fabricated. This allows multiple elements to be constructed end-to-end in the one pre- tensioning operation, allowing significant productivity benefits and economies of scale to be realized. The amount of bond (or adhesion) achievable between the freshly set concrete and the surface of the tendons is critical to the pre-tensioning process, as it determines when the tendon anchorages can be safely released. Higher bond strength in early-age concrete will speed production and allow more economical fabrication. To promote this, pre- tensioned tendons are usually composed of isolated single wires or strands, which provides a greater surface area for bonding than bundled-strand tendons. Pre-tensioned hollow-core plank being placed Unlike those of post-tensioned concrete (see below), the tendons of pre-tensioned concrete elements generally form straight lines between end-anchorages. Where \\"profiled\\" or \\"harped\\" tendons\\"Tendons having one or more deviations from a straight line, either vertically or horizontally, between the ends of the structure\\" are required, one or more intermediate deviators are located between the ends of the tendon to hold the tendon to the desired non-linear alignment during tensioning. Such deviators usually act against substantial forces, and hence require a robust casting-bed foundation system. Straight tendons are typically used in \\"linear\\" precast elements, such as shallow beams, hollow-core planks and slabs; whereas profiled tendons are more commonly found in deeper precast bridge beams and girders. Pre-tensioned concrete is most commonly used for the fabrication of structural beams, floor slabs, hollow-core planks, balconies, lintels, driven piles, water tanks and concrete pipes. ==Post-tensioned concrete== Forces on post-tensioned concrete with profiled (curved) tendon Post-tensioned tendon anchorage; four-piece \\"lock-off\\" wedges are visible holding each strand Post- tensioned concrete is a variant of prestressed concrete where the tendons are tensioned _after_ the surrounding concrete structure has been cast. The tendons are not placed in direct contact with the concrete, but are encapsulated within a protective sleeve or duct which is either cast into the concrete structure or placed adjacent to it. At each end of a tendon is an anchorage assembly firmly fixed to the surrounding concrete. Once the concrete has been cast and set, the tendons are tensioned (\\"stressed\\") by pulling the tendon ends through the anchorages while pressing against the concrete. The large forces required to tension the tendons result in a significant permanent compression being applied to the concrete once the tendon is \\"locked-off\\" at the anchorage. The method of locking the tendon-ends to the anchorage is dependent upon the tendon composition, with the most common systems being \\"button-head\\" anchoring (for wire tendons), split-wedge anchoring (for strand tendons), and threaded anchoring (for bar tendons). Balanced-cantilever bridge under construction. Each added segment is supported by post-tensioned tendons Tendon encapsulation systems are constructed from plastic or galvanised steel materials, and are classified into two main types: those where the tendon element is subsequently bonded to the surrounding concrete by internal grouting of the duct after stressing (bonded post-tensioning); and those where the tendon element is permanently debonded from the surrounding concrete, usually by means of a greased sheath over the tendon strands (unbonded post- tensioning). Casting the tendon ducts/sleeves into the concrete before any tensioning occurs allows them to be readily \\"profiled\\" to any desired shape including incorporating vertical and/or horizontal curvature. When the tendons are tensioned, this profiling results in reaction forces being imparted onto the hardened concrete, and these can be beneficially used to counter any loadings subsequently applied to the structure. ===Bonded post-tensioning=== Multi-strand post-tensioning anchor In bonded post-tensioning, tendons are permanently bonded to the surrounding concrete by the in situ grouting of their encapsulating ducting (after tendon tensioning). This grouting is undertaken for three main purposes: to protect the tendons against corrosion; to permanently \\"lock-in\\" the tendon pre-tension, thereby removing the long- term reliance upon the end-anchorage systems; and to improve certain structural behaviors of the final concrete structure. Bonded post-tensioning characteristically uses tendons each comprising _bundles_ of elements (e.g. strands or wires) placed inside a single tendon duct, with the exception of bars which are mostly used unbundled. This bundling makes for more efficient tendon installation and grouting processes, since each complete tendon requires only one set of end-anchorages and one grouting operation. Ducting is fabricated from a durable and corrosion-resistant material such as plastic (e.g. polyethylene) or galvanised steel, and can be either round or rectangular/oval in cross-section. The tendon sizes used are highly dependent upon the application, ranging from building works typically using between 2 and 6 strands per tendon, to specialized dam works using up to 91 strands per tendon. Fabrication of bonded tendons is generally undertaken on-site, commencing with the fitting of end-anchorages to formwork, placing the tendon ducting to the required curvature profiles, and reeving (or threading) the strands or wires through the ducting. Following concreting and tensioning, the ducts are pressure-grouted and the tendon stressing-ends sealed against corrosion. ===Unbonded post-tensioning=== Unbonded post-tensioning differs from bonded post-tensioning by allowing the tendons permanent freedom of longitudinal movement relative to the concrete. This is most commonly achieved by encasing each individual tendon element within a plastic sheathing filled with a corrosion-inhibiting grease, usually lithium based. Anchorages at each end of the tendon transfer the tensioning force to the concrete, and are required to reliably perform this role for the life of the structure. Unbonded post-tensioning can take the form of: * Individual strand tendons placed directly into the concreted structure (e.g. buildings, ground slabs), or * Bundled strands, individually greased-and-sheathed, forming a single tendon within an encapsulating duct that is placed either within or adjacent to the concrete (e.g. restressable anchors, external post-tensioning) For individual strand tendons, no additional tendon ducting is used and no post-stressing grouting operation is required, unlike for bonded post-tensioning. Permanent corrosion protection of the strands is provided by the combined layers of grease, plastic sheathing, and surrounding concrete. Where strands are bundled to form a single unbonded tendon, an enveloping duct of plastic or galvanised steel is used and its interior free-spaces grouted after stressing. In this way, additional corrosion protection is provided via the grease, plastic sheathing, grout, external sheathing, and surrounding concrete layers. Individually greased-and-sheathed tendons are usually fabricated off-site by an extrusion process. The bare steel strand is fed into a greasing chamber and then passed to an extrusion unit where molten plastic forms a continuous outer coating. Finished strands can be cut-to-length and fitted with \\"dead-end\\" anchor assemblies as required for the project. ===Comparison between bonded and unbonded post-tensioning=== Both bonded and unbonded post-tensioning technologies are widely used around the world, and the choice of system is often dictated by regional preferences, contractor experience, or the availability of alternative systems. Either one is capable of delivering code- compliant, durable structures meeting the structural strength and serviceability requirements of the designer. The benefits that bonded post- tensioning can offer over unbonded systems are: * Reduced reliance on end- anchorage integrity Following tensioning and grouting, bonded tendons are connected to the surrounding concrete along their full length by high-strength grout. Once cured, this grout can transfer the full tendon tension force to the concrete within a very short distance (approximately 1 metre). As a result, any inadvertent severing of the tendon or failure of an end anchorage has only a very localised impact on tendon performance, and almost never results in tendon ejection from the anchorage. * Increased ultimate strength in flexure With bonded post-tensioning, any flexure of the structure is directly resisted by tendon strains at that same location (i.e. no strain re-distribution occurs). This results in significantly higher tensile strains in the tendons than if they were unbonded, allowing their full yield strength to be realised, and producing a higher ultimate load capacity. * Improved crack-control In the presence of concrete cracking, bonded tendons respond similarly to conventional reinforcement (rebar). With the tendons fixed to the concrete at each side of the crack, greater resistance to crack expansion is offered than with unbonded tendons, allowing many design codes to specify reduced reinforcement requirements for bonded post-tensioning. * Improved fire performance The absence of strain redistribution in bonded tendons may limit the impact that any localised overheating has on the overall structure. As a result, bonded structures may display a higher capacity to resist fire conditions than unbonded ones. The benefits that unbonded post-tensioning can offer over bonded systems are: * Ability to be prefabricated Unbonded tendons can be readily prefabricated off-site complete with end- anchorages, facilitating faster installation during construction. Additional lead time may need to be allowed for this fabrication process. * Improved site productivity The elimination of the post-stressing grouting process required in bonded structures improves the site-labour productivity of unbonded post-tensioning. * Improved installation flexibility Unbonded single-strand tendons have greater handling flexibility than bonded ducting during installation, allowing them a greater ability to be deviated around service penetrations or obstructions. * Reduced concrete cover Unbonded tendons may allow some reduction in concrete element thickness, as their smaller size and increased corrosion protection may allow them to be placed closer to the concrete surface. * Simpler replacement and/or adjustment Being permanently isolated from the concrete, unbonded tendons are able to be readily de-stressed, re-stressed and/or replaced should they become damaged or need their force levels to be modified in-service. * Superior overload performance Although having a lower ultimate strength than bonded tendons, unbonded tendons' ability to redistribute strains over their full length can give them superior pre-collapse ductility. In extremes, unbonded tendons can resort to a catenary-type action instead of pure flexure, allowing significantly greater deformation before structural failure. ==Tendon durability and corrosion protection== Long-term durability is an essential requirement for prestressed concrete given its widespread use. Research on the durability performance of in-service prestressed structures has been undertaken since the 1960s, and anti-corrosion technologies for tendon protection have been continually improved since the earliest systems were developed. The durability of prestressed concrete is principally determined by the level of corrosion protection provided to any high-strength steel elements within the prestressing tendons. Also critical is the protection afforded to the end- anchorage assemblies of unbonded tendons or cable-stay systems, as the anchorages of both of these are required to retain the prestressing forces. Failure of any of these components can result in the release of prestressing forces, or the physical rupture of stressing tendons. Modern prestressing systems deliver long-term durability by addressing the following areas: * Tendon grouting (bonded tendons) Bonded tendons consist of bundled strands placed inside ducts located within the surrounding concrete. To ensure full protection to the bundled strands, the ducts must be pressure-filled with a corrosion-inhibiting grout, without leaving any voids, following strand-tensioning. * Tendon coating (unbonded tendons) Unbonded tendons comprise individual strands coated in an anti-corrosion grease or wax, and fitted with a durable plastic-based full-length sleeve or sheath. The sleeving is required to be undamaged over the tendon length, and it must extend fully into the anchorage fittings at each end of the tendon. * Double-layer encapsulation Prestressing tendons requiring permanent monitoring and/or force adjustment, such as stay-cables and re-stressable dam anchors, will typically employ double-layer corrosion protection. Such tendons are composed of individual strands, grease-coated and sleeved, collected into a strand-bundle and placed inside encapsulating polyethylene outer ducting. The remaining void space within the duct is pressure-grouted, providing a multi-layer polythene-grout- plastic-grease protection barrier system for each strand. * Anchorage protection In all post-tensioned installations, protection of the end-anchorages against corrosion is essential, and critically so for unbonded systems. Several durability-related events are listed below: * Ynys-y-Gwas bridge, West Glamorgan, Wales, 1985 A single-span, precast-segmental structure constructed in 1953 with longitudinal and transverse post-tensioning. Corrosion attacked the under- protected tendons where they crossed the in-situ joints between the segments, leading to sudden collapse. * Scheldt River bridge, Melle, Belgium, 1991 A three-span prestressed cantilever structure constructed in the 1950s. Inadequate concrete cover in the side abutments resulted in tie-down cable corrosion, leading to a progressive failure of the main bridge span and the death of one person. * UK Highways Agency, 1992 Following discovery of tendon corrosion in several bridges in England, the Highways Agency issued a moratorium on the construction of new internally grouted post-tensioned bridges and embarked on a 5-year programme of inspections on its existing post-tensioned bridge stock. The moratorium was lifted in 1996. * Pedestrian bridge, Charlotte Motor Speedway, North Carolina, US, 2000 A multi-span steel and concrete structure constructed in 1995. An unauthorised chemical was added to the tendon grout to speed construction, leading to corrosion of the prestressing strands and the sudden collapse of one span, injuring many spectators. * Hammersmith Flyover London, England, 2011 Sixteen-span prestressed structure constructed in 1961. Corrosion from road de-icing salts was detected in some of the prestressing tendons, necessitating initial closure of the road while additional investigations were done. Subsequent repairs and strengthening using external post-tensioning was carried out and completed in 2015. * Petrulla Viaduct, Sicily, Italy, 2014 One span of the viaduct collapsed on 7 July due to corrosion of the post- tensioning tendons. * Genoa bridge collapse, 2018. The Ponte Morandi was a cable-stayed bridge characterised by a prestressed concrete structure for the piers, pylons and deck, very few stays, as few as two per span, and a hybrid system for the stays constructed from steel cables with prestressed concrete shells poured on. The concrete was only prestressed to 10 MPa, resulting in it being prone to cracks and water intrusion, which caused corrosion of the embedded steel. * Churchill Way flyovers, Liverpool, England The flyovers were closed in September 2018 after inspections revealed poor quality concrete, tendon corrosion and signs of structural distress. Demolition is planned for 2019. ==Applications== Prestressed concrete is a highly versatile construction material as a result of it being an almost ideal combination of its two main constituents: high-strength steel, pre-stretched to allow its full strength to be easily realised; and modern concrete, pre- compressed to minimise cracking under tensile forces. Its wide range of application is reflected in its incorporation into the major design codes covering most areas of structural and civil engineering, including buildings, bridges, dams, foundations, pavements, piles, stadiums, silos, and tanks. ===Building structures=== Building structures are typically required to satisfy a broad range of structural, aesthetic and economic requirements. Significant among these include: a minimum number of (intrusive) supporting walls or columns; low structural thickness (depth), allowing space for services, or for additional floors in high-rise construction; fast construction cycles, especially for multi-storey buildings; and a low cost- per-unit-area, to maximise the building owner's return on investment. The prestressing of concrete allows \\"load-balancing\\" forces to be introduced into the structure to counter in-service loadings. This provides many benefits to building structures: * Longer spans for the same structural depth Load balancing results in lower in-service deflections, which allows spans to be increased (and the number of supports reduced) without adding to structural depth. * Reduced structural thickness For a given span, lower in-service deflections allows thinner structural sections to be used, in turn resulting in lower floor-to-floor heights, or more room for building services. * Faster stripping time Typically, prestressed concrete building elements are fully stressed and self- supporting within five days. At this point they can have their formwork stripped and re-deployed to the next section of the building, accelerating construction \\"cycle-times\\". * Reduced material costs The combination of reduced structural thickness, reduced conventional reinforcement quantities, and fast construction often results in prestressed concrete showing significant cost benefits in building structures compared to alternative structural materials. Some notable building structures constructed from prestressed concrete include: Sydney Opera House and World Tower, Sydney; St George Wharf Tower, London; CN Tower, Toronto; Kai Tak Cruise Terminal and International Commerce Centre, Hong Kong; Ocean Heights 2, Dubai; Eureka Tower, Melbourne; Torre Espacio, Madrid; Guoco Tower (Tanjong Pagar Centre), Singapore; Zagreb International Airport, Croatia; and Capital Gate, Abu Dhabi UAE.

When investigated in the 1940s for use on heavy-duty bridges, the advantages of this type of bridge over more traditional designs was that it is quicker to install, more economical and longer-lasting with the bridge being less lively. One of the first bridges built in this way is the Adam Viaduct, a railway bridge constructed 1946 in the UK. By the 1960s, prestressed concrete largely superseded reinforced concrete bridges in the UK, with box girders being the dominant form. In short-span bridges of around , prestressing is commonly employed in the form of precast pre-tensioned girders or planks. Medium-length structures of around , typically use precast- segmental, in-situ balanced-cantilever and incrementally-launched designs. For the longest bridges, prestressed concrete deck structures often form an integral part of cable-stayed designs. Dams Concrete dams have used prestressing to counter uplift and increase their overall stability since the mid-1930s. Prestressing is also frequently retro-fitted as part of dam remediation works, such as for structural strengthening, or when raising crest or spillway heights. Most commonly, dam prestressing takes the form of post- tensioned anchors drilled into the dam's concrete structure and/or the underlying rock strata. Such anchors typically comprise tendons of high- tensile bundled steel strands or individual threaded bars. Tendons are grouted to the concrete or rock at their far (internal) end, and have a significant \\"de-bonded\\" free-length at their external end which allows the tendon to stretch during tensioning. Tendons may be full-length bonded to the surrounding concrete or rock once tensioned, or (more commonly) have strands permanently encapsulated in corrosion-inhibiting grease over the free-length to permit long-term load monitoring and re-stressability. Silos and tanks Circular storage structures such as silos and tanks can use prestressing forces to directly resist the outward pressures generated by stored liquids or bulk-solids. Horizontally curved tendons are installed within the concrete wall to form a series of hoops, spaced vertically up the structure. When tensioned, these tendons exert both axial (compressive) and radial (inward) forces onto the structure, which can directly oppose the subsequent storage loadings. If the magnitude of the prestress is designed to always exceed the tensile stresses produced by the loadings, a permanent residual compression will exist in the wall concrete, assisting in maintaining a watertight crack-free structure. Nuclear and blast-containment structures Prestressed concrete has been established as a reliable construction material for high-pressure containment structures such as nuclear reactor vessels and containment buildings, and petrochemical tank blast- containment walls. Using prestressing to place such structures into an initial state of bi-axial or tri-axial compression increases their resistance to concrete cracking and leakage, while providing a proof-loaded, redundant and monitorable pressure-containment system. Nuclear reactor and containment vessels will commonly employ separate sets of post-tensioned tendons curved horizontally or vertically to completely envelop the reactor core. Blast containment walls, such as for liquid natural gas (LNG) tanks, will normally utilise layers of horizontally-curved hoop tendons for containment in combination with vertically looped tendons for axial wall prestressing. Hardstands and pavements Heavily loaded concrete ground-slabs and pavements can be sensitive to cracking and subsequent traffic-driven deterioration. As a result, prestressed concrete is regularly used in such structures as its pre-compression provides the concrete with the ability to resist the crack-inducing tensile stresses generated by in-service loading. This crack-resistance also allows individual slab sections to be constructed in larger pours than for conventionally reinforced concrete, resulting in wider joint spacings, reduced jointing costs and less long-term joint maintenance issues. Initial works have also been successfully conducted on the use of precast prestressed concrete for road pavements, where the speed and quality of the construction has been noted as being beneficial for this technique. Some notable civil structures constructed using prestressed concrete include: Gateway Bridge, Brisbane Australia; Incheon Bridge, South Korea; Roseires Dam, Sudan; Wanapum Dam, Washington, US; LNG tanks, South Hook, Wales; Cement silos, Brevik Norway; Autobahn A73 bridge, Itz Valley, Germany; Ostankino Tower, Moscow, Russia; CN Tower, Toronto, Canada; and Ringhals nuclear reactor, Videbergshamn Sweden.

In the United States, such organizations include the Post-Tensioning Institute (PTI) and the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI).Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute Similar bodies include the Canadian Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (CPCI),Canadian Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute the UK's Post-Tensioning Association,Post-Tensioning Association the Post Tensioning Institute of AustraliaPost Tensioning Institute of Australia and the South African Post Tensioning Association.South African Post Tensioning Association Europe has similar country-based associations and institutions. It is important to note that these organizations are not the authorities of building codes or standards, but rather exist to promote the understanding and development of prestressed concrete design, codes and best practices. Rules and requirements for the detailing of reinforcement and prestressing tendons are specified by individual national codes and standards such as: *European Standard EN 1992-2:2005 ‚Äì Eurocode 2: Design of Concrete Structures; * US Standard ACI318: Building Code Requirements for Reinforced Concrete; and * Australian Standard AS 3600-2009: Concrete Structures. ==See also== ==References== ==External links== * The story of prestressed concrete from 1930 to 1945: A step towards the European Union *Guidelines for Sampling, Assessing, and Restoring Defective Grout in Prestressed Concrete Bridge Post- Tensioning Ducts Federal Highway Administration * Historical Patents and the Evolution of Twentieth Century Architectural Construction with Reinforced and Pre-stressed Concrete Category:Building materials Category:Concrete buildings and structures Category:Reinforced concrete Category:Structural engineering fr:B√©ton#B√©ton pr√©contraint sv:Armerad betong#Sp√§nnarmerad betong ","title":"Prestressed concrete"},{"id":"833502","text":"King of New York is a 1990 American neo-noir crime thriller film starring Christopher Walken, Laurence Fishburne, David Caruso, Wesley Snipes, Victor Argo, and Giancarlo Esposito. It was directed by independent filmmaker Abel Ferrara and written by Nicholas St. John. ==Plot== Frank White, a drug lord, is riding into New York City in a limousine after being released from Rikers Island. Emilio El Zapa, a Colombian drug dealer, is shot dead and the killers leave a newspaper headline announcing Frank's release. Zapa's partner, King Tito, is in a hotel room with Jimmy Jump, who is Frank‚Äôs trigger happy right hand man and Test Tube, who are negotiating the purchase of cocaine. Jimmy and Test Tube shoot Tito and his bodyguards and steal the cocaine. Later, in a suite at the Plaza Hotel, Frank is greeted by Jimmy, Test Tube and other members of his gang, who welcome him home. Frank leaves to meet two of his lawyers, Joey Dalesio and Jennifer, for dinner. Frank expresses his desire to be Mayor of New York City and asks Dalesio to set up a meeting with Mafia boss Arty Clay. He and Jennifer leave to take a ride on the subway where they embrace passionately and grope each other. Confronted by muggers, Frank first brandishes his gun then gives them a wad of money, telling them to ask for him at the Plaza if they want work. Dalesio goes to Little Italy, to set up a meeting with Clay but the Mafia don urinates on Dalesio's shoes and tells him it is a message for his boss. Frank, Jump and other members of the gang go to Clay's social club, where Frank tells Clay that he wants a percentage of all of Clay's profits. When Clay insults him, Frank shoots the Mafioso. As he leaves, Frank tells Clay's men that they can all find employment at the Plaza. The next night, Frank is confronted by Detectives Bishop, Gilley and Flanigan of the New York Police Department (NYPD) narcotics squad. They drive him to an empty lot where they show him the body of El Zapa in the trunk. When Frank refuses to confess, Gilley and Flanigan beat him and leave him in the lot. Frank sends Dalesio to Chinatown to make contact with Triad leader Larry Wong, who has $3 million worth of cocaine. Frank tells him it will bring $15 million when he sells it on the street. Larry demands $3 million up front and another $500,000 after the drugs are sold. Frank counters that the two should team up, then split the profits evenly. Larry turns him down and demands that Frank decide immediately whether he wants to buy the drugs. Frank declines. Jimmy Jump and several of Frank's lieutenants are arrested by Gilley and Flanigan, who reveal that one of Tito's bodyguards is alive and willing to testify. When Frank learns of his men's arrest, he orders his lawyers to arrange their release. They head to Chinatown, where they kill Larry and his gang and take the cocaine. Gilley, Flanigan and other officers pose as drug dealers and bribe Dalesio into leading them to the nightclub where Frank and his men are partying. They burst in shooting, killing several members of Frank's gang. Fleeing over the Queensboro Bridge, Frank and Jump trade shots with the police, killing all but Gilley and Flanigan. After evading their pursuers, the two men split up. Sneaking up on Flanigan, Jump shoots him in the chest, puncturing his vest. Seeing this, Gilley shoots Jump several times in the chest and stomach. Gilley tries CPR on his partner to no avail and he finishes Jump off with a gunshot to the head. A few days later at Flanigan's funeral, Frank kills Gilley. After his men kill Dalesio, Frank goes to Bishop's apartment, telling him that he has placed a $250,000 bounty on every detective involved in the case. Holding Bishop at gunpoint, Frank explains that he killed Tito, Larry, Arty Clay and Zapa because he disapproved of their involvement in human trafficking and child prostitution. Frank forces Bishop to handcuff himself to a chair. As Frank heads to the subway, Bishop uses a hidden gun to free himself. Bishop corners Frank in a subway car. Frank shoots Bishop, killing him but the policeman is able to fire a last shot. Frank walks slowly out of the subway station in Times Square. He gets in a taxi and tells the driver to just drive but the taxi is caught in a traffic jam caused by the police search for Frank. Sitting in the back seat of the taxi, Frank puts his hand over his wound and watches the police surround his car. As police officers close in on the taxi, Frank closes his eyes and goes limp. ==Cast== * Christopher Walken as Frank White * Larry Fishburne as Jimmy Jump * David Caruso as Dennis Gilley * Victor Argo as Roy Bishop * Janet Julian as Jennifer * Wesley Snipes as Thomas Flanigan * Steve Buscemi as Test Tube * Paul Calder√≥n as Joey Dalesio * Giancarlo Esposito as Lance * Theresa Randle as Raye * Frank Adonis as Paul Calgari * Harold Perrineau as Subway Mugger ==Production== According to Ferrara, Donald Trump gave him permission to film at the Plaza Hotel at no charge on condition that Walken would pose for a photograph with Ivana Trump, who is a fan of the actor. ==ReceptionCritical response=== Total Film rated King of New York four stars out of five. Roger Ebert awarded two stars out of four, citing Walken's \\"usual polished and somehow sinister ease\\" and the director's strong command of mood and style, marred by a sketchy screenplay and a fragmented plot. Mark Caro, writing for the Chicago Tribune, gave the movie only 1/2 star. He called King of New York \\"a film that sucked like mad\\", adding that star Christopher Walken and the movie remain \\"just out of grasp\\". The film holds a 73% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 26 reviews. The film was also featured in Steven Jay Schneider's 7th Edition of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. ==ReferencesCategory:1990 films Category:1990s crime thriller films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American films Category:Italian crime thriller films Category:Italian films Category:Films directed by Abel Ferrara Category:Carolco Pictures films Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films about the American Mafia Category:American neo- noir films Category:Films about drugs ","title":"King of New York"},{"id":"833509","text":"A resident assistant (also variously known as a house fellow, resident advisor, community assistant, resident mentor, residence don, peer advisor, community advisor, collegiate fellow, or senior resident), commonly shortened to RA, is a trained peer leader who coordinates activities in resident halls in colleges, universities, or residential mental health and substance abuse facilities., or similar establishments. An RA has many roles and responsibilities, including building a residential community through programming, acting as a mentor for students, being a familiar first resource for students with academic or institutional questions, and enforcing residence policies. RAs assist residents with problem solving or refer them to counseling resources. Above all, a resident assistant must be an example and uphold professional and personal accountability as outlined by the institution. RAs must balance their schedule and priorities with the needs of the students they are supporting. A major component of the job is not only creating a community, but ensuring safety for all by participating in nightly community walks. Other duties include ordering supplies and determining need for maintenance, repairs, and furnishings. They may maintain household records and assign rooms. ==Job benefits== According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national mean hourly wage of an RA was $13.87 in 2017, and the national mean average annual wage was $28,850. An RA at a college or university does not typically receive an hourly wage, but is compensated in other ways. Common compensations are price-adjusted or free room, free board, and/or stipends. Listed below are two tables of RA hourly and annual mean wage, broken down by individual industries.

The following are the more common responsibilities of an RA. === Administrative === These duties are a direct result of the leadership portion of the RA position. The RA is often asked to be a liaison from the floor to the Community Coordinator of the building. This requires writing reports, keeping accurate records, and maintaining good communication. RAs are usually required to meet with their building coordinator weekly or bi-weekly to discuss their residents, planned programming, and any other issues or subjects that could affect the ability to perform their responsibilities. The RA may also assist with public relations and housing needs. === Institution-specific === These duties are designated from the values and goals of the institution. This denotes that the RA should be a role model by following the regulations. In addition, the RA could be required to disseminate, explain, and uphold these regulations. At the University of Illinois in Urbana Champaign, Resident Advisors are role models, peer advisors, resource referrals, student advocates, and educators. RAs assume leadership roles in creating a positive and friendly atmosphere for students of varied backgrounds. RAs at Illinois develop relationships with their residents on a personal level and try to become a resource to each of them. An RA at Illinois is responsible for a floor of residents, and creates programs and activities for their floor throughout the semester. RAs can point residents in the right direction and help them solve problems by referring them to departments on campus for more extensive help with certain issues. RAs also make sure to address the needs of underrepresented groups of students and work with other staff to incorporate the needs and wishes of these student groups into the community model. At Illinois, RAs are compensated with waived fees for housing and meal plans, and are given a monthly stipend of roughly $105.00. RAs have nights where they are on duty, and must complete procedures such as checking the security of the building, making sure residents in the residence halls are safe and don‚Äôt have any unaddressed concerns, and be available to anyone who is having problems or needs help with something. The job of an RA is to create a community among their residents that is inclusive, welcoming, and comfortable environment for students who are living in university housing. Creating a social and welcoming living space is important for students getting acclimated to a new setting (the college campus) and making sure students feel at home. === Community === The residents and the RA compose a community, simply by living together in a similar location. The RA may be required to foster this community by having the residents be tolerant and respectful of the other residents and their property, or going so far as to create programming to create a sense of family on the floor or in the building. Community programming may also be a required duty in order to help create a sense of belonging in the living space. === Interpersonal === These duties deal with directly helping the residents as individuals. This requires the RA to know all the residents and be able to help each resident if they run into any problems with each other as well as with other things that may follow. Some problems could pertain to relationships, class-work, or institutional questions. The RA should have the skills to either assist the resident, or know of a resource that the resident can use to solve their problem. ===Security=== These duties involve creating a safe and healthy environment for the residents to reside in. Enforcing community standards, such as quiet hours and alcohol and drug policy are frequent occurrences. Fines, bonds, and behavioural contracts can be issued at many universities by RAs. Monitoring floor activity and helping with conflict resolution between residents is another important security related duty of the RA. ===Integration=== This refers to assisting residents in making a smooth transition into campus life by getting them involved in traditional activities in their institution such as homecoming events, for example. ===Academic and awareness=== This refers to academic development and social awareness. Resident assistants are there to promote the well-being of residents in university housing, and to make sure that residents feel like they have enough resources available to them and know how to use them. RAs may try to teach students about social justice and inclusivity, and take students to places on campus where they can learn more about social justice and groups with differing identities. RAs can show students where to go when they need academic help or advice, and can even offer advice of their own as they are often older students with more experience. ===Identity=== This refers to the personal development of residents that enables them to gain a level of self- awareness. ===Independence=== Resident assistants must encourage self- awareness and personal accountability amongst the residents. ===Programs=== One way these elements can be achieved is through programming. This is a major aspect of the job for a resident assistant. Programming can come in three different forms. This includes planned, passive, and take. A planned program is an event created or co-sponsored by the resident assistant. This event is specifically tailored to fit the needs and/or interests of the residents. Sometimes RAs are required to have one planned event for their residents a month, as well as contribute to a building program once a semester in which they work with other RAs to create a meaningful program for the whole building. A passive program is one that is completed without assembling or direct interaction between the residents and/or the resident assistant. Passive programs are generally used to start a conversation on a particular issue affecting the residents. These programs can range from a bulletin board that can be casually read in passing, or they can be more interactive like taking a survey, for example. Finally, take programs require the resident assistant to accompany residents to an event which can include an on-campus program such as an institution sponsored event, a basketball game or perhaps a movie. All these programs help to develop a community amongst residents and incorporate the core values mentioned above. _Active Program Ideas:_ Mocktails (alcohol safety), Condom Olympics (sex ed), DIY air freshners with baking soda and essential oils (Hygiene), DIY Tote bags from old t shirts (Sustainability), Icecream Social (Icebreaker), BJ's and PJS- Ben and jerrys (Sex ed), Paint Nite (Alcohol safety). _Passive Program Ideas:_ Making a door dec representative for that month (bunnies in March, ornaments in December, pumpkins in October), going door to door and handing out candy/ taping candy on their door, an interactive bulletin board where they can write countries they've been or what they're thankful for in November. http://studentaffairs.odu.edu/housing/corevalues.shtml. Core Values. Retrieved 2011-03-30. == International  United Kingdom === Positions similar to resident assistants are much rarer in the UK than the USA, reflecting British universities taking much less direct interest in their student's personal, social and sporting life than their American equivalents. It is more common to have a professional manager, supported by a team of student assistants, whose role focuses on duties covering security, fire and first-aid along with night/weekend reception. However, some UK universities do have a similar role to that of the resident assistant in the USA. These are often called \\"senior wardens\\", \\"student wardens\\" or \\"senior mentors\\". Such positions do not generally much focus on improvement of student life, and are instead more directed towards pastoral care of residents along with practical responsibilities. The positions are most often filled by graduate students or sometimes undergraduate students from their second year of study on. === Mexico === In Mexico, resident assistants are typically called \\"prefectos\\". The position has many of the same functions as in the USA, with a few exceptions including taking attendance every night at 11:30pm. The residence halls tend to be mainly of the same sex; therefore attendance is taken every night by a resident assistant to ensure opposite sex guests are no longer in the building. == Notable RAs == *Anthony Bradley, theology professor at The King's College ‚Äì Clemson University *Ryan C.

As part of Marvel NOW!, Forge returns as a member of Cable's X-Force. ==Fictional character biographyEarly years=== Forge is a mutant with an innate superhuman talent for invention and an intuitive genius. He is a Native American of the Cheyenne nation. Although he was trained as a medicine man, he has primarily relied upon technology rather than mysticism to accomplish his tasks. This rift between Forge and his elder teacher, Naze, made Forge leave his past behind and join the military. While in the army, Forge served in the Vietnam War. After rising in the ranks to become a sergeant, he was asked by S.H.I.E.L.D. to join. Forge declined, because he saw his need was in Vietnam. During his second tour of duty in the war, his comrades were killed by enemy troops; in anger, he used their spirits to summon a band of demons to destroy the opposition. Forge, concerned about his former comrades, decided to order a B-52 bombing on his position to close the portal from the world of the unliving. The bombs destroy the spirits, but he is injured as well, losing his right leg and right hand. This action allowed the demon called the Adversary to come to Earth, and Forge has since been hesitant to employ his mystical abilities. Years later, Forge creates cybernetic replacements for his lost limbs. When Tony Stark stops making advanced weaponry for the US government, Forge is hired as an employee of the Defense Department.Uncanny X-Men #184 (October 1984) One of his earliest commissions is to design a weapon to detect the shape-shifting aliens known as the Dire Wraiths. Subsequently, Forge constructs a device capable of neutralizing mutant powers. Following orders from the President, Henry Peter Gyrich, an agent of the National Security Council, takes the device.Uncanny X-Men #184 Forge protests because the device is untested and extremely dangerous to use. The device is used against Rogue, who was wanted for allegedly killing a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. However, the device instead removes the powers of her teammate, Storm.Uncanny X-Men #185 ===Romance=== Forge rescues Storm after she falls into a river. Forge brings her back to his home in Dallas, Texas. During her recovery, romantic feelings develop between them. When she finds out he developed the device which removed her abilities, Storm leaves.Uncanny X-Men #186 (October 1984) They are briefly reunited to fight the common enemy of the Dire Wraiths, who are trying to prevent Forge from perfecting his neutralizer. They are defeated by the combined forces of the X-Men, Magik and Amanda Sefton.Uncanny X-Men #187‚Äì188 Forge later improves his Neutralizer, but is hesitant to design more devices like it because of what happened with Storm. With the help of the Wraiths' enemy, Rom the Spaceknight, Forge creates a large scale version of the neutralizer in Earth's orbit. Rom and Forge use the device on the Wraith's home-world, casting the entire race into the other-dimensional Limbo.Rom #66 After saving the world, Forge destroys all remaining Neutralizers and focuses on ridding the Earth of the Adversary. The Adversary, in the shape of Naze, convinces Storm that Forge was driven insane by her leaving and is planning to open a gate to hell.Uncanny X-Men #220‚Äì223 Storm tries to kill Forge, but the moment she stabs him she sees that she was tricked.Uncanny X-Men #224 (December 1987) The Adversary banishes Storm and Forge to another dimension, devoid of human life. Storm and Forge spend an unknown amount of time there, rekindling their romance.

The goddess Roma intervenes and secretly restores the X-Men to life.Uncanny X-Men #227 Magik, younger sister of X-Man Colossus, sees Forge as responsible for the death of her brother and attacks Forge, who fights back using his knowledge of Native-American sorcery. Feeling guilty over his involvement, Forge allows Magik to stab him with her Soulsword in the hopes it will kill him. Instead its effects cause both mutants to come to terms with their shortcomings.New Mutants #66 (August 1988) Destiny Forge, still unaware of the X-Men's resurrection, fights alongside Mystique's Freedom Force and an interim team of \\"X-Men\\" against the Reavers at Muir Island. He uses his mutant skills to create a rifle that deactivates the cyborg enemy Skullbuster and forces the rest of the Reavers to retreat. During the battle, Destiny is killed, but not before foreseeing that Forge and Mystique will one day love one another, a fact that both parties find implausible. Afterward, Mystique blames him for Destiny's death.Uncanny X-Men #254‚Äì255 Banshee approaches Forge, hunting for leads about the whereabouts of the X-Men. Forge is convinced by visions that all the X-Men are still alive. During this time, his days as a soldier in the Vietnam War are depicted.Uncanny X-Men #262‚Äì263 The two of them travel all over the world looking for their missing friends. Forge and Banshee eventually find the X-Men and become full-time members. They fight against several threats, such as Genoshan soldiers, Skrulls, and the Shadow King. Forge's skills are critical in defeating Cameron Hodge and overthrowing the Genoshan government. His plans are kept deep inside his own mind by a self-induced trance that even the forced removal of his artificial limbs can not break. Forge later becomes a member of the X-Mansion's \\"support team\\". He redesigns the Danger Room and the Blackbird jet. End of romance With the arrival of Bishop and Storm's constant involvement with the team, Forge and Storm's relationship becomes rocky. Forge leaves the X-Men after coming to believe Storm would have rejected his proposal of marriage.Uncanny X-Men #290 The pair continue to have an on-again-off-again relationship, until it ends for good. Forge goes back home to Dallas to become a government contractor again and to help with the mental care of Mystique, who is becoming schizophrenic. During her stay, Forge and Mystique grow closer and have an affair. ===X-Factor=== Forge replaces Valerie Cooper as the new government liaison for the mutant superhero team X-Factor.X-Factor #93 Forge goes on his second cosmic adventure while with X-Factor, venturing to the far side of the sun with dozens of other superheroes in the incident known as the Infinity Crusade.Infinity Crusade #1‚Äì6 Forge is personally affected as one of his team, Wolfsbane, is kidnapped by the villain called the Goddess. Forge ends up orbiting a duplicate Earth in an escape pod, along with the vigilante Nomad. When the team begins to experience personal problems, Forge takes a more active involvement, gradually taking over the leadership of the remaining members of X-Factor. In this role, he sees the mutant criminals Mystique and Sabretooth forced to become unwilling members of his team.X-Factor #114X-Factor #120 Forge also comes to terms with his heritage when the Adversary returns. With Naze's assistance, Forge defeats the Adversary by combining technology created using his mutant powers with his mystical abilities.X-Factor #120‚Äì121 Under Forge's leadership, X-Factor is tricked into hunting and battling former team member Multiple Man.X-Factor #128‚Äì129 Following this, Forge severs the team's involvement with the government and leads them underground.X-Factor #132‚Äì133 Forge and Mystique become more attracted to one another while working together as members of the team, with Forge ultimately falling in love with Mystique.X-Factor #132‚Äì134 During their time underground, another former X-Factor member, Strong Guy, awakes from a coma that he suffered due to his powers over-stressing his heart. Forge creates a device which saves Strong Guy's life.X-Factor #135 Along with the other team members, Forge is severely injured after Sabretooth betrays and attacks the team.X-Factor #136 Mystique escapes her forced membership while Forge is recuperating.X-Factor #137 After recovering from his injuries, Forge refuses to become a member of a new X-Factor line-up led by former team leader Havok, as he feels that Havok is no longer trustworthy.X-Factor #145 This new version of X-Factor disbands shortly thereafter.X-Factor #149 For a time, Forge is not active on any mutant groups, though he briefly works as support staff at the X-Men's mansion.X-Men vol. 2, #103 ===Xavier's Underground=== Forge takes part in Xavier's Underground movement. He works with a former X-Factor member, Multiple Man, in Genosha. Afterwards, Forge returns to the X-Men and briefly becomes a mentor to Danielle Moonstar. Later, Charles Xavier asks him for help in locating Mystique whom he needs for a clandestine mission.Mystique #1 Forge also helps Cannonball and Siryn find Cable with the aid of Deadpool, and builds a pair of special gauntlets for New X-Men team member Surge; afterward, he returns to his lab to build a Nimrod unit with the primary objective of protecting mutants and secondary objective of protecting humans. He then encounters a time-traveling Nimrod suffering from severe damage, demanding that Forge fix him; this version of Nimrod comes from an alternate future, and had compelled an alternate version of Forge (married to Storm, with two children) to build a device to allow it to travel to the past. The alternate Forge had seemingly complied, but actually built a device to send Nimrod not only back in time, but also to another timeline, and to disable him upon arrival. Nimrod threatens to harm this reality's Storm, and Forge offers to transfer Nimrod into his own version of the Sentinel, which Nimrod agreed to. The transfer is interrupted by the arrival of Surge and the rest of the New X-Men, who had received Forge's distress call through Surge's own gauntlets; in the ensuing battle, Forge helps them defeat Nimrod. ===Messiah Complex=== After Forge sends Madrox and Layla to the future, he goes on a mission at Cyclops' behest to rendezvous with the other X-Men, who are on their way to confront Sinister's forces. He is shot by a seemingly treacherous Bishop.X-Men #206 He is seen later in the recovery room along with other injured X-Men.Uncanny X-Men #494 (2008) ===Divided We Stand=== Forge suffers an array of injuries, including serious head trauma, from Bishop's attack during his mad quest to murder the first mutant child following M-Day. Bishop steals several time travel devices that Forge is reverse engineering. Throughout his recovery, Forge is obsessed with recreating his notes and research on these devices. Fixated to an unhealthy degree on this project, Forge shuts himself off in his home at Eagle Plaza to devote all his time to this work. But before he begins, he enhances his home's defense systems to ensure that he never falls victim to such an attack again.X-Men: Divided We Stand #2 (2008) ===Ghost Box=== Forge later returns in Astonishing X-Men #29, when the X-Men fly to his complex on Wundagore Mountain to confront him about his apparent role in an inter-dimensional invasion of Earth.Astonishing X-Men #29 After following a trail of mysteriously genetically-created mutants and death, the X-Men track Forge down, who through a monologue, reveals his true madness. He wants to save the world from the Annexation, an invasion from a parallel world on the other side of the Ghost Box, the transdimensional teleporter. He plans to send the X-Men to the parallel universe that is home to the Ghost Boxes to destroy them before the Annexation begins. The X-Men try to talk Forge down but he rebukes them and forcibly opens the Ghost Box, risking all life on Earth. Thanks to the assistance of Abigail Brand and Beast, a laser is shot into the opening of the Ghost Box. Before everything is destroyed, Ororo offers Forge a chance to come back with them. A bitter Forge rejects her offer, and stays in his complex as it is destroyed.Astonishing X-Men #30 ===Cable and X-Force=== As part of Marvel NOW!, Forge is shown to still be alive following the destruction of his complex, and has apparently restored his original right hand (but still uses a prosthetic for his right leg). Forge is approached by Cable (after he used his telepathic abilities to help cure him of his insanity) to be in a new X-Force team created by Cable.Marvel Now Point 1 #1 ===All-New, All-Different Marvel=== As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel, Forge appears as a member of Storm's X-Men as their primary technician even though his relationship with Storm is awkward and strained. Forge programmed Cerebra into the body of a Sentinel with the capability to showcase human emotion and the ability to teleport along with mutant detection so she could be a bridge between Earth and Limbo.Extraordinary X-Men #1 ===Dawn of X=== Professor X tasks Forge with modifying Cerebro so it can store backups for mutant minds.Powers of X #5 Forge would later assist the Marauders with recovering his mutant power neutralizers after they were co-opted by the Russians.Marauders #10 ==Powers and abilities== Forge is a mutant with a superhuman intuitive talent for inventing mechanical devices, backed up by the ability to visually perceive mechanical energy in action. This power allows him to instinctively recognize the potential and functional uses of any machine or technological device in his visual range, a skill that combined with his natural intelligence gives him the ability to conceive, design and build highly advanced mechanical devices; and operate, modify and disassemble existing technology or create countermeasures for it. Forge's superhuman talent for invention does not mean that he is of a superhuman intellect, even a genius at invention must for the most part consciously work out the theoretical principles behind the invention and then the design of the invention itself through a series of logical steps. In Forge's case, however, many of these logical steps are worked out by his subconscious mind. Hence, Forge himself might not be entirely aware of exactly how he figured out how to create an invention of his. Sometimes, he must disassemble a device he has made to even figure out how it works. Forge wore synthetic stretch fabric backed by micro-thin bulletproof Kevlar and thermal insulation while a member of the X-Men. He sometimes employs devices of his own invention. Most notable among these was his Neutralizer gun that could suppress superhuman mutant abilities. The only known examples of this device have been destroyed. Forge has also invented a hand-held scanning device that can detect the presence of superhuman beings or aliens. Forge has knowledge of many scientific and technological fields. He also possesses various mystical abilities such as spell casting through mystical training, though he rarely uses these. He possesses extensive knowledge of Native American magic. His bionic-robotic right hand (which he has since restored to its original organic state) and right leg often contain concealed weapons and devices that he can use in combat. In addition, they can be outfitted with computer interfaces and plasma blasters. His skill as a hand-to-hand combatant and as a marksman from his military training were so impressive that Nick Fury offered him a job with S.H.I.E.L.D. ==Other versionsAge of Apocalypse=== In the Age of Apocalypse reality, Forge was a member of Magneto's rebels, the X-Men, and years of combat against Apocalypse's empire had left him a cyborg with a mostly-robotic body except for the right half of his face. He left them to go his own way and became the founder and leader of the Outcasts, an anti- Apocalypse resistance cell of mutants disguised as a traveling theatre group. The Outcasts' consisted of Soaron, Toad, Brute, and Mastermind, and later Sonique and Essex, who is rescued by the group from the Infinites during their attack on a train. He became a father figure to Nate Grey, and also his trainer, teaching him how to combat without using his powers. When the Outcasts were attacked by Domino and her henchmen Caliban and Grizzly, Forge attempted to distract them with a Flash Grenade and later in the battle personally killed Grizzly for killing Toad. Forge was eventually killed by Sinister, who had been masquerading as a member of the Outcasts called Essex.X-Man #1‚Äì4 ===Here Comes Tomorrow=== In the apocalyptic alternate future of Here Comes Tomorrow, the final arc of Grant Morrison's run of New X-Men, a British Mutant under the name Smith had taken Forge's alias, the Maker. Though his powers and his relation to Forge, if any, are unknown, he bore some physical resemblance to the former Maker, and also carried numerous mechanical tools.New X-Men #151 ===House of M=== Forge is seen in House of M as a scientist working under Tony Stark, Iron Man. He is one of Stark's most trusted employees and is one of the first to learn that he is truly Iron Man. He utilizes his skills in technology and computers by aiding Jarvis and Stark in tracking down the mutant gene bombs that Johnny Storm and Stark are hunting down all over the city.Iron Man: House of M #1‚Äì3 ===Hulk: Future Imperfect=== In the mini-series Hulk: Future Imperfect, describing an alternate timeline where the Hulk becomes the Maestro, the Maestro claims that Forge created a weapon specifically designed to kill the Maestro, but that the Maestro killed him before the weapon could be used. The present-day Hulk would later encounter Forge using such a weapon.The Incredible Hulk: Future Imperfect #1 ===Marvel Zombies=== Forge appears in Marvel Zombies alongside Magneto's Acolytes as one of few survivors who were hiding on Asteroid M from the hordes of zombie superheroes on Earth. He constructs artificial limbs for the Black Panther after the zombie Giant-Man consumes some of his original ones. Forge becomes close friends with Black Panther, and Forge's daughter later marries Black Panther's son and the couple later conceives a child. After the Panther's and Forge's children die under mysterious circumstances (later revealed that to have been murdered by Malcolm Cortez), both friends become closer through their shared tragedy, and help to raise their grandson together.Marvel Zombies #1‚Äì6 During the former heroes' forty years of absence, Forge anticipates that the zombies would return. Over the decades he and his forces plunder the technological remnants of the world. He makes improvements to Reed Richards' and Tony Stark's technologies for defenses of the colony New Wakanda, such as the Avengers' force field projector and Iron Man's armors. The interdimensional transporter is the only technology Forge is unable to rebuild, and it is later revealed that Fabian Cortez's son, Malcolm, has sabotaged it by removing some of its key components. Forge dons one of the Iron Man armors when the zombies return. After multiple extensive battles, the surviving zombies and the colonists begin a truce because the returning zombies' hunger has faded. Cortez ambushes and teleports the zombies to another dimension in order to seize power within the colony. Cortez kills Forge to hide this situation.Marvel Zombies 2 #1‚Äì7 ===Mutant X=== The version of Forge who appears in the Mutant X comic is virtually the same as his mainstream incarnation: he first used his powers to manufacture anti-mutant technology for the government,Mutant X #13 (September 1999) and later becomes Storm's lover. However, because Storm has become a vampire in the Mutant X universe, he allows her to regularly drain blood from him so that she will not have to violate her oath to never take a life.Mutant X #4 (January 1999) ===Ronin=== In the alternate reality of X-Men: Ronin, the X-Men are superheroes based out of Japan. Forge is a Japanese police officer with an attraction to Storm. He also helps build and pilot an array of robots called Sentinel Force which are sent against the X-Men.X-Men: Ronin #2 ===Ultimate Marvel=== In the Ultimate Marvel continuity, Forge has been dramatically re- imagined. He became a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants and follows Magneto with the promise of getting to strike back at humans.Ultimate X-Men #27 This version of Forge is also now of Asian Indian descent, a play upon the mainstream version of the character's American Indian heritage. Magneto ordered Forge to invent a machine that would enhance his abilities to a point where Magneto would be able to kill every human on Earth. Forge, slightly naive, agreed to build it, the promise of Magneto's offer of ownership of Canada and a hate-free world blinding him. It was only at the final stages of his machine that he realized what he was truly doing -‚Äî about to slaughter millions of people. He attempts to confront Magneto about this, telling him that he was under the impression that Magneto would only frighten the humans. Magneto replies that in the start of a new nation, one must make sacrifices and coldly asks Forge if he is hesitating. Forge hastily assures him no; he is later seen depressed and angry.Ultimate X-Men #28‚Äì30 In the 'Magnetic North' storyline it is revealed that he was freed from prison by Mystique. As a pair, they frame Lorna Dane with one of Forge's devices. It causes her powers to malfunction, killing dozens of innocent people. Later, Forge does nothing as Mystique snaps the neck of a female police officer and assumes her form. As part of a carefully thought out plan, Forge and Mystique later personally attack the Triskelion; the headquarters for the Ultimates and a supervillain prison. They kill dozens of S.H.I.E.L.D. soldiers during the attack and even more die cleaning up the prison break which results.Ultimate X-Men #62‚Äì64 He is then taken into custody, but escapes Triskelion using a phasing device, also helping Wolverine break out as well. Although, according to General Nick Fury, he orchestrated the escape in order for Wolverine to lead him to the Hulk's location.Ultimate Hulk vs. Wolverine #4‚Äì5 He is later tortured and killed in the Savage Land.Ultimatum #3 ===Exiles=== An alternate version of Forge, who appears to be a White American with no apparent Native heritage (but still a cyborg with a robotic right leg, though now also with a robotic right full-arm instead of just a robotic right hand), is drafted onto the interdimensional superhero group the Exiles. Originating from Earth-2814, he was married to his reality's Storm. In this reality, the Skrulls succeeded in conquering Earth, but Forge rebuilt and reprogrammed Sentinel City to destroy their command city. He seemingly perished in the explosion, but was instead plucked out of time and put on the Exiles.Exiles (vol. 3) #1 ===Age of X=== An alternate version of Forge is present in the Age of X reality. He was present when Magneto used New York City skyscrapers to create his so-called \\"Fortress X\\".Age of X: Alpha #1 ===Old Man Logan=== As revealed by Old Man Logan, Forge was not with the X-Men the night when the villains rose and Mysterio tricked Wolverine into killing his fellow X-Men. Many years later after the villains took over the United States of America and renamed it Amerika, Forge was shown living in a Cheyenne reservation in South Dakota when Rhino led the Rhino Gang into invading. While Forge's highly advanced weaponry defeated the Rhino Gang, Forge rode an exo-skeleton which he used to beat Rhino to death. Upon ending up on Earth-616, Old Man Logan told Forge about the fate of his Earth-807128 counterpart. Even though Old Man Logan never visited the Cheyenne Reservation, he was sure that Forge was the one responsible for protecting it from the Rhino Gang.Extraordinary X-Men #18 (2017) A return to this wasteland sees a renewed focus on Forge, He has built a fortress on his land, above and below. When it is attacked by Sabretooth clones, Forge detonates his secret weapon, Old Man Speedball. Forge does not survive this incident.Dead Man Logan #7-10.

As told by his brother Larry he started running as a child against his brothers in Indian relays where one would start at the back of the pack and work to get to the front. This would come to be one of the tactics he would later use in his running. He started running for his school in seventh grade and continued through high school (4:34.4 mile). He continued his collegiate career in 1956, at Miami University in Ohio, where he broke the school record in the mile as a sophomore running 4:12.1. He joined the Air Force and for a year had limited training because of Air Force schooling. In May 1960, he was assigned to Oxnard AFB in California and Max Truex (himself a world class distance runner, who placed sixth in the Olympic 10,000 meters that year) became his commanding officer. In June, after one month of good training, Schul ran the USA championships; he placed fifth in his trial race, running 3:55 for 1500 meters. In 1961, Truex introduced Schul to Hungarian coach Mih√°ly Igl√≥i. Under Igl√≥i's training, Schul finished third at the national championships in the 3000 m steeplechase. In 1962, he ran well indoors at two miles, with only one American, Jim Beatty, running faster. However, after several poor races that spring, Schul was diagnosed with mononucleosis and spent three months in an Air Force hospital. The next winter, Schul became the US Indoor Champion, running 13:39.3 for three miles. A few weeks later, he ran the third fastest indoor two miles ever (8:37.5), though losing to Beatty's world record time of 8:30.7. With a partially torn soleus muscle, Schul placed third in the Pan American Games at 5K, but the injury kept him from competing in the U.S. Championships. ==1964 success== Returning to Miami University in the fall of 1963, Schul continued using Igl√≥i's training methods, with some innovations. The highlights of his 1964 indoor season were a new American record time for three miles, 13:31.4 (then the second fastest indoor time in the world), and two wins over 10,000 meters world record holder Ron Clarke of Australia. Schul posted an extremely impressive outdoor season in 1964, not losing a single race and beating among others Bruce Kidd, Gerry Lindgren, Billy Mills, Bill Baillie, and Bill Dellinger. Schul first broke the American record in the 5000m at Compton, running 13:38.0. Schul did not run in the NCAA Championships that year, as he thought it unfair for a twenty-six-year-old to be running against younger opponents. He won both the US Championship and the separately held Olympic Trials that year. On August 29, 1964, Schul set a new world record for two miles of 8:26.4, eclipsing the previous mark of 8:29.6 by Michel Jazy of France. For the first time Track and Field News and Sports Illustrated picked an American to win a distance race, as Schul went to the Games having both the best time in the world in the 5K and the new two-mile world record. The Olympic final was held in heavy rain. In the last lap, Jazy appeared poised to take the gold, as he had opened up a ten-meter lead on the back stretch; however, Schul ran an impressive 37.8 for the last 300 meters on a muddy track. He caught Jazy 50 meters before the finish line, and pulled away for a clear victory to take the gold medal. ==Injuries and retirement== After returning home, Schul's knee was hurting and he could not run for four months. Using a YMCA pool and stationary bicycle throughout the winter, he resumed running in March 1965. With only three months of training, Schul won the US Championship again in 1965, this time over three miles again, setting a new American record of 13:10.4. He stated afterward, \\"it was the toughest race I ran and won.\\" Schul never managed to regain his 1964 level again, though he did run personal bests over the metric distances of 1500 meters (3:40.7) and 3000 meters (7:59.9) in Europe. In August 1965, Schul's knee began hurting again and he decided to retire. He resumed training in 1967 for fitness purposes and this led him to the 1968 Olympic trials at South Lake Tahoe. With numerous injuries and limited training, he still managed to place fifth in the final. In that final, he had an asthma attack after a few laps and struggled throughout, fainting as he crossed the finish line. In 1971, for one year, Schul served as the national coach for Malaysia and then moved back to the U.S., re-settling in Ohio. In his spare time he continued to train club athletes. In 1978, the Air Force sent all their top distance runners to Wright Patterson Air Force Base to train under Schul. After a year of training, many of the athletes reduced their times enough to compete in National events. Schul himself participated in road races along with his club athletes until the age of sixty, when his right leg and back problems prevented further racing. Along the way, Schul became a top masters runner (33.55 for 10,000 m and 76:00 for half marathon at age fifty; 17:56 for 5,000 m at age 60). In October 2007, Schul had his right hip replaced. Schul was employed at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, as its men's and women's cross country and track coaches from 1996 to 2007. ==References== == Bibliography == * * == Training book == * == External links == * Category:1937 births Category:Living people Category:People from West Milton, Ohio Category:Track and field athletes from Ohio Category:American male long-distance runners Category:American male steeplechase runners Category:American male middle- distance runners Category:Pan American Games bronze medalists for the United States Category:Pan American Games medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1963 Pan American Games Category:Olympic track and field athletes of the United States Category:Olympic gold medalists for the United States in track and field Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:Miami RedHawks men's track and field athletes Category:Indiana University alumni Category:Cornell University faculty Category:American masters athletes Category:Wright State Raiders track and field coaches Category:Wright State Raiders cross country coaches ","title":"Bob Schul"},{"id":"833526","text":"Martin Walser (; born 24 March 1927) is a German writer. ==Life== Detail of the by Peter Lenk (Martin Walser as Bodenseereiter). Walser was born in Wasserburg am Bodensee, on Lake Constance. His parents were coal merchants, and they also kept an inn next to the train station in Wasserburg. He described the environment in which he grew up in his novel Ein springender Brunnen (English: A Gushing Fountain). From 1938 to 1943 he was a pupil at the secondary school in Lindau and served in an anti-aircraft unit. According to documents released in June 2007, at the age of 17 he became a member of the Nazi Party on 20 April 1944,Die Welt: Dieter Hildebrandt soll in NSDAP gewesen sein 30 June 2007 though Walser denied that he knowingly entered the party, a claim disputed by historian Juliane Wetzel.Der Tagesspiegel: Gemeinsam in die NSDAP 22 July 2009Wolfgang Benz, ed.: Wie wurde man Parteigenosse? ‚Äì Die NSDAP und ihre Mitglieder (Frankfurt: S. Fischer Verlag, 2009). By the end of the Second World War, he was a soldier in the Wehrmacht. After the war he returned to his studies and completed his Abitur in 1946. He then studied literature, history, and philosophy at the University of Regensburg and the University of T√ºbingen. He received his doctorate in literature in 1951 for a thesis on Franz Kafka, written under the supervision of Friedrich Bei√üner. While studying, Walser worked as a reporter for the S√ºddeutscher Rundfunk radio station, and wrote his first radio plays. In 1950, he married Katharina \\"K√§the\\" Neuner-Jehle. He has four daughters from this marriage: Franziska Walser is an actress; Alissa Walser is a writer-and-painter; Johanna Walser, and Theresia Walser are professional writers. Johanna has occasionally published in collaboration with her father. German journalist Jakob Augstein is Walser's illegitimate son from a relationship with translator Maria Carlsson.Gerrit Bartels: Augstein und Walser. Vater und Sohn: Eine gewisse √Ñhnlichkeit. In: Der Tagesspiegel. 28 November 2009. Retrieved 25 March 2012. Beginning in 1953 Walser was regularly invited to conferences of the Gruppe 47 (Group 47), which awarded him a prize for his story Templones Ende (English: Templone's End) in 1955. His first novel Ehen in Philippsburg (English: Marriages in Philippsburg) was published in 1957 and was a huge success. Since then Walser has been working as a freelance author. His most important work is Ein fliehendes Pferd (English: A Runaway Horse), published 1978, which was both a commercial and critical success. Walser received the Georg B√ºchner Prize in 1981. In 2004 Walser left his long-time publisher Suhrkamp Verlag for Rowohlt Verlag after the death of Suhrkamp director Siegfried Unseld. An unusual clause in his contract with Suhrkamp Verlag made it possible for Walser take publishing rights over all of his works with him. According to Walser, a decisive factor in instigating the switch was the lack of active support by his publisher during the controversy over his novel \\"Tod eines Kritikers\\" (English: Death of a Critic). Walser is a member of Akademie der K√ºnste (Academy of Arts) in Berlin, S√§chsische Akademie der K√ºnste (Saxon Academy of Arts), Deutsche Akademie f√ºr Sprache und Dichtung (German Academy for Language and Poetry) in Darmstadt, and member of the German P.E.N. In 2007 the German political magazine Cicero placed Walser second on its list of the 500 most important German intellectuals, just behind Pope Benedict XVI and ahead of Nobel Prize winner G√ºnter Grass. ==Political engagement== Martin Walser at a reading in Germany, 1992 ===From Left to Right=== Walser has also been known for his political activity. In 1964, he attended the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial, which was considered an important moment in the development of West German political consciousness regarding the recent German past. He was involved in protests against the Vietnam War. During the late 1960s, Walser, like many leftist German intellectuals including G√ºnter Grass, supported Willy Brandt for the election to the office of chancellor of West Germany. In the 1960s and 1970s Walser moved further to the left and was considered a sympathizer of the West German Communist Party. He was friends with leading German Marxists such as Robert Steigerwald and even visited Moscow during this time. By the 1980s, Walser began shifting back to the political right, though he denied any substantive change of attitude. In 1988 he gave a series of lectures entitled \\"Speeches About One's Own Country,\\" in which he made clear that he considered German division to be a painful gap which he could not accept. This topic was also the topic of his story \\"Dorle und Wolf\\". ===Peace Prize of the German Book Trade=== In 1998 Walser was awarded the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. His acceptance speech, given in the former Church of St. Paul (Paulskirche) in Frankfurt, invoked issues of historical memory and political engagement in contemporary German politics and unleashed a controversy that roiled German intellectual circles. Walser's acceptance speech was titled: (\\"Experiences when writing the regular soapbox- speech\\"): (Full text in German ) At first the speech did not cause a great stir. Indeed, the audience present in Church of St. Paul received the speech with applause, though Walser's critic Ignatz Bubis did not applaud, as confirmed by television footage of the event.Eshel, Amir: \\"Jewish Memories, German Futures: Recent Debates in Germany about the Past\\" , page 12. 2000. (PDF-File, 6 MB) Some days after the event, and again on 9 November 1998, the 60th anniversary of the Kristallnacht pogrom against German Jews, Bubis, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, accused Walser of \\"intellectual arson\\" () and claimed that Walser's speech was both \\"trying to block out history or, respectively, to eliminate the remembrance\\" and pleading \\"for a culture of looking away and thinking away\\". Then the controversy started. As described by Karsten Luttmer: Walser replied by accusing Bubis to have stepped out of dialog between people. Walser and Bubis met on 14 December at the offices of the to discuss the heated controversy and to bring the discussion to a close. They were joined by Frank Schirrmacher of the and Salomon Korn of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. Afterward, Bubis withdrew his claim that Walser had been intentionally incendiary, but Walser maintained that there was no misinterpretation by his opponents. ===Death of a Critic=== In his 2002 roman-√†-clef Death of a Critic, Martin Walser attacks violently the most powerful literary critic in Germany, Marcel Reich-Ranicki, a Jew who had escaped the Warsaw ghetto. Walser criticised his person as much as his role as a symbol of a corrupted cultural milieu. This started a scandal, a war between newspapers and a power contest between personalities all played a role. Does a writer, especially one who had been a member of the Nazi party, have the right to attack the most well-known critic in Germany, former head of the arts and culture section of the country's most prestigious newspaper and host of a popular literary television show, a German national for more than fifty years? As soon as the novel came out, this question became the hot topic of debate in Germany. Not a day went by without a newspaper article taking a stance for or against the book. And this with hardly anybody even having read it, because at the time, only a few advance copies were in circulation. His was the first volley in the public debate. On 29 May, months before the book was to be officially released in August, Frank Schirrmacher wrote an open letter to Martin Walser to inform him that contrary to tradition, an excerpt from his book would not be published in the feuilleton of the FAZ: \\"This book is an execution, a settlement of accounts, a document of hate\\", he wrote. The FAZ continued to publish expressions of support for Marcel Reich-Ranicki, who was Schirrmacher's predecessor at the FAZ. Its arch- rival daily paper, the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung from Munich, closed ranks behind Walser. Reich-Ranicki commented himself in May 2010 in an interview with Der Spiegel: \\"I don't think that he is an anti-Semite. But it is important to him to demonstrate that the critic, who allegedly tortured him most, is a Jew, too. He expects his public to follow him in this. You see, there never was an anti-Semitic line or remark from Grass, not one. And I certainly haven't written only positively about his books.\\" ==Works== ;In German ‚Äì and in English, if translated: *Beschreibung einer Form: Versuch √ºber die epische Dichtung Franz Kafkas (1951) *Ein Flugzeug √ºber dem Haus und andere Geschichten (1955) *Ehen in Philippsburg (1957) ‚Äì The Gadarene Club (1960) *Halbzeit (1960) ‚Äì Halftime: A Novel (also 1960) *Eiche und Angora: Eine deutsche Chronik (1962) ‚Äì The Rabbit Race (1963) *√úberlebensgro√ü Herr Krott: Requiem f√ºr einen Unsterblichen (1964) *L√ºgengeschichten (1964) *Erfahrungen und Leseerfahrungen (1965) *Das Einhorn (1966) ‚Äì The Unicorn (1983) *Der Abstecher, Die Zimmerschlacht (1967) *Heimatkunde: Aufs√§tze und Reden (1968) *Ein Kinderspiel: St√ºck in zwei Akten (1970) *Fiction: Erz√§hlung (1970) *Aus dem Wortschatz unserer K√§mpfe(1971) *Die Gallistl‚Äôsche Krankheit (1972) *Der Sturz (1973) *Das Sauspiel: Szenen aus dem 16.

He is particularly known for his plays Marat/Sade and The Investigation and his novel The Aesthetics of Resistance. Peter Weiss earned his reputation in the post-war German literary world as the proponent of an avant-garde, meticulously descriptive writing, as an exponent of autobiographical prose, and also as a politically engaged dramatist. He gained international success with Marat/Sade, the American production of which was awarded a Tony Award and its subsequent film adaptation directed by Peter Brook. His \\"Auschwitz Oratorium,\\" The Investigation, served to broaden the debates over the so-called \\"Aufarbeitung der Vergangenheit\\" (or formerly) \\"Vergangenheitsbew√§ltigung\\" or \\"politics of history.\\" Weiss' magnum opus was The Aesthetics of Resistance, called the \\"most important German-language work of the 70s and 80s.\\"Klaus Beutin, Klaus Ehlert, Wolfgang Emmerich, Helmut Hoffacker, Bernd Lutz, Volker Meid, Ralf Schnell, Peter Stein und Inge Stephan: Deutsche Literaturgeschichte. Von den Anf√§ngen bis zur Gegenwart. 5., √ºberarbeitete Auflage. Stuttgart-Weimar: Metzler 1994, S. 595. His early, surrealist-inspired work as a painter and experimental filmmaker remains less well known. == Life == Weiss was born in Nowawes (now part of Potsdam- Babelsberg) near Berlin, to a Hungarian Jewish father and a Christian mother. After the First World War and the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire Weiss's father became a Czech citizen and the son acquired his father's citizenship ‚Äì Weiss was never a German citizen. At age three he moved with his family to the German port city of Bremen, and during his adolescence back to Berlin where he began training as a painter. In 1935 he emigrated with his family to Chislehurst, near London, where he studied photography at the Polytechnic School of Photography. In 1936‚Äì1937 the family moved to Czechoslovakia. Weiss attended the Prague Art Academy. After the German occupation of the Czech Sudetenland in 1938, his family moved to Sweden, while Weiss was visiting Hermann Hesse in Switzerland. In 1939 he joined his family in Stockholm, Sweden, where he lived for the rest of his life. He became a Swedish citizen in 1946. Weiss was married three times: to the painter Helga Henschen, 1943‚Äì47; to Carlota Dethorey, 1949; and from 1964 until his death to the Swedish artist and stage designer Gunilla Palmstierna-Weiss. In the 1960s Weiss became increasingly politically radical, taking stands for revolutionary Cuba and against US intervention in Vietnam and visiting both countries. In 1966 he visited the United States together with the West German writers group Gruppe 47. During a conference at Princeton University he denounced the US war against North VietnamSee Peter Weiss: \\"I Come out of my hiding place.\\" The Nation, May 30, 1966, pp. 652, 655. (Written in English by Peter Weiss.) which seems to have scandalized his German colleagues more than his US hosts. In 1967 he participated in the anti-war Russell Tribunal in Stockholm and in 1968 he joined the eurocommunist Swedish Left Party (VPK). During the same year he also visited North Vietnam and published a book about his trip.See Peter Weiss: Notes on the Cultural Life of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. (Translator not named.) London: Calder & Boyars, 1971. In 1970 Weiss suffered a heart attack. During the following decade, he wrote his monumental three- part novel, The Aesthetics of Resistance, as well as two very different stage versions of Kafka's novel The Trial. He died in Stockholm in 1982. == Painting, Film, and Literature == Production of The Investigation at the Staatstheater Nuremberg, 2009 (photography: Marion Buehrle) During his early life as a painter ‚Äì 1930 to 1950 ‚Äì Weiss was influenced by old Dutch masters such as Pieter Breughel, and Hieronymus Bosch. After World War II his painting, as well as his work in film and literature, came under the lasting influence of Surrealism. He taught painting at Stockholm's People's University, and illustrated a Swedish edition of The Book of One Thousand and One Nights. In 1952 he joined the Swedish Experimental Film Studio, where he directed several experimental short films, followed by several socially conscious documentary shorts: Gesichter im Schatten (Faces in the Shadow, 1956), Im Namen des Gesetzes (In the Name of the Law, 1957), Was machen wir jetzt? (What Do We Do Now?, 1958). In 1959 he directed his only full length (experimental) film H√§gringen (The Disappeared). In the early 1950s, Weiss had begun to write again, producing a number of prose works, some in German, others in Swedish. Most are short, intense, surrealist text which suggest the influence of Kafka (whose work Weiss would later adapt for the stage). The most important of these prose texts is Der Schatten des K√∂rpers des Kutschers (The Shadow of the Body of the Coachman,Earlier translations give the title as The Shadow of the Coachman's Body thereby smoothing over the unwieldy double genitive case of the German original title. See Peter Weiss: Marat/Sade, The Investigation, and The Shadow of the Body of the Coachman. Robert Cohen (ed.). New York: Continuum, 1998. \\"Introduction,\\" p. X 1952). It is a nearly hermetic experimental work which explores language through the use of surreal, disturbing imagery whereby an apparent rural idyll is transformed into a kafkaesque nightmare. The Surrealist effect was enhanced by collages in the style of Max Ernst, so-called xylography, which Peter Weiss created for the book. Coachman has been linked both to the French nouveau roman of Alain Robbe-Grillet and Raymond Queneau, as well as to French absurdist works by Samuel Beckett, Eugene Ionesco, and Jean Genet.See Cohen: Understanding Peter Weiss. P. 32. When it was eventually published in Germany in 1960 it put its 45 years old writer at the forefront of the West German literary scene. Weiss abandoned painting and filmmaking and turned exclusively to writing. Nearly all his subsequent works ‚Äì and all of the major ones ‚Äì are written in German. His next prose work, Abschied von den Eltern (Leavetaking, 1959/60) was less hermetic than Coachman and strongly autobiographical. It was not only a critical but also a public success, as was its follow-up Fluchtpunkt (Vanishing Point, 1962) Since the early 1950 Weiss had also been writing plays: Der Turm (The Tower, 1950), Die Versicherung (The Insurance, 1952), Nacht mit G√§sten (Night with Guests, 1963), Wie dem Herrn Mockinpott das Leiden ausgetrieben wird (How Mister Mockinpott was Cured of His Sufferings, 1963/68). But none of these stage works prepared the public for what came next: A play about the French Revolution which through its title alone became an overnight a sensation: \\"Die Verfolgung und Ermordung Jean Paul Marats dargestellt durch die Schauspielgruppe des Hospizes zu Charenton unter Anleitung des Herrn de Sade (The Persecution and Assassination of Jean Paul Marat As Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of MonsieurEarlier translations use \\"Marquis\\" but \\"Monsieur\\" is the more appropriate translation of de Sade's appellation as the original German title uses \\"Herr\\" rather than \\"Marquis.\\" See Weiss: Marat/Sade, The Investigation, and The Shadow of the Body of the Coachman. \\"Introduction\\", p. XIII de Sade). First performed in West Berlin in 1964, it quickly brought Weiss notoriety. The following year, 1965, British director Peter Brook staged it at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in London. Brook's film version (1967) turned Marat/Sade into an international cultural icon. Set in an insane asylum and constantly in danger of being overwhelmed by madness and chaos, the play explores the place of writers and intellectuals in a time of revolutionary upheaval. At its center are two very different historical figures, Jean-Paul Marat, a writer and leading intellectual of the French Revolution, and the Marquis de Sade, a writer and intellectual as well, whose attitude towards the revolution is much more ambivalent and who is solipsistically obsessed with sex, violence, and pain. In the play Weiss draws both on Antonin Artaud's Theater of Cruelty and on its opposite: Brecht's theater of reason. In the words of de Sade: \\"Our intent in creating such dialogues as these / was to experiment with various antitheses / to oppose each to each so that we might / upon our many doubts shed some light\\".Weiss: Marat/Sade, The Investigation, and The Shadow of the Body of the Coachman. P. 112. Much of the discussion of the play has focused on whether it is Marat's or Sade's position which prevails. Beginning with Marat/Sade Weiss's work increasingly attracted the attention of communist East Germany. The play and all the ones to follow were staged in exemplary fashion in Rostock and other theaters in the GDR. Weiss frequently visited East Berlin and became friends with many East German writers and artists. He developed a collaborative relationship and eventually a close friendship with Manfred Haiduk, professor of literature in Rostock. After Weiss wrote his play about Trotsky, which East German party functionaries interpreted as an anti-Leninist provocation, he for a while became persona non grata, but the relationship soon revived. Weiss was one of only a handful of western artists and intellectuals whose work attracted wide interest in both Germanies though in both states he was also subjected to distrust and denunciations. During this period Brecht's influence on Weiss's plays became more evident. He also became obsessed with Dante's Divine Comedy the influence of which is present in all his works from the mid-1960s until his death. In 1965, Weiss wrote the documentary play The Investigation (Die Ermittlung) on the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials. Like Marat/Sade it attracted wide international attention and became the focus of heated debates about the 'right' way of representing Auschwitz and about who gets to decide what is acceptable and what is not.See Robert, Cohen: \\"The Political Aesthetics of Holocaust Literature: Peter Weiss's 'The Investigation' and its Critics.\\" History & Memory vol. 10. 2/1998). 43‚Äì67. This was followed by two experimental plays about the struggle for self-determination in the 'Third World': Gesang vom lusitanischen Popanz (Song of the Lusitanian Bogey [a better translation would be Canto of the Lusitanian Bogey] 1967) about Angola, and Viet Nam Diskurs (Viet Nam Discourse, 1968). The next two plays once again focused on intellectuals and writers in times of upheaval: Trotzki im Exil (Trotsky in Exile, 1970)See Robert Cohen: \\"A Dream of Dada and Lenin: Peter Weiss's 'Trotsky in Exile'.\\" In: Rethinking Peter Weiss. Jost Hermand and Marc Silberman (eds.). Peter Lang, 2000. 151-73. and H√∂lderlin (1971). Between 1971 and 1981 Weiss worked on his opus magnum: his three part 1000 page novel on the European resistance against Nazi Germany, The Aesthetics of Resistance. Weiss received numerous awards, among them the Charles Veillon Award, 1963; the Lessing Prize, 1965; the Heinrich Mann Prize, 1966; the Carl Albert Anderson Prize, 1967; the Thomas Dehler Prize, 1978; the Cologne Literature Prize, 1981; the Bremen Literature Prize, 1982; the Swedish Theatre Critics Prize, 1982; and finally the highest German literary award, the Georg B√ºchner Prize, 1982. == Selected works == All works were originally written in German unless otherwise noted.

The story is written as a mixture of historical fiction and Arthurian mythology. The books were originally published between 1995 and 1997 by Penguin and Michael Joseph in the United Kingdom and by St. Martin's Press in the United States, in hardcover and paperback editions, each with different ISBNs. ==Books in the trilogy== * The Winter King (1995) * Enemy of God (1996) * Excalibur (1997) ==Treatment of legend and history== The story is written as if it took place in Dark Age Britain as described in the original Welsh legends, with appropriate types of technology, culture, warfare, and attitudes. Cornwell also weaves later additions such as Merlin and Lancelot into the plot. Like other \\"historical\\" takes on the Arthurian legends, the series postulates that Post-Roman Britain was a difficult time for the native Britons, being threatened by invasion from the Anglo-Saxons in the East and raids from the Irish in the West. At the same time, they suffered internal power struggles between their petty kingdoms. Like Marion Zimmer Bradley in her novel The Mists of Avalon, Cornwell also presumes friction occurred between the old Druidic religion and Christianity. The protagonist of the series is Derfel Cadarn (pronounced Derv-el), based on the part-legendary Saint Derfel and on Bedivere. Cornwell's Derfel is a Saxon brought up as a Briton by Merlin, the greatest of all Druids. In the course of the story, he becomes a great warrior and one of Arthur's warlords in his war against the Saxons. Derfel is one of Arthur's closest advisers and friends, is one-handed, and casts Excalibur into the sea after the Battle of Camlann. Merlin, meanwhile, concerns himself with trying to restore the old gods of Britain. Other characters from the Arthurian mythos are given significant and memorable twists. For example, Lancelot, always portrayed as the most virtuous and the mightiest of Arthur's knights, here is depicted as an arrogant, cowardly and self-serving petty prince, whose legendary feats and martial prowess are crafted through the songs of the bards and a fictional reputation that he himself carefully cultivates. Sagramor is a Hungarian prince in the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, but is depicted here as a Numidian veteran of the old Roman Army who joined Arthur's service after the collapse of the Empire. Cornwell portrays Merlin as a lecherous, driven, mischievous and irreverent druid. His solution to the problem of integrating the magic of the Arthurian mythos in the context of historical fiction is to leave room for the reader to take the \\"magic\\" depicted in the story at face value or to interpret it as a mixture of coincidence, psychology, primitive technology and illusion which preys on the superstitions, religious fundamentalism and intolerance of the time. ==Reception== The Warlord Chronicles has been acclaimed for both its storytelling qualities and its accuracy in portraying contemporary life. Cornwell himself has said, \\"I have to confess that of all the books I have written these three are my favourites.\\" ==Audiobooks== Isis Audio Books and Harper Collins have published unabridged audiobook recordings of all three novels, read by Edmund Dehn and Jonathan Keeble respectively.

Most often the checkmated king has castled queenside, and is mated on c8 or c1. Many variants on the mate are seen, for example a king on e8 checkmated by bishops on g6 and a3, and a king on f1 checkmated by bishops on h3 and b6. Often the mate is immediately preceded by a sacrifice that opens up the diagonal on which the bishop delivers checkmate, and the mate is often a pure mate (as is the case for all but one of the examples given here). The mate is named for Samuel Boden, who played a famous early example of it in Schulder‚ÄìBoden, London 1853.

He went to Eton before reading History at Christ Church, Oxford. ==Political career== Belstead showed little interest in politics at first, and waited six years after succeeding to the peerage on his father's death in 1958 before making his maiden speech. In 1970 Edward Heath appointed him to become Parliamentary Under-Secretary to Margaret Thatcher at the Department of Education and Science; he was moved in the same rank to the Northern Ireland Office three years later. When Margaret Thatcher led the Tories back to power in 1979, she sent him to the Home Office. He was then made Minister at the Foreign Office when Lord Carrington and his team resigned after the Falklands invasion. In 1980 he was interviewed by the BBC's Panorama current affairs program about Britain's preparations for a nuclear attack. He next moved to the Ministry of Fisheries and Food, and went back to the Education Department again before becoming Deputy Leader to William Whitelaw as Leader of the House of Lords. He succeeded Whitelaw in that post in 1988, taking the sinecure post of Lord Privy Seal at the same time. After losing his Cabinet seat, which he had gained when he became Lord Privy Seal, in 1990 he became Paymaster-General and Northern Ireland Minister under John Major, retiring from the Government to become Chairman of the Parole Board in 1992. In the 1983 New Year Honours, he was sworn of the Privy Council. After the House of Lords Act 1999 removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords, he was created a life peer (an honour given to all former Leaders of the House of Lords) as Baron Ganzoni, of Ipswich in the County of Suffolk on 17 November 1999. He also gave his name to the new \\"Belstead Centre\\" at Woodbridge School. ==Personal life== Lord Belstead never married. He died in December 2005, aged 73, when both the hereditary peerage and the baronetcy became extinct. He is buried in the churchyard of St Mary's, Great Bealings, Suffolk. He was an active Freemason and president of the Board of General Purposes for the United Grand Lodge of England.Conservatives at heart of freemasonry, The Independent. Retrieved 29 May 2016.

In guns, internal ballistics covers the time from the propellant's ignition until the projectile exits the gun barrel. The study of internal ballistics is important to designers and users of firearms of all types, from small-bore rifles and pistols, to high- tech artillery. For rocket-propelled projectiles, internal ballistics covers the period during which a rocket motor is providing thrust.http://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/ballisticsElements of Armament Engineering, Part Two, Ballistics, AMCP 706-107, 1963 ==Parts and equations== Hatcher breaks the duration of interior ballistics into three parts: *Lock time, the time from sear release until the primer is struck *Ignition time, the time from when the primer is struck until the projectile starts to move *Barrel time, the time from when the projectile starts to move until it exits the barrel. There are many processes that are significant. The source of energy is the burning propellant. It generates hot gases that raise the chamber pressure. That pressure pushes on the base of the projectile, and causes the projectile to accelerate. The chamber pressure depends on many factors. The amount of propellant that has burned, the temperature of the gases, and the volume of the chamber. The burn rate of the propellant depends not only on the chemical make up, but also on the shape of the propellant grains. The temperature depends not only on the energy released, but also the heat lost to the sides of the barrel and chamber. The volume of the chamber is continuously changing: as the propellant burns, there is more volume for the gas to occupy. As the projectile travels down the barrel, the volume behind the projectile also increases. There are still other effects. Some energy is lost in deforming the projectile and causing it to spin. There are also frictional losses between the projectile and the barrel. The projectile, as it travels down the barrel, compresses the air in front of it, which adds resistance to its forward motion. Models have been developed for these processes. These processes affect the gun design. The breech and the barrel must resist the high-pressure gases without damage. Although the pressure initially rises to a high value, the pressure starts dropping when the projectile has traveled some distance down the barrel. Consequently, the muzzle end of the barrel does not need to be as strong as the chamber end. There are five general equations used in interior ballistics: # The equation of state of the propellant # The equation of energy # The equation of motion # The burning rate equation # The equation of the form function ==History== Prior to the mid-1800s, before the development of electronics and the necessary mathematics, (see Euler), and material science to fully understand pressure vessel design, internal ballistics did not have a lot of detailed objective information. Barrels and actions would simply be built strong enough to survive a known overload (Proof test), and muzzle velocity change could be surmised from the distance the projectile traveled. In the 1800s test barrels began to be instrumented.Testing Firearms: Measuring Chamber Pressures Holes were drilled in the barrel, fitted with standardized steel pistons, acting to deform a standardized small copper cylinder pellet which is crushed when the firearm discharged. The reduction in the copper cylinder length is used as an indication of peak pressure. Industry standards defined \\"Copper Units of Pressure\\", or \\"CUP\\" for high pressure firearms. Similar standards were applied to firearms with lower peak pressures, typically common handguns, with test cylinder pellets made of more easily deformed lead cylinders, hence \\"Lead Units of Pressure\\", or \\"LUP\\". The measurement only indicated the maximum pressure that was reached at that point in the barrel. By the 1960s, piezoelectric strain gauges were also commonly used. They allow instantaneous pressures to be measured and did not need a pressure port drilled into the barrel. More recently, using advanced telemetry and acceleration-hardened sensors, instrumented projectiles were developed by the Army Research Laboratory that could measure the pressure at the base of the projectile and its acceleration.Development of a Telemetry-Enabled High-G Projectile Carrier, Army Research Laboratory, 2012 ==Priming methods== Through the years, several methods of igniting the propellant have been developed. Originally, a small hole (a touch hole) was drilled into the breech so that a fine propellant (black powder, the same propellant used in the gun) could be poured in, and an external flame or spark was applied (see matchlock and flintlock). Later, percussion caps and self-contained cartridges had primers that detonated after mechanical deformation, igniting the propellant. Another method is the use of an electric current to ignite the propellant. ==Propellants Black powder=== Gunpowder (Black powder) is a finely ground, pressed and granulated mechanical pyrotechnic mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate or sodium nitrate. It can be produced in a range of grain sizes. The size and shape of the grains can increase or decrease the relative surface area, and change the burning rate significantly. The burning rate of black powder is relatively insensitive to pressure, meaning it will burn quickly and predictably even without confinement, making it also suitable for use as a low explosive. It has a very slow decomposition rate, and therefore a very low brisance. It is not, in the strictest sense of the term, an explosive, but a \\"deflagrant\\", as it does not detonate but decomposes by deflagration due to its subsonic mechanism of flame-front propagation. ===Nitrocellulose (single-base propellants)=== Nitrocellulose or \\"guncotton\\" is formed by the action of nitric acid on cellulose fibers. It is a highly combustible fibrous material that deflagrates rapidly when heat is applied. It also burns very cleanly, burning almost entirely to gaseous components at high temperatures with little smoke or solid residue. Gelatinised nitrocellulose is a plastic, which can be formed into cylinders, tubes, balls, or flakes known as single-base propellants. The size and shape of the propellant grains can increase or decrease the relative surface area, and change the burn rate significantly. Additives and coatings can be added to the propellant to further modify the burn rate. Normally, very fast powders are used for light-bullet or low-velocity pistols and shotguns, medium-rate powders for magnum pistols and light rifle rounds, and slow powders for large- bore heavy rifle rounds. ===Double-base propellants=== Nitroglycerin can be added to nitrocellulose to form \\"double-base propellants\\". Nitrocellulose desensitizes nitroglycerin to prevent detonation in propellant-sized grains, (see dynamite), and the nitroglycerin gelatinises the nitrocellulose and increases the energy. Double-base powders burn faster than single-base powders of the same shape, though not as cleanly, and burn rate increases with nitroglycerin content. In artillery, Ballistite or Cordite has been used in the form of rods, tubes, slotted-tube, perforated-cylinder or multi-tubular; the geometry being chosen to provide the required burning characteristics. (Round balls or rods, for example, are \\"degressive-burning\\" because their production of gas decreases with their surface area as the balls or rods burn smaller; thin flakes are \\"neutral-burning,\\" since they burn on their flat surfaces until the flake is completely consumed. The longitudally perforated or multi-perforated cylinders used in large, long-barreled rifles or cannon are \\"progressive-burning;\\" the burning surface increases as the inside diameter of the holes enlarges, giving sustained burning and a long, continuous push on the projectile to produce higher velocity without increasing the peak pressure unduly. Progressive-burning powder compensates somewhat for the pressure drop as the projectile accelerates down the bore and increases the volume behind it.) ===Solid propellants (caseless ammunition)=== A recent topic of research has been in the realm of \\"caseless ammunition\\". In a caseless cartridge, the propellant is cast as a single solid grain, with the priming compound placed in a hollow at the base, and the bullet attached to the front. Since the single propellant grain is so large (most smokeless powders have grain sizes around 1 mm, but a caseless grain will be perhaps 7 mm diameter and 15 mm long), the relative burn rate must be much higher. To reach this rate of burning, caseless propellants often use moderated explosives, such as RDX. The major advantages of a successful caseless round would be elimination of the need to extract and eject the spent cartridge case, permitting higher rates of fire and a simpler mechanism, and also reduced ammunition weight by eliminating the weight (and cost) of the brass or steel case.Caseless Ammunition Small Arms. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, (Schatz), NDIA Joint Armaments Conference 2012 While there is at least one experimental military rifle (the H&K; G11), and one commercial rifle (the Voere VEC-91), that use caseless rounds, they have met with little success. One other commercial rifle was the Daisy VL rifle made by the Daisy Air Rifle Co. and chambered for .22 caliber caseless ammunition that was ignited by a hot blast of compressed air from the lever used to compress a strong spring like for an air rifle. The caseless ammunition is of course not reloadable, since there is no casing left after firing the bullet, and the exposed propellant makes the rounds less durable. Also, the case in a standard cartridge serves as a seal, keeping gas from escaping the breech. Caseless arms must use a more complex self-sealing breech, which increases the design and manufacturing complexity. Another unpleasant problem, common to all rapid- firing arms but particularly problematic for those firing caseless rounds, is the problem of rounds \\"cooking off\\". This problem is caused by residual heat from the chamber heating the round in the chamber to the point where it ignites, causing an unintentional discharge. To minimize the risk of cartridge cook-off, machineguns can be designed to fire from an open bolt, with the round not chambered until the trigger is pulled, and so there is no chance for the round to cook off before the operator is ready. Such weapons could use caseless ammunition effectively. Open-bolt designs are generally undesirable for anything but machine guns; the mass of the bolt moving forward causes the gun to lurch in reaction, which significantly reduces the accuracy of the gun, which is generally not an issue for machinegun fire. ==Propellant chargeLoad density and consistency=== Load density is the percentage of the space in the cartridge case that is filled with powder. In general, loads close to 100% density (or even loads where seating the bullet in the case, compresses the powder) ignite and burn more consistently than lower-density loads. In cartridges surviving from the black-powder era (examples being .45 Colt, .45-70 Government), the case is much larger than is needed to hold the maximum charge of high-density smokeless powder. This extra room allows the powder to shift in the case, piling up near the front or back of the case and potentially causing significant variations in burning rate, as powder near the rear of the case will ignite rapidly but powder near the front of the case will ignite later. This change has less impact with fast powders. Such high- capacity, low-density cartridges generally deliver best accuracy with the fastest appropriate powder, although this keeps the total energy low due to the sharp high-pressure peak. Magnum pistol cartridges reverse this power/accuracy tradeoff by using lower-density, slower-burning powders that give high load density and a broad pressure curve. The downside is the increased recoil and muzzle blast from the high powder mass, and high muzzle pressure. Most rifle cartridges have a high load density with the appropriate powders. Rifle cartridges tend to be bottlenecked, with a wide base narrowing down to a smaller diameter, to hold a light, high-velocity bullet. These cases are designed to hold a large charge of low-density powder, for an even broader pressure curve than a magnum pistol cartridge. These cases require the use of a long rifle barrel to extract their full efficiency, although they are also chambered in rifle-like pistols (single-shot or bolt-action) with barrels of 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 cm). One unusual phenomenon occurs when dense, low- volume powders are used in large-capacity rifle cases. Small charges of powder, unless held tightly near the rear of the case by wadding, can apparently detonate when ignited, sometimes causing catastrophic failure of the firearm. The mechanism of this phenomenon is not well known, and generally it is not encountered except when loading low recoil or low-velocity subsonic rounds for rifles. These rounds generally have velocities of under 1100 ft/s (320 m/s), and are used for indoor shooting, in conjunction with a suppressor or for pest control, where the power and muzzle blast of a full-power round is not needed or desired. ==ChamberStraight vs bottleneck=== Straight walled cases were the standard from the beginnings of cartridge arms. With the low burning speed of black powder, the best efficiency was achieved with large, heavy bullets, so the bullet was the largest practical diameter. The large diameter allowed a short, stable bullet with high weight, and the maximum practical bore volume to extract the most energy possible in a given length barrel. There were a few cartridges that had long, shallow tapers, but these were generally an attempt to use an existing cartridge to fire a smaller bullet with a higher velocity and lower recoil. With the advent of smokeless powders, it was possible to generate far higher velocities by using a slow smokeless powder in a large volume case, pushing a small, light bullet. The odd, highly tapered 8 mm Lebel, made by necking down an older 11 mm black- powder cartridge, was introduced in 1886, and it was soon followed by the 7.92√ó57mm Mauser and 7√ó57mm Mauser military rounds, and the commercial .30-30 Winchester, all of which were new designs built to use smokeless powder. All of these have a distinct shoulder that closely resembles modern cartridges, and with the exception of the Lebel they are still chambered in modern firearms even though the cartridges are over a century old. ===Aspect ratio and consistency=== When selecting a rifle cartridge for maximum accuracy, a short, fat cartridge with very little case taper may yield higher efficiency and more consistent velocity than a long, thin cartridge with a lot of case taper (part of the reason for a bottle-necked design). Given current trends towards shorter and fatter cases, such as the new Winchester Super Short Magnum cartridges, it appears the ideal might be a case approaching spherical inside. Target and vermin hunting rounds require the greatest accuracy, so their cases tend to be short, fat, and nearly untapered with sharp shoulders on the case. Short, fat cases also allow short-action weapons to be made lighter and stronger for the same level of performance. The trade-off for this performance is fat rounds which take up more space in a magazine, sharp shoulders that do not feed as easily out of a magazine, and less reliable extraction of the spent round. For these reasons, when reliable feeding is more important than accuracy, such as with military rifles, longer cases with shallower shoulder angles are favored. There has been a long-term trend however, even among military weapons, towards shorter, fatter cases. The current 7.62√ó51mm NATO case replacing the longer .30-06 Springfield is a good example, as is the new 6.5 Grendel cartridge designed to increase the performance of the AR-15 family of rifles and carbines. Nevertheless, there is significantly more to accuracy and cartridge lethality than the length and diameter of the case, and the 7.62√ó51mm NATO has a smaller case capacity than the .30-06 Springfield,Cartridge Case Capacities reducing the amount of propellant that can be used, directly reducing the bullet weight and muzzle velocity combination that contributes to lethality, (as detailed in the published cartridge specifications linked herein for comparison). The 6.5 Grendel, on the other hand, is capable of firing a significantly heavier bullet (see link) than the 5.56 NATO out of the AR-15 family of weapons, with only a slight decrease in muzzle velocity, perhaps providing a more advantageous performance tradeoff. ==Friction and inertiaStatic friction and ignition=== Since the burning rate of smokeless powder varies directly with the pressure, the initial pressure buildup,(i.e. \\"the shot-start pressure\\"), has a significant effect on the final velocity, especially in large cartridges with very fast powders and relatively light weight projectiles.Interior Ballistics of High Velocity Guns, Version 2, User's Guide, US Army Ballistics Research Laboratory, 1987 In small caliber firearms, the friction holding the bullet in the case, determines how soon after ignition the bullet moves, and since the motion of the bullet increases the volume and drops the pressure, a difference in friction can change the slope of the pressure curve. In general, a tight fit is desired, to the extent of crimping the bullet into the case. In straight-walled rimless cases, such as the .45 ACP, an aggressive crimp is not possible, since the case is held in the chamber by the mouth of the case, but sizing the case to allow a tight interference fit with the bullet, can give the desired result. In larger caliber firearms, the shot start pressure is often determined by the force required to initially engrave the projectile driving band into the start of the barrel rifling; smoothbore guns, which do not have rifling, achieve shot start pressure by initially driving the projectile into a \\"forcing cone\\" that provides resistance as it compresses the projectile obturation ring. ===Kinetic friction=== The bullet must tightly fit the bore to seal the high pressure of the burning gunpowder. This tight fit results in a large frictional force. The friction of the bullet in the bore does have a slight impact on the final velocity, but that is generally not much of a concern. Of greater concern is the heat that is generated due to the friction. At velocities of about , lead begins to melt, and deposit in the bore. This lead build-up constricts the bore, increasing the pressure and decreasing the accuracy of subsequent rounds, and is difficult to scrub out without damaging the bore. Rounds, used at velocities up to , can use wax lubricants on the bullet to reduce lead build-up. At velocities over , nearly all bullets are jacketed in copper, or a similar alloy that is soft enough not to wear on the barrel, but melts at a high enough temperature to reduce build-up in the bore. Copper build-up does begin to occur in rounds that exceed , and a common solution is to impregnate the surface of the bullet with molybdenum disulfide lubricant. This reduces copper build-up in the bore, and results in better long-term accuracy. Large caliber projectiles also employ copper driving bands for rifled barrels for spin-stabilized projectiles; however, fin-stabilized projectiles fired from both rifle and smoothbore barrels, such as the APFSDS anti-armor projectiles, employ nylon obturation rings that are sufficient to seal high pressure propellant gasses and also minimize in-bore friction, providing a small boost to muzzle velocity. ===The role of inertia=== In the first few centimeters of travel down the bore, the bullet reaches a significant percentage of its final velocity, even for high-capacity rifles, with slow burning powder. The acceleration is on the order of tens of thousands of gravities, so even a projectile as light as can provide over of resistance due to inertia. Changes in bullet mass, therefore, have a huge impact on the pressure curves of smokeless powder cartridges, unlike black- powder cartridges. The loading or reloading of smokeless cartridges thus requires high-precision equipment, and carefully measured tables of load data for given cartridges, powders, and bullet weights. ==Pressure-velocity relationships== graph of a simulation of the 5.56 mm NATO round, being fired from a barrel. The horizontal axis represents time, the vertical axis represents pressure (green line), bullet travel (red line), and bullet velocity (light blue line). The values shown at top are peak values Energy is imparted to the bullet in a firearm by the pressure of gases produced by burning propellant. While higher pressures produce higher velocities, pressure duration is also important. Peak pressure may represent only a small fraction of the time the bullet is accelerating. The entire duration of the bullet's travel through the barrel must be considered. ===Peak vs area=== This graph shows different pressure curves for powders with different burn rates. The leftmost graph is the same as the large graph above. The middle graph shows a powder with a 25% faster burn rate, and the rightmost graph shows a powder with a 20% slower burn rate. Energy is defined as the ability to do work on an object; for example, the work required to lift a one-pound weight, one foot against the pull of gravity defines a foot-pound of energy (One joule is equal to the energy needed to move a body over a distance of one meter using one newton of force). If we were to modify the graph to reflect force (the pressure exerted on the base of the bullet multiplied by the area of the base of the bullet) as a function of distance, the area under that curve would be the total energy imparted to the bullet. Increasing the energy of the bullet requires increasing the area under that curve, either by raising the average pressure, or increasing the distance the bullet travels under pressure. Pressure is limited by the strength of the firearm, and duration is limited by barrel length. ==Propellant design== Propellants are carefully matched to firearm strength, chamber volume and barrel length, and to bullet material, weight and dimensions. The rate of gas generation is proportional to the surface area of burning propellant grains in accordance with Piobert's Law. Progression of burning from the surface into the grains is attributed to heat transfer from the surface of energy necessary to initiate the reaction. Smokeless propellant reactions occur in a series of zones or phases as the reaction proceeds from the surface into the solid. The deepest portion of the solid experiencing heat transfer melts and begins phase transition from solid to gas in a foam zone. The gaseous propellant decomposes into simpler molecules in a surrounding fizz zone. Endothermic transformations in the foam zone and fizz zone require energy initially provided by the primer and subsequently released in a luminous outer flame zone where the simpler gas molecules react to form conventional combustion products like steam and carbon monoxide. The heat transfer rate of smokeless propellants increases with pressure; so the rate of gas generation from a given grain surface area increases at higher pressures. Accelerating gas generation from fast burning propellants may rapidly create a destructively high pressure spike before bullet movement increases reaction volume. Conversely, propellants designed for a minimum heat transfer pressure may cease decomposition into gaseous reactants if bullet movement decreases pressure before a slow burning propellant has been consumed. Unburned propellant grains may remain in the barrel if the energy-releasing flame zone cannot be sustained in the resultant absence of gaseous reactants from the inner zones. ===Propellant burnout=== Another issue to consider, when choosing a powder burn rate, is the time the powder takes to completely burn vs. the time the bullet spends in the barrel. Looking carefully at the left graph, there is a change in the curve, at about 0.8 ms. This is the point at which the powder is completely burned, and no new gas is created. With a faster powder, burnout occurs earlier, and with the slower powder, it occurs later. Propellant that is unburned when the bullet reaches the muzzle is wasted -- it adds no energy to the bullet, but it does add to the recoil and muzzle blast. For maximum power, the powder should burn until the bullet is just short of the muzzle. Since smokeless powders burn, not detonate, the reaction can only take place on the surface of the powder. Smokeless powders come in a variety of shapes, which serve to determine how fast they burn, and also how the burn rate changes as the powder burns. The simplest shape is a ball powder, which is in the form of round or slightly flattened spheres. Ball powder has a comparatively small surface-area-to- volume ratio, so it burns comparatively slowly, and as it burns, its surface area decreases. This means as the powder burns, the burn rate slows down. To some degree, this can be offset by the use of a retardant coating on the surface of the powder, which slows the initial burn rate and flattens out the rate of change. Ball powders are generally formulated as slow pistol powders, or fast rifle powders. Flake powders are in the form of flat, round flakes which have a relatively high surface-area-to-volume ratio. Flake powders have a nearly constant rate of burn, and are usually formulated as fast pistol or shotgun powders. The last common shape is an extruded powder, which is in the form of a cylinder, sometimes hollow. Extruded powders generally have a lower ratio of nitroglycerin to nitrocellulose, and are often progressive burning -- that is, they burn at a faster rate as they burn. Extruded powders are generally medium to slow rifle powders. ===Muzzle pressure concerns=== From the pressure graphs, it can be seen that the residual pressure in the barrel as the bullet exits is quite high, in this case over 16 kpsi / 110 MPa / 1100 bar. While lengthening the barrel or reducing the amount of propellant gas will reduce this pressure, that often is not possible due to issues of firearm size and minimum required energy. Short-range target guns usually are chambered for .22 Long Rifle or .22 Short, which have very tiny powder capacities and little residual pressure. When higher energies are required for long-range shooting, hunting or anti-personnel use, high muzzle pressures are a necessary evil. With these high muzzle pressures come increased flash and noise from the muzzle blast, and, due to the large powder charges used, higher recoil. Recoil includes the reaction caused not just by the bullet, but also by the powder mass and speed (with the residual gases acting as a rocket exhaust). However, for a muzzle brake to be effective there must be significant muzzle pressure. ==General concernsBore diameter and energy transfer=== A firearm, in many ways, is like a piston engine on the power stroke. There is a certain amount of high-pressure gas available, and energy is extracted from it by making the gas move a piston -- in this case, the projectile is the piston. The swept volume of the piston determines how much energy can be extracted from the given gas. The more volume that is swept by the piston, the lower is the exhaust pressure (in this case, the muzzle pressure). Any remaining pressure at the muzzle or at the end of the engine's power stroke represents lost energy. To extract the maximum amount of energy, then, the swept volume is maximized. This can be done in one of two ways -- increasing the length of the barrel or increasing the diameter of the projectile. Increasing the barrel length will increase the swept volume linearly, while increasing the diameter will increase the swept volume as the square of the diameter. Since barrel length is limited by practical concerns to about arm's length for a rifle and much shorter for a handgun, increasing bore diameter is the normal way to increase the efficiency of a cartridge. The limit to bore diameter is generally the sectional density of the projectile (see external ballistics). Larger-diameter bullets of the same weight have much more drag, and so they lose energy more quickly after exiting the barrel. In general, most handguns use bullets between .355 (9 mm) and .45 (11.5 mm) caliber, while most rifles generally range from .223 (5.56 mm) to .32 (8 mm) caliber. There are many exceptions, of course, but bullets in the given ranges provide the best general-purpose performance. Handguns use the larger-diameter bullets for greater efficiency in short barrels, and tolerate the long-range velocity loss since handguns are seldom used for long-range shooting. Handguns designed for long-range shooting are generally closer to shortened rifles than to other handguns. ===Ratio of propellant to projectile mass=== Another issue, when choosing or developing a cartridge, is the issue of recoil. The recoil is not just the reaction from the projectile being launched, but also from the powder gas, which will exit the barrel with a velocity even higher than that of the bullet. For handgun cartridges, with heavy bullets and light powder charges (a 9√ó19mm, for example, might use of powder, and a bullet), the powder recoil is not a significant force; for a rifle cartridge (a .22-250 Remington, using of powder and a bullet), the powder can be the majority of the recoil force. There is a solution to the recoil issue, though it is not without cost. A muzzle brake or recoil compensator is a device which redirects the powder gas at the muzzle, usually up and back. This acts like a rocket, pushing the muzzle down and forward. The forward push helps negate the feel of the projectile recoil by pulling the firearm forwards. The downward push, on the other hand, helps counteract the rotation imparted by the fact that most firearms have the barrel mounted above the center of gravity. Overt combat guns, large-bore high-powered rifles, long-range handguns chambered for rifle ammunition, and action-shooting handguns designed for accurate rapid fire, all benefit from muzzle brakes. The high-powered firearms use the muzzle brake mainly for recoil reduction, which reduces the battering of the shooter by the severe recoil. The action-shooting handguns redirect all the energy up to counteract the rotation of the recoil, and make following shots faster by leaving the gun on target. The disadvantage of the muzzle brake is a longer, heavier barrel, and a large increase in sound levels and flash behind the muzzle of the rifle. Shooting firearms without muzzle brakes and without hearing protection can eventually damage the operator's hearing; however, shooting rifles with muzzle brakes - with or without hearing protection - causes permanent ear damage. (See muzzle brake for more on the disadvantages of muzzle brakes.) Powder-to-projectile-weight ratio also touches on the subject of efficiency. In the case of the .22-250 Remington, more energy goes into propelling the powder gas than goes into propelling the bullet. The .22-250 pays for this by requiring a large case, with much powder, all for a fairly small gain in velocity and energy over other .22 caliber cartridges. ===Accuracy and bore characteristics=== Nearly all small bore firearms, with the exception of shotguns, have rifled barrels. The rifling imparts a spin on the bullet, which keeps it from tumbling in flight. The rifling is usually in the form of sharp edged grooves cut as helices along the axis of the bore, anywhere from 2 to 16 in number. The areas between the grooves are known as lands. Another system, polygonal rifling, gives the bore a polygonal cross section. Polygonal rifling is not very common, used by only a few European manufacturers as well as the American gun manufacturer Kahr Arms. The companies that use polygonal rifling claim greater accuracy, lower friction, and less lead and/or copper buildup in the barrel. Traditional land and groove rifling is used in most competition firearms, however, so the advantages of polygonal rifling are unproven. There are three common ways of rifling a barrel, and one emerging technology: * The most basic is to use a single point cutter, drawn down the bore by a machine that carefully controls the rotation of the cutting head relative to the barrel. This is the slowest process, but as it requires the simplest equipment, it is often used by custom gunsmiths, and can result in superbly accurate barrels. * The next method is button rifling. This method uses a die with a negative image of the rifling cut on it. This die is drawn down the barrel while carefully rotated, and it swages the inside of the barrel. This \\"cuts\\" all the grooves at once (it does not really cut metal), and so is faster than cut rifling. Detractors claim that the process leaves considerable residual stress in the barrel, but world records have been set with button-rifled barrels, so again there is no clear disadvantage. * The last common method used is hammer forging. In this process, a slightly oversized, bored barrel is placed around a mandrel that contains a negative image of the entire length of the rifled barrel. The barrel and mandrel are rotated and hammered by power hammers, which forms the inside of the barrel all at once. This is the fastest (and in the long run, cheapest) method of making a barrel, but the equipment is prohibitively expensive for all but the largest gun makers. Hammer-forged barrels are strictly mass-produced, so they are generally not capable of top accuracy as produced, but with some careful hand work, they can be made to shoot far better than most shooters are capable of. * A new technique being applied to barrel manufacture is electrical machining, in the form of Electrical discharge machining (EDM) or Electro chemical machining (ECM). These processes use electricity to erode away material, a process which produces a highly consistent diameter and very smooth finish, with less stress than other rifling methods. EDM is very costly and primarily used in large bore, long barrel cannon, where traditional methods are very difficult, while ECM is used by some smaller barrel makers. The purpose of the barrel is to provide a consistent seal, allowing the bullet to accelerate to a consistent velocity. It must also impart the right spin, and release the bullet consistently, perfectly concentric to the bore. The residual pressure in the bore must be released symmetrically, so that no side of the bullet receives any more or less push than the rest. The muzzle of the barrel is the most critical part, since that is the part that controls the release of the bullet. Some rimfires and airguns actually have a slight constriction, called a choke, in the barrel at the muzzle. This guarantees that the bullet is held securely just before release. To keep a good seal, the bore must be a very precise, constant diameter, or have a slight decrease in diameter from breech to muzzle. Any increase in bore diameter will allow the bullet to shift. This can cause gas to leak past the bullet, affecting the velocity, or cause the bullet to tip, so that it is no longer perfectly coaxial with the bore. High quality barrels are lapped to remove any constrictions in the bore which will cause a change in diameter. A lapping process known as \\"fire lapping\\" uses a lead \\"slug\\" that is slightly larger than the bore and covered in fine abrasive compound to cut out the constrictions. The slug is passed from breech to muzzle, so that as it encounters constrictions, it cuts them away, and does no cutting on areas that are larger than the constriction. Many passes are made, and as the bore becomes more uniform, finer grades of abrasive compound are used. The final result is a barrel that is mirror-smooth, and with a consistent or slightly tapering bore. The hand-lapping technique uses a wooden or soft metal rod to pull or push the slug through the bore, while the newer fire-lapping technique uses specially loaded, low-power cartridges to push abrasive-covered soft-lead bullets down the barrel. Another issue that has an effect on the barrel's hold on the bullet is the rifling. When the bullet is fired, it is forced into the rifling, which cuts or \\"engraves\\" the surface of the bullet. If the rifling is a constant twist, then the rifling rides in the grooves engraved in the bullet, and everything is secure and sealed. If the rifling has a decreasing twist, then the changing angle of the rifling in the engraved grooves of the bullet causes the rifling to become narrower than the grooves. This allows gas to blow by, and loosens the hold of the bullet on the barrel. An increasing twist, however, will make the rifling become wider than the grooves in the bullet, maintaining the seal. When a rifled-barrel blank is selected for a gun, careful measurement of the inevitable variations in manufacture can determine if the rifling twist varies, and put the higher-twist end at the muzzle. The muzzle of the barrel is the last thing to touch the bullet before it goes into ballistic flight, and as such has the greatest potential to disrupt the bullet's flight. The muzzle must allow the gas to escape the barrel symmetrically; any asymmetry will cause an uneven pressure on the base of the bullet, which will disrupt its flight. The muzzle end of the barrel is called the \\"crown\\", and it is usually either beveled or recessed to protect it from bumps or scratches that might affect accuracy. A sign of a good crown will be a symmetric, star-shaped pattern on the muzzle end of the barrel, formed by soot deposited, as the powder gases escape the barrel. If the star is uneven, then it is a sign of an uneven crown, and an inaccurate barrel. Before the barrel can release the bullet in a consistent manner, it must grip the bullet in a consistent manner. The part of the barrel between where the bullet exits the cartridge, and engages the rifling, is called the \\"throat\\", and the length of the throat is the freebore. In some firearms, the freebore is all but nonexistent -- the act of chambering the cartridge forces the bullet into the rifling. This is common in low-powered rimfire target rifles. The placement of the bullet in the rifling ensures that the transition between cartridge and rifling is quick and stable. The downside is that the cartridge is firmly held in place, and attempting to extract the unfired round can be difficult, to the point of even pulling the bullet from the cartridge in extreme cases. With high-powered cartridges, there is an additional disadvantage to a short freebore. A significant amount of force is required to engrave the bullet, and this additional resistance can raise the pressure in the chamber by quite a bit. To mitigate this effect, higher-powered rifles tend to have more freebore, so that the bullet is allowed to gain some momentum, and the chamber pressure is allowed to drop slightly, before the bullet engages the rifling. The downside is that the bullet hits the rifling when already moving, and any slight misalignment can cause the bullet to tip as it engages the rifling. This will, in turn, mean that the bullet does not exit the barrel coaxially. The amount of freebore is a function of both the barrel and the cartridge. The manufacturer or gunsmith who cuts the chamber will determine the amount of space between the cartridge case mouth and the rifling. Setting the bullet further forward or back in the cartridge can decrease or increase the amount of freebore, but only within a small range. Careful testing by the ammunition loader can optimize the amount of freebore to maximize accuracy, while keeping the peak pressure within limits. ===Revolver-specific issues=== The defining characteristic of a revolver is the revolving cylinder, separate from the barrel, that contains the chambers. Revolvers typically have 5 to 10 chambers, and the first issue is ensuring consistency among the chambers, because if they aren't consistent then the point of impact will vary from chamber to chamber. The chambers must also align consistently with the barrel, so the bullet enters the barrel the same way from each chamber. The throat in a revolver is part of the cylinder, and like any other chamber, the throat should be sized so that it is concentric to the chamber and very slightly over the bullet diameter. At the end of the throat, however, things change. First, the throat in a revolver is at least as long as the maximum overall length of the cartridge, otherwise the cylinder cannot revolve. The next step is the cylinder gap, the space between the cylinder and barrel. This must be wide enough to allow free rotation of the cylinder even when it becomes fouled with powder residue, but not so large that excessive gas is released. The next step is the forcing cone. The forcing cone is where the bullet is guided from the cylinder into the bore of the barrel. It should be concentric with the bore, and deep enough to force the bullet into the bore without significant deformation. Unlike rifles, where the threaded portion of the barrel is in the chamber, revolver barrels threads surround the breech end of the bore, and it is possible that the bore will be compressed when the barrel is screwed into the frame. Cutting a longer forcing cone can relieve this \\"choke\\" point, as can lapping of the barrel after it is fitted to the frame. ==See also== * External ballistics * Percussion cap, for an early history of priming powder and percussion caps * Terminal ballistics * Transitional ballistics * Physics of firearms * Table of handgun and rifle cartridges ==References* * A (Very) Short Course in Internal Ballistics, Fr.

It lies in the Raigad district, east of Mumbai across the Dharamtar Creek. Uran is primarily a fishing and agriculture village, which has developed into the special economic zone of Uran. The primary languages spoken are Agri and Koli which is a dialect of Marathi-Kokani. ==History== The city name is derived from the Hindu goddess Uranavati. It was called Uruvan during the rule of Madhavrao I, the fourth Peshwa of the Maratha Empire. Later, the area was named Uran by the Portuguese and Ooran by the British. Many Indian dynasties have ruled the area. In early history, these included the Maurya Empire, SƒÅtavƒÅhana Empire, Western Kshatrapas, VƒÅkƒÅ·π≠aka Empire, Chalukyas, and Yadavas. The area around Mumbai was under Portuguese and British rule in the 16th to 19th centuries. Uran was subject to the Maratha princely states in the Maharashtra. Uran was once the base of the famous Maratha Sarkhel (Admiral) Kanhoji Angre, who battled European naval interests in the 18th century. ==Geography== Uran is located at . Uran is at an average elevation of . On the tip of a peninsula, Uran district is surrounded by sea on three sides. The town of Uran itself is centrally located on the peninsula, flanked by Karanja village to the south and Mora village and port to the north. Uran is home to extensive salt pans, part of a long-standing network of salt manufacturing around Mumbai. The land has been under redevelopment pressure. The Uran wetlands were once home to many species of birds and reptiles, some critically endangered. The wetlands were developed in 2009 and 2010, leaving only the Panje-Dongri wetlands. Dronagiri mandir Karanja Khopate Uran ==Economy== ONGC Oil and Gas Processing Platform in the Bombay High oilfield Jaskhar Fair at night in the month of April The main occupation in Uran is fishing; 80% of the fish production of Mumbai comes from fishermen based out of the Uran district, especially the villages of Karanja and Mora. The second major occupation is farming. Uran contributes to the production of rice in the Raigad district. Raigad is the second largest district in terms of rice production in India. Shipping, shipbuilding, and port support are major economic factors in Uran district. Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPT) is the largest container terminal in India. Other container terminals in the Uran district include APM Terminals (formerly GTI) and DP World (formerly the British Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company). Salt pan owners revolted against the government decision to build a seaport, but the port has proved to be the main source of income to residents and nearby villages, as major projects and warehouses have opened nearby. The Indian Navy maintains a naval base near Mora. Due to Security reasons sea travel restrictions is imposed by the Indian Navy . The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has a plant nearby. GTPS-MSEB is Asia's first power plant run by natural gas. Other industrial and manufacturing employers Grindwell Norton Limited, NAD, and the Skols Brewery (closed in 2005). ==Demographics== Uran is growing. In the 2001 India census, Uran had a population of 23,254; this had increased by the 2011 census to 30,439. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. In Uran, 10‚Äì11% of the population is 6 years of age or younger. Uran's average literacy rate is also rising, from 79% in 2001 to 82% in 2011. Female literacy lags behind male literacy: male literacy was 83% in 2001 and 85% in 2011, and female literacy was 75% in 2001 and 79% in 2011.

It was originally published serially in the Strand Magazine and illustrated by New- Zealand-born artist Harry Rountree during the months of April‚ÄìNovember 1912. The character of Professor Challenger was introduced in this book. The novel also describes a war between indigenous people and a vicious tribe of ape-like creatures. == Plot summary == The group encountering Iguanodon Edward Malone, a young reporter for the Daily Gazette, asks his editor for a dangerous assignment to impress the woman he loves, Gladys, who wishes for a great man capable of brave deeds and actions. His task is to approach the notorious Professor Challenger, who dislikes the popular press intensely and physically assaults intrusive journalists. The subject is to be his recent South American expedition which, surrounded by controversy, guarantees a hostile reaction. As a direct approach would be instantly rebuffed, Malone instead masquerades as an earnest student. On meeting the professor he is startled by his intimidating physique, but believes his ruse is succeeding. Seeing through the masquerade, then confirming Malone's scientific knowledge is non-existent, Challenger erupts in anger and forcibly throws him out. Malone earns his respect by refusing to press charges with a policeman who saw his violent ejection into the street. Challenger ushers him back inside and, extracting promises of confidentiality, eventually reveals he has discovered living dinosaurs in South America, following up an expedition by a now-deceased previous American explorer named Maple White. At a tumultuous public meeting in which Challenger experiences further ridicule (most notably from a professional rival, Professor Summerlee), Malone volunteers for an expedition to verify the discoveries. His companions are to be Professor Summerlee, and Lord John Roxton, an adventurer who helped end slavery on the Amazon; the notches on his rifle showing how many slavers he killed doing so. Running the gauntlet of hostile tribes, the expedition finally reaches the lost world with the aid of Indian guides, who are superstitiously scared of the area. Summerlee retains his scepticism ‚Äì although being delighted at making other scientific discoveries in the field of botany and entomology: even a glimpse of a pterodactyl at a distance fails to convince him, believing it is some species of stork (the sharper-eyed Roxton is inclined to agree it is not a stork but has no clue what it really is), until a night-time encounter when it flies down and is seen by all at close range, as it steals the companions' dinner. After this, Summerlee apologises to Challenger. The cliffs to the plateau itself prove to be apparently unscalable, but an adjacent pinnacle turns out to be climbable, and moreover, has a tall tree which can be cut down and used as a bridge, which allows the four explorers to cross to the plateau. However, they are almost immediately trapped on it, thanks to the treachery of one of their luggage-porters, Gomez: who, as it turns out, is a former slaver whose brother had previously been killed by Roxton during his anti-slavery activities. Gomez takes his revenge by dropping the tree off the cliff, stranding the explorers on the plateau. Gomez himself is subsequently killed by another porter, a negro ex-slave named Zambo, who remains loyal to the party: but the latter is unable to do much more to help, other than send some of the company's supplies over by rope. Whilst investigating the wonders of the lost world, discovering many plants and creatures thought to be extinct, they narrowly escape an attack from pterodactyls. Although barely escaping with their lives, Roxton takes great interest in nearby blue clay deposits. At night a ferocious dinosaur is about to break through the thorn bushes surrounding their camp; Roxton averts disaster by bravely dashing at it, thrusting a blazing torch at its face to scare it away. Later, all except Malone are captured by a race of ape-men. Whilst in captivity they discover that a tribe of natives, with whom the ape-men are at war, inhabit the other side of the plateau. Roxton escapes and together with Malone mounts a rescue, preventing many unpleasant deaths, including a young native who is a prince of his tribe. The rescued natives take the party to their village, then with the help of their firepower return to defeat the ape-men. After witnessing the power of their guns, the tribe wish to keep them on the plateau but, helped by the young prince they saved, they eventually discover a tunnel leading back to the outside world. During their time with the tribe, Roxton plans how to capture a pterodactyl chick, and succeeds in doing so. Upon return to England, despite full reports from Malone many detractors continue to dismiss the expedition's account, much as they had Challenger's original story ‚Äì although Summerlee, having been on the expedition, has now switched sides and is supporting Challenger. Anticipating this, at a public meeting Challenger produces the young pterodactyl as proof, transfixing the audience and leaving them in no doubt of the truth. The explorers are instantly feted as heroes, and on a wave of adulation find themselves carried shoulder-high from the hall by cheering crowds. The pterodactyl, in the confusion, makes its escape and is witnessed several times at different locations around London, causing consternation wherever it goes, but is last seen heading off to the southwest in the probable direction of its home. At a private celebratory dinner, Roxton reveals to the others that the blue clay contained diamonds ‚Äì he had been tipped off to the possibility, by the recollection of a similar feature in South Africa ‚Äì and that he managed to extract about ¬£200,000 worth, which is to be split between them, Challenger plans to open a private museum with his share, Summerlee plans to retire and categorise fossils. Malone returns to his love, Gladys, hoping she will recognise his achievements. Instead, he finds she has now selfishly changed her mind and married a very ordinary man instead, an insignificant clerk. Astonished at this turn of events, and with nothing to keep him in London, he decides to accompany Roxton back to the lost world. ==Characters== *Professor George Edward Challenger, a zoologist *Edward D.

In that book, published in 1864, the creatures live under the earth in and around a subterranean sea. In 1915, the Russian scientist Vladimir Obruchev produced his own version of the \\"lost world\\" theme in the novel Plutonia, which places the dinosaurs and other Jurassic species in a fictional space inside the hollow Earth connected to the surface via an opening in the Russian Far North. In 1916, Edgar Rice Burroughs published The Land That Time Forgot, his version of The Lost World where lost submariners from a German U-Boat discovered their own lost world of dinosaurs and ape-men in Antarctica. Two other books in the series followed. Author Greg Bear set his 1998 novel Dinosaur Summer in Doyle's lost world. A 1994 release for the Forgotten Futures role-playing game was based on and includes the full text of the Professor Challenger novels and stories. Doyle's title was reused by Michael Crichton in his 1995 novel The Lost World, a sequel to Jurassic Park. (Its film adaptation, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, followed suit.) Both the book and its movie adaptation share a somewhat similar setting with the Doyle story, involving a journey to an isolated area filled with living dinosaurs. At least two similarly named TV shows, Land of the Lost and Lost, nod to this source material, although the latter draws more from Doyle's short story \\"The Lost Special\\". At least two of the characters in Michael Crichton's novel The Lost World mention a palaeontologist called John Roxton. However, Crichton's Roxton, who is never seen, is something of an idiot, wrongly identifying one dinosaur and publishing a report stating that the braincase of Tyrannosaurus rex is the same as that of a frog and thus possesses a visual system attuned strictly to movement. In the Valiant Comics series, Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, Turok meets Professor Darwin Challenger, a descendant of Professor George Edward Challenger, who accompanies him during the several adventures. Darwin bears strong resemblance to his ancestor in both character and appearance. He is seen to be in possession of a Dimorphodon specimen shot by his grandfather and mentions that Maple White Land had since been destroyed in a cataclysmic event prior to the 1990s. One of the Neopets plots, \\"Journey to The Lost Isle\\" is based on this book, with Roxton A. Colchester III, Hugo & Lillian Fairweather, and Werther as the adventurers, with Captain Rourke and Scrap as the guides. The book was adapted in Czech comics by Vlastislav Toman/Ji≈ô√≠ Ve≈°krna (Prvn√≠ v√Ωprava do Ztracen√©ho svƒõta, 1970, 24 pages), followed by a sequel The Second Expedition (Druh√° v√Ωprava, Vlastislav Toman/Franti≈°ek Kobl√≠k, 26 pages) (reprinted together in Velk√° kniha Komiks≈Ø, ). The 2002 animated adventure Dinosaur Island is an attempt to blend the original story with the popular reality series format, and was written by John Loy, writer of similar productions such as The Land Before Time. Rafael Chandler's 2016 supplement \\"The World of the Lost\\" for the OSR Lamentations of the Flame Princess Weird Fantasy Role-Playing game system references the Doyle book not only in its title, but also in its contents and setting themes, including prehistoric creatures on a plateau and a savage war forming the setting's background. ==References to actual history, geography and current science== Map of Maple-White Land The characters of Ed Malone and Lord John Roxton were modelled, respectively, on the journalist E. D. Morel and the diplomat Roger Casement, leaders of the Congo Free State reform campaign (the Congo Reform Association), which Doyle supported.Daniel Stashower. Teller of Tales: The Life of Arthur Conan Doyle. Henry Holt & Co., New York, 1999, pgs. 321-22 The setting for The Lost World is believed to have been inspired by reports of Doyle's good friend Percy Harrison Fawcett's expedition to Huanchaca Plateau in Noel Kempff Mercado National Park, Bolivia. Fawcett organised several expeditions to delimit the border between Bolivia and Brazil ‚Äì an area of potential conflict between both countries. Doyle took part in the lecture of Fawcett in Royal Geographical Society on 13 February 1911 and was impressed by the tale about the remote \\"province of Caupolican\\" (present day Huanchaca Plateau) in Bolivia ‚Äì a dangerous area with impenetrable forests, where Fawcett saw \\"monstrous tracks of unknown origin\\".Harold T. Wilkins. Secret Cities of Old South America. Cosimo Inc., New York, 2008, p. 199 Fawcett wrote in his posthumously published memoirs: \\"monsters from the dawn of man's existence might still roam these heights unchallenged, imprisoned and protected by unscalable cliffs. So thought Conan Doyle when later in London I spoke of these hills and showed photographs of them. He mentioned an idea for a novel on Central South America and asked for information, which I told him I should be glad to supply. The fruit of it was his Lost world in 1912, appearing as a serial in the Strand Magazine [sic], and subsequently in the form of a book that achieved widespread popularity.\\"P. H. Fawcett, Brian Fawcett. Exploration Fawcett. 1953, p. 122 Additionally, a 1996 Science Fiction Studies review of an annotated edition of the novel suggested that another inspiration for the story may have been the 1890s contested political history of the Pacaraima Mountains plateaux, and Mount Roraima in particular. The dinosaur that attacks the camp during the night is vividly described (‚ÄòIn the deep shadow of the tree...a crouching form full of savage vigour and menace... not higher than a horse, but the dim outline suggested vast bulk and strength). Identified as an Allosaurus, in real life it would have been more fearsome still, though the book also allowed the possibility of it being Megalosaurus or a juvenile Allosaurus, which would be closer to the description. The novel also details a brief encounter with a giant snake, estimated by Challenger to have been over 50 feet long. Though not based on any known snake at the time, its inclusion likely came from reports by Fawcett. In 1907, Fawcett claimed to have witnessed and killed a giant anaconda of a similar size, though his report was unverified. However, the 2009 discovery of Titanoboa fossils, which could fit the description given in the novel, indicates snakes of gargantuan size did indeed exist in prehistoric eras. ==Film, television and radio adaptationsFilm=== *The Lost World (1925; film) **Wallace Beery as Professor Challenger **Lewis Stone as Lord John Roxton **Lloyd Hughes as Edward Malone **Bessie Love as Paula White (additional character) **Arthur Hoyt as Professor Summerlee **Alma Bennett as Gladys Hungerford **Bull Montana as Gomez **Jules Cowes as Zambo *The Lost World (1960; film) **Claude Rains as Professor Challenger **Michael Rennie as Lord John Roxton **David Hedison as Edward Malone **Jill St. John as Jennifer Holmes (additional character) **Richard Haydn as Professor Summerlee **Fernando Lamas as Manuel Gomez **Ray Stricklyn as David Holmes (additional character) **Jay Novello as Costa (additional character) *The Lost World (1992; film) **John Rhys-Davies as Professor Challenger **Eric McCormack as Edward Malone **Tamara Gorski as Jenny Nielson (additional character) **David Warner as Professor Summerlee **Darren Peter Mercer as Jim (additional character) **Nathania Stanford as Malu (additional character) *Return to the Lost World (1992; sequel film) **John Rhys-Davies as Professor Challenger **Eric McCormack as Edward Malone **Tamara Gorski as Jenny Nielson (additional character) **David Warner as Professor Summerlee **Darren Peter Mercer as Jim (additional character) **Nathania Stanford as Malu (additional character) *The Lost World (1998; film) **Patrick Bergin as Professor Challenger **David Nerman as Lord John Roxton (In this version, Roxton is an American big game hunter and the film's main antagonist) **Julian Casey as Arthur Malone (originally Edward Malone) **Jayne Heitmeyer as Amanda White (additional character) **Michael Sinelnikoff as Professor Leo Summerlee (originally simply Professor Summerlee) **Gregoriane Minot Payeur as Djena (additional character) *The Lost World (2001; television film) **Bob Hoskins as Professor Challenger **Tom Ward as Lord John Phillip Roxton (originally simply Lord John Roxton) **Matthew Rhys as Edward Malone **Elaine Cassidy as Agnes Cluny (additional character) **James Fox as Professor Leo Summerlee (originally simply Professor Summerlee) **Peter Falk as Reverend Theo Kerr (additional character) *King of the Lost World (2005) **Bruce Boxleitner as Lt.

He and his wife Margaret (n√©e Spencer- Nairn, 1924‚Äì2012) had four children, three daughters and one son. == Career == Atkins was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire, and served in the Royal Navy from 1940 to 1948. He worked for Nairn's, his wife's family's linoleum business in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, then became a director of a financial advertising agency. He contested the constituency of West Lothian in 1951, and was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Merton and Morden in 1955. He became MP for Spelthorne in 1970. Atkins was a Conservative Chief Whip from 1973 to 1979, and served as a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland from 1979 to 1981. On September 1981, he was appointed as Lord Privy Seal, which was a role as the chief government spokesman in the House of Commons for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. This role was necessary because the Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, sat in the House of Lords. He resigned in April 1982, along with Lord Carrington, over the Falklands invasion. Atkins was appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George as a Knight Commander (KCMG) in the 1983 Dissolution Honours. He left the House of Commons in 1987 and was created a life peer on 16 October as Baron Colnbrook of Waltham St Lawrence in the Royal County of Berkshire.

The ' New Lodge' estate is located to the north of Barnsley on the A61 near Athersley. The earliest reference to New Lodge dates from 1377, when the area was referred to as 'Newe Laythes', becoming New Laithes in 1541.On Our Street: Life in Athersley, New Lodge and Smithies, Roundhouse Community Partnership, 2006, p. 7 Maps from 1850 show 8 or 9 farm outbuildings at New Lodge, together with the large stone built manor house with its long carriageway and the 'Roundhouse' lodge on the Wakefield Turnpike (now the A61). The manor house was built around 1800 by the York architect John Clarke for his nephew John Carr. The 'Roundhouse', an unusual eight-sided building, was demolished in the mid-20th century, and its site is now occupied by the Roundhouse Medical Centre. The manor house remained in private hands until the 1940s; it subsequently became a private club until it was purchased by Barnsley Borough Council in 1947 and converted into a home for elderly ladies in 1950. The home was closed down in 1990 and the historic building was badly vandalised, but restored and extended as a private residential home in 1992. New Lodge Crescent with Tarran houses (left) and new homes being constructed (2009) Today New Lodge is a predominantly council housing estate. Prior to the Second World War, the area was mostly farmland, but was purchased by Barnsley Council in 1946 for the express purpose of creating a new housing estate. A document of conveyance dated 16 November 1946, recording the purchase of the land from the Barn-Murdoch family by Barnsley Council for a sum of ¬£7750, can be found in the Athersley Archives.On Our Street: Life in Athersley, New Lodge and Smithies, Roundhouse Community Partnership, 2006, p. 9 Factory built houses, or prefabs, comprise most of the estate. These are of the concrete section Tarran type, and the BISF houses, known as the 'tin houses'. By the late 1940s there was a thriving community of predominantly mining families and the estate was completed in the early 1950s with conventional brick houses. Regent Crescent and Park Avenue were called New Lodge before the council estate was built. The estate is currently undergoing a renovation, with the replacement of some of the Tarran houses and major upgrades to the remaining stock. == References == Category:Housing estates in England Category:Geography of Barnsley ","title":"New Lodge, South Yorkshire"},{"id":"833601","text":"Pavlovo-Posadsky District () is an administrativeLaw #11/2013-OZ and municipalLaw #41/2005-OZ district (raion), one of the thirty-six in Moscow Oblast, Russia.

Population: ==History== View of Tsarskaya Street in Pavlovsky Posad around 1910 A typical house in Pavlovsky Posad The town of Pavlovsky Posad was founded in 1844 by merging several villages (Pavlovo, Dubrovo, Zakharovo, and Melenki). From its very foundation, the land on which the town stands belonged to the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius monastery of the Russian Orthodox Church. Later, from the mid-17th century, the land came into state ownership. Due to these peculiarities, Pavlovsky Posad never knew serfdom. ==Administrative and municipal status== Within the framework of administrative divisions, Pavlovsky Posad serves as the administrative center of Pavlovo-Posadsky District.Resolution #123-PG As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Pavlovo-Posadsky District as the Town of Pavlovsky Posad. As a municipal division, the Town of Pavlovsky Posad is incorporated within Pavlovo-Posadsky Municipal District as Pavlovsky Posad Urban Settlement.Law #41/2005-OZ ==Economy== From the very beginning Pavlovsky Posad has had the textile industry as its main business. This industry is still the most prominent in modern town. During the 1990s, most textile factories were transformed into public corporations and went through bankruptcy. The public float index for these factories is currently extremely low: about 90-95% of each factory's shares are owned by one person. The town has also always been famous for its Pavlovo Posad shawl factories. One of these factories, Pavlovo-Posadkaya Manufaktura, is still producing traditional shawls and kerchiefs in the Russian style. Some other factories survived by concentrating on fire-equipment (such as fire hoses); whereas others yet are producing vestments for Orthodox priests. ===Transportation=== The Moscow‚ÄìVladimir railway goes through the town. ==Religion== Pokrovsko- Vasilyevsky Monastery was established near the cemetery in the beginning of the 20th century. In the monastery there's a cathedral that actually incorporates two independent churches: the upper church of Pokrov and the lower of St. Basil the Confessor, who was Vasily Gryaznov's saint patron. For his missionary work among the old believers, Vasily Gryaznov was granted sainthood in 1999. A cathedral also has a belltower. Both the cathedral and the belltower are built in the so-called pseudo-Russian style. There's also a little church of St. Andrey Rublev at the monastery gates.

It was part of the Hearst syndicate. The afternoon Herald-Express and the morning Examiner, both of which had been publishing in the city since the turn of the 20th century, merged in 1962. For a few years after this merger, the Herald Examiner claimed the largest afternoon-newspaper circulation in the country. It published its last edition on November 2, 1989.Judy Pasternak and Thomas B. Rosenstiel, \\"Herald Examiner Will Halt Publishing Today,\\" Los Angeles Times, November 2, 1989 ==Early years== William Randolph Hearst founded the Los Angeles Examiner in 1903, in order to assist his campaign for the presidential nomination on the Democratic ticket, complement his San Francisco Examiner, and provide a union-friendly answer to the Los Angeles Times. At its peak in 1960, the Examiner had a circulation of 381,037. It attracted the top newspapermen and women of the day. The Examiner flourished in the 1940s under the leadership of City Editor James H. Richardson, who led his reporters to emphasize crime and Hollywood scandal coverage. The Herald Examiner was the result of a merger with the Los Angeles Herald-Express in 1962. In turn, the Herald-Express had been the result of a merger between the Los Angeles Evening Express and Evening Herald in 1931. The Herald-Express was also Hearst-owned and excelled in tabloid journalism under City Editor Agness Underwood, a veteran crime reporter for the Los Angeles Record before moving to the Herald-Express first as a reporter and later its city editor. With the merger in 1962, the newspaper became an afternoon-only newspaper. The Examiner, while founded as a pro-labor newspaper, shifted to a hard-right stance by the 1930s, much like the rest of the Hearst chain. It was pro-law enforcement and was vehemently anti-Japanese during World War II. Its editorials openly praised the mass deportation of Mexicans, including U.S. citizens, in the early 1930s, and was hostile to liberal movements and labor strikes during the Depression. Its coverage of the Zoot Suit Riots in Los Angeles during World War II also was particularly harsh on the Mexican-American community. Much of its conservative rhetoric was minimized when Richardson retired in 1957. Underwood remained on staff following the merger in an upper management position, leaving the day- to-day operations to younger editors. The Hearst Corporation decided to make the new Herald Examiner an afternoon paper, leaving the morning field to the Los Angeles Times (which at the same time had ceased publication of the evening Mirror). However, readers' tastes and demographics were changing. Afternoon newspaper readership was declining as television news became more prominent, while expanding suburbs made it harder to distribute papers during the rush hour. The fact that sports leagues were playing more night games also meant that evening newspapers were no longer able to print full results. Indeed, by the 1950s Hearst's morning papers such as the Examiner had their income siphoned off merely to support the chain's faltering afternoon publications. Following the merger between the Herald-Express and Examiner, readership of the morning Los Angeles Times soared to 757,000 weekday readers and more than 1 million on Sunday. The Herald Examiners circulation dropped from a high of 730,000 in the mid-1960s to 350,000 in 1977. By the time it folded in 1989 its circulation was 238,000. ==Strike and closure== On December 15, 1967, Herald Examiner employees began a strike that lasted almost a decade and resulted in at least $15 million in losses. At the time of the labor strike, the paper's circulation was about 721,000 daily and it had 2,000 employees. The strike ended in March 1977, with circulation having dropped to about 350,000 and the number of employees to 700. Owner William Randolph Hearst, Jr.'s confrontational response prolonged the unrest. Hearst hired a number of replacement employees to keep the paper going, as well as Pinkerton guards to maintain security, protect the strike-breakers and harass the strikers. Numerous violent incidents took place between pickets and strike- breakers, as well as confrontations between the guards and the Los Angeles Police Department. === Final years === The paper enjoyed a journalistic and spiritual renaissance beginning in 1978, when Jim Bellows was hired as its editor. Bellows and his successor, Mary Ann Dolan, brought an infusion of new talent, youth and energy to the newsroom. The excitement of rejuvenating a newspaper in Los Angeles with a storied past attracted a stream of young journalists, many with Ivy League credentials. The paper's scrappy, no-holds- barred, often unconventional coverage repeatedly challenged the dominant Los Angeles Times on stories about City Hall, local politics, the Los Angeles Police Department, the arts and sports, and its coverage was recognized repeatedly for its excellence by the Los Angeles Press Club. The paper was also slightly schizophrenic: its entertainment section was hip, its sport section was blue-collar and its news hole straddled the tabloid and kick-ass journalism genres. However, as an after-effect of the 10-year long strike, advertising and circulation continued to decline. The paper switched back to a morning publication in 1982, 20 years after the merger; this did little to improve sagging revenue and readership. Furthermore, having two editions led to higher production costs. The afternoon edition was dropped during 1989. In 1989, the Hearst Corporation attempted to sell the moribund newspaper, but found no suitable buyers (News Corporation intended to buy the paper and turn it into a tabloid, but backed out). This led to the company's shutting down the newspaper. On November 2, 1989, the paper printed its last edition, with a banner head saying \\"SO LONG, L.A.!\\" One factor behind the shutdown was increased pressure from the competing Los Angeles Times, whose circulation was, at the time of the Herald Examiner's shutdown, about four times larger. Editorial writer Joel Bellman recalled that by then the newspaper'sJoel Bellman, \\"My Herald Examiner Days,\\" LAObserved.com, November 2, 2019 > once-splendid 1913 Julia Morgan-inspired Mission Revival building had gone > to seed, the ground-floor arched windows long since covered over as a result > of vandalism . . . .

Examiner news reporter Will Fowler was on another assignment with photographer Felix Paegel on January 15, 1947, when they heard a radio call of a mutilated female body found in a vacant lot on Norton Avenue in the Leimert Park area of Los Angeles. Fowler and Paegel arrived before police and observed the female body. Fowler claimed in his autobiography that he knelt down to close the victim's eyes before Paegel began shooting photographs. City editor Richardson in his own autobiography had another, more mundane version of the Examiner obtaining the story. He said that reporter Bill Zelinsky called the city desk from Los Angeles Police headquarters to report the discovery of the body and a reporter and photographer were dispatched to the lot where a crowd of newsmen was already assembled. Whatever the facts were, the morning Examiner scooped the other Los Angeles newspapers by publishing an extra edition two hours before any of the afternoon newspapers hit the streets. By the late afternoon of January 15, an autopsy on the female victim was completed by the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office. The victim's fingerprints were scheduled to be airmailed to the FBI fingerprint identification division in Washington, D.C. Examiner Assistant Managing Editor Warden Woolard suggested to Los Angeles police Capt. Jack Donahoe, who was chief of the department's homicide division, that the victim's fingerprints be transmitted to the FBI by using the Examiners new soundphoto machine. During the early morning hours of January 16, the International News Photo wire service received the prints via photo transmission from the Examiner. Soon afterward, the FBI identified the victim as Elizabeth Short. In the early afternoon of January 16 an Examiner extra hit the streets, again beating the competition. The Examiner identified Short and provided details of her life growing up in Massachusetts, and details of her adult life in Santa Barbara and later in Los Angeles. The Examiner noted that Short had lived in Los Angeles for a period of time before moving to various other cities in the pursuit of jobs and men. She returned to Los Angeles in 1946 and lived in hotels and rooming houses while visiting a man she had met while living in Florida. Following Short's identification, reporters from the Los Angeles Examiner contacted her mother, Phoebe Short, and told her that her daughter had won a beauty contest. Only after prying as much personal information as they could from Phoebe did the reporters tell her that her daughter had been murdered. The newspaper offered to pay her air fare and accommodations if she would travel to Los Angeles to help with the police investigation. That was yet another ploy, since the newspaper kept her away from police and other reporters to protect its scoop. Each day the Examiner came up with more details of Short's murder, and painted her as a lovelorn woman searching for a husband. The Los Angeles Daily News was getting hammered daily by the Examiner. The newspaper's editors were so desperate for fresh stories that they sent rookie reporter Roy Ringer to the Examiners offices on Broadway. Ringer was new and unknown to Examiner newsmen. He walked into the Examiners composing room from off the street and lifted the Black Dahlia story proofs off the spikes and walked out. The Daily News city desk then rewrote the Examiner‚Äôs stories. After three days of stealing Examiner copy, Ringer walked into the composing room on the fourth day for a fresh batch of Black Dahlia stories. As he was about to grab a handful of proofs from the spike, someone from behind grabbed his shoulder. Behind Ringer was Examiner city editor James Richardson. \\"Nice try\\", said Richardson, as he sent Ringer back to the Daily News empty-handed. At one point an anonymous tip led Examiner reporters to the Greyhound bus station in downtown Los Angeles, where a steamer trunk owned by Short was discovered. Inside were letters, photographs and clothing belonging to the victim. The Examiner obtained the contents and led coverage of Short's life leading up to her death based on her own personal records and in her own voice. In another instance, more photos, newspaper clippings and letters were anonymously mailed to the Examiner. Richardson often said in subsequent interviews about his years at the Examiner that he believed the letters were from Short's killer. The Black Dahlia case was never solved, but for three months it led most of the Los Angeles newspaper's front pages until other sensational homicides replaced it. ===Jailing of William Farr=== During the 1970 Los Angeles murder trial of Charles Manson and his followers, who were charged with the 1969 murders of actress Sharon Tate and six others, Herald Examiner reporter William Farr reported in an article that Manson had planned to murder Elizabeth Taylor and Frank Sinatra. Farr was summoned by judge Charles Older to divulge his sources for the article. Farr refused. But at that time, Farr had already left the Herald Examiner to work for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office and later for the Los Angeles Times. Farr cited the California reporters shield law that protected him from revealing his sources, but Older ruled that since Farr was no longer a journalist he was required to hand over his notes. Farr continued to refuse to reveal his sources and was jailed for 46 days in 1972-73 on a contempt of court citation. Although he was released from custody, his case dragged through the courts for several years. The courts, however, recognized that a journalist could spend the rest of his life in jail if he refuses to divulge his sources on moral principle. In 1974, a California State Court of Appeal determined in In re Farr (36 C.A. 3d 577, 1974) that a procedure had to be adopted that allowed the courts to hold a hearing to consider a contempt of court citation involving the shield law. The first issue was whether a reporter was refusing to reveal sources by invoking the shield on \\"moral principle\\". The second consideration by the court was whether incarcerating the reporter would likely induce him or her to reveal the sources. In 1976, the state appellate court finally set aside the contempt citation. The Farr case in effect strengthened the California shield law and served as a precedent in future shield law cases involving journalists.Jailed & subpoenaed journalists ‚Äî a historical timeline, Freedom Forum Institute, Gordon T.

Hearst paid $1 million in 1913 for the parcel, which had been part of railroad magnate Henry Huntington's land holdings. The building was designed in the Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival styles, largely by San Francisco architect Julia Morgan, then associated with Los Angeles architects J. Martyn Haenke and William J. Dodd, whose contribution to the design is not yet determined by scholars. The building was completed in 1914, and is a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. Georgetown Co., a New York real estate developer, obtained control of the site in 2015. Renovation plans include restaurants and shops on the ground floor and offices in the remainder of the space. Walter and Margarita Manzke were planning to opening a restaurant there. In 2019, Arizona State University announced plans to locate its Los Angeles campus in the building. ==Notable staff membersWriters and editors=== * James Bacon, entertainment reporter and author * Jim Bellows, editor, later developed Entertainment Tonight * Winfred Blevins, entertainment editor, author of 40 books and screenplays * Alex Ben Block, reporter, later editor of The Hollywood Reporter * Denis Boyles, entertainment writer, 1979-1981 * Jim Burns, travel editor, later newspaper adviser for \\"The Occidental Weekly\\" * Harrison Carroll, entertainment writer 1925‚Äì1969 * Ruben Castaneda, reporter, author of S Street Rising * Jim Cramer, author and host of CNBC's \\"Mad Money\\" * Francis L.

During his time at university he was President of the Durham Union for Epiphany term of 1936. He served in the Royal Artillery in World War II, gaining the rank of Captain. ==Political career== Peart was elected Member of Parliament for Workington in 1945, serving until 1976. He initially served as PPS to the Minister of Agriculture & Fisheries (Tom Williams). Peart, along with the rest of the Labour Party, went into opposition after Sir Winston Churchill's 1951 election victory. In 1964, he returned to government after Harold Wilson defeated Sir Alec Douglas-Home at that year's election. He was appointed to the Cabinet holding the Cabinet post of Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. His tenure saw advances in pay for agricultural labourers, and in technology. In 1968, Peart became Lord Privy Seal, with no particular responsibilities. Seven months later, Peart became Leader of the House of Commons, taking the subsidiary title Lord President of the Council. After Labour lost the 1970 election, Peart returned to opposition as Shadow Leader of the House of Commons. He held that position until December 1971, when he became Shadow Agriculture Minister. When Labour returned to power, Peart once more took the Agriculture portfolio. On 6 June 1975, Peart was involved in a train accident; he was on board a London to Glasgow sleeper train which crashed at Nuneaton, he survived the accident with minor injuries. On 23 September 1976, Peart was created a life peer as Baron Peart, of Workington in the County of Cumbria, to serve as Leader of the House of Lords and Lord Privy Seal at a time when the Labour faction in the Lords was tiny compared to the vast Tory majority, mainly composed of hereditary peers. After Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 election, Peart continued as Leader of the Labour Peers and thus became Shadow Leader of the House of Lords. He served in those roles until 1982, when he was defeated for re-election by Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos in a vote among Labour peers. ==See also== * List of Durham University people * List of Presidents of the Durham Union ==References== == External links == * - - - - - - - - - - - Category:1914 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Agriculture ministers of the United Kingdom Category:Alumni of the College of the Venerable Bede, Durham Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:Cumbria MPs Category:GMB-sponsored MPs Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Labour Party (UK) life peers Category:Leaders of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom Category:Leaders of the House of Lords Category:Lord Presidents of the Council Category:Lords Privy Seal Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Ministers in the Wilson governments, 1964‚Äì1970 Category:Presidents of the Durham Union Category:Royal Artillery officers Category:UK MPs 1945‚Äì1950 Category:UK MPs 1950‚Äì1951 Category:UK MPs 1951‚Äì1955 Category:UK MPs 1955‚Äì1959 Category:UK MPs 1959‚Äì1964 Category:UK MPs 1964‚Äì1966 Category:UK MPs 1966‚Äì1970 Category:UK MPs 1970‚Äì1974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974‚Äì1979 Category:UK MPs who were granted peerages ","title":"Fred Peart, Baron Peart"},{"id":"833613","text":"Top of the New Lodge Road near its junction with the Antrim Road The New Lodge () is an urban, working class Catholic community in Belfast, Northern Ireland, immediately to the north of the city centre. The landscape is dominated by several large tower blocks. The area has a number of murals, mostly sited along the New Lodge Road. The locality is demarcated by Duncairn Gardens, Antrim Road, Clifton Street, and dependent on opinion, York Street or North Queen Street. North Queen Street and Duncairn Gardens have often seen rioting between republicans and loyalists. The New Lodge is also an electoral ward of Belfast City Council. ==History== The area now known as the New Lodge was once open farmland within the original 17th-century city walls of the town of Belfast. The name of the area probably derives from the farm lodge at Solitude, now the location of the home ground of Cliftonville F.C.. The Old Lodge Road, now largely demolished, ran from Peter's Hill to the bottom of the Oldpark Road, while the New Lodge Road would have continued along the line of the modern Cliftonville Road. With Belfast's explosive expansion as an industrial city in the 19th century, the New Lodge developed as a built up, inner-City area; its residents came from both the Protestant and Catholic communities. The area between Lepper Street and the Antrim Road was largely filled with slum housing for the workers in the Lepper Mill, while the area between York Street and North Queen Street provided the same standard of accommodation for workers in the Gallagher tobacco factory and York Street Mill on York Street. The area between the New Lodge Road and Duncairn Gardens was historically occupied by the better-off working-class families, while Duncairn Gardens itself and Clifton Street were upmarket well into the 20th century. Victoria Barracks, a major British army barracks, was an important feature of the area. The only remnants of it are the street name, where about 10 former officers houses are in use today, the old Barrack wall (on North Queen Street beside the police station) and the former army gym, now a social centre known locally as \\"The Recy.\\" The New Lodge was heavily damaged in the Belfast Blitz in 1941, in which many streets were laid waste by the concentrated bombing on the nearby factories, mills and army barracks; Burke Street, which ran between Dawson and Annadale streets was completely levelled in the 15/16 April Easter Tuesday raid, with all its inhabitants killed. The subsequent destruction of large swathes of housing stock began a process of movement to the suburbs and depopulation which continues to the present. After the Second World War, many people from the New Lodge moved to new housing developments in suburban areas like Ballymurphy, New Barnsley, Rathcoole and Glengormley. In the 1950s, the army barracks was closed and the area was redeveloped with a mixture of low-rise and tower block buildings. Much of the population of the Sailortown area of Belfast's docklands moved here in the 1960s. The local Catholic church is St. Patrick's on Donegall Street The New Lodge, on the edge of the city centre, with a history of active Irish republicanism and surrounded by Loyalist areas saw much violence during The Troubles. Most of the remaining Protestant population left under intimidation in the early 1970s, to be replaced by Catholics intimidated from Loyalist areas of Belfast. The McGurk's Bar bombing occurred on 4 December 1971 in North Queen Street. After initially being blamed on the Provisional Irish Republican Army, it was claimed by the Ulster Volunteer Force. As a stronghold of the Third Battalion of the Provisional IRA's Belfast Brigade, rioting and gun battles between the IRA and the British Army and loyalist paramilitaries were almost daily occurrences during the early 1970s and other periods of high political tension such as the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike, and occurred sporadically during the rest of that period. The area was vulnerable to attacks by Loyalist paramilitaries throughout The Troubles, particularly to drive-by shootings. The corner of the New Lodge Road and the Antrim Road was statistically the most dangerous spot to stand at in Northern Ireland. The last fatal IRA attack in the area before the ceasefire came in August 1992, when guardsman Damien Shackleton was killed by a sniper. Despite this daily life proceeded and the area benefitted from housing improvement and slum clearance during the 1980s, with new high standard public housing. However, despite this, the improvement in the general economic situation and the IRA and Loyalist ceasefires of 1994, depopulation continued apace as people left for the suburbs. In recent years, Northern Ireland has become an attractive destination for many immigrants from the developing world and Eastern Europe. The New Lodge has seen immigration from Poland, Latvia and Lithuania since the expansion of the European Union in 2004. ==Local politics== The Dock Ward was one of 15 wards of Belfast City Council prior to 1973. Its boundaries were the Antrim Road, Clifton Street, North Queen St, Great George's Street and Brougham Street. From 1973‚Äì1985 the eastern boundary of the New Lodge ward was North Queen Street. The boundaries were extended to York Street and Clifton Park Avenue in 1985. In 1993 the Antrim Road boundary was restored with the Unity flats area added. These boundaries are used for census information. The Dock Ward of Belfast City Council mainly returned Unionists with slim majorities in the pre-War years, with Nationalists winning from the 1940s and becoming more dominant as time moved on. In the post-War years, the New Lodge was historically the political stronghold of Gerry Fitt. The co-terminous Stormont parliamentary constituency was the most marginal constituency, changing hands at every election until 1965. It was won by the Ulster Unionist Party in 1929, Northern Ireland Labour Party in 1933, Unionists in 1938, NILP in 1945, Unionists in 1949, Irish Labour in 1953, Unionists in 1958, Irish Labour (Gerry Fitt) in 1962, and Republican Labour (Fitt again) in 1965 and 1969. The Westminster parliamentary constituency was part of East Belfast until the 1974 elections and has formed part of North Belfast since then (although the areas east of North Queen Street were in West Belfast from 1983‚Äì1997). Politically, Sinn F√©in now dominate the area although previously parts of the area were, along with the Lower Falls, one of the strongest areas for Official Republicanism in Belfast ‚Äì especially the areas around the Carlisle estate and Henry Street. Seamus Lynch was elected for the Republican Clubs and their successor parties between 1977 and 1993 and a social club for supporters of the Workers Party and Official IRA survived until the late 80s. ==Social conditions== A rainbow over Donore Court, with Republican murals While the housing stock is now largely of a high standard, and the Belfast economy has improved dramatically from the nadir of the 1980s, the New Lodge remains an area of considerable social deprivation. The Northern Ireland Index of Multiple Deprivation lists the New Lodge as the fifth most deprived of 581 wards in Northern Ireland, and the second most deprived in terms of income. The high score comes in spite of it being the least deprived of the 581 in terms of access to services, lying on the edge of the city centre and with major health and education facilities nearby. 70.8% of the local school population are entitled to free school meals. Less than a quarter of households in the New Lodge own their own homes, with the vast majority renting from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive or other social landlords. 40.4% of local 16-year-olds gained five or more good GCSEs in 2002, well below the Northern Ireland average, but higher than most similarly deprived areas in England. 27.7% of 18-year-olds went on to further or higher education in the same year. With increasing property prices in the Belfast area in recent years, a higher proportion of younger and better qualified people have stayed in the area with affordable property which is within walking distance of the city centre. The graveyard in Henry Place houses the graves of many people prominent in Belfast's history, most notably United Irishman Henry Joy McCracken. The area is quite close to all amenities including the City Centre, the Mater Hospital and Cityside (Yorkgate) Shopping Centre. A previous attempt was made to establish a local supermarket at the Ashton Centre however this failed after the opening of the Yorkgate complex in 1991. ==Culture== Graffiti on North Queen Street in honour of George Best. In common with similar areas, much local cultural and social life revolves around the pub scene, in the New Lodge itself and in the nearby Docks area. Live rock, blues, techno and Irish traditional music are regularly performed. The New Lodge Festival was devised as an alternative to the traditional Internment Night bonfire, which often led to violence. The festival is linked to the West Belfast Festival and Ardoyne fleadh and sees a wide range of musical events, children's activities, amateur sport and historical and cultural discussions. Many local people are passionate football fans. Gaelic football and boxing are also popular ‚Äì Hugh Russell, who won a flyweight bronze medal in the 1980 Moscow Olympics came from the area and still lives nearby. In September 2011, pop star Rihanna chose to film scenes for her music video We Found Love in the New Lodge area.\\"Rihanna music video shoot in Belfast\\" UTV News ==2001 Census== The New Lodge is one of the 60 wards of Belfast City Council.

A psychopathic assassin, Bullseye uses the opportunities afforded by his line of work to exercise his homicidal tendencies and to work out his own personal vendetta against Daredevil. He is also an enemy of the Punisher. Although he possesses no superpowers, Bullseye is able to use almost any object as a lethal projectile, be it weapons like shuriken and sai or seemingly harmless objects like playing cards and pencils. His marksmanship is uncanny, at a nearly supernatural level. Bullseye was 20th in IGN's list of the \\"Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time\\", and 35th in their list of \\"The Top 50 Avengers\\". The character has been adapted into various forms of media relating to Daredevil. He has been portrayed by Colin Farrell in the 2003 film adaptation and by Wilson Bethel as Benjamin \\"Dex\\" Poindexter in the third season of the Netflix Daredevil television adaptation. ==Publication history== The character's first appearance is in Daredevil #131 (March 1976). Although created by writer Marv Wolfman and artist John Romita Sr., the book features art by Bob BrownWolfman, in an undated \\"Comics Channel\\" interview in Underground Online, recalled: \\"Bob Brown is the artist that drew the book, but he didn't co-create him. I had come up with the character, designed a rough version of the costume and then sat down with John Romita Sr. to do the final version. and Klaus Janson. Bullseye's real name and origins are unknown. He has used the name \\"Benjamin Poindexter\\" on several occasions, but there are also instances where his name is given as ‚ÄúLester\\". The miniseries Bullseye: Greatest Hits (2004) developed the character's backstory, but also revealed that some or all of it has been fabricated, probably by Bullseye himself. In this series, Bullseye's name was Leonard. Following Civil War, Warren Ellis took over writing Thunderbolts and Bullseye became one of the core members of the new team line-up.Better Know a Thunderbolt: Bullseye , Newsarama, November 28, 2006 In the Secret Invasion aftermath storyline Dark Reign, Bullseye becomes a member of the Dark Avengers under the alias HawkeyeTHE OSBORN SUPREMACY: Dark Avengers, Comic Book Resources, January 22, 2008 and features in a five-issue limited series Dark Reign: Hawkeye, written by Andy Diggle, with art by Tom Raney.What's in a Name?

Bullseye is killed by Daredevil in Shadowland #1, but is later confirmed alive in Daredevil Vol. 3 #26. ==Fictional character biographyEarly life and back-story=== Bullseye grew up in The Bronx, where he lived with his brother and their abusive father. His brother's main form of recreation was playing with rifles, leading him to become an expert shot. When he was 10 years old, his brother started a fire in their home in an unsuccessful attempt to kill their father. Shortly thereafter, Bullseye was placed in a foster home, and became a baseball player in high school. He was an extremely talented pitcher, and was offered a scholarship, but instead opted to enter the minor leagues. After three games, he was called up to play a sold-out Major League game. He had surrendered no hits the entire game, and in the bottom of the ninth with two outs, he became bored and requested the coach pull him from the game. The coach refused, and insisted that he finish the game. The opposing team's batter mocked him, accusing him of cowardice. Bullseye threw the ball at his head, killing him. As the ball struck, he said only one word: \\"Bullseye\\". He was barred from professional baseball and convicted of manslaughter. This is a retcon of a previous origin story, which depicts Bullseye growing up as a below average student in a trailer park with an alcoholic, physically abusive father. In this version of events, Bullseye fakes his father's suicide using a handgun set off by a toy arrow. It is unclear how many elements of this version are actually true. His cold demeanor and unique skills, however, meant subsequent recruitment by the National Security Agency as an assassin was inevitable, and he was soon assigned to train Contras in Nicaragua. By the time he arrived, however, he claimed to have already been planning to leave the NSA. He had planned on robbing the Contras blind and fleeing, but soon discovered they were desperately poor. Bullseye made the best of the situation: within seven hours of being informed of their poverty, he had led the Contras in seizing a landing strip that the Colombian cocaine smugglers were using as a staging area before moving on to the United States. Without use of the airfield, the smugglers were unable to send new shipments. Bullseye set up his hapless Nicaraguan translator Paolo as the leader of the new force controlling the airfield, and let the word spread around, however, Paolo was nothing but a patsy. Bullseye planned to invite several organized crime heads to the airfield to broker a new deal with him as Paolo's supposed \\"right hand man\\". He would take their money and disappear, presumably leaving Paolo to suffer the wrath of the Mafia, Russian Mafia, Yakuza, and various other criminal elements. However, before the deal could be finalized, the Punisher (Frank Castle) arrived. Castle killed all the organized crime leaders in a fiery explosion from which Bullseye barely escaped. The two engaged in a fierce battle in which Bullseye was able to wound the Punisher and evade or disable several of his weapons. Bullseye then used some blood-reddened mud to paint a bull's-eye on his forehead, mocking Castle's inability to hit him. The fight concluded when Drug Enforcement Administration agents arrived, and the Punisher fled. Bullseye turned himself in to the D.E.A. agents and soon was assigned to infiltrate the Kingpin's criminal empire. He obtained a costume, fled yet again, and became one of the most dangerous hitmen in the world. All of the above information is given by Bullseye during a subsequent interrogation by US intelligence. Just prior to escaping from custody, Bullseye confesses he made up some or all of his story to amuse himself; for example, he claims that he was really the one who started the fire which burned down his childhood home. The whole capture was a plan by the assassin to gain access to the prison where his father is being held. Bullseye finally gets revenge on his father, leaving him to burn as the prison's security systems torch everything inside. ===Costumed criminal career=== Bullseye battles (and defeats) Daredevil at a circus in order to establish his reputation as an extortionist.Daredevil #131-132.

Marvel Comics. and who survived only because of his mutant healing factor, Bullseye's surgery was performed properly by Lord Dark Wind himself, and thus included the special herb treatment which prevents the body from being destroyed by the implantation. Bullseye has a compulsive need to study his targets' histories, abilities, and relationships before engaging them. He employs this information to attempt to anticipate his opponents' movements in combat. This compulsion often crosses from the professional into the personal, such as Bullseye's obsession with Elektra. Due to a mutual head injury, Bullseye was able to sense Daredevil's presence psychically for a brief time.Daredevil #197-199.

In 1857, Matt served as a cabin boy on the first American naval vessel to visit Japan. The entire crew besides Matt was killed by The Devil Who Dares, a ronin forced into service by the Giant Shogun in return for restoring his blinded son's sight. The Shogun planned to steal the ship's cargo of gunpowder and ammunition, however, Matt detonated the explosives and destroyed the ship, escaping in a lifeboat. He returned to America and served in the Civil War, becoming an expert marksman. He was hired by the Shogun as a mercenary to kill the Devil's son, who had adopted his father's identity. Realising that the Shogun was the true architect of his friend's deaths, and troubled when the Shogun ordered him to kill the Devil's partner Elektra in cold blood, Bullseye stood by and allowed Devil to kill him. Bullseye became the Devil's friend and was eventually appointed the first American ambassador to Japan. His great-great-grandson wrote a best selling novel based on the Devil's adventures. What If: Daredevil #1. Marvel Comics. ==In other mediaTelevision=== Wilson Bethel as Benjamin Poindexter in Daredevil. The character adopting Daredevil's suit and persona is a loose reference to the Daredevil: Born Again storyline, where the Kingpin let a mental patient loose in Daredevil's costume in order to kill Foggy Nelson. The character makes his television debut as Benjamin \\"Dex\\" Poindexter in season three of the live-action Netflix series Daredevil, portrayed by Wilson Bethel, while his young self portrayed by Cameron Mann and his teenage self portrayed by Conor Proft. Born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Dex was orphaned as a child and grew up in a group home. While there, he took up playing little league baseball, focusing his aim until he could hit the same spot on a brick wall repeatedly, carving a hole in the ball's shape. When his coach benched him to allow his teammates field time, Dex rebounded the ball off a post and into the back of his coach's head, killing his coach. His therapist diagnosed him with borderline personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder with possible psychopathic tendencies. After the therapist died, she left Dex with tapes of their sessions to ground him, encouraging him to search for a \\"north star\\" (someone to guide him on how to act in society). After a stint at a suicide prevention hotline, during which he befriended a colleague named Julie Barnes, followed by a few years in the Army, he joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a SWAT sniper and Ray Nadeem's colleague, eventually ending up on a detail assigned to protecting Wilson Fisk. While transferring Fisk to the Presidential Hotel, the convoy is attacked by Albanian gunmen seeking to kill Fisk as retaliation for snitching on them. Dex manages to free himself from his car and singlehandedly kills every one of the assailants, using a combination of trick shots and improvised weaponry. Fisk takes notice of Dex's talents, seeing him as a man ideal for his plans, and orders his lawyer Big Ben Donovan and fixer Felix Manning to dig up everything they can on Dex. While this is happening, Fisk directs corrupt FBI personnel on his payroll to open an internal investigation into Dex's actions, to ensure he gets suspended from duty. He also has Julie bribed to take a job as a waitress at the hotel's restaurant so that Dex will reach out to her. They share a drink but, when she discovers that he has been stalking her, she abruptly leaves, leaving Dex distraught and ever angrier. Once Dex is suspended, Fisk has Felix take him to Melvin Potter to be outfitted in a Daredevil costume, with which Dex will impugn the real Daredevil's reputation, also calling himself Daredevil. After receiving the costume, Dex is sent to attack the New York Bulletin and get rid of Jasper Evans, a lifer whom Fisk had paid to shank him and who was about to make a testimony, as part of his plans to manipulate the FBI into releasing him, as well as discredit Karen Page on account of her association with the real Daredevil. He kills several of Karen's coworkers in the newsroom before being temporarily halted by Matt Murdock. A drawn-out fight ensues between Matt and Dex, which ends when Dex wounds Matt by stabbing him with a pair of scissors and crushing him with a bookshelf. With Matt incapacitated, Dex forces his way into a breakroom, where he wounds Foggy Nelson and Mitchell Ellison before shooting Jasper Evans with Karen's gun. He then flees the scene, fighting off Ray Nadeem and his men as they converge on the scene. A few days later, Dex decides to reach out to Julie to ask for help; although reluctant at first, she accepts. Fisk finds out about their meeting, and has his men kill Julie while sending Dex text messages posing as her claiming that she doesn't want to see him again, which further increases Dex's mental instability and despondency. Meanwhile, Matt and Nadeem learn the truth about Dex while following a tip from Melvin Potter. They break into his apartment and attempt to find evidence on him, but are forced to flee when Dex comes home early and opens fire on them, wounding Nadeem. When Nadeem tries to blow the whistle on Dex to SAC Tammy Hattley, she reveals she is also in on Fisk's conspiracy, killing a FBI supervisor with Nadeem's gun. With help from Manning, Hattley blackmails him into working with Dex. On orders from Fisk, Dex and Nadeem round up crime bosses John Hammer, Everett Starr, Rosalie Carbone, Latimer Zyl, and Sophia Carter for a secret meeting at which Fisk extorts a protection tax from them, with Dex donning his Daredevil costume again to kill Starr for refusing to pay. Following the meeting, Fisk dispatches Dex to kill Karen to avenge her murder of James Wesley, Fisk's former aide and closest friend. With Nadeem reluctantly acting as his driver, Dex tracks Karen down to the Clinton Church and prepares to kill her, but is thwarted by Matt's timely intervention. Matt and Karen fight Dex off, but not before he is able to kill Father Lantom with one of his batons. Dex returns to the church in FBI outfit minutes later, and tries to smoke Matt and Karen out. Following Foggy's intervention, Karen surrenders while Matt escapes; then Foggy, backed by Brett Mahoney, convinces a conflicted Nadeem to have the NYPD take her into custody, which infuriates Dex. Following Matt and Foggy's effort to put Nadeem in front of a grand jury the next day, Vanessa decides that Nadeem needs to be killed to keep from telling all about what he knows of Fisk's operation, an assignment which is carried out that night by Dex. In the interim, Matt realizes that he needs to break Dex's loyalty to Fisk; by torturing Felix he learns about Julie's murder, which he then reveals to Dex. Subsequently, Dex dons his Daredevil costume and attacks Fisk and Vanessa's wedding, chases them up to their penthouse, and tries to kill Vanessa before Matt intercedes. After a three-way struggle with Matt and Fisk, Dex is defeated when Fisk breaks his back, paralyzing him, before Matt defeats Fisk in front of Vanessa. Dex is later shown on an operating table, with doctors performing an experimental surgery to restore his spine. ===Film=== Colin Farrell portrayed Bullseye in the 2003 Daredevil film adaptation. This version has an Irish background, and his traditional costume was dropped in favor of a biker/metalhead style appearance: a reptile-skin duster (trench coat), leather pants, black tank top, dark goatee, tattoos, multiple earrings, and a shaved head with a bull's-eye branding on his forehead (although he does jokingly request a costume from the Kingpin). Prior to the film's release, the comic book version adopted a near-identical appearance but has since reverted to the traditional look, retaining only the scar. Director Mark Steven Johnson credited Joe Quesada for talking him out of using the traditional costume. In the movie, Bullseye uses shurikens carried in his belt buckle as his main weapon, although he uses many small objects, including peanuts, paperclips, playing cards, shards of broken glass, and a pencil with as much ease. He is hired by the Kingpin to kill Nikolas Natchios. Bullseye fights with Daredevil and kills Natchios with Daredevil's billy club, causing Elektra Natchios to believe Daredevil is the killer. Bullseye perceives Daredevil as a personal challenge, because Daredevil is the only target he has ever missed. Elektra later seeks revenge on Daredevil but soon realizes Bullseye is Natchios's killer. Elektra and Bullseye battle, and he brutally kills Elektra. Daredevil chases Bullseye to a church, and they battle until Daredevil maneuvers Bullseye's hands to be shot by an ESU sniper, leaving him with wounds resembling stigmata. Daredevil grabs and throws him out of a window, crashing onto the hood of Ben Urich's car. A final scene shows him hospitalized but still able to flick a hypodermic needle with enough force and accuracy to impale a fly without killing it. Colin Farrell was attached to the role in December 2001. Farrell, adopting an American accent for most of his previous films, was encouraged to keep his Irish accent. Farrell had to read Frank Miller's Daredevil comics to understand Bullseye > \\"because the expression on the character's faces in the comic books, and > just the way they move sometimes, and the exaggerations of the character I'm > playing [‚Ä¶] he's so over-the-top that you do draw from that. But it's not > exactly a character you can do method acting for... you know, running around > New York killing people with paper clips.\\" ===Video games=== * Bullseye made a cameo appearance in The Punisher DOS video game.

McCarver played for the St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies, Montreal Expos, and Boston Red Sox between 1959 and 1980. He appeared in the MLB All-Star Game in 1966 and 1967, and was the starting catcher for the World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals in 1964 and 1967. After his playing career ended, McCarver began a career as a broadcaster, most notably for Fox Sports. McCarver called a then-record 23 World Series and 20 All-Star Games. He was the recipient of the 2012 Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasting.McCarver gets call from Baseball Hall of Fame, St. Louis Post-Dispatch (July 15, 2012) ==Early playing career== McCarver was born in Memphis, Tennessee. McCarver, following his years with Memphis' Christian Brothers High School, was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1959. Playing with the Cardinals' minor league teams of Keokuk and Rochester, McCarver reached the MLB level for the first time at the age of only 17. He spent the 1960, 1961, and 1962 seasons shuttling between St. Louis and the minor league teams of Memphis, Charleston (West Virginia), and Atlanta. In 1963, he was called up to the majors for good. ===St. Louis Cardinals=== In 1964, his tiebreaking home run in the 10th inning won Game 5 of the World Series. In 1966, McCarver was named to the All-Star Team, scored the winning run in the 10th inning of that 1966 All-Star Game, and became the first catcher to lead the National League in triples, with 13. In 1967, he finished second to teammate Orlando Cepeda for the National League Most Valuable Player award. McCarver was a member of two World Series championships during his time in St. Louis. He was the favorite catcher of the notoriously temperamental Bob Gibson, and fostered a relationship with young pitcher Steve Carlton that would keep him in the major leagues later in his career. In 1968, he was the Cardinals catcher as they took the NL pennant but lost to the Detroit Tigers in a seven-game World Series. ===Later career=== McCarver in 2017 After a trade to the Philadelphia Phillies involving, among others, his teammate Curt Flood (which led to Flood's lawsuit over baseball's reserve clause) before the 1970 season, McCarver played for the Phillies, Expos, Red Sox, and another brief stint with the Cardinals (he was replaced on the roster by the rookie Keith Hernandez). McCarver's career might have taken a different turn in 1975, when, according to Peter Gammons, McCarver (then 33 and Boston's third-string catcher) was rumored as a potential managerial replacement for struggling skipper Darrell Johnson. McCarver, however, was released (to return to the Phillies), and Johnson led the Red Sox to the '75 AL pennant. During his first stint with the Phillies, McCarver caught Rick Wise's no-hitter on June 23, 1971. At the end of the season, the Phillies traded Wise to the Cardinals for Steve Carlton, the deal reuniting McCarver with Carlton. During the 1972 season, the Phillies traded McCarver to the Montreal Expos where, on October 2, he caught the second of Bill Stoneman's two career no-hitters. On July 4, 1976, McCarver hit what is known as a \\"Grand Slam Single\\" when, after hitting a grand slam, he passed his teammate Garry Maddox on the basepath. While hosting the HBO special The Not-so-Great Moments in Sports, McCarver later claimed to have said to the umpire, \\"I didn't pass him, he lapped me.\\" Asked how Maddox could have done that, McCarver replied, \\"Sheer speed.\\" The event was commemorated in the book The Baseball Hall of Shame 3 as \\"Tim McCarver's Grand Sob.\\" McCarver finished his career as the personal catcher for Steve Carlton for the Phillies in the late 1970s. Carlton preferred McCarver to Phillies regular Bob Boone. It was quipped that when Carlton and McCarver eventually died, they would be buried 60 feet, 6 inches apart. He retired after the 1979 season to begin a broadcasting career. McCarver briefly returned to duty in September 1980, thus becoming one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to appear in Major League games in four different decades (1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s). He caught 121 shutouts during his career, ranking him 9th all-time among major league catchers. ==Broadcasting career== As a broadcaster, McCarver has enjoyed prominence as a color commentator on the network level. He has won three Emmy Awards for Sports Event Analyst. He began his broadcasting career at WPHL-TV (Channel 17) in Philadelphia, where he was paired with Richie Ashburn and Harry Kalas for Phillies games, before co-hosting HBO's Race for the Pennant in 1978 and working as a backup Game of the Week commentator for NBC in 1980. McCarver has called baseball for all four major U.S. television networks. His work at NBC was followed by stints with ABC (where he teamed with Don Drysdale on backup Monday Night Baseball games in 1984 and Al Michaels and Jim Palmer from 1985 to 1989 and again from 1994 to 1995 under the \\"Baseball Network\\" umbrella) and CBS (where he teamed with Jack Buck from 1990 to 1991 and Sean McDonough from 1992 to 1993). McCarver was paired with Joe Buck on the Fox network's MLB telecasts, a role he held from 1996 to 2013. McCarver called his first World Series in for ABC as a last minute replacement for Howard Cosell. Cosell had been removed from the broadcasts altogether after excerpts from his controversial book I Never Played the Game (which was critical of Cosell's co- workers at ABC Sports) appeared in TV Guide. Perhaps McCarver's most notable assignment for ABC prior to the 1985 World Series was as a field reporter for the 1984 National League Championship Series. Also while at ABC, he also served as a correspondent and play-by-play announcer for Freestyle skiing at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. McCarver also co-hosted the prime time coverage of 1992 Winter Olympics with Paula Zahn for CBS. He has also called games locally for the Phillies from 1980 to 1982, Mets from 1983 to 1998, Yankees from 1999 to 2001, and Giants in 2002. However, McCarver wasn't able to call the World Series wins by the Phillies in , Mets in , and Yankees in (all three wins were broadcast on NBC, but McCarver wasn't part of the broadcasting team any of those times). A notable call by McCarver followed the Yankees' victory in the 1996 World Series, which took place two days after manager Joe Torre's brother Frank received a heart transplant. As the Yankees celebrated, McCarver said: \\"Frank Torre is on the second day of his second heart. Joe Torre is in the 56th year of his first one. Both are overflowing.\\" McCarver is the only sportscaster to have covered the New York Mets and two of their rivals on a regular basis. He is one of three sportscasters to have covered the Mets and the Yankees (the others being Fran Healy and Tom Seaver) and one of three sportscasters to have covered both the Mets and the Phillies (the others being Todd Kalas and Tom McCarthy). In 2003, McCarver set a record by broadcasting his 13th World Series on national television (surpassing Curt Gowdy); in all, he called 24 Fall Classics for ABC, CBS, and Fox. Also, from 1984 (when he served as a field reporter for ABC's NLCS coverage) to 2013 (when he served as color analyst for Fox's coverage of the ALCS), McCarver never missed commentating on at least one League Championship Series per year. McCarver announced March 27, 2013 that he would leave Fox after the 2013 season. His final Fox broadcast was October 30, 2013, as the Boston Red Sox defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 6 to win the 2013 World Series. On December 8, 2013 he was hired to be a part-time analyst for the Cardinals on Fox Sports Midwest. He teamed with Dan McLaughlin to call 30 games in the 2014 season. His first game called for the Cardinals was on April 28, 2014, when they hosted the Milwaukee Brewers. At the conclusion of the season, McCarver stated that he had not yet decided whether to come back to the Cardinals' booth in 2015. However, McCarver returned to the Cardinals booth for 40 games in 2015, and continued to call a select number of games each year through 2019. In July 2020 it was announced that McCarver would not be working any telecasts during the team's shortened 2020 season, citing his doctor's recommendations due to health concerns related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. McCarver also hosted a nationally syndicated sports interview program, The Tim McCarver Show, from 2000 until 2017 when it was replaced by The James Brown Show. ===Criticism=== McCarver has elicited criticism throughout his broadcasting career. During the 1992 National League Championship Series, he criticized Deion Sanders, who also had become an NFL star, for playing both sports on the same day. For his criticism, Sanders dumped a bucket of water on McCarver three times while he was covering the National League pennant winning Atlanta Braves' clubhouse celebration for CBS. After being doused with the water, McCarver shouted at Sanders, \\"You are a real man, Deion. I'll say that.\\" Also during the 1992 post-season (when McCarver worked for CBS), Norman Chad criticized McCarver in Sports Illustrated by saying that he's someone who \\"when you ask him the time, will tell you how a watch works\\", a reference to McCarver's habit of over- analyzing. In Game 4 of the 1997 American League Championship Series, on a wild pitch with runners dashing around the bases, when umpire Durwood Merrill gestured to where the ball was, McCarver sarcastically commented that \\"maybe he was trying to tell himself where the ball is!\\" Merrill took offense to the comment, and fired back in his autobiography that he was letting the other umpires know that the situation was under control. When rule questions came up during a broadcast, McCarver misstated a rule. After a St. Louis Cardinals balk in Game 4 of the 2006 NLCS, McCarver explained, \\"You have to have 'one thousand one' when coming to a stop, and you have to stop your glove in the same place every time in front of your body,\\" when the rules state that there must be merely a complete discernible stop anywhere in front of the pitcher's body; no certain duration or location is necessary. In October 2008, just before the 2008 NLCS, McCarver made public his feelings about Manny Ramirez, calling him \\"despicable\\" and criticizing Ramirez for his perceived sloppy, lazy play in Boston and how he had suddenly turned it around in Los Angeles. Ramirez declined comment. In 2010, he compared the New York Yankees treatment of former manager Joe Torre to the treatment meted out by Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia to generals who fell out of favour with their leaders. After receiving negative comments on his position, McCarver apologized. ==Music career== On October 9, 2009, McCarver released a cover album of jazz standards entitled Tim McCarver Sings Songs from the Great American Songbook. ==Honors and awards== McCarver speaking upon being inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame, 2010. In 2010, McCarver was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame. In July 2012, McCarver won the Ford C. Frick Award for his broadcasting career. The minor league baseball stadium in Memphis was christened Tim McCarver Stadium in 1978; it was replaced by a new downtown stadium (named AutoZone Park in a naming rights arrangement) in 2000. ==Works== * * ==See also== * List of St. Louis Cardinals team records * List of Major League Baseball annual triples leaders * List of Major League Baseball players who played in four decades ==References== ==External links== *Tim McCarver at SABR (Baseball BioProject) *Tim McCarver Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:American television news anchors Category:American television reporters and correspondents Category:American television sports announcers Category:American television talk show hosts Category:Atlanta Crackers players Category:Baseball players from Tennessee Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:Ford C.

It was incorporated into the city of Ventura, California, in 2012. Montalvo is located in the southern portion of the city of Ventura, on the northern bank of the Santa Clara River. It is bounded by Victoria Avenue to the west, Ralston Street to the north, Johnson Drive to the east, and the Ventura Freeway to the south. ==History== Montalvo was founded in approximately 1887 when the Southern Pacific Railroad reached the location. J. G. Hill, credited with being the \\"founder\\" of Montalvo, laid out plans for the town site in 1886. Some accounts indicate that the community was named after Garci Rodr√≠guez de Montalvo, the Spanish author who first described the Island of California in the 1510 novel Las Sergas de Esplandi√°n. In its early days, Montalvo was served by the Washington Street railroad depot. The depot was the terminus of the Southern Pacific Railroad in Ventura County. Goods destined for Ventura and Port Hueneme were unloaded at Montalvo and taken by cart to those locations. The community also became a center for growing and processing apricots. A school was built on Grand Avenue in 1889. In the 19th century, the community had a newspaper called the Montalvo Courier or the Evening Monitor. It was a thriving community in the late 19th century. In the late 1880s, the University of Southern California planned to establish a satellite campus, to be known as the \\"Collegiate Institute\\", on a grassy knoll in Montalvo. According to one account: \\"There was a splendid hotel beside the large depot. The town boasted a daily newspaper, a Chinese laundry, a general store and post office that was the center of life along the river.\\" Montalvo promoters touted the community as \\"the Pasadena of Ventura County.\\" In the early 1900s, after railroad service was extended to Oxnard, most of the homes in Montalvo were physically relocated across the Santa Clara River to Oxnard. Oxnard became a boom town, and home mover John Brakey developed a thriving business loading homes on rollers and moving them across the dry river bed from Montalvo to Oxnard. During this time, Montalvo also lost its newspaper and printing press. By the 1920s, most of Montalvo's population had relocated elsewhere. After World War II, several residential neighborhoods were built in Montalvo. In 1952, the community formed the Montalvo Sanitary District (later renamed the Montalvo Municipal Improvement District) and built a sewage treatment plant to facilitate further development. Development was halted in 1958 when the Ventura County Health Department found the sewage treatment plant to be inadequate. After improvement to the sewage facilities, development resumed. In 1961, Ventura County master plan consultants proposed developing Montalvo as \\"the core of an urban region\\" covering Ventura, Oxnard, Point Hueneme, and Saticoy, which was predicted to reach a population of 700,000 by 1980 and 2,000,000 by the year 2020. The consultants proposed making Montalvo the hub of Ventura County government, culture, and transportation, including development of a civic center and a state college. In 1967, the Ventura Freeway was constructed through Montalvo, resulting in significant financial losses to local merchants. ==Annexation and crime problems== In the 1980s, residents debated proposals to accept annexation of Montalvo into the city of Ventura. An initial effort at annexation was defeated in 1992. In the 1970s and 1980s, the city of Ventura moved eastward and 35 apartment buildings were constructed on three Montalvo streets south of the Bristol Shopping Center. By 1990, Montalvo had a population of 4,630 and a median household income of $46,602. In the 1990s, the area began to experienced increased blight and crime, including fights, drug dealing and tagging, as two gangs claimed the apartment area as their territory. In 1994, the Ventura Police Department opened a storefront substation in Montalvo to attempt to fight the increased crime. Montalvo was finally annexed into the city of Ventura in September 2012. ==Landmarks== Notable landmarks in Montalvo included Sam Korb's Trading Post, Loop's Restaurant, Little Heidelberg Restaurant, and The White Spot. Montalvo also was home to a mound in the northern part of the community that was thought to e the work of native Americans. It was described in the 1890s as having an altitude of 150 feet with smoothly sloping sides and approximately one-quarter mile in length. Later press reports indicate that large portions of the mound were removed to be used as fill dirt. ==See also== * East Ventura station * West Montalvo Oil Field ==References== Category:Ventura County, California Category:Ventura, California Category:Neighborhoods in Ventura County, California ","title":"Montalvo, Ventura, California"},{"id":"833625","text":"Malcolm Newton Shepherd, 2nd Baron Shepherd, Baron Shepherd of Spalding (27 September 1918 ‚Äì 5 April 2001), was a British Labour politician and peer who served as Leader of the House of Lords under Harold Wilson and James Callaghan and member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Shepherd was the son of the Labour politician George Shepherd, 1st Baron Shepherd. With the House of Lords Act 1999, the right of the hereditary peers of an automatic seat in the House of Lords was removed, so Shepherd was created a life peer as Baron Shepherd of Spalding, of Spalding in the County of Lincolnshire to keep his seat. == Early life == Born in Blackburn, Lancashire, Malcolm Shepherd was educated at the Lower School of John Lyon and the Friends' School, now known as Walden School, an independent school in the market town of Saffron Walden in Essex. He was commissioned in the Royal Army Service Corps in 1941 and served in North Africa, Sicily and Italy rising to the rank of Captain and transferring to what was known as 'Special Services'. Initially his mother and father were against him joining the Army because of their pacifist convictions. After the end of the Second World War, Shepherd, together with his wife Allison, went to Singapore as an employee of a British trading company. Later Shepherd purchased majority shares in the firm of Fielding, Brown and Finch working in Malaya and Singapore. When his father died in 1954, he took six months leave, came to the UK to settle his father's affairs and made his maiden speech in the House of Lords before returning to the Far East and resuming his business career. In 1958, his company headquarters moved to London and Shepherd moved himself and his family to the UK. == Political career == Shepherd succeeded to the title of Baron Shepherd of Spalding on the death of his father in December 1954. In 1960 he became Deputy Opposition Chief Whip, House of Lords and became Opposition Chief Whip in 1964. When Shepherd first joined the House of Lords its membership was entirely composed of hereditary peers with a large inbuilt Conservative Party majority. There were only about 25 to 30 Labour Party peers. Shepherd was a pragmatist who realised that if he was to enable the Bills sent from the House of Commons to pass through the House of Lords he had to do deals with the Conservatives and maintain good relations with all in the House. Although a moderate in his political views he was an early advocate of House of Lords reform. He thought there was too much unnecessary ceremony and in 1971 argued that those entitled to vote in the Upper House be restricted to regular attenders. After the Labour victory in the 1964 general election, he became Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms and Government Chief Whip, House of Lords, a post he held until 1967 when he became Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. He also served as Deputy Leader of the House of Lords from 1968 to 1970. Shepherd was appointed to the Privy Council in the 1965 Birthday Honours. As Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, a role that had previously been known as Secretary of State for the Colonies. During his tenure at The Foreign Office, Britain was busy shedding Empire and he was very involved in the new constitutions of colonies becoming independent, including Fiji. Shepherd was also involved in resolving the Caribbean island of Anguilla's demand for independence from St. Christopher- Nevis-Anguilla. He also had to deal with the Biafra war in Nigeria. He won particular popularity in Gibraltar by supervising the introduction of a new constitution which bound Gibraltar more closely to the UK after the Spanish government of General Franco closed the border. Shepherd's preamble to the Gibraltar constitution stated that 'Her Majesty's Government will never enter into arrangements under which the people of Gibraltar will pass under the sovereignty of another state against their wishes.' Within the Colony's population he is commonly known as \\"The Father of the Constitution\\". He was also responsible for Hong Kong during the cultural revolution inspired riots of 1967; he maintained relationship with the territory in the following years. From 1970 to 1974, Shepherd was Opposition Deputy Leader, House of Lords. In 1974 he became Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords, a post he held till he resigned in 1976. In 1975, Shepherd and his wife Allison accompanied The Queen and Prince Philip on the first state visit to Japan. In November 1975, Harold Wilson caused controversy within the Labour Party by sending him to represent the UK Government at the funeral of General Franco, attending together with Prince Philip representing the British Royal Family. Shepherd remained an active member of the House of Lords for the rest of his life, and on 16 November 1999 he was created a life peer as Baron Shepherd of Spalding, of Spalding in the County of Lincolnshire in order to keep his seat after the House of Lords Act removed the right of hereditary peers to an automatic seat in the House. == Business career == After the surprise defeat of Harold Wilson's Labour government in the 1970 general election, Shepherd worked for Rudy Sternberg's Sterling Group. He returned to an active career in business after resigning from the Cabinet in 1976 and also held a number of public offices. Shepherd was the first Chairman of the Civil Service Pay Research Unit board from 1978 to 1981. He served on the Packaging Council from 1978 to 1980. He was chairman of the Medical Research Council from 1978 to 1982. From 1976 to 1986 he was Deputy Chairman of Rudi Sternberg's, later to become Lord Plurenden, Sterling Group of Companies. In 1979 he became chairman of the National Bus Company which was then one of the largest nationalised industries. Shepherd oversaw a large rise in its profits which reached ¬£48m by 1984. He tried to persuade the Conservative government not to privatise the company, warned of the disappearance of loss-making rural services and frequently clashed with the Transport Secretary Nicholas Ridley. He was President of the Centre Europ√©en de l'Enterprise Publique from 1985 and of the Institute of Road Transport Engineers. ==Family== In 1941, Shepherd married Allison Wilson Redmond (died 1998), the sister of broadcaster James Redmond. Their two sons, Graeme and Douglas, were born in Singapore before he succeeded to the title. He was on holiday in Lanzarote (with his Whip's permission), where he died suddenly on 5 April 2001. His elder son Graeme inherited the hereditary title. He is buried together with his wife, Allison, in the yard of Muiravonside church in Falkirk, Scotland. ==Sources== ==Sources== *The Independent 7 April 2001 (obituary) *The Guardian 6 April 2001 (obituary) *The Times (obituary) *The Daily Telegraph (obituary) * Who's Who 1999 - - - - - Category:1918 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Disease-related deaths in Spain Category:Lords Privy Seal Category:Barons in the Peerage of the United Kingdom Shepherd of Spalding Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Leaders of the House of Lords Category:Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms Category:Royal Army Service Corps officers Category:Labour Party (UK) hereditary peers Category:Eldest sons of barons Category:English expatriates in Spain Category:Ministers in the Wilson governments, 1964‚Äì1970 ","title":"Malcolm Shepherd, 2nd Baron Shepherd"},{"id":"833627","text":"Historic Southern Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp Cassadaga (a Seneca Indian word meaning \\"Water beneath the rocks\\") is a small unincorporated community located in Volusia County, Florida, United States, just north of Deltona.

Colby, from Pike, New York, a trance medium who traveled to many different states, giving readings and seances. He was well known and in his travels was referred to as the \\"seer of spiritualism.\\" Colby attended summer Spiritualist Camp meetings at Lily Dale, New York, the town adjacent to Cassadaga, New York that would lend its name to the Florida community.Cassadaga, Florida Yesterday and Today by Elizabeth Owens, 2001 Colby worked with several spirit guides who would give him knowledge. One of his spirit guides was a Native American named Seneca, who had manifested to Colby during a seance in Lake Mills, Iowa. According to Colby, Seneca had instructed him to travel south to Florida, where he eventually arrived at a place called the Blue Springs Landing, near Orange City, Florida. According to Colby, the area that Seneca had led him to was the same area that Colby had seen during the seance in Iowa. Colby had arrived in Florida in 1875, and on December 18, 1894, the charter was granted to form The Southern Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp Meeting Association. Later, on January 3, 1895, Colby had signed a warranty deed to the association for thirty-five acres. The people who came to the Spiritualist Camp in the early days of its formation were affluent and well educated. The association later received additional acreage that expanded the camp to the current fifty-seven acres. ==The Cassadaga Camp today== Today, the Camp features the Cassadaga Hotel, a central auditorium, The Colby Memorial Temple, a community library, the Caesar Forman Healing Center, a Camp bookstore, a welcome center, and the Andrew Jackson Davis Educational building, used for musical performances and gatherings.Cassadaga, Spiritualist Camp Guide Book, Calendar/ Directory Annual Program, 2007 -2008 Nearby is Colby-Alderman Park.

The original Combat Readiness Medal was an award senior to the Air Force Commendation Medal, and it was awarded for superior and meritorious duty to the United States Air Force. The award criteria for the medal were revised in 1967 and the Combat Readiness Medal adopted the designation as a service medal. The current Combat Readiness Medal is awarded to any member of U.S. Air Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve, who have accomplished sustained individual combat mission readiness in an Air Force weapon system or who have undertaken the preparedness for direct weapon- system employment. A service member must have completed 24 cumulative months of sustained duty performance for the medal to be received. The Combat Readiness Medal is given as a service award by an Air Force Major Headquarters. In many cases, those receiving the award have also qualified for the Air Medal, the Aerial Achievement Medal or the Nuclear Deterrence Operations Service Medal. For aeronautically rated Air Force officers and enlisted aircrew personnel, it is not unusual to receive one or both of the aforementioned flight crew medals simultaneously with the Combat Readiness Medal. The medal was designed by the Institute of Heraldry. On the obverse, it has an inverted triangle on top of a delta-swept winglike object, both representing supersonic aircraft. This design is enclosed by a stylized compass rose, with triangles at the points, indicating the worldwide nature of the mission of the Air Force. The reverse of the medal has the inscription, \\"For Combat Readiness--Air Force\\" in a circle, near the outer edge of the medal. The ribbon has a wide center stripe of red, flanked on either side by a narrow stripe of light blue, thin stripe of dark blue, narrow stripe of light blue with a stripe of red at the edge. Multiple presentations of the Combat Readiness Medal are authorized, with additional awards denoted by oak leaf clusters. The Combat crew badge, a qualification accoutrement worn by crew members collecting time towards the medal, is no longer awarded. If an Air Force member has the Combat Readiness Medal and does the Blue to Green program (Air Force to Army transition) they are still authorized to wear the medal, but unlike in the Air Force, it will be worn as the last medal/ribbon, but before any foreign awards. ==References== Category:Awards and decorations of the United States Air Force Category:Awards established in 1964 Category:1964 establishments in the United States ","title":"Combat Readiness Medal"},{"id":"833637","text":"Cassadaga is a Seneca Native American word meaning \\"Water beneath the rocks\\".

Two Saturday and two Sunday trains would continue to the downtown Riverside station until July 5, 2014, when weekend service on the 91 Line began. ==Route== After leaving Union Station and crossing the Los Angeles River, the line follows the San Bernardino Freeway and El Monte Busway until just after the Cal State L.A. station; it then runs in the median of the San Bernardino Freeway to the El Monte Station along the former route of the Pacific Electric Railway's San Bernardino Line. Starting at El Monte, the line parallels the Union Pacific's Sunset Route (ex-Southern Pacific) for a few miles before turning northeast at Bassett onto a Southern Pacific branch. At (a former Southern Pacific/Pacific Electric-Santa Fe crossing), it switches to the Santa Fe; from Claremont to just west of San Bernardino it follows what was the Santa Fe's Pasadena Subdivision (and before that the Second District of the LA Division, the Santa Fe passenger main line). The San Bernardino Line is mostly single track with 6 passing sidings and short sections of double track near Covina, between Pomona and Montclair, and west of Fontana. ==Expansion== When the line opened in 1992 service extended only as far as Pomona, but in 1993 the line was extended to San Bernardino. Saturday service was added in 1997 and Sunday service in 1998. San Bernardino Associated Governments (SANBAG) completed an environmental impact report (EIR) in 2015 to extend Metrolink service southeast from the current eastern terminus in San Bernardino to Redlands. The extension will follow the Redlands Subdivision and comprises two projects. The Downtown San Bernardino Passenger Rail Project extended Metrolink southeast one mile via double trackage to a new terminus at the San Bernardino Transit Center. The project's groundbreaking was in February 2014; at that time, the extension was expected to be completed by mid-2016. , the completion date had been extended to 2017. Construction work on the extension continued through March and April 2017. Test trains began running on the tracks in April 2017. This phase of the project opened to the public on December 16, 2017. Arrow is a planned rail extension to Redlands. By December 2015, SANBAG decided that this second phase of the project, from the San Bernardino Transit Center to Redlands, would no longer be a Metrolink extension, but rather an independent system. SANBAG planned to use diesel multiple units (DMUs) and have Omnitrans operate the system. However, San Bernardino Line express limited-stop trains would run on part of the extension, to a new station near the Downtown Redlands station. Construction was planned to begin in 2017 with the extension opening in 2021,, however groundbreaking took place in July 2019 with a 2022 opening. The selected route runs between the Downtown San Bernardino station and the University of Redlands with stops at Tippecanoe Avenue, Esri, and Downtown Redlands, adjacent to the Redlands Santa Fe Depot. Omnitrans was removed as the system's operator in 2019 amid mounting deficits, and Metrolink took over construction and procurement. Arrow's DMU sets have been studied for wider deployment on the rest of the San Bernardino Line. ==Stations== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - ! Station ! Location ! Address !

The Growler has more than 90% in common with the standard Super Hornet, sharing airframe, Raytheon AN/APG-79 AESA radar and weapon systems such as the AN/AYK-22 stores management system. Most of the dedicated airborne electronic attack equipment is mounted on a plate in the space that used to house the internal 20 mm cannon and on the wingtips. Nine weapons stations remain free to provide for additional weapons or jamming pods. The added electronics include AN/ALQ-218 wideband receivers on the wingtips and ALQ-99 high and low-band tactical jamming pods. The ALQ-218 combined with the ALQ-99 form a full spectrum electronic warfare suite that is able to provide detection and jamming against all known surface-to-air threats. However, the current pods may be inadequate against emerging threats.Thompson, Loren B. \\"Navy Steps Up New Jammer Effort; First New System in 40 Years.\\" Aol Defense, 26 July 2012. The EA-18G can be fitted with up to five ALQ-99 jamming pods and will typically add two AIM-120 AMRAAM or AGM-88 HARM missiles. The EA-18G will also use the INCANS Interference Cancellation system that will allow voice communication while jamming enemy communications, a capability not available on the EA-6B. In addition to the radar warning and jamming equipment, the Growler possesses a communications receiver and jamming system that will provide suppression and electronic attack against airborne communication threats. The poor reliability of the ALQ-99 jammer pod and frequent failures of the Built-In Test (BIT) have caused the crew to fly missions with undetected faults. The ALQ-99 has also interfered with the aircraft's AESA radar and has imposed a high workload on the two-man crew, along with reducing the Growler's top speed.\\"Defense Acquisitions: Assessments of Selected Weapon Programs.\\" U.S. Government Accountability Office, 30 March 2010.

Boeing is looking into other potential upgrades; the ALQ-99 radar jamming pod may be replaced in the future, and the company is looking into adding weapons and replacing the satellite communications receiver. The Growler is the initial platform for the Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) which uses Active electronically scanned array (AESA) technology to focus jamming power exactly where needed. The NGJ was to be implemented on the F-35.

The song was written by Friends writers Adam Chase and Betsy Borns, with musician Chrissie Hynde and Kudrow for the latter's character Phoebe Buffay, and first appears in the sixth episode of the show's second season, \\"The One with the Baby on the Bus\\". Hynde guest stars in the episode as a singer hired to replace Phoebe as Central Perk's in-house musician, to whom Phoebe eventually teaches \\"Smelly Cat\\". Borns originally intended to write the song about a dog, initially basing it on her own pet dog Gouda, but ultimately decided that a song about a pungent cat would be funnier. Following its debut, Kudrow would continue to frequently perform \\"Smelly Cat\\" throughout Friends' ten-year run, most prominently during the show's second season, with the song becoming a running gag and integral component of Phoebe's role. The song's popularity grew among fans to the point at which they asked that it be released as an album track. Kudrow and the Pretenders, credited as Phoebe Buffay and The Hairballs, recorded an updated version of the song entitled \\"Smelly Cat Medley\\" for the soundtrack album Friends Again (1999). Musically, \\"Smelly Cat\\" is an acoustic pop and folk novelty song about an odorous cat mistreated and neglected by its owners due to its stench. Established as a fan favorite, \\"Smelly Cat\\" has become closely associated with Phoebe, Kudrow, and the series, and is often ranked highly by media publications among Friends' most memorable moments and featured songs, even rivaling the show's theme song \\"I'll Be There for You\\" in terms of popularity. \\"Smelly Cat\\" has been covered by several artists, including Friends guest stars E. G. Daily, Chris Isaak, and James Michael Tyler, co-star Courteney Cox, and singer Colbie Caillat. Notably, Kudrow performed \\"Smelly Cat\\" with Taylor Swift live during the singer's 1989 World Tour in 2015, with footage of the duet garnering widespread media attention and becoming a viral sensation. == Background and writing == alt=Woman with medium-length shaggy brown hair, wearing a white vest and tie while playing a guitar. On the sitcom Friends, actress Lisa Kudrow portrays Phoebe Buffay, an eccentric masseuse and amateur singer-songwriter with poor rhythm. The character regularly performs her original, peculiar songs at Central Perk, a New York-based coffeehouse at which she and her five friends often socialize. \\"Smelly Cat\\" was written for the character by Kudrow with Adam Chase, Betsy Borns and Chrissie Hynde. The song was conceived in 1995 by Borns, a Friends writer who originally intended for its lyrics to be about a pungent dog entitled \\"Smelly Dog\\". Having a tendency to incorporate aspects of her personal life into Friends episodes, Borns initially based the song on a malodorous dog she had once owned named Gouda (named after the cheese), at first penning it \\"as an ode to her childhood pet\\", before ultimately deciding a song about a foul-smelling cat would be more humorous. Chase, another writer on Friends, also contributed lyrics. Kudrow composed the melody herself, as she had done for all of her character's original songs. \\"Smelly Cat\\" first appears in the sixth episode of the second season, \\"The One with the Baby on the Bus\\" (1995), which Borns also wrote. Hynde (lead singer of rock band The Pretenders) guest stars in the episode as Stephanie Schiffer, a professional singer originally hired to replace Phoebe as Central Perk's resident musician, to whom Phoebe teaches \\"Smelly Cat\\" at the end of the episode. Hynde co-wrote the song's music with Kudrow. The musician had agreed to guest star on Friends with little knowledge as to how popular the relatively new sitcom had already become in the United States, having not heard of the show prior to being cast. Kudrow described writing with Hynde as \\"amazing\\". Critics believe Hynde's guest appearance bolstered sales of The Pretenders' cover of \\"Angel of the Morning\\", which Hynde also performs in the episode. \\"Smelly Cat\\" grew increasingly popular among fans of the show, who sent letters to producers asking that they release the song on an album. Upon realizing the song's popularity, Reprise Records' Howie Klein expressed interest in developing a concept album based around \\"Smelly Cat\\" as a follow-up to the previous years' Friends album, but Kudrow's participation in the project was undecided. An updated version of the song entitled \\"Smelly Cat Medley\\" was eventually released on the soundtrack album Friends Again (1999), credited to Phoebe Buffay and The Hairballs. The track is a combination of \\"Smelly Cat\\" excerpts from various episodes, featuring vocals from Kudrow and The Pretenders. Although the album's cover features all six of the show's main cast members ‚Äì Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer ‚Äì Kudrow was the only main cast member to contribute a song. == Use in Friends == \\"Smelly Cat\\" is one of several songs Phoebe writes and performs on Friends. Debuting in \\"The One with the Baby on the Bus\\", Phoebe first mentions the song to Rachel Green (Aniston) in conversation. The song is initially established as Phoebe's least popular among audiences. In the episode, Stephanie struggles to play \\"Smelly Cat\\" to Phoebe's liking, with Phoebe advising the character to work on feeling the song's lyrics. \\"Smelly Cat\\" proved popular and would continue to make several appearances throughout Friends' ten seasons, primarily via various performances and renditions by Phoebe. Although originally intended to be a one-time joke, the writers continued to conceive ways of incorporating the song into the series, creating various storylines that revolve around \\"Smelly Cat\\". I'll Be There for You: The One about Friends author Kelsey Miller confirmed that the composition was used most frequently during the show's second season, with Phoebe singing it at Central Perk regularly. The song would become one of the show's most used running gags.leftThe song appears in season two's \\"The One Where Eddie Moves In\\", in which Phoebe attempts to record a professional rendition of the song in a recording studio. She struggles to record with background singers. Phoebe eventually films a music video for the song, for which her voice is ultimately dubbed by a professional singer, voiced by E. G. Daily. Phoebe initially believes she is hearing herself sing and thinks she sounds good. Upon learning the truth, Phoebe ultimately feels sorry for the anonymous singer instead of pitying herself. The song is then heard in season three's \\"The One with Phoebe's Ex-Partner\\", in which Leslie (again portrayed by Daily), a singer with whom Phoebe used to perform, suggests that \\"Smelly Cat\\" be adapted into a jingle for a cat litter commercial. Phoebe ultimately refuses the offer, but Leslie sells the song without Phoebe's permission, prompting her to write \\"Jingle Bitch\\" about Leslie. The product is named \\"Smelly Cat\\" Kitty Litter, after the song. Phoebe performs the song as a duet with Rob, portrayed by musician Chris Isaak, although Phoebe criticizes his rendition, suggesting that the singer refrain from incorporating his signature high-pitched yodeling in favor of \\"a more masculine note\\". Phoebe also leads her friends in a sing- along version of \\"Smelly Cat\\" at Central Perk, each of whom contribute a solo, except Ross Geller (Schwimmer) because there are no more lines. In season five's \\"The One with Joey's Bag\\", Phoebe's estranged father Frank Buffay reveals that he used to sing her a lullaby called \\"Sleepy Girl\\", which shares \\"Smelly Cat\\"'s melody, as a baby, further establishing \\"Smelly Cat\\" as a fundamental aspect of Phoebe's life story. However, Sam Ashurst of Digital Spy identified this as a plot hole, since Phoebe had previously confirmed that her father abandons her before she was born, therefore he could not have been present to sing to her. Ashurst theorized that Phoebe could have been so determined to retain the copyright to her most famous song that she lied about its composer. According to Rachel Steinberg Radio Times, \\"Smelly Cat\\" is heard nine times throughout the course of the series in various capacities. VH1 writer Stacy Lambe believes \\"Smelly Cat\\" once signified \\"a point in Phoebe's career when it seemed like her music was going to take off.\\" The New Zealand Herald described the song as \\"Phoebe's acoustic anthem [which] echoed throughout the whole series.\\" Following filming of the Friends series finale in January 2004, a wrap party was hosted for the cast and crew at Los Angeles' Park Plaza Hotel, at which a cocktail named after the song was served. A full version of the music video has been included on DVD releases of Friends. == Composition == Kudrow's original rendition of \\"Smelly Cat\\" has been described as a \\"folky, acoustic\\" track. The Toronto Star called it a \\"unique guitar ballad\\". According to HelloGiggles' Rachel Paige, the music video version is treated to a \\"90s remix\\" with heavy production. Amazon identified the updated \\"Smelly Cat Medley\\" as a pop song lasting two minutes and twenty-seven seconds (2:27) in duration. \\"Smelly Cat\\" alternates between three chords ‚Äì E, A and D ‚Äì although Phoebe never refers to chords by their traditional names. The song consists of a simple melody and humorous lyrics, with Comedy Central describing Kudrow's vocals as \\"strained\\". A novelty song, MTV's Lindsay Soll wrote that \\"Smelly Cat\\" is about a \\"feline with a pungent odor\\", but Phoebe reassures the cat that its scent is not its own fault. Rachel Simon, writing for Bustle, summarized the track as a song about \\"about a poor-smelling cat treated badly by society for its odor\\". The song's lyrics begin \\"Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?\\", followed by \\"Smelly cat, smelly cat it's not your fault.\\" \\"Smelly Cat\\" continues, \\"It may not be a bed of roses/ but you're no friend to those with noses\\". NME critic Beth Cherry believes that the song \\"educate[s] the world about the plight of olfactorily-challenged felines everywhere.\\" Ciara Knight of Joe considers the song's opening lyrics to be its most iconic. Simon believes that \\"Smelly Cat\\" explores an inspiring message beyond the odor of a cat about remaining unbothered while being bullied and shunned. Classic FM's Sofia Rizzi agreed that the song \\"has a deep and meaningful message at its core\\". Referring to the line \\"what are they feeding you?\\", Bustle's Mallory Schlossberg suggested that fans \\"may never know the answer to that deeply philosophical musical question\\". The song never reveals how or why the cat smells bad, or what its owners are feeding it. Kudrow confirmed that she never learned what the cat was being fed, although the general consensus is that the cat's diet contributed to its smell. The cat's gender is also never confirmed. == Reception and popularity == Reviews for \\"Smelly Cat\\" have been generally positive. Cosmopolitan writer Jo Sayer reviewed \\"The One with the Baby on the Bus\\" as \\"an awesome episode because it's ... where Smelly Cat is first introduced.\\" Newsweek called the song \\"legendary\\". A Medium contributor wrote that the song \\"has become an undetachable part of Phoebe's persona and her anthem\\". The Toronto Star's Melody L. Goh hailed \\"Smelly Cat\\" as \\"the best song to ever be played on Friends\\", while RT√â.ie declared it one of the series' greatest moments. Greg Gilman of TheWrap described \\"Smelly Cat\\" as \\"delightfully silly\\". Laura McClellan of Taste of Country deemed \\"Smelly Cat\\" \\"one of Phoebe's greatest quirky coffee house hits\\". Ilyse Liffreing of Ad Age reviewed one of Phoebe's \\"Smelly Cat\\" performances as \\"One of the most memorable scenes\\" from the series, which the author believes in turn \\"solidified Phoebe as their show favorite.\\" The Honolulu Star-Advertiser's Betty Shimabukuro described \\"Smelly Cat\\" as \\"legendary for its tunelessness and total fusion with the Phoebe personality\\", and suggested that fans seek solace by singing the song following the show's finale. Conversely, Wired writer Travis Reilly described the track as \\"notoriously awful\\", while The Washington Post journalist Jennifer Frey dismissed the song's several renditions as \\"painful\\". Digital Spy ranked \\"Smelly Cat\\" among \\"12 amazing Phoebe moments\\". Sammy Nickalls, writing for HelloGiggles, believes \\"Smelly Cat\\" \\"will go down in history for the best song about an odorous pet\\". Madison Malone Kircher of Business Insider wrote that \\"Smelly Cat\\" predated the Internet as a viral meme by \\"becoming an oft-quoted and mimicked cultural touchstone for fans of the show.\\" Victoria Dawson Hoff of Elle observed that the song threatens to \\"unseat 'I'll Be There For You' as the song that's most synonymous with Friends\\", explaining that fans still struggle to \\"get it out of our heads\\" nearly 20 years after it was released. Bustle's Rachel Simon agreed that \\"Smelly Cat\\" rivals \\"the theme song as one of the show's most unforgettable musical moments\\". CinemaBlend contributor Jessica Rawden attributes the song's popularity to several storylines that established \\"Smelly Cat\\" as an important aspect of Phoebe's life, ultimately becoming \\"ingrained into the cultural fiber of Friends\\". Cosmopolitan's Ellen Scott described the song as \\"glorious\\" and \\"iconic\\", to which any true fan knows the lyrics. Conversely, Lindsey Weber of Vulture found \\"Smelly Cat\\" is \\"overrated\\", believing it to be inferior to Phoebe's angrier songs. == Live performances and covers == Kudrow has generally refrained from performing \\"Smelly Cat\\" live under most circumstances, despite being constantly asked by fans. The song began to experience a revival in 2009 when a dance remix began circulating on the Internet. Upon learning about the remix, Kudrow said \\"I can't wait to hear if it is any good\\". In September 2009, Kudrow performed \\"Smelly Cat\\" live with actress Courteney Cox, who portrayed Monica Geller on Friends, during the Rock A Little, Feed A Lot benefit concert. Kudrow was originally intended to introduce musician Sheryl Crow, only for the audience to ask her to sing \\"Smelly Cat\\" instead. Kudrow then invited Cox to join her for the performance, for which the stagehands provided Kudrow with a guitar at Cox's insistence. The performance was met with a standing ovation from the crowd. Hello! joked that \\"hitting the right notes wasn't really a concern [for the actresses] if they wanted the performance to reflect Lisa's character's dubious musical talents\\", while Inquisitr's Asher Bayot reviewed the duet as awkward. The performance remained Kudrow's only documented post-Friends \\"Smelly Cat\\" performance for several years. In 2014, singer-songwriter Colbie Caillat sang an a capella version of \\"Smelly Cat\\" live at a Central Perk-themed pop-up caf√© in Manhattan, New York, which had been launched to commemorate the show's 20th anniversary. Caillat's unscheduled performanced surprised many fans in attendance, who she encouraged to sing along. Despite praising Caillat's rendition as \\"awesome\\" for \\"fulfill[ing] every Friends fanatic's fantasy\\", Bustle's Aly Semigran criticized her for performing only half of the song. However, she believes her rendition should lead to a Phoebe tribute album, on which she should reprise \\"Smelly Cat\\". At the same pop-up, actor James Michael Tyler, who portrayed Central Perk barista Gunther, performed the first verse of the song with band The Rembrandts, who originally recorded \\"I'll Be There for You\\". Brent Furdyk of Entertainment Tonight Canada described the Tyler- Rembrandts rendition as \\"Jim Morrison-esque\\". A box of \\"Smelly Cat\\" kitty litter from the episode \\"The One with Phoebe's Ex-Partner\\" was displayed as part of the pop-up's exhibit. Singer Taylor Swift invited Kudrow to perform \\"Smelly Cat\\" with her live during one of the final performances of her 1989 World Tour. In August 2015, Kudrow performed \\"Smelly Cat\\" live with singer Taylor Swift at the Staples Center during the final North American legs of her 1989 World Tour. Her fifth and final performance at the venue, Swift introduced Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay, advising the audience that \\"She's only ever played in coffee houses before. She's never played in a big venue like this\\". Kudrow then entered the stage wearing a long skirt reminiscent of Phoebe's wardrobe. Adopting her character's personality, both Kudrow and Swift accompanied themselves on guitar. Kudrow interrupted Swift midway through the duet to offer feedback and remind her to feel the song's lyrics, prompting screams and laughter from the audience. Referencing her duet with Hynde, Kudrow ultimately assured Swift that she master the song eventually. The performance was widely reported and positively received by media outlets. Yvonne Villarreal of the Los Angeles Times found the rendition superior to \\"Smelly Cat's\\" \\"over-produced music video\\" from \\"The One Where Eddie Moves In\\". The Daily Telegraph's Helena Horton called Kudrow's performance \\"the sweetest\\" of all the guest appearances throughout Swift's tour. Stylist agreed that Kudrow's appearance \\"might top\\" all other guests, calling it superior to singers Selena Gomez and Justin Timberlake's cameos at the same concert, while Screener's Andrea Reiher concurred that Kudrow was arguably Swift's \\"best guest of the entire '1989' run\\", concluding that the singer once again \\"wins at life\\". Heather Saul of The Independent crowned Kudrow \\"the highlight of all of [Swift's] cameos\\", eclipsing Timberlake's first stage appearance since becoming a father. Michel Serra of Closer reviewed that Kudrow \\"has not lost any of Phoebe's intonations\\", despite being performed 10 years after the actress had last played the role. Business Insider's Madison Malone Kircher found the song to be \\"an excellent fit for Swift\\" due to her love of cats, despite being \\"a far cry from the tracks on her '80s-pop-inspired ... album\\". Tessa Berenson of Time wrote that Swift \\"may have outdone herself\\" by duetting with Kudrow, suggesting that Swift's next album should be a cover album of Phoebe songs. Rachel Paige of HelloGiggles declared that it would be difficult for Swift to ever top this moment, while HuffPost contributor Stephanie Marcus called Swift's decision to perform with Kudrow \\" genius\\" and \\"glorious\\". A critic for The New Zealand Herald described the rendition as \\"a whole new ‚Äì and slightly surreal ‚Äì experience to see it performed with pop royalty in front of a huge stadium audience.\\" Fan recordings of the performance became very popular on the Internet being heavily circulated on social media, with both Swift and \\"Smelly Cat\\" trending on Facebook and Twitter, respectively, the following morning. The videos quickly earned millions of views, becoming the most viral guest performance from the tour. Time ranked the performance Swift's seventh best moment of 2015. However, Vice's Mitchell Sunderland questioned whether Swift's target demographic of fans born in and after 1999 were truly familiar with Kudrow and the song. As of 2016, E. G. Daily sometimes performs the song during her shows. To commemorate the show's 25th anniversary in September 2019, a flash mob of 25 women dressed as Phoebe assembled in New York‚Äôs Union Square and performed \\"Smelly Cat\\". In tribute to the character, each woman donned a suede fringe jacket, blonde wig, and guitar, replicating one of Phoebe's outfits from the series. The impersonators also sang the song at each location they stopped, including The Today Show, WPIX TV and Grand Central Station. The performers used the occasion to raise awareness for pet rescue and encourage witnesses to adopt a cat, on behalf of the Best Friends Animal Society. == Legacy == \\"Smelly Cat\\" has since been established as a fan and cult favorite. Although Phoebe performs nearly 40 original songs over Friends' ten-year run, \\"Smelly Cat\\" is considered her breakout hit and signature song, as well as her \\"her most famous creation\\". According to The Times of India, Phoebe made the song \\"real and iconic at the same time\\" to the point at which \\"its used worldwide by fans.\\" In 2014, Kudrow revealed that fans constantly ask her to sing the song, but she refuses. USA Today ranked the lyrics of \\"Smelly Cat\\" among the actress' best Friends quotes. More included \\"Smelly Cat\\" among \\"The 15 Best Moments In 'Friends' History\\", with author Effie Orfanides deeming it \\"one of the best things to come out of the series\\", insisting that all fans know its lyrics. \\"Smelly Cat\\" is one of the most enduring songs from the sitcom. VH1 ranked \\"Smelly Cat\\" Friends' best musical moment, ahead of \\"I'll Be There for You\\". Author Kat George called the song \\"as essential to Friends as the shows theme song\\", even going on to crown it \\"the show's unofficial theme song.\\" E! also ranked the song first, writing that the character \\"turned the sincere lyrics into one of her most acclaimed (laughed) 'hits'.\\" In a similar article, Billboard critic Erin Strecker deemed the track \\"a classic\\" among Phoebe's songs. NDTV recognized \\"Smelly Cat\\" as one of Friends' 20 funniest moments, citing its music video as their favorite rendition. E! considers \\"Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat\\" to be among Friends' 25 most quotable moments. Classic FM ranked \\"Smelly Cat\\" Phoebe's best song, with writer Sofia Rizzi calling it \\"a post-modern work of art\\" that remains \\"an anthem for fans of the show today.\\" Metro's Hanna Flint declared the song \\"arguably one of the most memorable songs in the history of television.\\" Marie Claire believes \\"Smelly Cat\\" has grown to be nearly as ubiquitous as \\"Happy Birthday\\" and Christmas carols, calling it \\"everyone's favourite Friends song\\" and concluding, \\"Despite belting out dozens of ditties during the 10 season run of Friends, the musical talent of Phoebe Buffay will always be remembered through the lyrical genius that is Smelly Cat.\\" In 2016, Comedy Central crowned the song \\"one of the most iconic tunes of the 90s\\", calling it a \\"timeless\\" track because fans can recall its lyrics 21 years later. In addition to ranking \\"Smelly Cat\\" first on BuzzFeed's \\"Definitive Ranking Of Phoebe Buffay's Top 40 Songs\\", author Tasmai Uppin called it \\"the ultimate Phoebe Buffay song\\" against which all of her songs are compared. Entertainment Weekly ranked \\"Smelly Cat\\" Phoebe's fifth greatest song, with author Hillary Busis calling it \\"iconic and charming and ready-made for merchandise\\" but questioned its popularity, considering it less funny than some of her other songs. Busis also praised its music video. The Irish Independent included \\"Smelly Cat\\" as one of Friends' 10 best moments, about which author Aishling Phelan wrote that Phoebe \\"created some pretty comical and sometimes disturbing songs, but Smelly Cat emerged as her trademark number.\\" Phelan went on to describe its lyrics as \\"deep and eloquent\\", but dismissed its music video as \\"cheesy\\". Although VH1 ranked \\"Smelly Cat\\" the third \\"Best (Fake) Song Written For TV\\", author Stacy Lambe critiqued the music video version as \\"overproduced\\". Meanwhile, Abi Jackson of Stylist included the costume Phoebe wears in the \\"Smelly Cat\\" music video among \\"The 50 most iconic fashion and beauty moments in Friends\\", calling it \\"One of Phoebe's best sartorial moments\\" and joking \\"forget Lady Gaga, this is how music videos should be\\". Ranking \\"Smelly Cat\\" among Friends' 10 best running gags, Gillian Furmage of WOW247 wrote that the show simply \\"wouldn't be Friends without the anthem that is 'Smelly Cat'.\\" Calling it one of television's 12 best running gags, Refinery29's wrote that the song \\"still brings the laughs years after the show's end.\\" Erin Fitzpatrick Digital Spy ranked \\"Smelly Cat\\" the 11th best original song from within a television show. Kat George of Bustle ranked the video the third best video the Friends characters watched during the series, while ranking the commercial for the single seventh. Although Hyndes used to get annoyed by fans asking her to perform \\"Smelly Cat\\" on stage, she has grown used to the popularity of it and now considers the song to be \\"probably my biggest legacy now. Portuguese comedy group Gato Fedorento named themselves after \\"Smelly Cat\\", which translates to Gato Fedorento in Portuguese. To commemorate the show's 25th anniversary in September 2019, Google created several Friends-themed easter eggs which appear in the search results when the name of a main character is searched. Searching \\"Phoebe Buffay\\" or \\"Phoebe\\" returned an image of a guitar which, when clicked, promoted Kudrow's rendition of \\"Smelly Cat\\" to play in the background, while a black cat walks across the screen as a green cloud of gas is excreted from its backside to indicate its stench. == References == Category:1990s ballads Category:1995 songs Category:1999 songs Category:American folk songs Category:American pop songs Category:Comedy songs Category:Folk ballads Category:Friends (1994 TV series) Category:Novelty songs Category:Pop ballads Category:Songs about cats Category:Songs written by Chrissie Hynde ","title":"Smelly Cat"},{"id":"833669","text":"Lincoln University from the northeast Lincoln University is a private university in Oakland, California.

(This was a project of the American Colonization Society). Each of the men became ordained ministers. In 1866, a year after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, Ashmun Institute was renamed Lincoln University. The college attracted highly talented students from numerous states, especially during the long decades of legal segregation in the South. As may be seen on the list of notable alumni (link below), many furthered their in careers in fields including academia, public service, and the arts. In June 1921, days after the Tulsa race massacre, President Warren Harding visited Lincoln to deliver the commencement address. He spoke about the need to seek healing and harmony in that incident's aftermath, as well as to honor Lincoln alumni who were part of the 367,000 African American servicemen to fight in World War I. The school newspaper noted Harding's visit as \\"the high water mark in the history of the institution.\\"President Harding called for racial justice in America after Tulsa massacre Retrieved June 27, 2020 In 1945 Dr. Horace Mann Bond, an alumnus of Lincoln, was selected as the first African-American president of the university. During his 12-year tenure, he continued to do social science research, and helped support the important civil rights case of Brown v. Board of Education, decided in 1954 by the US Supreme Court. His relationship with the collector Albert C. Barnes was essential in ensuring the university's role in the management of his art collection. From 1854 to 1954, Lincoln University graduates accounted for 20% of African American physicians and over 10% of African American lawyers in the United States.

A 1981 alumna of Lincoln, Allen's inauguration was held for October 20, 2017. ==Academics== According to U.S. News & World Report, Lincoln University ranks number 19 in the 2020 magazine's ranking of HBCUs. In 2020 the US News & World Best Colleges Report rated Lincoln 119 among Regional Universities North. Lincoln University's International and Study Abroad Program had student participation in Service Learning Projects in the countries of Ecuador, Argentina, Spain, Ireland, Costa Rica, Japan, France, Cambodia, Zambia, Liberia, Ghana, Kenya, Russia, Australia, Thailand, the Czech Republic, Mexico, and South Africa The Lincoln- Barnes Visual Arts program is a collaboration between Lincoln University and the Barnes Foundation. It established a Visual Arts program that leads to a Bachelor of Fine Arts, and most recently, a Pan-Africana Studies major has been added to the list undergraduate majors available at the institution. Lincoln University offers 38 undergraduate majors and 23 undergraduate minors. ==Campus== Brown Memorial Chapel Lincoln University main campus is with 56 buildings totaling over one million gross square feet. There are fifteen residence halls that accommodate over 1,600 students. The residence halls range from small dorms such as Alumni Hall, built in 1870; and Amos Hall, built in 1902, to the new coed 400-bed apartment-style living (ASL) suites built in 2005. There are additional off-campus housing arrangements such as Thorn Flats, in Newark, Delaware. The $40.5 million, four-story, Ivory Nelson Science Center and General Classroom High Technology Building was completed in December 2008. The $26.1 million International Cultural Center began construction on April 10, 2008, and was completed in 2010. The $28 million Health and Wellness Center is a facility that opened in September 2012. The facility contains basketball courts, locker rooms, classrooms, track, rock climbing wall, health clinic and healthy eating caf√©. An on-campus football stadium with concession stands, a separate locker room, and storage facilities opened in August 2012. A separate practice field with Field Turf II is located near the Health and Wellness Center, where new lighted tennis courts are located. New baseball and softball fields are adjacent to the football stadium. One of the most visible landmarks on campus is the Alumni Memorial Arch, located at the entrance to the university. The arch was dedicated by President Warren G. Harding in 1921, to honor the Lincoln men who served in World War I. The Mary Dod Brown Memorial Chapel is the center for campus religious activities. This Gothic structure was built in 1890 and contains a 300-seat main auditorium and a 200-seat fellowship hall. Vail Memorial Hall, built in 1899 and expanded in 1954, served as the library until 1972. The facility houses administrative offices. The Langston Hughes Memorial Library (LHML), named after the famous alumnus, houses more than 176,000 volumes, and subscribes to more than 600 current periodicals. A substantial number of the library's periodicals are on microfilm and can be accessed electronically through the school's website. LHML is equipped with the JSTOR database for online academic proprietary research tools. A separate section of the library contains special African-American collections. This includes the personal papers and artifacts of poet Langston Hughes (class of 1929). The completely renovated Student Union Building contains the bookstore, caf√©, two television studios, and a radio studio, postal services, and multipurpose rooms. The Thurgood Marshall Living Learning Center, along with the Student Union Building, are the centers for campus social and meeting activities. Marshall graduated in the class of 1930, directed the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund in groundbreaking cases, and was the first African American to be appointed as a justice to US Supreme Court. Manuel Rivero Hall is the athletic and recreation center at Lincoln University. The main gymnasium seats 2,500 for athletic and convocation activities. A separate full-size auxiliary gymnasium, Olympic-size swimming pool, training room facilities, wrestling room, and eight-lane bowling alley are contained in this facility. The Student Union Building (SUB) Lincoln University is a census-designated place (CDP) for statistical purposes. As of the 2010 census, Lincoln University CDP had a resident population of 1,726. Lincoln University has a post office with a ZIP code of 19352. === Satellites === Lincoln University - University City, a six-story building in the University City section of Philadelphia, offers select undergraduate and graduate programs in the School of Adult & Continuing Education. ==Student activities== ;Honor societies * Alpha Chi ‚Äì National Honor Scholarship Society * Alpha Kappa Delta National Sociology Honor Society * Alpha Mu Gamma National Foreign Language Honor Society * Beta Beta Beta National Biological Science Honor Society * Beta Kappa Chi Honorary Scientific Society * Chi Alpha Epsilon National Honor Society (Act/T.I.M.E) * Dobro Slovo ‚Äì The National Slavic Honor Society * Iota Eta Tau Honor Society * Omicron Delta Epsilon International Honorary Society in Economics * Phi Iota Sigma Foreign Language Honor Society * Phi Kappa Epsilon Honor Society * Pi Sigma Alpha National Political Science Honor Society * Psi Chi National Psychology Honor Society * Sigma Tau Delta English Honor Society * Sigma Beta Delta Business Honors Society * Kappa Delta Pi ‚Äì Tau Zeta Chapter International Honor Society in Education ;Student organizations Lincoln has over 60 student organizations as outlets for multiple interests including fashion, arts, social justice, religious, international, cultural, service, leisure, media, and publishing.

Lincoln competes as a Division II member of the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association and, the Eastern College Athletic Conference. Lincoln Lions compete in intercollegiate athletics in the following sports: baseball, soccer (women), basketball (men & women), volleyball (women), indoor track (men & women), outdoor track (men & women), cross-country (men & women), softball, and football. ==The Barnes Foundation== As president of Lincoln University (1945‚Äì1957), Dr. Horace Mann Bond formed a friendship with Albert C. Barnes, philanthropist and art collector who established the Barnes Foundation. Barnes took a special interest in the institution and built a relationship with its students. Barnes gave Lincoln University the privilege of naming four of the five directors originally set as the number for the governing board of the Barnes Foundation. Barnes had an interest in helping under-served youth and populations. Barnes intended his $25 billion art collection to be used primarily as a teaching resource. He limited the number of people who could view it, and for years even the kinds of people, with a preference for students and working class. Visitors still must make appointments in advance to see the collection, and only a limited number are allowed in the galleries at one time. In the mid-20th century, local government restricted traffic to the current campus, located in a residential neighborhood located at 300 North Latch's Lane, Merion, Pennsylvania. Barnes' constraints, local factors, and management issues pushed the Foundation near bankruptcy by the 1990s. Supporters began to explore plans to move the collection to a more public location and maintain it to museum standards. To raise money for needed renovations to the main building to protect the collection, the Foundation sent some of the most famous Impressionist and Modern paintings on tour. In 2002, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania D. Michael Fisher contested Albert C. Barnes' will, arguing that the Merion location of the collection and small number of Board members limited the Foundation's ability to sustain itself financially. Pennsylvania Governor Edward Rendell brokered a settlement in 2005 between the Barnes Foundation and Lincoln University. This agreement resulted in the number of directors increasing. This has diluted Lincoln's influence over the collection, now valued at approximately twenty-five billion dollars. A documentary named The Art of the Steal depicts the events. ==Notable alumni== Lincoln University has numerous notable alumni, including US Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall; Harlem Renaissance poet Langston Hughes; father of musical legend Cab Calloway; Medal of Honor recipient and pioneering African- American editor Christian Fleetwood; civil rights activist Frederick D. Alexander; the first president of Nigeria, Nnamdi Azikiwe; the first president of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah; song artist and activist Gil Scott-Heron; Emmy Award- winning and Tony Award-nominated actor Roscoe Lee Browne; Dr. Robert Walter Johnson, tennis coach of Althea Gibson and Arthur Ashe; Melvin B. Tolson, teacher and coach of the Wiley College, Marshall, Texas, debate team portrayed in the film The Great Debaters; and Joseph Newman Clinton, member of the Florida House of Representatives. Lincoln University has alumni who founded the following six colleges and universities in the United States and abroad: South Carolina State University (James E. Clark), Livingstone University (African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church), Albany State University (Joseph Winthrop Holley), Allen University (Richard Allen), Texas Southern University (R.O'Hara Lanier), Ibibio State College (Nigeria) (Ibrahim Babangida) and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (Ghana) (King Osei Tutu).

Young (2010), Book Reviews: \\"Statistical Tolerance Regions: Theory, Applications, and Computation\\", TECHNOMETRICS, FEBRUARY 2010, VOL. 52, NO. 1, pp.143-144. \\"A (p, 1‚àíŒ±) tolerance interval (TI) based on a sample is constructed so that it would include at least a proportion p of the sampled population with confidence 1‚àíŒ±; such a TI is usually referred to as p-content ‚àí (1‚àíŒ±) coverage TI.\\"Krishnamoorthy, K. and Lian, Xiaodong(2011) 'Closed-form approximate tolerance intervals for some general linear models and comparison studies', Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation, First published on: 13 June 2011 \\"A (p, 1‚àíŒ±) upper tolerance limit (TL) is simply a 1‚àíŒ± upper confidence limit for the 100 p percentile of the population.\\" A tolerance interval can be seen as a statistical version of a probability interval. \\"In the parameters-known case, a 95% tolerance interval and a 95% prediction interval are the same.\\" If we knew a population's exact parameters, we would be able to compute a range within which a certain proportion of the population falls. For example, if we know a population is normally distributed with mean \\\\mu and standard deviation \\\\sigma, then the interval \\\\mu \\\\pm 1.96\\\\sigma includes 95% of the population (1.96 is the z-score for 95% coverage of a normally distributed population). However, if we have only a sample from the population, we know only the sample mean \\\\hat{\\\\mu} and sample standard deviation \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}, which are only estimates of the true parameters. In that case, \\\\hat{\\\\mu} \\\\pm 1.96\\\\hat{\\\\sigma} will not necessarily include 95% of the population, due to variance in these estimates. A tolerance interval bounds this variance by introducing a confidence level \\\\gamma, which is the confidence with which this interval actually includes the specified proportion of the population. For a normally distributed population, a z-score can be transformed into a \\"k factor\\" or tolerance factor for a given \\\\gamma via lookup tables or several approximation formulas. \\"As the degrees of freedom approach infinity, the prediction and tolerance intervals become equal.\\" ==FormulasNormal case=== ==Relation to other intervals== The tolerance interval is less widely known than the confidence interval and prediction interval, a situation some educators have lamented, as it can lead to misuse of the other intervals where a tolerance interval is more appropriate. The tolerance interval differs from a confidence interval in that the confidence interval bounds a single-valued population parameter (the mean or the variance, for example) with some confidence, while the tolerance interval bounds the range of data values that includes a specific proportion of the population. Whereas a confidence interval's size is entirely due to sampling error, and will approach a zero-width interval at the true population parameter as sample size increases, a tolerance interval's size is due partly to sampling error and partly to actual variance in the population, and will approach the population's probability interval as sample size increases. The tolerance interval is related to a prediction interval in that both put bounds on variation in future samples. However, the prediction interval only bounds a single future sample, whereas a tolerance interval bounds the entire population (equivalently, an arbitrary sequence of future samples). In other words, a prediction interval covers a specified proportion of a population on average, whereas a tolerance interval covers it with a certain confidence level, making the tolerance interval more appropriate if a single interval is intended to bound multiple future samples. ===Examples=== gives the following example: > So consider once again a proverbial EPA mileage test scenario, in which > several nominally identical autos of a particular model are tested to > produce mileage figures y_1, y_2, ..., y_n.

The Certificate of Merit Medal replaced the much older Certificate of Merit which was authorized by the United States Congress on March 3, 1847. ==History== The system of military awards and decorations presented to members of the United States Military can trace its lineage to the Badge of Military Merit. This military award, established by George Washington, was given in recognition of soldiers who displayed unusual gallantry or extraordinary fidelity. Awarded three times during the Revolutionary War, the Badge of Military Merit was not awarded again. Thus, for more than 50 years the United States Military had no official military decorations. ===Original Certificate of Merit=== The original Certificate of Merit was authorized by an Act of Congress related to the expansion of the US Army during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì1848). The legislation authorized brevets to non-commissioned officers and for privates who distinguished themselves in service \\"the President may in like manner grant him a certificate of merit, which shall entitle him to additional pay at the rate of two dollars per month.\\" This was a step forward in the recognition of the individual contributions of soldiers. The first certificates were only authorized for Privates and it was not until 1854 that the Certificate of Merit was awarded to NCOs the rank of Sergeant and above. The Certificate of Merit was never authorized for officers. During this period from at least 1865 to 1904, the Certificate was used as an equivalent to the Medal of Honor. This created a dilemma for some soldiers, who applied for both awards, hoping to benefit from the pay increase included with the Certificate, in spite of the fact that military protocol restricted them to only one decoration. George Jordan is an example of a soldier who received both. It was issued to 545 soldiers during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. After the war, the Certificate of Merit was discontinued. ===Reintroduced Certificate of Merit=== Though the Army was of the position that it no longer had the authority to award the Certificate of Merit, commanders in the field continued to recommend soldiers for the award, but the Army did not act on the nominations. Following the Battle of Little Big Horn in 1876, the Certificate of Merit was reintroduced. In 1892, the criteria for the Certificate of Merit was changed. Adjutant General's Circular number 2 dated 11 February 1892 stated: > Medals of honor should be awarded to officers or enlisted men for > distinguished bravery in action, while certificates of merit should, under > law, be awarded for distinguished service, whether in action or otherwise, > of a valuable character to the United States as, for example, extraordinary > exertion in the preservation of human life, or in the preservation of public > property, or rescuing public property from destruction by fire or otherwise, > or any hazardous service by which the Government is saved loss in men or > material. Simple heroism in battle, on the contrary, is fitly rewarded by a > medal of honor, although such act of heroism may not have resulted in any > benefit to the United States. Where the conduct of an enlisted man, non- > commissioned officer or private has been represented to merit both a medal > of honor and a certificate of merit, recommendation may be made for both, > either simultaneously or at different times. Soldiers, both privates and non-commissioned officers, were eligible for award of a Certificate of Merit upon the recommendation of their regimental or corps commander. Service could be in peacetime or in time of war. These regulations remained in effect until 9 July 1918. ===Certificate of Merit Medal=== In 1905, a medal was created for those holding a Certificate of Merit and called the Certificate of Merit Medal. This medal was authorized for wear on a United States military uniform. It was always worn following the Medal of Honor, before all campaign medals. The first recipient of the Certificate of Merit Medal was First Lieutenant William B. Baker, who was presented medal No. 1 on 30 December 1907. Baker had received an original Certificate of Merit as a Corporal during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War on 13 August 1898. The last act recognized by a Certificate of Merit was May 1918, when Corporal Paul Scaletta made a water rescue of soldiers in dangerous surf condition at Ocean Beach, California. The last soldier to be awarded the Certificate of Merit Medal was George Arrington for his service while a Private with the 24th Infantry Regiment in 1889. He was awarded medal No. 361, and subsequently converted it to a Distinguished Service Cross. ===Conversion=== The Certificate of Merit Medal was declared obsolete on July 19, 1918. Those holding the Certificate of Merit Medal could exchange their medal for the newly created Distinguished Service Medal. In 1934, Congress changed the regulation allowing the conversion of the medal to the Distinguished Service Cross, including those converted to the Distinguished Service Medal. ==Appearance== The medal is bronze, 1.25 inches in diameter. The obverse depicts an eagle facing left, with its wings partially spread. The eagle is surrounded by the inscription VIRTUTIS ET AUDACIAE MONUMENTUM ET PRAEMIUM (Virtue and Audacity are Their Own Monument and Reward). The reverse of the medal bears the word, FOR MERIT surrounded by an oak wreath of two branches, the stems joined at the bottom by a bow. Around the edge in relief are the words, UNITED STATES ARMY at the top and thirteen stars below. The suspension and service ribbon of the Certificate of Merit Medal is red, white and blue. It has two stripes of blue at the edges with equal stripes of white. A wide central stripe of red is bisected by a thin stripe of white. == See also == *Medal of Honor *Awards and decorations of the United States military ==References== Category:Awards and decorations of the United States Army Category:Courage awards Category:Military awards and decorations of the United States ","title":"Certificate of Merit Medal"},{"id":"833711","text":"Ganamukti Parishad flag Tripura Rajaer Upajati Ganamukti Parishad (Bengali for 'Tripura State Indigenous People's Liberation Council') is a left-wing movement working amongst the Tripuri peoples of Tripura, in north-eastern India. ==Origins== During the 1940s the royal house of Tripura tried its best to maintain its political rule over the state. However, monarchy was challenged by movements that were influenced by the Indian National Congress and the Communist Party of India. These associations proposed democratic reforms, but were met with stern resistance from the royal house. In 1946 members of Janamangal Samiti (People‚Äôs Welfare Association), Janasiksha Samiti (People‚Äôs Educational Association), the local cell of the Communist Party and individual left-wingers got together to form the Tripura Rajya Prajamandal (Tripura State Popular Assembly). Prajamandal proposed a form of constitutional monarchy for the state. The Prajamandal included both communists and non-communists. In 1948 a ban on the organisation was proposed, on the ground that the organisation was under the influence of communists in East Pakistan. This spurred the non-communist leaders of Prajamandal to try to expel the communists. However, the ban was enforced before the expulsion had taken place. Leaders of Prajamandal were arrested, and many cadres went into hiding. By not differentiating between communists and non-communists in repressing Prajamandal, the royal government indirectly contributed to increasing the support for the communist within the organisation. On Independence Day Prajamandal took out a militant manifestation in Agartala. Simultaneously, the movement started activating itself in the struggle for Tiprasas land rights. Following the Partition of India, a major wave of Bengali Hindus migrated to Tripura from East Pakistan. On the Tripura countryside Bengali money-lenders started to take over agricultural land from indebted Tiprasas. Prajamandal organised resistance, a struggle that radicalized the movement. On several sites the movement resulted in clashes with the state forces. In October police firing in Bishalgarh killed nine Tiprasa and injured twenty more. The military set up camps in the tribal areas, with the objective of rooting out Prajamandal. The Prajamandal leadership considered that it had no possibility to cope with the increasing repression, and decided to dissolve the association. In the void that emerged after the disappearance of Prajamandal, Tiprasa leaders founded the Tripura Rajaer Mukti Parishad (Tripura State Liberation Council, generally called Mukti Parishad). Mukti Parishad raised demands of withdrawal of the DIR and freedom of expression and association. The slogan of the movement was 'Democratic Rights for the People of Tripura'.\\\\- Majumder, Benimadhab; The Legislative Opposition in Tripura, Agartala: Tripura State Tribal Cultural Research Institute & Museum, 1997 ==Armed struggle== As Tripura was put under military rule in March 1949, the leadership of the Mukti Parishad went underground to escape arrests. In the tribal belts of the state armed resistance was organized by the GMP. Inspired by the advances of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Mukti Parishad set up the Shanti Sena (Peace Army), which routed out the troops of the administration from the tribal belt. In the ‚Äòliberated areas‚Äô people‚Äôs government was in command, with the Village Committees of GMP managing the everyday affairs. The tribals didn‚Äôt have to pay any taxes to the state, nor would they turn to the courts of the state to express their queries. At the same time, a cultural revolution took place within the tribal society as abolition of child marriages, forced labour, excessive alcohol consumption, oppression of women, etc. were outlawed by the GMP. ==Entry into mainstream politics== Armed resistance lasted until 1951. Then the strategies changed as a result of the changes in the political climate of the state. The Communist Party had begun to operate over-ground. In the end of 1949 the leaders of GMP had joined CPI. Now the struggle of the GMP was to be taken overground, in cooperation with CPI. In the first parliamentary elections of India in 1952 both seats of the Lok Sabha (2nd chamber of the Indian parliament) were won by the CPI. Both of the elected MPs, Biren Dutta and Dasarth Deb, were stalwarts of the GMP. Deb, the president of GMP, was at the time of election still considered as a guerrilla leader on the run by the police. The cases against him were not dropped until he was pardoned by the Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru himself after having reached the parliament premises incognito for his first session. ==1967 conference== GMP-TYF election poster in favour of Communist Party of India (Marxist) It should be mentioned that although the bulk of the leadership as well as the common members of the GMP were tribals, the GMP was not an exclusively Tiprasa organization at this time (Biren Dutta, for example was a Bengali). After the end of the armed struggle, an intense debate surged within the CPI concerning the future role of the GMP. Some considered that the GMP, whose membership was overwhelmingly agrarian, should be integrated into the peasant mass organization of the party, AIKS, and that Tiprasas and Bengali peasants should fight together since their class interests were the same. Other, such as Deb, considered that the tribals were not merely peasants but also constituted a separate sub-national entity and that the GMP should be a Tiprasa organization articulating the sub-nationalist consciousness of the tribal community. In the beginning of the 1960s CPI suffered a severe internal division. The party was split into two camps on issues such as the relationship to the Congress party and the Sino-Soviet polemic. In 1964 the split was a fact, as two separate party congresses were held, one by CPI and the other by Communist Party of India (Marxist). The split also came to divide the Tripura unit of the CPI, with the CPI(M) soon having outmanovered the CPI in Tripura. Initially both factions agreed that the GMP ought to stay intact and that it would be spared from the split for the sake of unity of the mass organization movement, but soon competition over control over the organization started. At the GMP conference of 1967 the split had also reached the GMP, ending in the victory for the CPI(M) and its leader within the GMP, Deb, who were able to gather the support of the broad majority of the organization. At the same conference the GMP was re-christened as the Upajati (i.e., Tribal) Ganamukti Parishad. Subsequently, non-tribals were no longer able to obtain GMP membership. Thus Deb‚Äôs thesis that Tiprasa constituted as separate subnationalist entity and needed a mass organization of their own had been implemented in the organizational practice. Following the 1967 conference CPI formed its own Ganamukti Parishad, led by Aghore Debbarma. It has not played any major political role since its foundation. ==ATPLO merger== In 1983 the All Tripura Peoples Liberation Organization of Binanda Jamatya gave up their arms and were integrated into the Ganamukti Parishad. ATPLO had surged as a splinter group of the Tripura National Volunteers, and a turf war between the TNV soon turned into a bloody fight. In the end, ATPLO found no other viable solution than to align with their former enemies and thus merge into GMP. ==The organisation today== Today the GMP is affiliated with the All India Kisan Sabha, the peasant mass-organization of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)). GMP does, however, maintain its own organizational character as an entirely tribal organization. Similarly, as the GMP is an affiliate to the AIKS, the Tribal Youth Federation is affiliated to the Democratic Youth Federation of India and the Tribal Students Union is affiliated to the Students Federation of India. However at the same time as these organizations belong to different all India structures, they are organizationally interlinked. The general secretary and president of TYF are by tradition elected as members of the secretariat of the GMP. The GMP, TYF and TSU use other flags, symbols and publications than their all India bodies. The leadership of these three organizations are referred to as Central Committees, whereas the state leaderships of the AIKS, DYFI and SFI are referred to as State Committees. By 2000 it claimed a membership of 70 000. It president is Aghore Debbarma and its general secretary is Lok Sabha MP Babujan Riang. ==Footnotes== ==Bibliography== * Basu, Pradip Kumar; The Communist Movement in Tripura, Calcutta: Progressive Publishers, 1996 * Deb, Dasarath; Mukti Parishader Itikatha, Kolkata: National Book Agency, 1999 ==External links== * Dasarath Deb, 1916-1998, article in Frontline * Article on the 17th central conference of GMP, in People's Democracy Category:Politics of Tripura Category:Political parties in Tripura ","title":"Ganamukti Parishad"},{"id":"833713","text":"The Cozumel thrasher (Toxostoma guttatum) is a bird from the mockingbird family (Mimidae), which is endemic to the island of Cozumel off the Yucat√°n Peninsula, Mexico. It is believed to be the most critically endangered species of bird in Mexico - if it indeed still exists, which is probable but not certain.ENS (2004) This bird is closely related to the long-billed and brown thrasher. It has been generally described as shy, but there have been descriptions to the contrary. It was once abundant throughout Cozumel before two hurricanes greatly affected its numbers. Invasive species are also thought to have impacted the population of the thrasher. ==Taxonomy == The Cozumel thrasher was first described as Harporhynchus guttatus by Robert Ridgway in 1885. It has been described as a subspecies to its relative the long-billed thrasher, but was considered a separate species when it was determined in a 1998 study that it differed genetically more than five percent from both the long-billed and brown thrasher. In the same study it was determined to be the basal member of the rufum group of Toxostoma thrashers. The bird is monotypic. == Description == The thrasher is 21.5 to 24 cm in length. The adult has a brown crown, back, shoulders, and rump that becomes more red in its tint on its lower back and rump. Greater and lesser coverts are a warm brown with concealed white tips, preceded with a black bar. Primaries and secondaries are grayish-brown with warm rufous-brown outer webs. The rectrices are also have a warm brown color. The lores and ear-coverts are a mottled grey brown. The chin and throat are an off-white color with a blackish partial malar stripe. The chest is a buffy-white in color with stark black teardrop shaped spots. The belly is off-white, and the flanks have larger black spots. Its vent is buffy and an underwing that is buffy-white with darker markings. The iris is yellow, the bill is grayish-brown, and the legs are brown with a dull tint. Juveniles' plumage have not been recorded, but presumably is similar in development to adulthood like the long-billed and brown thrasher. ===Similar species=== The Cozumel thrasher is similar in appearance to the long-billed thrasher (26.5‚Äì29 cm in length), but is smaller, darker in color, has a blacker bill, and the markings are more sharply defined. No other thrasher species coexist on the island, but is most likely to be confused with the migratory wood thrush. The wood thrush differs in lacking wing bars, a shorter beak, and a different shape. == Distribution and habitat == The distribution of the thrasher is restricted to Isla Cozumel which is 45 km long and 20 km wide. The habitat preferences for the thrasher is thought to be in low and medium deciduous and semi-deciduous forests. It may have once been most abundant in forest edges adjacent to clearings. ==Behavior and ecology== The thrasher is predominately terrestrial and elusive and as with all members of the genus Toxostoma, it may resort to running instead of flying when startled. Ornithologists Ludlow Griscom and Raymond A. Paynter, Jr. had noted its secretive behavior, but James Bond did not. The song is described as a rich varied warbling, slightly scratchy with little repetition. Bond described its alarm note being similar to the brown thrasher. ==Status== The numbers of this bird declined rapidly when Hurricane Gilbert hit this island on September 14, 1988. Until it was sighted in June 2004, this bird had last been seen in 1995, the same year that Hurricane Roxanne hit Cozumel on October 11, and it was widely believed to have become extinct. It is still unclear what damage the impact of Hurricanes Emily and Wilma in 2005 caused; it seems that the bird was not found anymore during a survey in December 2006Surfbird News (2006) Inquiry from the local population had suggested that the species would likely be encountered near the Mayan ruins of San Gervasio. The last - unconfirmed - sightings were in April 2006, where an apparent T. guttatum was sighted at the Cozumel Golf Club; in October and December 2007, thrashers were also seen but could not be reliably identified as T. guttatum. Relocation efforts continue; though at least a few birds seem to survive, the continuing existence of this species had not been verified as of January 2008.Curry (2008) Some scientists believe that other factors must have contributed to the bird's decline, because the Cozumel thrasher likely survived hurricanes for millennia. Introduced species, including predatory boa constrictors‚Äîwhich were released on the island in 1971 and are now abundant‚Äîmay also have had a detrimental effect. ==Footnotes== ==References== * Curry, Robert L.

Previously, he served in the Texas Senate from 1983 to 1990. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Edwards was on Barack Obama's vice presidential shortlist in 2008. ==Early life and education== A Waco resident, Edwards was born in Corpus Christi. He graduated magna cum laude from Texas A&M; University in 1974, earning a bachelor's degree in economics. One of his professors was future U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator Phil Gramm. Upon graduation, he received the Earl Rudder Award, which is given to two outstanding seniors. Edwards was the Chairman of the 18th MSC Student Conference on National Affairs Conference, where he helped to bring Vice President Walter Mondale and businessman Ross Perot to campus. == Early career == After graduation, Edwards worked as an aide to Congressman Olin E. Teague for three years. This mentorship later influenced Edwards‚Äô work in Congress on Veterans Affairs.Thomas Chester ‚ÄúChet‚Äù Edwards State Legislative Papers #8, Baylor Collections of Political Materials, W. R. Poage Legislative Library, Baylor University. When Teague announced his retirement in 1978, Edwards ran in the Democratic primary to succeed him. He lost by only 115 votes to his former professor, Phil Gramm, who switched to Republican affiliation in 1983. In 1981, Edwards earned his MBA from Harvard Business School. He then went to work for the Trammell Crow Company as a commercial real estate agent. Later, Edwards purchased several rural radio stations in South Texas. ===Texas Senate=== Edwards was elected to the Texas Senate in 1983, and served until 1990, representing District 9. He was the youngest member at age 30. In the Texas Senate, Edwards was a member of the Senate Education Committee which oversaw class size reduction in public schools. He was also on the Health and Human Resources Committee, chaired the Senate Nominations Committee, the Texas Sunset Commission, a joint commission which reviews state agencies on a 12-year rotation, and the Texas Election Code Revision Committee. Edwards was also a member of the Committee on Business, Technology, and Education. He received the ‚ÄúTexas Business‚Äù award during the 68th Regular Session as one of three outstanding freshman legislators, and was named by Texas Monthly as one of the \\"Ten Outstanding Legislators\\" during his tenure. ==U.S. House of RepresentativesCommittee assignments=== *Committee on Appropriations **Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development **Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government **Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies (Chairman) *Committee on the Budget Edwards served as a member on the House Budget Committee, the Appropriations Committee, and the Financial Services Appropriations Subcommittee and vice chair of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee. He also chaired the House Army Caucus. He was known as a national champion for America's veterans, troops, and their families. After becoming Chairman of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee in 2007, Edwards authored a $17.7 billion increase in funding for veterans health care and benefits, the largest increase in veterans funding in the history of the Veterans Administration. He also assisted in enacting the 21st Century GI Bill of Rights into law, covering the full cost of a college education for troops. In 2008, both the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars recognized Edwards' leadership with their national awards. While representing Fort Hood, Edwards played a major leadership role in support of the U.S. Army, troops, and military families. In 2007, he received the Marix Congressional Achievement Award from the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) in recognition of his work. In 2006, Edwards was honored with the Award of Merit, the highest award given by the Military Coalition, which represents 36 military and veteran groups. In 2003, the Association of the U.S. Army gave Edwards its \\"Legislator of the Year Award.\\" He was co-chair of the House Army Caucus for over a decade and served on the House Armed Services and Veterans Affairs Committees for six years before joining the Appropriations Committee.Thomas Chester ‚ÄúChet‚Äù Edwards U.S. House of Representatives Papers #8A, Baylor Collections of Political Materials, W. R. Poage Legislative Library, Baylor University. ==Political positions== Edwards is a moderate Democrat according to a nonpartisan organization GovTrack. He was also a leader in the House of Representatives. However, he has stated his opposition to caps on medical malpractice lawsuits. He voted for the Iraq Resolution. ===Fiscal policy=== Edwards opposed the 2001 federal tax cuts and voted against eliminating the marriage penalty and estate tax. He voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Early on, Edwards became known as a leader in the fight against nuclear terrorism. In 2001, he strongly opposed cuts of $100 million to the nuclear non-proliferation budget proposed by the Bush Administration. Serving as a member on the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, Edwards oversaw homeland defense and university research programs to protect Americans from the threat of nuclear terrorism. To ensure that more cargo coming into U.S. seaports was properly inspected, Edwards supported the implementation of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and, in 2003, helped secure $84 million to install radiological detectors at the busiest foreign ports so nuclear materials could be detected overseas before reaching America. During his 20-year tenure in Congress, including 12 years of seniority on the Appropriations Committee, Edwards developed a reputation of working hard and effectively for his Central Texas constituents. He was committed to protecting jobs and the local economy by making vital federal investments in education, health, transportation, and water programs in his District. Securing federal investments for Fort Hood, the Central Texas Veterans' Health Care System, and university research programs at Baylor and Texas A&M; Universities was also a primary focus of Congressman Edwards' work in Washington. Edwards is known as a fiscal conservative who believes massive federal deficits and the multi-trillion national debt is harmful to the American economy and is morally wrong to pass on to future generations. The non-partisan Concord Coalition gave him its \\"Deficit Hawk\\" Award. His pro- economic, pro-agriculture record also earned him endorsements from both the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Farm Bureau Friends of Agriculture Fund (AGFUND). The U.S. Chamber of Commerce gave him their \\"Spirit of Enterprise\\" Award for several years for his support of business. As a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights, Congressman Edwards voted with the NRA 100% on gun rights issues for many years and received the NRA's endorsement. ===Social policy=== Edwards traditionally votes against same-sex marriage. He has voted in favor of Constitutional amendments to ban same-sex marriage, as well as to define marriage one-man-one-woman, and holds a 25% rating from the Human Rights Campaign.On the Issues - Chet Edwards Edwards voted against ending preferential treatment by race in college admissions and received an 83% rating from the NAACP in 2006. Edwards has received an \\"A\\" by the National Rifle Association. In 2008, Edwards successfully introduced legislation to earmark $150 million toward a cure for neuroblastoma, a pediatric cancer. In July 2008, the measure was signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush. Edwards was inspired in the endeavor by the illness and subsequent death of Erin Channing Buenger (1997-2009) of Bryan, daughter of one of his constituents, Walter L. Buenger, head of the history department at Texas A&M; University. As a respected voice on issues facing working families, Edwards pushed for increased access to health care for children of working families under the State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP), supported middle class tax cuts, and protected Medicare and Social Security benefits for America's seniors. As a lifelong person of faith, Edwards was honored by the Baptist Joint Committee, and earned the Walter Cronkite Award from the Interfaith Alliance for his principled stand to keep government regulations out of churches and houses of worship. Congressman Edwards also received the T.B. Maston Christian Ethics Award. ==Political campaigns== Edwards was elected to the U.S. House in 1990 with 54 percent of the vote in what was then the 11th District, defeating Republican Hugh Shine. He was re-elected in 1992 with 67 percent of the vote, defeating Republican James Broyles. He defeated Broyles again in 1994 with 59 percent of the vote. During the 1990s, like much of rural Texas, the 11th District trended more and more Republican. Edwards was able to hold onto his seat, though with shrinking margins. In 1996, he was re-elected with 57 percent of the vote against Republican Jay Mathis. He won in 1998 without any Republican opponent. In 2000 he won with 55 percent of the vote over Ramsey Farley; in 2002, he beat Farley again, this time with 52 percent of the vote. In 2000, he became President Bush's congressman; the district includes Prairie Chapel Ranch just outside Crawford, which was Bush's legal residence during his presidential term. As part of the 2003 Texas redistricting, Edwards' district was renumbered as the 17th District and radically altered. The ethnically diverse cities of Temple and Killeen were removed, as was the Army post of Fort Hood. In their place, his district absorbed College Station, home to Texas A&M; and a long-standing bastion of conservatism. It also absorbed several heavily Republican areas near Fort Worth. While Edwards' old district had been trending Republican for some time, the new district was, on paper, one of the most Republican districts in the country. Edwards defeated conservative State Representative Arlene Wohlgemuth in November 2004 by 9,260 votes, or approximately a 3.8% margin. Proving just how Republican the new 17th district was, Bush carried it with a staggering 70 percent of the vote‚Äîthe most of any Democratic-held district, and Bush's 17th- best district in the entire country. Edwards was one of two Democrats to represent a significant portion of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, along with Eddie Bernice Johnson. In much of this district, Edwards was the only elected Democrat above the county level. It was generally understood that Edwards would be succeeded by a Republican when he retired. In 2006, Edwards ran for reelection against Republican Van Taylor, a former Marine Corps reservist and Iraq War veteran, and was re-elected with 58% of the vote to Taylor's 40%. Edwards speaks during the third night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. On February 18, 2008, Edwards officially endorsed Barack Obama in the Texas March 4 Democratic primary. In late June 2008, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi publicly suggested that Edwards would be a great choice as Obama's vice-presidential running mate. Edwards stated that he would accept such an offer from Obama. On August 22, the Associated Press reported that Edwards was on Obama's short-list as a potential running- mate. ===2008=== In November 2008, Edwards was reelected, defeating Republican Rob Curnock, a Waco video business owner, with 53 percent of the vote.David Doerr, \\"Republican, two Libertarians file to vie with Democrat Edwards for congressional seat\\", Waco Tribune-Herald, January 3, 2008 John McCain carried the 17th with 67 percent of the vote. ===2010=== Edwards was challenged by Republican nominee Bill Flores, a retired Bryan oil and gas executive. Edwards was endorsed by the Dallas Morning News and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Nate Silver in the FiveThirtyEight.com New York Times blog predicted that there was a 4.7% chance that Edwards would defeat Flores. Real Clear Politics rated this race \\"Likely Republican\\". On November 2, 2010, Edwards was heavily defeated, taking 37 percent of the vote to Flores' 62 percent.http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/politics/7276047.html This was the largest margin of defeat for a Democratic incumbent in the 2010 cycle. Edwards' term ended on January 3, 2011. ==Personal life== Since leaving Congress in 2011, Edwards has established Edwards, Davis Stover & Associates, LLC with his former chief of staff, Lindsey Davis Stover, and continues to be involved with veterans issues in the Washington, D.C. area through his work on the boards of the Military Child Education Coalition and the Arlington National Cemetery Advisory Commission. He is married to Lea Ann Wood from Paducah, Kentucky. They have two sons, J.T. and Garrison. He was raised a Methodist. ==References== ==External links== *Chet Edwards for U.S. Congress official campaign site * - - Category:1951 births Category:20th-century American politicians Category:21st-century American politicians Category:American United Methodists Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Harvard Business School alumni Category:Living people Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Texas Category:People from Corpus Christi, Texas Category:People from Duncanville, Texas Category:Texas A&M; University alumni Category:Texas Democrats Category:Texas state senators Category:United States congressional aides ","title":"Chet Edwards"},{"id":"833720","text":"Fiber simulation is a branch of mechanics that deals with modeling the dynamics and rheology of fibers, i.e. particles of large aspect ratio length to diameter. Fiber simulations are used to gain a better understanding of production processes including fibers (textile and paper industry ), biological systems or computer graphics. == Modeling fibers == Many of the models used to simulate fibers were developed by researchers in the field of rheology. Rheologically speaking fiber suspensions are non-Newtonian fluids, and can display normal stress differences. == Simulation techniques == Early fiber simulations employed particles which were rigid rods or prolate spheroids, whose equations of motion have analytical solutions. More recent models are able to represent flexible fibers. The models rely heavily on continuum mechanics concepts and the numerical methods employed have some similarities to those employed in molecular dynamics, or in dynamics of multi body systems. The use of computers facilitates greatly the solution of fiber simulation problems. The complexity of the simulations arise from the system having a large number of degrees of freedom, and from the numerous possible interparticle interactions having place, such as friction, hydrodynamic interactions, and other kinds of interparticle forces such as colloidal forces that exert attractive or repulsive forces. == References == Category:Materials science ","title":"Fiber simulation"},{"id":"833728","text":"Gerstetten is a municipality in the district of Heidenheim in Baden- W√ºrttemberg in southern Germany.

In 1939 they had to relocate to Pozna≈Ñ. In 1945 his father was killed in the war, and after the end of the war, his mother fled west with her three sons Robert, Per, and Andreas, finally ending up in G√∂ttingen, where Robert Gernhardt finished school in 1956. Afterwards, he studied painting, first in Stuttgart and then at the Hochschule der K√ºnste in Berlin, also doing German Studies at Berlin's Freie Universit√§t.

He was part of the so-called Neue Frankfurter Schule (New Frankfurt School) together with artists like Waechter, , and . Gernhardt's satirical style combines social critique with a self-consciously irreverential attitude to cultural and literary traditions. His poetry and prose are situated within the comic traditions of Wilhelm Busch, Christian Morgenstern and the urban poetry of Heinrich Heine and Bertolt Brecht. Gernhardt's poems, which frequently produce their comic effects through play with language and sound as well as through playfully quoting literary tradition, have become part of public consciousness in Germany. During the '70s and '80s, he wrote material for Otto Waalkes, one of Germany's most popular comedians. A lot of Waalkes' most famous routines were written by Gernhardt, often in collaboration with and .

The decoration was bestowed for meritorious or heroic deeds related to wartime operations and was awarded for both combat and non-combat service. There were two classes of the Vietnam Distinguished Service Order, the first class being for officers and the second class for enlisted personnel. The first class of the order was differentiated by a blossom device centered on the medal and ribbon. The Vietnam Distinguished Service Order was also provided to foreign militaries, and in the United States military the decoration was considered the equivalent of the Legion of Merit. For foreign officers, the 2nd class of the order was also provided to officers. The decoration ranked immediately below the National Order of Vietnam and the Vietnam Military Merit Medal. It was among the less commonly bestowed medals, in contrast to such decorations as the Vietnam Gallantry Cross and Vietnam Campaign Medal. The last issuance of the Vietnam Distinguished Service Order was in 1974, before the Fall of Saigon. ==See also== *Orders, decorations, and medals of South Vietnam ==External links== *Military Orders, Decorations, and Medals of the Republic of Vietnam Category:Military awards and decorations of Vietnam ","title":"Distinguished Service Order (Vietnam)"},{"id":"833767","text":"The Downing Professorship of Medicine was one of the senior professorships in medicine at the University of Cambridge.

He lived in the United States (or served in its army abroad) between 1935 and 1952, before moving back to the part of his native Germany which was, from 1949 to 1990, the German Democratic Republic (GDR, \\"East Germany\\"). He published works in English and German at home and abroad, and despite longstanding criticism of the GDR remained a committed socialist. ==Biography Early years=== Flieg, born to a Jewish merchant family in Chemnitz, was an antifascist from an early age. In 1931, he was, at the instigation of local Nazis, expelled from the Gymnasium in his home town because of an anti-military poem. He completed school in Berlin, and began a degree in media studies there. After the 1933 Reichstag fire, he fled to Czechoslovakia, where he took the name Stefan Heym. In Czechoslovakia, the only remaining democracy in Central Europe at that time, he worked for German newspapers published in Prague such as Prager Tagblatt and Bohemia and also managed to have some of his articles published in translation by Czech newspapers. During this time he signed his articles under several pseudonyms, including Melchior Douglas, Gregor Holm and Stefan Heym.Hutchinson: Stefan Heym: the perpetual dissident, p. 16 ===United States=== In 1935, he received a grant from a Jewish student association, and went to the United States to continue his degree at the University of Chicago, which he completed in 1936 with a dissertation on Heinrich Heine. Between 1937 and 1939 he was based in New York as Editor-in-Chief of the German-language weekly Deutsches Volksecho, which was close to the Communist Party of the USA. After the newspaper ceased publication in November 1939, Heym worked as a freelance author in English, and achieved a bestseller with his first novel, Hostages (1942). From 1943, Heym (who had become a U.S. citizen), contributed to the World War II war effort. He was a member of the Ritchie Boys, a unit for psychological warfare under the command of √©migr√© Hans Habe. His work consisted of composing texts designed to influence Wehrmacht soldiers, to be disseminated by leaflet, radio and loudspeaker. These experiences formed the background for a later novel, The Crusaders, and were the basis for Reden an den Feind (Speeches to the Enemy), a collection of those texts. After the war Heym led the Ruhrzeitung in Essen, and then became editor in Munich of Die Neue Zeitung, one of the most important newspapers of the American occupying forces. Because of his refusal to soften his critical stance toward Nazism and the German elites that had collaborated with it and his refusal to begin to discreetly weave doubts about Soviet intentions into his editorials,Nachruf, pp 389‚Äì91 Heym was transferred back to the U.S. toward the end of 1945 and was discharged because of an allegedly \\"procommunistic\\" mindset. In the following years he worked as a freelance author once again. In 1952 he gave all his American military commendations back in protest against the Korean War and moved first to Prague, then in the following year to the German Democratic Republic (GDR, \\"East Germany\\"). ===GDR=== In the GDR, Heym initially received privileged treatment as a returning antifascist emigre. He lived with his wife in a state-provided villa in Berlin-Gr√ºnau. Between 1953 and 1956, he worked at the Berliner Zeitung, thereafter primarily as a freelance author. In the early years of his life in the GDR, Heym supported the regime with socialist novels and other works. Heym's works, which he continued to write in English, were published by a publishing house founded for him (Seven Seas Publishers). In German, translations were printed in large numbers. Conflicts with the GDR authorities became apparent from 1956 on, as despite the destalinisation of the leadership, the publication of Heym's book on the June 17, 1953, uprising, Five Days in June, was rejected. Tensions increased after 1965, when Erich Honecker attacked Heym during an SED party conference. In 1969, Heym was convicted of breaching the exchange control regulations after publishing his novel Lassalle in West Germany. He was nonetheless able to leave the GDR on foreign trips, such as his two-month visit to the U.S. in 1978, and his books continued to appear, albeit in lower print runs, in the GDR. In 1976, Heym was among those GDR authors who signed the petition protesting the exile of Wolf Biermann. From this point on Heym could only publish his works in the West, and he began composing works in German. In 1979, he was again convicted of breaching exchange controls and excluded from the GDR Authors Association. Heym expressed support for German reunification as early as 1982, and during the 1980s supported the civil rights movement in the GDR, contributing a number of speeches to the East Berlin demonstrations in autumn 1989. Stefan Heym's grave ===After reunification=== In the years after reunification, Heym was critical of what he saw as the discrimination against East Germans in their integration into the Federal Republic, and argued for a socialist alternative to the capitalism of the reunited Germany. At the federal elections in 1994, Heym stood as an independent on the Open List of the then Party of Democratic Socialism, and won direct election to the Bundestag from the seat of Berlin-Mitte/Prenzlauer-Berg. As chairman by seniority he held the opening speech of the new Parliament in November 1994, but resigned in October 1995 in protest against a planned constitutional amendment raising MP expense allowances. In 1997, he was among the signers of the \\"Erfurt Declaration\\", demanding a red-green alliance (between SPD and Greens) to form a minority government supported by the PDS after the 1998 federal elections. He died suddenly of heart failure in Ein Bokek in Israel whilst attending a Heinrich Heine Conference. Heym was honoured with honorary doctorates from the University of Bern (1990) and University of Cambridge (1991), and honorary citizenship of Chemnitz, his birthplace (2001). He was also awarded the Jerusalem Prize (1993) for literature 'for the freedom of the individual in society', and the peace medal of the IPPNW. Previously he had won the Heinrich-Mann-Prize (1953), and the National Prize of the GDR, 2nd class (1959). He died in 2001, aged 88, and was buried in the Wei√üensee Cemetery. ==WorksWritten in English=== * Nazis in the U.S.A., New York 1938 * Hostages, New York 1942 * Of Smiling Peace, Boston 1944 * The Crusaders, Boston 1948 () * The Eyes of Reason, Boston 1951 * Goldsborough, Leipzig 1953 * The Cannibals and Other Stories, Berlin 1958 * The Cosmic Age, New Delhi 1959 * Shadows and Lights, London 1963 * The Lenz Papers, London 1964 ‚Äì concerns the failed revolutions in Germany in 1848 * The Architects written c 1963 ‚Äì 1965, unpublished (published in German as Die Architekten, Munich 2000; published in English under \\"The Architects\\" by Northwestern in 2005; ) * Uncertain Friend, London 1969 * The King David Report, New York 1973 \\\\- giving many anecdotes of King David's life which did not get into the Bible * The Queen against Defoe, London 1975 * Five Days in June, London 1977 (concerning the 1953 uprisings in the GDR) * Collin, London 1980 ===Written in German=== * Collin (1979) * Der kleine K√∂nig, der ein Kind kriegen mu√üte und andere neue M√§rchen f√ºr kluge Kinder (1979) * Ahasver (1981) ‚Äì published in English as The Wandering Jew (1984) * Atta Troll.

He wrote under the pseudonym \\"A Pennsylvanian,\\" and was known to his political enemies as \\"Mr. Facing Bothways.\\" ==Biography== Coxe was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on May 22, 1755. His mother was a daughter of Tench Francis Sr. His father came of a family well known in American affairs. His great-grandfather was the governor of West Jersey, Dr. Daniel Coxe. Tench received his education in the Philadelphia schools and intended to study law, but his father determined to make him a merchant, and he was placed in the counting-house of Coxe & Furman, becoming a partner at the age of twenty-one. After Patriots took power, Coxe left Philadelphia for a few months, only to return when British General Howe occupied the city in September 1777. Coxe remained in Philadelphia after the British departed in 1778, and some Patriots accused him of having Royalist sympathies and of having served (briefly) in the British army. Coxe's trading successes during the period of British occupation lent considerable support to the charges, and he was arrested; although nothing came of the allegations and he was pardoned. The Pennsylvania militia records of 1780, 1787, and 1788 listed Coxe as a militia private. Of the militia, Coxe wrote, Coxe became a Whig, and began a long political career. In 1786 he was sent to the Annapolis Convention, and in 1788 to the Continental Congress. In September of 1787, Coxe wrote three articles published in the Independent Gazetteer (Philadelphia) with the name ‚ÄúAn American Citizen‚Äù examining the newly minted U.S. Constitution with a focus on the Presidency and the two houses of Congress and contrasting it - favorably - to the British Constitution.\\"Debate on the Constitution: Part One,\\" The Library of America: 1993, pp. 20-30 Coxe next became a Federalist.Gordon DenBoer, The Documentary History of the First Federal Elections 1788-1790, v. 3, p. 29. A proponent of industrialization during the early years of the United States, Coxe co-authored the famous Report on Manufactures (1791) with Alexander Hamilton, providing much of the statistical data. He had been appointed Assistant Secretary of the Treasury on September 11, 1789 under Alexander Hamilton when Hamilton was Secretary of the Treasury. Coxe also headed a group called the Manufacturing Society of Philadelphia. He was appointed revenue commissioner by President George Washington on June 30, 1792, and served until removed by President John Adams. Coxe then turned Democratic-Republican, and in the canvass of 1800 published Adams' famous letter to him regarding Pinckney. For this he was reviled by the federalists as a renegade, a tory, and a British guide, and President Thomas Jefferson rewarded him by an appointment as purveyor of public supplies; he served from 1803 to 1812. In 1804 Coxe organized and led a group at Philadelphia opposed to the election to congress of Michael Leib, and this brought him again into public notice. Though a Democratic-Republican, he was for three months daily abused by the Aurora. He was called a tory, a Federal rat, a British guide who had entered Philadelphia in 1777 with laurel in his hat, and his group was nicknamed the \\"quids.\\" The term is commonly supposed to have been first applied to the little band led by John Randolph in 1806, but this is a mistake. Coxe was a writer on political and economic subjects and a champion of tariffs to protect the new nation's growing industries. He wrote also on naval power, on encouragement of arts and manufactures, on the cost, trade, and manufacture of cotton, on the navigation act, and on arts and manufactures in the United States. He deserves, indeed, to be called the father of the American cotton industry. He was the first to attempt to bring an Arkwright machine to the United States, the first to urge Southerners to raise cotton. Coxe also acquired vast acreage of Pennsylvania timber and coal lands. This investment in lands though not much developed in Tench Coxe lifetime was the basis of wealth for his descendants. Coxe died July 17, 1824 in Philadelphia, where he is interred in Christ Church Burial Ground. His grandson Colonel Frank Coxe built Battery Park Hotel in Asheville, North Carolina and bought Green River Plantation in Polk County, North Carolina. His grandson, Eckley Coxe, founded MMI Preparatory School in Freeland, Pennsylvania. ==Works== * An Inquiry into the Principles for a Commercial System for the United States (1787) * Examination of Lord Sheffield's Observations on the Commerce of the United Provinces (1792) * View of the United States (1787‚Äì1794) * * ==References== ==Further reading== * Jacob Cooke, Tench Coxe and the Early Republic; 1978, Univ. of North Carolina Press, * Jacob E.

Elements of his philosophy have been cited as forerunners of Nietzschean ideas,; . and his advocacy of liberation movements and natural science had significant impact on Russian development. A critique of his philosophy became the subject of Fyodor Dostoevsky's celebrated novel Crime and Punishment. Indeed, Pisarev's philosophy embraces the nihilist aims of negation and value-destruction; in freeing oneself from all human and moral authority, the nihilist becomes ennobled above the common masses and free to act according to sheer personal preference and usefulness. These new types, as Pisarev termed them, were to be pioneers of what he saw as the most necessary step for human development, namely the reset and destruction of the existing social and philosophic order.; ; . Among his most famous locutions is: \\"What can be smashed must be smashed. Whatever withstands the blow is fit to survive; what flies into pieces is rubbish. In any case, strike out right and left, no harm can come of it.\\"; . == Biography == He graduated from a gymnasium in Saint Petersburg in 1856. In 1861 he graduated from the historical-philological faculty at St. Petersburg University. After graduation he worked as editor for various publications. He was arrested in 1862 for anti-government writings and was imprisoned until 1866. After his release, he continued his literary work. During the summer holidays of 1868 he died as a result of a drowning accident at Dubulti on the Gulf of Riga (in present-day Latvia). == Legacy == Burial place of Dmitry Pisarev in Volkovo Cemetery in 2017 Pisarev was one of the writers who propelled the democratic-revolutionary trend in Russia during the 1860s. The next generation of Russians, made famous by the events of 1905 and 1917, acknowledged Pisarev's influence. Nadezhda Krupskaya, Lenin's wife, once wrote, \\"Lenin was of the generation that grew up under the influence of Pisarev\\". Pisarev was also noted for his support of Russian natural science, particularly biology, and his works greatly influenced the career choice of the young Ivan Pavlov.Babkin, B.P. (1949) Pavlov: A Biography. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press Pisarev wanted, more than anything else, for his readers to learn to think independently. This desire he pursued through philosophy, literary criticism and social and family analyses. === Influence on Lenin === Lenin, in the fifth chapter of What Is To Be Done?, quoted these lines from an article by Pisarev: \\"There are rifts and rifts,\\" wrote Pisarev of the rift between dreams and reality. \\"My dream may run ahead of the natural march of events or may fly off at a tangent in a direction in which no natural march of events will ever proceed. In the first case my dream will not cause any harm; it may even support and augment the energy of the working men.... There is nothing in such dreams that would distort or paralyse labour-power. On the contrary, if man were completely deprived of the ability to dream in this way, if he could not from time to time run ahead and mentally conceive, in an entire and completed picture, the product to which his hands are only just beginning to lend shape, then I cannot at all imagine what stimulus there would be to induce man to undertake and complete extensive and strenuous work in the sphere of art, science, and practical endeavour.... The rift between dreams and reality causes no harm if only the person dreaming believes seriously in his dream, if he attentively observes life, compares his observations with his castles in the air, and if, generally speaking, he works conscientiously for the achievement of his fantasies. If there is some connection between dreams and life then all is well.\\" Of this kind of dreaming there is unfortunately too little in our movement. And the people most responsible for this are those who boast of their sober views, their \\"closeness\\" to the \\"concrete\\", the representatives of legal criticism and of illegal \\"tail-ism\\". According to the recollection of Menshevik Georgiy Solomon, who held offices in the Soviet government from 1918 until he became a nevozvrashchenets in 1923, Lenin once quoted in a private conversation to him the following from Pisarev, with \\"a purely sadistic expression\\" and in an apparent \\"fit of hysteria\\": \\"Break, beat up everything, beat and destroy! Everything that's being broken is rubbish and has no right to life! What survives is good.\\" Lenin allegedly used this quote in response to Solomon's remark that the activities of the Bolsheviks in power had a primarily destructive nature, and then threatened Solomon with the Cheka if he were to object to him again.–õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω –∏ –µ–≥–æ —Å–µ–º—å—è. –ü–∞—Ä–∏–∂, 1931. 116-117 == Works  Translated works in English === * * == References == == Sources == * * * == External links == * Category:1840 births Category:1868 deaths Category:19th-century journalists Category:19th-century Russian male writers Category:Imperial Russian journalists Category:Imperial Russian literary critics Category:Imperial Russian male writers Category:People from Lev- Tolstovsky District Category:People from Oryol Governorate Category:Russian male journalists Category:Russian nihilists Category:Social critics ","title":"Dmitry Pisarev"},{"id":"833774","text":"The Professorship of Mineralogy was a professorship at the University of Cambridge.

His wife, Heike Hohlbein, is also a writer and often works with her husband. With more than 200 published books and more than 43 million sold copies he is considered among the most successful German writers in the fantasy genre. ==Personal life== Wolfgang Hohlbein was born on 15 August 1953 in Weimar, Bezirk Erfurt. When he finished school, he took an apprenticeship as industrial clerk. After the apprenticeship he worked in this profession in the following years. To bolster his income, he also worked as night watchman. It was during this time when he started to write his early works, to pass the time faster. In 1971 he met his wife Heike Hohlbein, whom he would marry 3 years later. Together they raised six children. In 1977 their daughter Rebecca Hohlbein was born, who became a writer herself too. In 1982 he quit his job to work as a full-time author. Shortly after he and his family moved to Neuss, North Rhine-Westphalia, where they live until today. In 2014 the German TV channel RTL II launched a reality show called Die Hohlbeins ‚Äì Eine total fantastische Familie (The Hohlbein's, a fantastic family), which aimed to show the life of the Hohlbein family in the a docusoap format. The show garnered about 910.000 viewers during the first episode, but after a fast drop-off in viewers and negative criticism of being too trivial and boring it was cancelled soon after. ==Work== Writing short stories since young age, Hohlbein was first recognized as an author after sending in a manuscript he and his wife had written at a fantasy and science fiction writing contest in 1982. They won and their book, M√§rchenmond (English title: \\"Magic Moon\\"), was published by Ueberreuter Verlag, soon becoming a bestseller and winning several awards. In the following years the Hohlbein's wrote two sequels to the book, continuing their success. The trilogy remains their greatest success until today and sold more than 2 million copies. He's also a writer of pulp fiction, including the series Der Hexer (The Warlock), which he conceived in 1984 for the magazine Gespenster-Krimi (Ghost Thriller) published by Bastei L√ºbbe, mainly based on H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and of which he wrote the majority of novels initially under the collective pen name of Robert Craven. Later the series was reedited and republished as paperbacks, which collected the stories of several pulp magazines, including a prequel, and as e-books both under Hohlbein's own name. Hohlbein primarily writes in the genre of fantasy, horror and historical fiction. Since the success of M√§rchenmond Hohlbein had published more than 200 books. He sometimes cooperates with other authors like Dieter Winkler or his daughter Rebecca Hohlbein. His most important source of inspiration is his wife Heike Hohlbein, who is credited as co-author on more than 30 of his books. In his early days, Hohlbein also wrote a lot of paperback stories for various magazines and also often used a pseudonym. Later he focused more on stand-alone novels as well as some long- running book series, like the Enwor saga or the still not finished Chronik des Unsterblichen (Chronicles of the Immortal). Apart from his own creations, Hohlbein also wrote various movie tie-in books, like in the Indiana Jones, Stargate or Pirates of the Caribbean universe. ==Reception== Wolfgang Hohlbein is among the most successful and prolific German fantasy authors. He has written more than 200 books and sold more than 43 million issues throughout his career. Many of his books are translated and published internationally in various European countries as well as outside of Europe in countries such as South Korea. For many years none of his works had been translated into English, not even the eight Indiana Jones novels he wrote. His only works to be translated into English were his three M√§rchenmond novels, which were published by Tokyopop from 2006 onwards, now titled Magic Moon. Hohlbein's books also have been adapted into other media such as radioplays. His work M√§rchenmond was translated into a theatre play, which has been presented in places like the Westf√§lisches Landestheater or the Theater f√ºr Niedersachsen.

Pickering, who had seven years earlier discovered Phoebe, announced the discovery of a tenth satellite of Saturn, which he promptly named Themis. The photographic plates on which it supposedly appeared, thirteen in all, spanned a period between April 17 and July 8, 1904. However, no other astronomer has ever confirmed Pickering's claim. Pickering attempted to compute an orbit, which showed a fairly high inclination (39.1¬∞ to the ecliptic), fairly large eccentricity (0.23) and a semi-major axis () slightly less than that of Hyperion. The period was supposedly 20.85 days, with prograde motion. Pickering estimated the diameter at , but since he also gave as the diameter of Phoebe, he was clearly overestimating the albedo; using the modern figure for Phoebe gives Themis a diameter of . Two possible orbits for Themis as calculated by W. H. Pickering Oddly, in April 1861, Hermann Goldschmidt had also believed that he had discovered a new satellite of Saturn between Titan and Hyperion, which he called Chiron. Chiron also does not exist (however, the name was used much later for the comet/asteroid 2060 Chiron). Pickering was awarded the Lalande Prize of the French Academy of Sciences in 1906 for his \\"discovery of the ninth and tenth satellites of Saturn\\". The actual tenth satellite of Saturn (in order of discovery) was Janus, which was discovered in 1966 and confirmed in 1980. Its orbit is far from the supposed orbit of Themis. There is also an asteroid named 24 Themis. ==Themis in fiction== * Philip Latham (pen-name of Robert S. Richardson), in his novel Missing Men of Saturn, has Themis collide with Titan, \\"getting rid of the little nuisance once and for all\\", according to the introduction. * John Varley's science fiction novel Titan is set aboard an expedition to Saturn. As they approach the planet and prepare to enter orbit, the astronomer onboard discovers a new moon. At first she believes she has recovered Pickering's lost moon, so she names it Themis. * Robert Anton Wilson's novel Schr√∂dinger's Cat trilogy makes frequent reference to Pickering's Moon as a satellite that revolves the \\"wrong way\\" (i. e. retrograde) around its primary. * Nelson S. Bond, in his 1943 science-fiction story \\"The Ordeal of Lancelot Biggs,\\" explains that Themis periodically disappears when it is occulted by its own moon, an invisible body with \\"the peculiar property of being able to warp light waves around itself.\\" ==References== * Deguy: Le cosmos revue encyclopedique hebdomadaire des progres des sciences et de leurs applications aux arts et a l'industrie, p.421 (1861) * Annals of Harvard College Observatory, vol. 53, no. 9, pp. 173-185 (1905) * Harvard College Observatory Bulletin No. 189, p.1 (April 1905) * AnHar 53 (1905) 173 * AnHar 61 (1908) 86 * MNRAS 69 (1909) 215 * Obs 28 (1905) 12:433 * Obs 31 (1908) 8:295 * Obs 32 (1909) 3:79 * PASP 18 (1906) 96 ==See also== * List of hypothetical astronomical objects Category:Moons of Saturn Category:Hypothetical moons Category:Hypothetical bodies of the Solar System ","title":"Themis (hypothetical moon)"},{"id":"833785","text":"The locus coeruleus (LC) (\\\\\\\\-si-Ààr√º-lƒì-…ôs\\\\\\\\), also spelled locus caeruleus or locus ceruleus, is a nucleus in the pons of the brainstem involved with physiological responses to stress and panic. It is a part of the reticular activating system. The locus coeruleus is the principal site for brain synthesis of norepinephrine (noradrenaline). The locus coeruleus and the areas of the body affected by the norepinephrine it produces are described collectively as the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system or LC-NA system. Norepinephrine may also be released directly into the blood from the adrenal medulla. ==Anatomy== The locus coeruleus (LC) is located in the posterior area of the rostral pons in the lateral floor of the fourth ventricle. It is composed of mostly medium-size neurons. Melanin granules inside the neurons of the LC contribute to its blue colour. Thus, it is also known as the nucleus pigmentosus pontis, meaning \\"heavily pigmented nucleus of the pons.\\" The neuromelanin is formed by the polymerization of noradrenaline and is analogous to the black dopamine-based neuromelanin in the substantia nigra. In adult humans (19-78) the locus coeruleus has 22,000 to 51,000 total pigmented neurons that range in size between 31,000 and 60,000 Œºm3. ==Connections== The projections of this nucleus reach far and wide. For example, they innervate the spinal cord, the brain stem, cerebellum, hypothalamus, the thalamic relay nuclei, the amygdala, the basal telencephalon, and the cortex. The norepinephrine from the LC has an excitatory effect on most of the brain, mediating arousal and priming the brain's neurons to be activated by stimuli. As an important homeostatic control center of the body, the locus coeruleus receives afferents from the hypothalamus. The cingulate gyrus and the amygdala also innervate the LC, allowing emotional pain and stressors to trigger noradrenergic responses. The cerebellum and afferents from the raphe nuclei also project to the LC, in particular the pontine raphe nucleus and dorsal raphe nucleus. ===Inputs=== The locus coeruleus receives inputs from a number of other brain regions, primarily: *The Medial prefrontal cortex, whose connection is constant, excitatory, and increases in strength with raised activity levels in the subject *The Nucleus paragigantocellularis, which integrates autonomic and environmental stimuli *The Nucleus prepositus, which is involved in gaze *The Lateral hypothalamus, which releases orexin, which, as well as its other functions, is excitatory in the locus coeruleus. ===Outputs=== The projections from the locus coeruleus consist of neurons that utilize norepinephrine as their primary neurotransmitter. These projections include the following connections: :* LC ‚Üí Amygdala and Hippocampus :* LC ‚Üí Brain stem and Spinal cord :* LC ‚Üí Cerebellum :* LC ‚Üí Cerebral cortex :* LC ‚Üí Hypothalamus :* LC ‚Üí Tectum :* LC ‚Üí Thalamus :* LC ‚Üí Ventral tegmental area ==Function== It is related to many functions via its widespread projections. The LC-NA system modulates cortical, subcortical, cerebellar, brainstem, and spinal cord circuits. Some of the most important functions influenced by this system are: * Arousal and sleep-wake cycle * Attention and memory * Behavioral and cognitive flexibility, creativity, behavioral inhibition and stress (psychological) * Cognitive control * Decision making and utility maximization * Emotions * Neuroplasticity * Posture and balance The locus coeruleus is a part of the reticular activating system, and is almost completely inactivated in rapid eye movement sleep. ==Pathophysiology== The locus coeruleus may figure in clinical depression, panic disorder, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and anxiety. Some medications including norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (reboxetine, atomoxetine), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (venlafaxine, duloxetine), and norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (bupropion) are believed to show efficacy by acting upon neurons in this area. Research continues to reveal that norepinephrine (NE) is a critical regulator of numerous activities from stress response, the formation of memory to attention and arousal. Many neuropsychiatric disorders precipitate from alterations to NE modulated neurocircuitry: disorders of affect, anxiety disorders, PTSD, ADHD and Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in the locus coeruleus (LC) accompany dysregulation of NE function and likely play a key role in the pathophysiology of these neuropsychiatric disorders.Ressler KJ, Nemeroff CB. Role of norepinephrine in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. CNS Spectr. 2001 Aug;6(8):663-6, 670. ===In stress=== The locus coeruleus is responsible for mediating many of the sympathetic effects during stress. The locus coeruleus is activated by stress, and will respond by increasing norepinephrine secretion, which in turn will alter cognitive function (through the prefrontal cortex), increase motivation (through nucleus accumbens), activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and increase the sympathetic discharge/inhibit parasympathetic tone (through the brainstem). Specific to the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis, norepinephrine will stimulate the secretion of corticotropin-releasing factor from the hypothalamus, that induces adrenocorticotropic hormone release from the anterior pituitary and subsequent cortisol synthesis in the adrenal glands. Norepinephrine released from locus coeruleus will feedback to inhibit its production, and corticotropin-releasing factor will feedback to inhibit its production, while positively feeding to the locus coeruleus to increase norepinephrine production. The LC's role in cognitive function in relation to stress is complex and multi-modal. Norepinephrine released from the LC can act on Œ±2 receptors to increase working memory, or an excess of NE may decrease working memory by binding to the lower-affinity Œ±1 receptors. Psychiatric research has documented that enhanced noradrenergic postsynaptic responsiveness in the neuronal pathway (brain circuit) that originates in the locus coeruleus and ends in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala is a major factor in the pathophysiology of most stress-induced fear-circuitry disorders and especially in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The LC neurons are probably the origin of the first or second \\"leg\\" of the \\"PTSD circuit.\\" An important 2005 study of deceased American army veterans from World War II has shown combat-related PTSD to be associated with a postmortem-diminished number of neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) on the right side of the brain. ===In opiate withdrawal=== Opioids inhibit the firing of neurons in the locus coeruleus. When opioid consumption is stopped, the increased activity of the locus coeruleus contributes to the symptoms of opiate withdrawal. The alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist clonidine is used to counteract this withdrawal effect by decreasing adrenergic neurotransmission from the locus coeruleus. ===Rett syndrome === The genetic defect of the transcriptional regulator MECP2 is responsible for Rett syndrome. A MECP2 deficiency has been associated to catecholaminergic dysfunctions related to autonomic and sympathoadrenergic system in mouse models of Rett Syndrome (RTT). The locus coeruleus is the major source of noradrenergic innervation in the brain and sends widespread connections to rostral (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus) and caudal (cerebellum, brainstem nuclei) brain areasHokfelt T, Martensson R, Bjorklund A, Kleinau S, Goldstein M. 1984. Distribution maps of tyrosine-hydroxylase- immunoreactive neurons in the rat brain. In Handbook of Chemical Neuroanatomy, Vol. 2. Classical Transmitters in the CNS, Part I ( A. Bjorklund and T. Hokfelt, eds.) pp. 277-379. Elsevier, New York. and. Indeed, an alteration of this structure could contribute to several symptoms observed in MECP2-deficient mice. Changes in the electrophysiological properties of cells in the locus ceruleus were shown. These Locus Coeruleus cell changes include hyperexcitability and decreased functioning of its noradrenergic innervation. A reduction of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA level, the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis, was detected in the whole pons of MECP2-null male as well as in adult heterozygous female mice. Using immunoquantification techniques, a decrease of TH protein staining level, number of locus coeruleus TH-expressing neurons and density of dendritic arborization surrounding the structure was shown in symptomatic MECP2-deficient mice. However, locus coeruleus cells are not dying but are more likely losing their fully mature phenotype, since no apoptotic neurons in the pons were detected. Researchers have concluded that, \\"Because these neurons are a pivotal source of norepinephrine throughout the brainstem and forebrain and are involved in the regulation of diverse functions disrupted in Rett Syndrome, such as respiration and cognition, we hypothesize that the locus ceruleus is a critical site at which loss of MECP2 results in CNS dysfunction. Restoration of normal locus ceruleus function may therefore be of potential therapeutic value in the treatment of Rett Syndrome.\\" This could explain why a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (desipramine, DMI), which enhances the extracellular NE levels at all noradrenergic synapses, ameliorated some Rett syndrome symptoms in a mouse model of Rett syndrome. ===Neurodegenerative diseases=== The locus ceruleus is affected in many forms of neurodegenerative diseases: genetic and idiopathic Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, Pick's disease or Alzheimer's disease. It is also affected in Down syndrome.Esiri MM. et al. (2004). Neuropathology of dementia. 2nd ed. Cambridge University Press. For example, there is up to 80% loss of locus ceruleus neurons in Alzheimer's disease. Mouse models of Alzheimer's disease show accelerated progression after chemical destruction of the locus ceruleus The norepinephrine from locus ceruleus cells in addition to its neurotransmitter role locally diffuses from \\"varicosities\\". As such it provides an endogenous anti-inflammatory agent in the microenvironment around the neurons, glial cells, and blood vessels in the neocortex and hippocampus. It has been shown that norepinephrine stimulates mouse microglia to suppress AŒ≤-induced production of cytokines and promotes phagocytosis of AŒ≤. This suggests that degeneration of the locus ceruleus might be responsible for increased AŒ≤ deposition in AD brains. Degeneration of pigmented neurons in this region in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease can be visualized in vivo with Neuromelanin MRI. ==History== It was discovered in 1784 by F√©lix Vicq-d'Azyr, redescribed later by Johann Christian Reil in 1809 and named by Joseph Wenzel and Karl Wenzel brothers in 1812.Swanson, LW.

The name of the locus coeruleus is derived from its azure appearance in unstained brain tissue. The color is due to light scattering from neuromelanin in noradrenergic (producing or activated by norepinephrine) nerve cell bodies.

He won the Heinrich Mann Prize in 1967. He served the Stasi as an informer under the codename IM Martin. == Early life == Hermann Kant was born on June 14, 1926, in Hamburg, Germany the son of a factory worker and a gardener born into poverty. His younger brother, Uwe Kant, became a well-known children's author. Because of the impending bombing of Hamburg during the Second World War, the family moved to Parchim in 1940, where his paternal grandfather lived as a master potter. After passing elementary school he began an electrician apprenticeship in Parchim, which he completed in 1944. On December 8, 1944, he was drafted into the German Military. He became a Polish POW, was held in Warsaw's Mokot√≥w Prison and later was transferred to a labor camp, which was located on the site of the former Warsaw Ghetto. He was the co-founder of the antifascist committee and teacher at the Antifa Central School. During this time he met the writer Anna Seghers, who would have a lasting impression on him. After being released as a prisoner of war in 1949, he moved to East Germany and joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Kant finished High School in 1952 at the \\"Workers' and Peasants Faculty\\" in Greifswald. From 1952 to 1956 he studied German literature at the Humboldt University of Berlin . His thesis was entitled \\"The representation of the ideological-political structure of the German fascist army in Pliviers novel Stalingrad.\\" After graduating he worked until 1957 as a research assistant at the University and was also the editor of the student magazine, Tua res, from 1957 to 1959. In 1960, Kant became a freelance writer and member of the Writers' Union of East Germany. == Writing career == Kant's first book was published in 1962 as a collection of short stories entitled, A Little South Seas. The book showed stylistic influences adopted from the American Short Story genre and authors such as O. Henry, giving the East German literature a new satirical and a plainly ironic style.s. Manfred Durzak: Die deutsche Kurzgeschichte der Gegenwart. Autorenportr√§ts, Werkstattgespr√§che, Interpretationen. 3., erw. Aufl. W√ºrzburg 2002, S. 285 In his first novel, The Aula (1965), Kant described his own experiences at the \\"Workers and Peasants Faculty.\\" In the book, the closure of the faculty is an occasion for a graduation, for which the main character is to deliver a speech, which determines the fate of their fellow students and thus a part of their own lives in the early days of East Germany. \\"Kant's most famous and best novel\\"Hermann Wiegmann: Die deutsche Literatur des 20.

In: Zur Literatur der DDR. M√ºnchen 1974, S. 83‚Äì89 (zuerst in: Die Zeit, 1. April 1966) In 1972, the novel was published in a second edition, where he perfected his writing style. The publication was always seen as a false depiction of parts of the East German cultural bureaucracy, and Kant was criticized for painting a misrepresentation of the social conflict.s. Kant: Abspann. S. 286 ff.; Corino: Akte. S. 41 ff. In 1976 he began developing the novel Der Aufenthalt in the Bildungsroman style. He tells the story of Mark Niebuhr, mistakenly labelled as a German war criminal. With the protagonist socialist Roman left Kant's \\"hero\\" with nothing to do. The story describes a \\"conversion\\" or \\"enlightenment\\", but also knowledge of \\"disenchantment\\".Heinrich K√ºntzel: Von ‚ÄöAbschied‚Äò bis ‚ÄöAtemlos‚Äò. √úber die Poetik des Romans, insbesondere des Bildungs- und Entwicklungsromans in der DDR.

The writing was depicted in the 1983 DEFA film The Turning Point. In addition, Kant wrote occasionally scripts and screenplays, including for G√ºnter Reisch's feature film Ach du fr√∂hliche... (1962 - with supporting role) and, based on his own novel, turned into a made-for-TV movie; Mitten im kalten Winter (1968).

When Lenz was nine, in 1760, the family moved to Dorpat, now Tartu, where his father had been offered a minister's post. His first published poem appeared when he was 15. From 1768 to 1770 he studied theology on a scholarship, first at Dorpat and then at K√∂nigsberg. While there, he attended lectures by Immanuel Kant, who encouraged him to read Jean- Jacques Rousseau. He began increasingly to follow his literary interests and to neglect theology. His first independent publication, the long poem Die Landplagen (\\"Torments of the Land\\") appeared in 1769. He also studied music, most likely with either the Ukrainian virtuoso lutanist Timofey Belogradsky, then resident in K√∂nigsberg, or his student Johann Friedrich Reichardt. In 1771 Lenz abandoned his studies in K√∂nigsberg. Much against the will of his father, who on that account broke off contact with him, he took a position little better than that of a servant with Friedrich Georg and Ernst Nikolaus von Kleist (), barons from Courland and officer cadets about to begin their military service, whom he accompanied to Strasbourg. Once there, he came into contact with the actuary Johann Daniel Salzmann, around whom had formed the literary group of the Soci√©t√© de philosophie et de belles lettres. This was frequented also by the young Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who at this time happened to be in Strasbourg, and whose acquaintance Lenz made, as well as that of Johann Heinrich Jung-Stilling. Goethe now became Lenz's literary idol, and through him he made contact with Johann Gottfried Herder and Johann Kaspar Lavater, with whom he corresponded. In the following year, 1772, Lenz accompanied his masters to the garrisons of Landau, Fort Louis and Wissembourg. He also fell in love with Friederike Brion, once the beloved of Goethe, but his feelings were not reciprocated. In 1773 Lenz returned to Strasbourg and resumed his studies. The following year he gave up his position with the von Kleist brothers and lived as a freelance writer, earning his living by private tutoring. His relations with Goethe became friendlier: while the two of them were visiting Emmendingen, Goethe introduced Lenz to his sister Cornelia and her husband Johann Georg Schlosser. In April 1776 Lenz followed Goethe to the court of Weimar, where he was at first amicably received. But in early December, on Goethe's instigation, he was expelled. The exact circumstances are not recorded; Goethe, who broke off all personal contact with him after this, refers only vaguely in his diary to \\"Lenz's asininity\\" (\\"Lenzens Eseley\\"). Lenz then returned to Emmendingen, where the Schlossers took him in. From there he made a number of journeys into Alsace and Switzerland, including one to Lavater in Z√ºrich in May 1777. The news of Cornelia Schlosser's death, which reached him there in June of that year, had a powerful effect on him. He returned to Emmendingen, and then went back to Lavater. In November, while staying in Winterthur with Christoph Kaufmann, he suffered an attack of paranoid schizophrenia. In January 1778 Kaufmann sent Lenz to the philanthropist, social reformer and clergyman Johann Friedrich Oberlin in Waldersbach in Alsace, where he stayed from 20 January to 8 February. Despite the care of Oberlin and his wife, Lenz's mental condition grew worse. He returned to Schlosser at Emmendingen, where he was lodged with a shoemaker and then a forester. His younger brother Karl fetched him in June 1779 from Hertingen, where he was under treatment by a doctor, and brought him to Riga, where their father by this time had risen to the position of General Superintendent. Lenz was unable to establish himself professionally in Riga. An attempt to make him director of the cathedral school came to nothing, as Herder refused to give him a reference. Nor did he have any greater success in St. Petersburg, where he lived from February to September 1780. He then took a position as a private tutor on an estate near Dorpat, then, after another stay in St. Petersburg, he went to Moscow in September 1781, where initially he stayed with the historian Friedrich M√ºller and learned Russian. He worked as a private tutor, mixed in the circles of Russian Freemasons and authors, and helped produce a number of reformist schemes. He also translated books on Russian history into German. His mental condition however was steadily deteriorating all the while, and at last he became entirely dependent on the goodwill of Russian patrons for the means of living. In the early morning of 4 June 1792 (24 May in the Julian calendar) Lenz was found dead in a Moscow street. The place of his burial is unknown. ==Lenz as a literary figure== Lenz, a novella fragment by Georg B√ºchner, deals with Lenz's visit to the minister Friedrich Oberlin, in the Vosges. Lenz had visited Oberlin, on the suggestion of Kaufmann, because of his reputation as a pastor and psychologist. Oberlin's account of the events of Lenz's visit furnished B√ºchner with the source of his story, which in its turn was the source of Wolfgang Rihm's chamber opera Jakob Lenz. In Paul Celan's acceptance speech for the Georg B√ºchner Prize for Literature in 1960, both the historical man and the \\"Lenz\\" of B√ºchner's fragment figure heavily. In the first line of B√ºchner's novella, Lenz sets off for the mountains on 20 January. Celan relates this to the life of the poem, asking, \\"Perhaps one can say that every poem has its 20th of January?\\" He adds that the poem remains mindful of such dates. Celan also says of his work \\"Conversation in the Mountains,\\" composed after a missed encounter with Adorno, that it was written from such a date: that he started writing from his own \\"20th of January.\\" More recently the writers Peter Schneider, in his story Lenz (1973), and Gert Hoffmann, in his novella Die R√ºckkehr des verlorenen J.M.R. Lenz nach Riga (\\"The Return of the Lost J.M.R. Lenz to Riga\\", 1984), have given literary form to the events of his life. Also worth mentioning is Marc Buhl's novel of 2002, Der rote Domino (\\"The Red Domino\\"), which uses the friendship between Goethe and Lenz, and its abrupt end, as the inspiration for a detective story. ==Selected works== * Die Landplagen (\\"The Torments of the Land\\").

It was originally used to describe a person who was not a baptized member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints but who was friendly to church members and Mormonism, sympathized with them, and/or took an active interest in their belief system. Sometime in the early- to mid-twentieth century, however, the term began to refer to an individual deemed by adherents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to be an inactive or lapsed member of the LDS Church who, despite his personal religious viewpoint, maintained good relations with and positive feelings toward the church. ==Origin of the term== On April 18, 1845, the term \\"Jack Mormon\\" appeared in The Ottawa Free Trader to refer to J. B. Backenstos, the sheriff of Hancock County, who was \\"friendly to the Mormons, though not one himself.\\" This early published use of the term marks perhaps the earliest appearance of \\"Jack Mormon\\" in print, though it was followed soon by other instances in papers such as the New-York Daily Tribune and the Richmond Palladium. Thomas C. Sharp, editor of the Warsaw Signal, also coined the term \\"Jack-Mason\\" to refer to those who were sympathetic toward Freemasons in the Anti-Masonic political movement. These sympathetic non-Mormons included Nauvoo Justice of the Peace Daniel H. Wells, who later joined the church, and soldier and diplomat Thomas L. Kane. Kane was identified as a sympathetic Jack Mormon by US Army officials and the media, some of whom asserted that he had been secretly baptised into the LDS faith. However friendly toward the LDS people, Kane remained a Presbyterian all of his life. Several LDS historians believe that the term was used prior to Sharp's mention, and has ties to sympathetic Democrats in Jackson County, Missouri. Their belief is that the term originated in Missouri, during the Kirtland period of Latter Day Saint history, circa 1834. When Church members were expelled from Jackson County by a mob, many fled to Clay County, where local citizens, mostly Democrats, were sympathetic and friendly toward the Mormons. These citizens were pejoratively labeled \\"Jack\\" Mormons by the antagonistic citizens of Jackson County. During the early 1980s, it was also used as a description of members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS Church) who broke from the church, in part, over belief in plural marriage. ==Political usage== LDS Church membership was made up predominantly of liberal-leaning Democrats until the early 1900s, possibly due to anti-Mormon positions held by the Republican party during the latter half of the 19th Century. However, the church's conservative positions on social issues such as sexuality, drug use, traditional family values, and the role of religion in government caused large numbers of previously Democratic Latter-day Saints to shift to the Republican Party by the late 1970s. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the LDS church took a stand against the Equal Rights Amendment, and again increased the population's participation in the Republican party. At that time, many members who were registered Democrats were called \\"Jack Mormons\\", not as a negative term, but to distinguish them as traditional liberal Democrats. Because of the negative connotation of the term's modern context, this usage was short-lived. An alternative theory and contemporary usage holds that the term refers to a person who is a Mormon in \\"name only\\" (as in having a common Mormon surname) as though the \\"Mormon\\" label were nothing but a surname to this individual. The term was made popular by heavyweight champion William Harrison \\"Jack\\" Dempsey, born in Manassa, Colorado, on June 24, 1895. During the 1920s the greatest American sports hero of the day was undoubtedly Babe Ruth; his closest rival was Dempsey, a tough heavyweight boxer from the mining West. Around 1880 an LDS Church missionary converted his parents and they moved to the Mormon village of Manassa, Colorado. While his father parted ways with the church, his mother remained a devoted member. Jack would write, \\"I'm proud to be a Mormon. And ashamed to be the Jack Mormon that I am.\\" ==Change in terminology== The term is now used to describe a baptized member of the LDS Church who rarely or never practices the religion, but is still friendly toward the church. Alternatively, it can be used for someone that is of Mormon descent but unbaptized or non-religious. Some Jack Mormons still support the goals and beliefs of the LDS Church, but for various reasons choose not to attend services or participate in church activities. They are also colloquially known as Cultural Mormons, the LDS equivalent of a lapsed Catholic, a \\"Christmas and Easter Christian\\"/ \\"Sunday Christian\\"(or based on an adage \\"Once a Baptist, Always a Baptist\\") and a \\"Yom Kippur Jew\\" (or sometimes \\"ethnic Jew\\"). Some modern LDS youth today use the term to describe a baptized member who chooses not to follow the ethical, moral and cultural guidelines common to Mormons. These guidelines include refraining from profanity and pre-marital sex. Other common cultural limitations include following the Word of Wisdom by consuming a healthy diet, seeking exercise, and avoiding the use of drugs, tobacco, alcohol, and coffee and tea. Often such individuals are noticeable for public consumption of tobacco or alcohol. It is unclear how or why the meaning of the term changed to its current usage, which is almost the reverse of its original meaning. Preston Nibley, a mid-20th century LDS author who had a large impact on Mormon culture and folklore, mentioned the term in its modern context during the late 1940s and used it extensively in the 1950s. ==In popular culture== The term \\"Jack Mormon\\" was used by author Edward Abbey in his novel The Monkey Wrench Gang to describe a character, Seldom Seen Smith, who was a Mormon and had many wives, but was not active in the LDS Church nor its belief system: \\"Born by chance into membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons), Smith was on lifetime sabbatical from his religion. He was a jack Mormon. A jack Mormon is to a decent Mormon what a jackrabbit is to a cottontail.\\" In the play Angels in America by Tony Kushner, the character Harper Pitt identifies herself as a Jack Mormon, and postulates an alternate explanation for the origin of the term: \\"Like jack rabbit...I ran.\\" In Episode 6 of Season 5 of the AMC television series Hell On Wheels, the character known as Eva identifies herself as a Jack Mormon to the Brigham Young character. The term is used in its modern meaning by Wallace Stegner in his 1979 novel Recapitulation, set in Salt Lake City. Jerry Joseph and the Jackmormons is a rock band from Portland, Oregon in the United States. Jack Mormon Coffee Company is a Salt Lake-based coffee roaster, located in the Historic Avenues district. American actor Jason Cloud premiered a self-produced play titled Jack Mormon in December 2017 in Vienna, Austria. ==See also== * Antinomianism * Cafeteria Christianity * Cultural Catholic * Cultural Christian * Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints * Humanistic Judaism * Lapsed Catholic * Moralistic therapeutic deism * Sunday Christian ==Notes== ==External links== Jack Mormon Mormon, Jack Category:Latter Day Saint terms ","title":"Jack Mormon"},{"id":"833814","text":"Gerald Stanley Hawkins (20 April 1928- 26 May 2003) was a British-born American astronomer and author noted for his work in the field of archaeoastronomy. A professor and chair of the astronomy department at Boston University in the United States, he published in 1963 an analysis of Stonehenge in which he was the first to propose that it was an ancient astronomical observatory used to predict movements of the sun and moon, and that it was used as a computer. Archaeologists and other scholars have since demonstrated such sophisticated, complex planning and construction at other prehistoric earthwork sites, such as Cahokia in the United States. ==Early life and education== Gerald Hawkins was born in Great Yarmouth, England and studied physics and mathematics at the University of Nottingham. In 1952 he took a PhD in radio astronomy, studying under Sir Bernard Lovell at the University of Manchester. ==Career== In 1957 Hawkins became professor of astronomy and chairman of the department at Boston University in the United States. He wrote widely on numerous subjects, including tektites, meteors and the steady-state universe theory. Born in England, he became an American citizen in 1965. Hawkins applied the technological resources of the university to studying the astronomical alignments of ancient megalithic sites. He fed the positions of standing stones and other features at Stonehenge into an early IBM 7090 computer and used the mainframe to model sun and moon movements. In his 1965 book, Stonehenge Decoded, Hawkins argued that the various features at the monument were arranged in such a way as to predict a variety of astronomical events. This idea was briefly mentioned in his 1961 book, Splendor in the Sky (p23). By interpreting Stonehenge as a giant prehistoric observatory and computer, Hawkins' work re-assessed what had previously been seen as a primitive temple. The archaeological community was skeptical and his theories were criticized by such noted historians as Richard Atkinson, who denounced the book as being \\"...tendentious, arrogant, slipshod, and unconvincing\\". Stonehenge Decoded sold widely. It was especially popular among the members of 1960s counter culture, who found that it followed a similar \\"wisdom of the ancients\\" line explored by Alexander Thom. Hawkins' theories still inform popular opinion of Stonehenge. Although some archaeologists are cautious to accept Hawkins' theories, many archaeoastronomers have built upon his work. Many scholars accept that the importance of astronomical alignment and large complexes being planned and constructed to fulfill cosmology has been demonstrated at other prehistoric sites, such as the Snake Mound and CahokiaFriedlander, Michael W., \\"The Cahokia Sun Circles\\", The Wisconsin Archeologist, Vol. 88(1), pages 78-90, 2007. in the United States. Hawkins later examined the Nazca lines in Peru, and concluded there was not enough evidence to support an astronomical explanation for them. He also studied the temple of Amun at Karnak. He continued to study Stonehenge up until his death.

First published in 1912, it was re-released with an author's preface in 1922. It also ran as a serial in McClure's, giving Cather some free time from her work for that magazine. ==Plot introduction== Bartley Alexander is a construction engineer and world-renowned builder of bridges undergoing a mid-life crisis. Although married to Winifred, Bartley resumes his acquaintance with a former lover, Hilda Burgoyne, in London. The affair gnaws at Bartley's sense of propriety and honor. ==Plot summary== Professor Wilson arrives at the Alexanders' house in Boston, Bartley Alexander having persuaded him to attend a Congress of Psychologists in the city. He is greeted by Winifred Alexander. When her husband comes home the men talk; Winifred plays the piano for them. The next day, she tells Wilson how she met her husband through her aunt. On Christmas Eve, the Alexanders prepare for Christmas dinner. Bartley tells Wilson he is having trouble with a bridge in Canada. Later he gives his wife pearl earrings. On New Year's Day, Alexander makes ready to leave for London. On the ship, he endures sharp gales and goes into a bar, where he gambles at bridge, the card game. In London, Bartley visits Hilda and tells her he cannot go on having two relationships; she must forget about him and leave him alone. She is distressed. The day before he is due to return to America however, he takes her out to dinner. Later, Hugh MacConnell walks Hilda back to her house on a foggy day. She says she isn't attracted to him; they are just close friends. In her house, she receives a letter from Bartley, saying he is going mad away from her. This prompts her to visit him in America to tell him she will marry another man; Bartley doesn't like the idea. They spend one last evening together. Soon afterward, Philip Horton calls Bartley to Canada to inspect the bridge. Bartley discovers that one of the lower chords is failing, compromising the structural integrity of the entire bridge. Horton, concerned not to halt construction, had attempted to contact Bartley earlier ‚Äì the very day Bartley was with Hilda. As Bartley is on the bridge stopping the work crews, the bridge collapses, killing many of the workers. Bartley's body is recovered the next day and taken to Horton's house.

Meade was born in Swanage, Dorset. He was educated at Malvern College and attended Oriel College, Oxford in 1926 to read Greats, but switched to Philosophy, Politics and Economics and gained an outstanding first. His interest in economics grew from an influential postgraduate year at Christ's College, Cambridge and Trinity College, Cambridge (1930‚Äì31), where he held frequent discussions with leading economists of the time including Dennis Robertson and John Maynard Keynes. After working in the League of Nations and the Cabinet Office, he was the leading economist of the early years of Clement Attlee's government, before taking professorships at the London School of Economics (1947‚Äì1957) and the University of Cambridge (1957‚Äì1967). ==Early life and education== Meade was brought up in the city of Bath, Somerset in south-west England. He attended the Lambrook school in Berkshire from 1917 to 1921, where his education revolved around the Greek and Latin languages. In his time in Oriel College, Oxford, Meade switched at the end of his second year from Greats to Philosophy, Politics and Economics which was a very new concept at that time having started only in 1921. Meade's interest in economics grew due to various reasons. He considered the heavy unemployment in the United Kingdom in the inter-war period as a menace and a social evil. His association with Major C. H. Douglas, to whom he was introduced to by his aunt, helped him come up with a cure for this evil. In 1930 Meade was elected to a fellowship at Hertford College, Oxford. There he received the option of continuing his study of economics as a post graduate student. In 1930‚Äì31 Meade joined Trinity College, Cambridge after being invited to do so by Dennis Robertson whom he met through his great aunt. While in Cambridge Meade became close friends with Richard Kahn, Piero Sraffa, Joan Robinson and Austin Robinson, forming the Cambridge Circus for economic discussion. Together they started discussing Keynes' work namely the A Treatise on Money. Every weekend Keynes appeared and was presented with the circle's discussion over the week by Kahn. They also discussed theories with Keynes when they met on Monday evenings at the political economy club in Keynes' room in King's College. ==Career== Meade became a lecturer at Hertford College, Oxford in 1931 and continued until 1937. Meade along with young enthusiasts such as Roy Harrod, Henry Phelps Brown, Charlie Hitch, Robert Hall, Lindley Fraser, Maurice Allen and Eric Hargreaves, who was his old tutor at Oriel College, started the concept of teaching economics as a regular subject for examination which was relatively new at Oxford. Meade was assigned with the responsibility of teaching the whole subject of economic theory. The economics of mass-unemployment and international economics interested Meade in particular. At that time Oxford had a really strong branch of the League of Nations Union with Gilbert Murray as its chairman and Margaret Wilson as its secretary. (Wilson married Meade in 1933.https://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/proc/files/105p473.pdf) Meade was made a member of the economics section of the League of Nations in Geneva in 1937. He worked as the main editor of the journal \\"World Economic Survey\\" and published the 17th and the 18th editions. In April 1940 Meade was forced to leave Geneva for England with his family of three children because of the war. He became a member of the Economic Section of the War Cabinet Secretariat in England and remained member until 1947 rising to the post of Director in 1946. Meade was joined by Lionel Robbins and Keynes and together they used the section to solve everyday economic problems ranging from the rationing system to the pricing policy of nationalized companies. Meade became the professor of trade at London School of Economics in 1947 where the Economics department was headed by Lionel Robbins. While he was in Oxford, Meade had written a short textbook titled \\"An Introduction to Economic Analysis and Policy.\\" Meade believed it was time to rewrite the book while teaching international economics, more precisely the theory of international economic policy. It slowly cultivated into Meade's two books, The Balance of Payments (1951) and Trade and Welfare (1955). The first volume The Balance of Payments stresses the fact that for each of its policy objectives, the government requires a policy tool. The second volume Trade and Welfare deals with conditions under which free trade makes a country better off and conditions under which it does not. Meade concluded that, contrary to previous beliefs, if a country was already protecting one of its markets from international competition, further protection of another market could be \\"second best.\\" That is, although the ideal would be to eliminate all trade barriers, if for some reason this was not feasible, then adding a carefully chosen dose of protectionism could improve the nation's economic well-being. The two books took Meade a decade to complete, however according to him they still did not cover the entire field of international economic policy since he had given less attention to the issue of international aspects of economic growth or dynamic imbalance. Despite his words, Meade shared the Nobel Prize in Economics along with Bertil Ohlin in 1977. In 1957 Meade moved from London to the chair of political economy in Cambridge, which he held until 1967, after which he resigned to become a senior research fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge. Meade left the fellowship at the retirement age in 1974. During this time Meade started thinking about writing one or two volumes on the domestic aspects of economic theory and policy. He successfully wrote four volumes in this series namely The Stationary Economy, The Growing Economy, The Controlled Economy, and The Just Economy. Even after the four volumes Meade still believed that he had just made the beginning. He believed that the frontiers of knowledge when it comes to economics keep expanding at such a rate that it was almost impossible to establish a soundly based understanding of the entire subject and its ever- evolving parts. In 1974 Meade took time off to act as full-time chairman of a committee set up by the Institute for Fiscal Studies to examine the structure of direct taxation in the United Kingdom. The committee consisted of a number of first-rate economic theorists and of leading practitioners in tax law, accountancy and administration. In 1976, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) by the University of Bath.Honorary Graduates 1966 to 1988 ‚Äì University of Bath Meade died on 22 December 1995 in Little Shelford, Cambridgeshire. ==Meade's model of economic growth== The basic assumptions for J.E.Meade's model are as follows: (1) The economy in question is a closed economy with no relationship with the outside world. (2) There is no government activity involving taxation and expenditure. (3) Perfect competition exists in the market. (4) Constant returns to scale prevails in the economy. (5) There are only two commodities-a consumption good and a capital good. (6) There is full employment of land, labour and machinery. (7) All machinery are alike and the ratio of labour to machinery can be easily varied, hence there is perfect malleability of machinery. (8) There is perfect substitutability between capital goods, consumption goods and any given stock of machines, no matter how old or new they are, a certain percentage gets replaced every year. Meade calls this phenomenon the assumption of depreciation by evaporation. ===Determinants of the rate of economic growth=== According to the assumptions given above, the net output produced by the economy depends on the following four things: (1) The amount of existing stock of machines in the economy (2) The amount of labor for production process (3) The amount of land or natural resources available for productive use in the economy (4) The technological progress in the economy which is expected to improve over time. Hence the production function for the economy is given by: : Y = F (K,L,N,t) Where: Y = net output or net real income K = existing stock of machines L = the amount of labour N = amount of land t = time Time is accounted for because with the passage of time the production would increase without any increase in K , L , or N . An increase in Y with time (denoted by \\\\Delta Y ) can take place in three ways. First, the machine stockpile may increase if the community starts saving part of their income thereby accumulating real capital. If the increase in the stock of capital taking place in one year is given by \\\\Delta Y , the output would increase by V \\\\Delta K where V denotes the marginal net physical product of a machine. Secondly, L , the working population, may grow. If \\\\Delta L denotes an increase in the amount of labour productivity employed im a single year and W measures the marginal product of labour, the output will increase in that year by W \\\\Delta L . Finally, the net output can increase if there is an increase in the technical progress (hence enabling increased efficiency). The total increase in net output due to technical progress is given by \\\\Delta Y' . Hence the total increase in net output in one year is the sum of the three influences. Combining this we get the equation: \\\\Delta Y = V \\\\Delta K + W \\\\Delta L + \\\\Delta Y' Dividing both sides by Y , we get \\\\frac{\\\\Delta Y}{Y} = \\\\frac{V}{Y} . \\\\Delta K + \\\\frac{W}{Y} \\\\Delta L + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta Y'}{Y} Or, \\\\frac{\\\\Delta Y}{Y} = \\\\frac{VK}{Y} . \\\\frac{\\\\Delta K}{K} + \\\\frac{WL}{Y} . \\\\frac{\\\\Delta L}{L} + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta Y'}{Y} (Equation 1) Here \\\\frac{\\\\Delta Y}{Y} is the annual proportionate rate of growth of output, \\\\frac{\\\\Delta K}{K} the annual proportionate rate of growth of machinery stock, \\\\frac{\\\\Delta L}{L} the annual proportionate rate of growth of productively employed labour and \\\\frac{\\\\Delta Y'}{Y} the annual proportionate rate of growth of output due solely to increase in technical progress. Meade denotes these four proportionate rates of growth as y , k , l and r respectively. \\\\frac{VK}{Y} is the proportion of net national income to be paid in net profits (provided the owners of machinery receive a reward equal to the value of the net marginal product of the machinery). Meade denotes this as U and calls it \\"the proportional marginal product of machinery\\". Under the assumption of constant returns to scale, it is equal to the proportion of national income received in profits. Similarly \\\\frac{WL}{Y} represents the proportional marginal product of labour and is equal to the proportion of the net national income going to wages under conditions of constant-returns competitive equilibrium. Meade denotes this as Q . Hence equation 1 can be written as Y = UK +Ql + r (Equation 2) This shows the growth rate of output y as being the weighted sum of three other growth rates, the sum of the growth rate in the stock of machines k weighted by the marginal importance of machinery in the productive process i.e., in a competitive equilibrium by the proportion of the national income going to profits U plus the growth rate of the population I weighted by the marginal importance of labour in the productive process or, in a competitive equilibrium by the proportion of income going to wages Q plus the growth rate of technical progress r Hence equation 2 can be written as y - l = Uk - (1 - Q)L + r (Equation 3) Since y - l is the difference between the growth rate of total output and growth rate of the workforce, the growth rate of the real income per head can be measured. For example, if the total real income is increasing by 10 percent every annum but the working population is growing at 8 percent per annum, the income per head is rising by approximately 2 percent per annum. Equation 3 shows that the growth rate of real income per head (y ‚Äì l) is the output of three factors. Firstly it is raised by the growth rate in real capital k weighted by its proportional marginal product or by the proportion of net national income which would be paid min profits in a competitive equilibrium U . Secondly it is depressed by the growth rate in the working population l weighted by one minus the proportional marginal product of labour l - Q . Lastly it is raised by the amount of technology in the economy r . The element UK in equation 3 can also be written down as \\\\frac{VK}{Y} . k since the growth rate of machine stock is \\\\frac{SY}{K} where S is the proportion of the net national income that is saved. Therefore, we have Uk = US . \\\\frac{Y}{K} = SV which expresses the same thing in three forms namely the contribution which capital accumulation makes to the growth rate of the final output. Hence the basic relationship between the growth rate of real income per head and its three basic determinants can be expressed as: y - l = Uk - (1 - Q)l + r y - l = US . \\\\frac{Y}{K} - (1 - Q)l + r y - l = SV - (1 - Q)l + r Meade explains the application of these equations by taking a simple numerical example. Suppose the people save one tenth of their income such that S = and that the marginal product of real capital goods or the market profit rate is 5 percent per annum. Hence V = 5 percent per annum. The contribution of capital accumulation to the growth of output, SV would be one tenth of 5 percent per annum. Hence ¬Ω percent per annum. The explanation of this is, out of a year's income of 1000, if people save 100 units of product and if a once-for-all addition of 100 units to the stock of machines increases annual output in every future year by 5 units, then the initial annual income of 1000 will be raised by this year's capital accumulation to 1005 or by ¬Ω percent during the course of the year. Assuming initial annual income to be 1000 and the initial machinery stock to be 2000 Y = 1000 and K = 2000 . Similarly, the same thing can be expressed by saying that the stock of machines had increased from 2000 to 2100 or by 5 percent per annum. Then U = \\\\frac{VK}{Y} = \\\\frac{(5/100) \\\\times 2000}{1000} = \\\\frac{1}{10} and Uk = \\\\frac{1}{10} \\\\times 5 = \\\\frac{1}{2} per annum. Thus the contribution of capital accumulation to growth rate of the final output was one tenth of 5 percent per year or ¬Ω percent per annum. The same result can be obtained by multiplying the proportion of the national income going to profits U , the proportion of the national income which is saved S and the annual income to capital stock ratio \\\\frac{Y}{K} Our numerical example is: US . \\\\frac{Y}{K} = \\\\frac{1}{10} \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{10} \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{1}{2} percent per annum. ===Critical appraisal of Meade's growth theory=== The growth theory provided by Meade is neo-Classical in nature. It is simple and attractive as it promises a state of steady economic growth. However it suffers from a few drawbacks First, for a steady state of economic growth to exist, the technological progress should be assumed to be entirely labour-augmenting. This is the special case of Harrod-neutral technological progress. However this does not seem to exist in the model. Second, the neo-Classical adjustment mechanism depends on the flexibility of factor prices. But if they are not flexible a lot of difficulty is established. For example, in the Keynesian liquidity trap, the interest rate may fail to go down beyond a minimum level hence preventing the capital-output ratio to be high enough to reach growth equilibrium. Third, there is no mention about investment function in the model. It is assumed to be solely determined by savings. Hence entrepreneurial expectations about the future are not taken into account. Fourth, in the neo- Classical models capital is assumed to be jelly-like, homogeneous and malleable. This assumption is truly unrealistic, but without it present, it becomes very difficult to reach a stage of steady growth. Finally, the technological progress is considered to be totally exogenous which is again extremely unrealistic and has been pointed out by many economists. To sum up, the neo-Classical growth model of Meade is based on certain restrictive and unrealistic assumptions. Hence applying this model in the case of under developed nations is almost impossible since the assumptions of perfect competition, full employment of labour and machinery and constant returns to scale do not fit in their economic realities. ==Other contributions== Professor Meade made other contributions to economics. For example, he showed that the labour-managed firm (or worker cooperatives) need not respond inefficiently to price rises even in theory.\\"Perverse\\" market responses, known as the \\"Ward effect,\\" need not hold if a cooperative allows simple inegalitarian features when allotting shares to new-joining members: James Meade, \\"The Theory of Labour Managed Firms and of Profit Sharing,\\" Economic Journal 82, 325 (Supplement, March 1972): 402‚Äì428. Along with fellow Neo- Keynesian economist James Tobin in 1980, Meade proposed nominal GDP targeting as a monetary policy rule during his Nobel Prize memorial lecture on December 8, 1977. ==Published works== His books include: * The Theory of International Economic PolicyThe Balance of Payments (1951) * The Theory of International Economic PolicyTrade and Welfare (1955) * Principles of Political Economy (1965‚Äì76) * The Intelligent Radical's Guide To Economic Policy (1975) * Liberty, Equality and Efficiency (1993) ==Notes== ==References== * * ==External links== * Obituary, The Independent * Obituary, The New York Times * * Short autobiography by James Meade * Catalogue of the Meade papers at the Archives Division of the London School of Economics. * * Time.dufe.edu.cn * including the Prize Lecture December 8, 1977 The Meaning of ‚ÄúInternal Balance‚Äù Category:1907 births Category:1995 deaths Category:British economists Category:Nobel laureates in Economics Category:British Nobel laureates Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:Alumni of Oriel College, Oxford Category:Academics of the London School of Economics Category:People from Swanage Category:People educated at Malvern College Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:Fellows of the British Academy Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences Category:English Nobel laureates Category:Fellows of Hertford College, Oxford Category:Fellows of Christ's College, Cambridge Category:20th-century economists Category:Social Democratic Party (UK) politicians ","title":"James Meade"},{"id":"833857","text":"Anna Seghers (; 19 November 1900 ‚Äì 1 June 1983) was a German writer famous for depicting the moral experience of the Second World War. After living in Mexico City (1941‚Äì47) and West Berlin (1947-50), Anna Seghers eventually settled in the GDR. The pseudonym Anna Seghers was apparently based on the surname of the Dutch painter and printmaker Hercules Pieterszoon Seghers or Segers (c. 1589 ‚Äì c. 1638). == Life == Born Anna (Netty) Reiling in Mainz in 1900 into a Jewish family, her father was a dealer in antiques and cultural artefacts. She married L√°szl√≥ Radv√°nyi, also known as Johann Lorenz Schmidt, a Hungarian Communist in 1925, thereby acquiring Hungarian citizenship. In Cologne and Heidelberg she studied history, the history of art and Chinese. She joined the Communist Party of Germany in 1928, at a time when the Weimar Republic was moribund and soon to be replaced. Her 1932 novel, Die Gef√§hrten was a prophetic warning of the dangers of Nazism, which led to her being arrested by the Gestapo. In 1932, she also formally left the Jewish community. Grave of Anna Seghers in Berlin By 1934 she had emigrated, via Zurich, to Paris. After German troops invaded the French Third Republic in 1940, she fled to Marseilles and one year later to Mexico, where she founded the anti-fascist 'Heinrich-Heine-Klub', named after the German Jewish poet Heinrich Heine, and founded Freies Deutschland (Free Germany), an academic journal. While still in Paris, in 1939, she had written The Seventh Cross, for which she received the B√ºchner-Prize in 1947. The novel is set in 1936 and describes the escape of seven prisoners from a concentration camp. It was published in the United States in 1942 and produced as a movie in 1944 by MGM starring Spencer Tracy. The Seventh Cross was one of the very few depictions of Nazi concentration camps, in either literature or the cinema, during World War II. Seghers's best-known story, The Outing of the Dead Girls (1946), written in Mexico, was an autobiographical reminiscence of a pre-World War I class excursion on the Rhine river in which the actions of the protagonist's classmates are seen in light of their decisions and ultimate fates during both world wars. In describing them, the German countryside, and her soon-to-be destroyed hometown Mainz, Seghers gives the reader a strong sense of lost innocence and the senseless injustices of war, from which there proves to be no escape, whether or not you sympathized with the NSDAP. Other notable Seghers stories include Sagen von Artemis (1938) and The Ship of the Argonauts (1953), both based on myths. In 1947, Seghers returned to Germany, moved to West Berlin, and became a member of the SED in the zone occupied by the Soviets and received Georg B√ºchner Prize in the same year. In 1950, she moved to East Berlin and became a co-founder of the Academy of the Arts of the GDR and became a member of World Peace Council. In 1951, she received the first Nationalpreis der DDR, the Stalin Peace Prize also in 1951, and an honorary doctorate by the University of Jena in 1959. Seghers was nominated for the 1967 Nobel Prize in Literature by the German Academy of Arts. In 1981, she became honorary citizen of her native town Mainz. She died in Berlin on 1 June 1983. ==Trivia== Anna Seghers is mentioned in the ostalgie film, Good Bye Lenin!. == Selected works == Anna Seghers' earlier works are typically attributed to the New Objectivity movement. She also made a number of important contributions to Exilliteratur, including her novels Transit and The Seventh Cross. Her later novels, published in the GDR, are often associated with Social Realism. A number of her novels have been adapted into films in Germany. *1928 ‚Äì Aufstand der Fischer von St. Barbara ‚Äì Revolt of the Fishermen of Santa Barbara (novel) * 1933 ‚Äì Der Kopflohn ‚Äì A Price on His Head (novel) * 1939 ‚Äì Das siebte Kreuz ‚Äì The Seventh Cross (novel) * 1943 ‚Äì Der Ausflug der toten M√§dchen ‚Äì \\"The Excursion of the Dead Girls\\" (story) (in German Women Writers of the Twentieth Century, Pergamon Press, 1978) * 1944 - Transit ‚Äì Transit Visa (novel) * 1946 - Die Saboteure - The Saboteurs (1946) * 1949 - Die Toten bleiben jung ‚Äì The Dead Stay Young (novel) * 1949 - (short story) * 1950 - Die Linie. * 1950 - Der Kesselflicker \\"The Tinker\\" (short story) * 1951 - Crisanta (novella) * 1951 - Die Kinder. * 1952 - Der Mann und sein Name (novella) * 1953 - Der Bienenstock \\"The Beehive\\" (short story) * 1954 - Gedanken zur DDR.

It creates a number of offences against property in England and Wales. On 15 January 2007 the Fraud Act 2006 came into force, redefining most of the offences of deception. ==History== The Theft Act 1968 resulted from the efforts of the Criminal Law Revision Committee to reform the English law of theft. The Larceny Act 1916 had codified the common law, including larceny itself, but it remained a complex web of offences. The intention of the Theft Act 1968, was to replace the existing law of larceny and other deception- related offences, by a single enactment, creating a more coherent body of principles that would allow the law to evolve to meet new situations. ==Provisions== A number of greatly simplifiedor at least less complicatedoffences were created. ===Section 1 - Basic definition of \\"theft\\"=== This section creates the offence of theft. This definition is supplemented by sections 2 to 6. The definition of theft under the Theft Act 1968 is ‚ÄòA person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with intention to permanently deprive the other of it‚Äô ===Section 2 - \\"Dishonestly\\"=== This section provides a partial definition of dishonesty for certain purposes. ===Section 3 - \\"Appropriation\\"=== Appropriation is defined as \\"Any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner\\". The courts have interpreted the assumption \\"of the rights of an owner\\" to mean that a person assumes at least one of a set of rights rather than having to assume all of the rights of the owners. This interpretation of the legislation was originally given in the case of R v Morris; Anderton v Burnside,[1984] UKHL 1 and it has been endorsed by the decision in R v Gomez.[1993] AC 442R v Gomez, UK Law Online, Leeds University ===Section 4 - \\"Property\\"=== The definition of property is \\"any property including money and all other property, real or personal, including things in action and other intangible property\\" ===Section 5 - \\"Belonging to another\\"=== The definition of belonging to another is \\"Property shall be regarded as belonging to any person having possession or control of it, or having in it any proprietary right or interest (not being an equitable interest arising only from an agreement to transfer or grant an interest).\\". It is possible to have a proprietary right or interest over property that in the ordinary sense belongs to someone else. In the case of R v Turner (No. 2),[1971] 1 WLR 901 the Court of Appeal found that a man had committed theft by driving away his car without having paid for repairs made on the car. The garage that repaired his car had a proprietary right over it. One can have a controlling interest in a piece of property even after selling it. In R v Marshall,[1998] 2 Cr App R 282 a group of defendants resold used tickets for the London Underground. The Court of Appeal dismissed their appeal in part because the tickets said they were the property of London Underground, a condition of sale agreed to by the original buyer of the ticket. Section 5 includes subsections that deal with possession that has conditions. Section 5(3) deals with situations where a person has given property to another for a particular purpose: the person receiving the property is said to be engaging in theft if they use the property for some purpose it was not intended. If A gives B money to purchase a particular good for A and B buys something else with it without A's consent, even though the property is not in A's hands, A still has a controlling interest in it under Section 5(3). If one is placed under a duty to use property in a particular way, that obligation must be legal under civil law according to the Court of Appeal in R v. Breaks and Huggan (1998). There are limits to the legal obligations one is liable for under Section 5(3). In R v. Hall (1972), a customer paid a deposit to a travel agent. The deposit was paid into the company's bank account but the travel agent went out of business. This was not an instance of theft as the money was legitimately paid as a deposit against cancellation and there was no specific obligation to spend the money in a particular way. Section 5(4) requires that if property is received by mistake it must be returned and failure to do so counts as appropriation. This was seen in action in Attorney-General's Reference (No. 1 of 1983) where a police officer was given ¬£74 extra in her wages but failed to return it or alert her superiors to it. The Court of Appeal held it to be theft. ===Section 6 - \\"Intention to permanently deprive\\"=== This section provides that a person in order to be guilty of theft had the intention of permanently depriving the other of the property. In certain cases, the intention to deprive may be construed, even when the person may not have meant to deprive another of their property permanently, for example if the intention is to treat another's property as one's own to dispose of regardless of the other‚Äôs rights. ===Section 7 - Theft=== This section provides that a person convicted of theft on indictment is liable to imprisonment to a term not exceeding seven years. ===Section 8 - Robbery=== Section 8(1) creates the offence of robbery. Section 8(2) provides that a person convicted on indictment of robbery or assault with intent to rob is liable to imprisonment for life. ===Section 9 - Burglary=== This section creates the two offences of burglary and provides for penalties for that offence on conviction on indictment. The two offences can be found in section 9 (1) (a) and in section 9 (1) (b) Section 9 (1)(A) An offence the entry has to be with intent to commit one of the three offences listed and the entry may be by entry of the full body, entry of part of the body or entry by an instrument For a 9(1)(b) offence the offender does not require intention at the point of entry. An intention to commit the offence is not sufficient for the offence under section 9(1)(b) ‚Äì a person must have entered as a trespasser and then actually steal (or attempt to steal) or inflict (or attempt to inflict) grievous bodily harm. ===Section 10 - Aggravated burglary=== Section 10(1) creates the offence of aggravated burglary. Section 10(2) provides that a person guilty of that offence is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for life. ===Section 11 - Removal of articles from places open to the public=== This section creates the offence of removing article from place open to the public and provides that a person guilty of that offence is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. ===Section 12 - Taking motor vehicle or other conveyance without authority=== Section 12(1) creates an offence of taking a conveyance other than a pedal cycle without authority. Section 12(5) creates a separate offence of taking a pedal cycle. ===Section 12A - Aggravated vehicle-taking=== This section, which was added by the Aggravated Vehicle-Taking Act 1992, creates an offence of aggravated vehicle taking. ===Section 13 - Abstracting of electricity=== This section creates the offence of abstracting electricity. It replaces section 10 of the Larceny Act 1916. ===Section 14=== Extension to thefts from mails outside England and Wales, and robbery etc. on such a theft. ===Section 15 - Obtaining property by deception=== This section was repealed by the Fraud Act 2006. It created the offence of obtaining property by deception and provided a definition of deception for the purpose of that offence and the offences under sections 15A and 16 and 20(2) of this Act and sections 1 and 2 of the Theft Act 1978. ===Sections 15A and 15B=== These sections were repealed by the Fraud Act 2006. Section 15A created the offence of obtaining a money transfer by deception. Section 15B made supplementary provision. ===Section 16 - Obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception=== This section was repealed by the Fraud Act 2006. It created the offence of obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception. ===Section 17 - False accounting=== This section creates an offence of false accounting. ===Section 18 - Liability of company officers for certain offences by company=== The words \\"15, 16 or\\" in section 18(1) were repealed on 15 January 2007 by Schedule 3 to the Fraud Act 2006. ===Section 19 - False statements by company directors etc=== This section adds liability for any officer of a corporation or legal entity who publishes false accounts with intent to deceive members or creditors of the body corporate or association about its affairs. ===Section 20 - Suppression, etc, of documents=== Section 20(2) created the offence of procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception. Section 20(2) and the words \\"\\"deception\\" has the same meaning as in section 15 of this Act, and\\" in section 20(3) were repealed on 15 January 2007 by Schedule 3 to the Fraud Act 2006. ===Section 21 - Blackmail=== This section creates the offence of blackmail. ===Section 22 - Handling stolen goods=== This section creates the offence of handling stolen goods. ===Section 23 - Advertising rewards for return of goods stolen or lost=== This section replaces section 102 of the Larceny Act 1861.Ormerod, David. Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law. Thirteenth Edition. Oxford University Press. 2011. p. 254. n. 49. A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale. ===Section 24=== Scope of offences relating to stolen goods. ===Section 24A - Dishonestly retaining a wrongful credit=== This section creates the offence of dishonestly retaining a wrongful credit. Sections 24A(3) and (4) were repealed on 15 January 2007 by Schedule 3 to the Fraud Act 2006. ===Section 25=== This section creates an offence of \\"going equipped\\" for burglary or theft. It is described by the marginal note to that section as \\"going equipped for stealing, etc\\", and by the preceding crossheading as \\"possession of housebreaking implements, etc\\". It includes any item that is designed to be used to carry out a theft or burglary, as well as any items made specifically by a thief for use in committing a burglary, etc. The words \\", and 'cheat' means an offence under section 15 of this Act\\" in section 25(5) were repealed on 15 January 2007 by Schedule 3 to the Fraud Act 2006. This was consequential on the repeal of section 15. ==See also== *Theft Act ==Notes== ==References== *Allen, Michael. Textbook on Criminal Law. Oxford: Oxford University Press.

He was knighted in the 1997 Birthday Honours. == Early life and education == Born in Minnigaff, Kirkcudbrightshire, Mirrlees was educated at Douglas Ewart High School, then at the University of Edinburgh (MA in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in 1957) and Trinity College, Cambridge (Mathematical Tripos and PhD in 1963 with thesis title Optimum Planning for a Dynamic Economy, supervised by Richard Stone). He was a very active student debater. A contemporary, Quentin Skinner, has suggested that Mirrlees was a member of the Cambridge Apostles along with fellow Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen during the period. == Economics == Between 1968 and 1976, Mirrlees was a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology three times. He was also a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley (1986) and Yale University (1989). He taught at both Oxford University (as Edgeworth Professor of Economics 1968‚Äì1995) and University of Cambridge (1963‚Äì1968 and 1995‚Äì2018). During his time at Oxford, he published papers on economic models for which he would eventually be awarded his Nobel Prize. The papers centred on asymmetric information, which determines the extent to which they should affect the optimal rate of saving in an economy. Among other results, he demonstrated the principles of \\"moral hazard\\" and \\"optimal income taxation\\" discussed in the books of William Vickrey. The methodology has since become the standard in the field. Mirrlees and Vickrey shared the 1996 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences \\"for their fundamental contributions to the economic theory of incentives under asymmetric information\\". Mirrlees was also co-creator, with MIT Professor Peter A. Diamond, of the Diamond‚ÄìMirrlees efficiency theorem, which was developed in 1971.Peter A. Diamond and James A. Mirrlees (1971). \\"Optimal Taxation and Public Production I: Production Efficiency,\\" American Economic Review, 61(1), pp. 8‚Äì27 (press +). _____ (1971). \\"Optimal Taxation and Public Production II: Tax Rules,\\" American Economic Review, 61(3), Part 1, pp. 261‚Äì278 (press +). Mirrlees was emeritus Professor of Political Economy at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. He spent several months a year at the University of Melbourne, Australia. He was the Distinguished Professor-at- Large of the Chinese University of Hong Kong as well as University of Macau.UMAC Department of Economics: Staff In 2009, he was appointed Founding Master of the Morningside College of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Mirrlees was a member of Scotland's Council of Economic Advisers. He also led the Mirrlees Review, a review of the UK tax system by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. His Ph.D. students included eminent academics and policy makers like professor Franklin Allen, Sir Partha Dasgupta, professor Huw Dixon, professor Hyun-Song Shin, Lord Nicholas Stern, professor Anthony Venables, Sir John Vickers, and professor Zhang Weiying. He died in Cambridge, England, on 29 August 2018. == Personal life == Mirrlees was an atheist. == Publications == * \\"A New Model of Economic Growth\\"(with N.

It is written and illustrated by American cartoonist, professor, and mathematician Larry Gonick, who started the project in 1978.Paul Gravet, \\"1001 Comics You Must Read Before You Die\\", Universe, 2011, page 393. Each book in the series explains a period of world history in a loosely chronological order. Though originally published as a comic book series, the series is now published in trade paperback volumes of several hundred pages each. The final volume covers history from the late 18th century to early 2008. The final two volumes, published in 2007 and 2009, are named The Cartoon History of the Modern World volumes one and two. The books have been translated into many languages, including Portuguese, Greek, Czech and Polish. == Publication history == San Francisco-based underground comix publisher Rip Off Press began publishing The Cartoon History of the Universe in 1978, with the first six issues being published by 1981. Rip Off Press published 9 issues from 1978 to 1992; the first collected edition was published by Doubleday in 1990. While seeking a book publisher, Gonick received early support from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who worked as an editor at Doubleday and championed The Cartoon History of the Universe's publication by the company. == Illustration style == The Cartoon History is illustrated in a black-and-white cartoon style. Gonick occasionally uses crosshatching and other realistic drawing techniques, but he primarily draws with a lively brush-and-ink squiggle that resembles Bill Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes, Walt Kelly's Pogo, and Ren√© Goscinny and Albert Uderzo's Ast√©rix. Occasionally, as in the sequences on India in the second book, he mimics Gilbert Shelton's style from The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. His tribute to Asterix is explicit. When Gauls are depicted, not only do they often resemble Goscinny and Uderzo's characters Asterix and Obelix, but when Gonick treats the Gallic invasion of Italy (390 ‚Äì 387 BCE), the characters, along with Vitalstatistix, appear unmistakably (Vitalstatistix is transported on a shield, Asterix pummels a Roman soldier, etc.); and as they trudge off into the sunset, the speech balloon reads \\"Come on, Asterix! Let's get our own comic book.\\"The Cartoon History of the Universe II, Pages 172‚Äì3 == Narrative framework == Each volume or chapter begins with a one- or two-panel introduction. An Einstein-like Professor (representing Gonick's authorial voice) prepares to travel in his time machine to whatever place or era the chapter is about. The Professor reads a passage from a historical book, which activates the \\"time machine,\\" a literary device. For example, the Professor reads a book about dinosaurs to introduce Volume 1 about prehistory. He reads from Hans Zinsser's Rats, Lice and History before Volume 19 about the Black Death. This introduction provides a bridge to the action, the main narrative of each chapter. == Narrative style and tone  Point of view === Any history book has a point of view, and Larry Gonick's might best be described as \\"humanist.\\" However, it is not written in the style of a didactic textbook. Instead, Gonick fleshes out history into a long yarn, injecting characterization into historical personages, continually reporting gory anecdotes, and focusing on quirky details‚Äîall backed up by research‚Äîto enliven his subject. He reports both the greatness of human achievement and acknowledges humanity's savagery. Excerpt from The Cartoon History of the Universe II. Note the antic characterization of Alexander the Great and Gonick's use of black ink. In addition to being a straight (though unusual) history, The Cartoon History helps readers understand historical cause and effect‚Äîhow the past relates to the present. It explains the motivations behind human beings' discoveries, inventions, explorations, wars, triumphs, and mistakes. Gonick's editorial aim seeks to do justice to every point of view. === Humor === Gonick consistently uses elements of satire to find the most humor in every situation. For example, one cartoon panel depicts the barbarism of a group of Huns who had elephants herded off a cliff for their sadistic enjoyment. One Hun exclaims with an oafish grin, \\"My emotions are valid!\\"‚Äîjuxtaposing the Hun's brutal barbarism with an anachronistic, post- modern view of his own cruelty [3]. Also noteworthy is Gonick's use of caricature. For example, he depicts the weaselly Robert Guiscard, the 11th- century Norman adventurer, as an anthropomorphic weasel, an allusion to Guiscard's name and cunning nature, and depicts Babur, the 16th-century founder of the Mughal Empire with buckteeth (an allusion to the theory that the conqueror's name means \\"beaver\\"). == Unorthodox citations == Consistently enthusiastic in tone, Gonick uses each collection's bibliography to promote historical literacy. At the end of each published collection, Gonick thoroughly cites his sources. But rather than relying upon an ordinary, typeset bibliography, Gonick sustains his unorthodox style and exuberant tone as the Professor takes the reader through a cartoon tour of his sources. Because much of The Cartoon History covers evolutionary science, physics, astronomy, and ancient history, Gonick has referenced original writings on these subjects, rather than relying on secondary sources or anthologies. Some of these primary sources are national epics, cultural writings, or holy scriptures, such as Homer's Iliad, the Rig Veda of India, and the Bible. In this way he prompts his readers also to read the primary sources. == Antecedents == Gonick's work is not the first comic history in English: an early series of comic histories was published in Victorian England: Comic History of England (1847‚Äì48) and Comic History of Rome (1852), by author Gilbert Abbott √† Beckett, illustrator John Leech. ==The series== Beginning with its original comic book Volume 1 in 1977, the complete series covers world history through 2008. # # # # # == References == == External links == * Category:1978 comics debuts Category:Historical comics Category:Comics about time travel Category:Educational comics Category:Humor comics Category:1990 books Category:20th-century history books Category:Universal history books Category:American comics titles Category:Series of books Category:Books about civilizations Category:Non-fiction comics Category:Harvey Award winners for Best Graphic Album of Original Work ","title":"The Cartoon History of the Universe"},{"id":"833957","text":"ELN may refer to: == Paramilitary == * National Liberation Army (Colombia) (Spanish: ), involved in the continuing Colombian armed conflict * √ëancahuaz√∫ Guerrilla, a guerilla group active in the Cordillera Province, Bolivia from 1966 to 1967 * National Liberation Army (Peru) (Spanish: ), a guerilla group active in 1965 ==Science== * ELN (gene), coding for Elastin * Electronic lab notebook ==Other uses== * Bowers Airport, serving Ellensburg, Washington, United States * √âlan, an Irish pharmaceutical company * Equity-linked note, a financial instrument * European Leadership Network, a European think-tank * Emerging Leaders Network, a program of Toronto-based CivicAction ","title":"ELN"},{"id":"833962","text":"Charlie Dunbar Broad (30 December 1887 ‚Äì 11 March 1971), usually cited as C. D. Broad, was an English epistemologist, historian of philosophy, philosopher of science, moral philosopher, and writer on the philosophical aspects of psychical research. He was known for his thorough and dispassionate examinations of arguments in such works as Scientific Thought (1923), The Mind and Its Place in Nature (1925), and Examination of McTaggart's Philosophy (2 vols., 1933‚Äì1938). Broad's essay on \\"Determinism, Indeterminism, and Libertarianism\\" in Ethics and the History of Philosophy (1952) introduced the philosophical terms occurrent causation and non-occurrent causation, which became the basis for the contemporary distinction between \\"agent-causal\\" and \\"event-causal\\" in debates on libertarian free will. == Biography == Broad was born in Harlesden, in Middlesex, England.Harlesden was part of Middlesex until 1965; today it is part of the London Borough of Brent in Greater London. He was educated at Dulwich College from 1900 until 1906. He gained a scholarship in 1906 to study at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1910 with First- Class Honours, with distinction.Hodges, S. 1981. God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College. London: Heinemann. p. 87. He became a Fellow of Trinity College the following year. === Career === As his fellowship at Trinity College was a non-residential position, he was also able to accept a position as an assistant lecturer that he had applied for at St. Andrews University, where he remained until 1920. That year, he was appointed professor at Bristol University, working there until 1923, when he returned to Trinity as a lecturer. From 1926 until 1931, he was a lecturer in 'moral science' at Cambridge University's Faculty of Philosophy. Later at Cambridge, he was appointed in 1931 as 'Sidgwick Lecturer', a role he would keep until 1933, when he was appointed Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University, a position he held for twenty years (until 1953). In addition, Broad was President of the Aristotelian Society from 1927 to 1928, and again from 1954 to 1955. He was also President of the Society for Psychical Research in 1935 and 1958. === Personal life === Broad was openly homosexual at a time when homosexual acts were illegal. In March 1958, Broad along with fellow philosophers A.J. Ayer and Bertrand Russell, writer J.B. Priestley and 27 others sent a letter to The Times which urged the acceptance of the Wolfenden Report's recommendation that homosexual acts should \\"no longer be a criminal offence.\\"Annan, N.

Weatherhead, C. V. Wedgwood, Angus Wilson, John Wisdom, and Barbara Wootton. 7 March 1958. \\"Letter to the Editor.\\" The Times. == Theory  Psychical research === Broad argued that if research could demonstrate that psychic events occur, this would challenge philosophical theories of \\"basic limiting principles\\" in at least five ways: #Backward causation (i.e., the future affecting the past) is rejected by many philosophers, but would be shown to occur if, for example, people could predict the future. # One common argument against dualism (i.e., the belief that, while bodies are physical entities, minds are a different, non-physical sort of entity) is that physical and non-physical things cannot interact. However, this would be shown to be possible if people can move physical objects by thought (telekinesis). # Similarly, philosophers tend to be skeptical about claims that non-physical 'stuff' could interact with anything. This would also be challenged if minds are shown to be able to communicate with each other, as would be the case if mind-reading is possible. # Philosophers generally accept that we can only learn about the world through reason and perception. This belief would be challenged if people were able to psychically perceive events in other places. #Physicalist philosophers believe that there cannot be persons without bodies. If ghosts were shown to exist, this view would be challenged. === Free will === In his essay \\"Determinism, Indeterminism, and Libertarianism\\", Broad argued for non-occurrent causation as \\"literally determined by the agent or self.\\" The agent could be considered as a substance or continuant, and not by a total cause which contains as factors events in and dispositions of the agent. Thus, our efforts would be completely determined, but their causes would not be prior events. New series of events would then originate, which he called \\"continuants,\\" which are essentially causa sui. Peter van Inwagen says that Broad formulated an excellent version of what van Inwagen has called the \\"Consequence Argument\\" in defence of incompatibilism. == Works == * 1914.

The purpose of the National Galleries of Scotland (NGS) was set out by an Act of Parliament in the National Heritage (Scotland) Act 1985. Its role is to care for, preserve and add to the objects in its collections, exhibit artworks to the public and to promote education and public enjoyment and understanding of the Fine Arts. It is governed by a Board of Trustees who are appointed by ministers of the Scottish Government. ==History== The National Gallery of Scotland (now called the Scottish National Gallery) was opened to the public in 1859. Located on The Mound in the centre of Scotland's capital city, Edinburgh, the building was originally shared between the National Gallery and the collection of the Royal Scottish Academy (RSA). The gallery was a success, and in response to increasing public demand for the celebration of Scottish history and culture, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery (SNPG) was opened in 1889 to display portraits of noted Scots. The National Gallery collection was nevertheless constrained by lack of space in the premises on The Mound, and in 1906 the National Galleries of Scotland Act granted to the RSA perpetual tenancy of the Royal Institution building in front of the National Gallery, allowing the National Galleries collection to take over the entire National Gallery of Scotland building. Since then, the Royal Institution building became known as the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1959, National Galleries of Scotland expanded further with the establishment of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art (SNGMA), housed in Inverleith House in the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Twentieth-century artworks in the National Galleries collection were relocated to the new gallery, and the gallery began to acquire many more objects after 1960. By 1984, the modern art gallery had outgrown its first home, and the SNGMA relocated to the vacant John Watson's Institution building, a former school. In 1999, the SNGMA expanded with the opening of The Dean Gallery (now called Modern Two) in a former orphanage opposite the Gallery of Modern Art. In 2012, National Galleries of Scotland underwent a rebranding exercise, and the National Gallery of Scotland building on The Mound was renamed the Scottish National Gallery to distinguish it from the organistation that manages it. ==List of national galleries== * The Scottish National Gallery * The Scottish National Portrait Gallery * The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art Map of the three National Galleries of Scotland premises in Edinburgh The Partner Galleries are: * Duff House in Banff, Aberdeenshire * Paxton House, Berwickshire ==See also== *Board of Manufactures *The Playfair Project * Scottish Publishers Association ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Art museums and galleries in Edinburgh Category:Scottish Government Learning and Justice Directorate Category:Book publishing companies of Scotland Category:Charities based in Edinburgh ","title":"National Galleries of Scotland"},{"id":"834007","text":"Sir Eduardo Luigi Paolozzi (, ; 7 March 1924 ‚Äì 22 April 2005) was a Scottish sculptor and artist. He is widely considered to be one of the pioneers of pop art. ==Early years== Paolozzi's 283x283px Eduardo Paolozzi was born on 7 March 1924, in Leith in north Edinburgh, Scotland, and was the eldest son of Italian immigrants. In June 1940, when Italy declared war on the United Kingdom, Paolozzi was interned (along with most other Italian men in Britain). During his three-month internment at Saughton prison his father, grandfather and uncle, who had also been detained, were among the 446 Italians who drowned when the ship carrying them to Canada, the Arandora Star, was sunk by a German U-boat.\\"NAS gets behind bars\\", The National Archives of Scotland. Paolozzi studied at the Edinburgh College of Art in 1943, briefly at Saint Martin's School of Art in 1944, and then at the Slade School of Fine Art at University College London from 1944 to 1947, after which he worked in Paris. While in Paris from 1947 to 1949, Paolozzi became acquainted with Alberto Giacometti, Jean Arp, Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, Georges Braque and Fernand L√©ger. This period became an important influence for his later work.‚Ä≥Paolozzi Arches Noah‚Ä≥, Exhibit Catalog, M√ºnchner Stadtmuseum, 1990. For example, the influence of Giacometti and many of the original Surrealists he met in Paris can be felt in the group of lost-wax sculptures made by Paolozzi in the mid-1950s. Their surfaces, studded with found objects and machine parts, were to gain him recognition. ==Career== After Paris, he moved back to London eventually establishing his studio in Chelsea. The studio was a workshop filled with hundreds of found objects, models, sculptures, materials, tools, toys and stacks of books.\\"Paolozzi Studio\\" , National Galleries of Scotland. Paolozzi was interested in everything and would use a variety of objects and materials in his work, particularly his collages.‚Ä≥Mythologies‚Ä≥, Exhibit Catalog, The Scottish Gallery, 2‚Äì26 May 1990. In 1955 he moved with his family to the village of Thorpe-le-Soken in Essex. Together with Nigel Henderson he established Hammer Prints Limited, a design company producing wallpapers, textiles and ceramics that were initially manufactured at Landermere Wharf, and when his evening course in printed textile design at the Central School of Art and Design attracted the Trinidadian graphics student Althea McNish, he was instrumental in pointing her towards her future career as a textile designer. Paolozzi came to public attention in the 1950s by producing a range of striking screenprints and Art brut sculpture. He was a founder of the Independent Group in 1952, which is regarded as the precursor to the mid-1950s British and late 1950s American Pop Art movements. His seminal 1947 collage I was a Rich Man's Plaything is considered the earliest standard bearer representing Pop Art.Livingstone, M. (1990), Pop Art: A Continuing History, New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc.\\"Eduardo Paolozzi\\", Exhibit Catalog, Hefte der Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste, 1977. He always described his work as surrealist art and, while working in a wide range of media though his career, became more closely associated with sculpture. Paolozzi is recognized for producing largely lifelike statuary works, but with rectilinear (often cubic) elements added or removed, or the human form deconstructed in a cubist manner. Pimlico station of the London Underground system He taught sculpture and ceramics at several institutions, including the Hochschule f√ºr bildende K√ºnste Hamburg (1960‚Äì62),Where he taught the 'fifth Beatle' Stuart Sutcliffe. University of California, Berkeley (in 1968) and at the Royal College of Art. Paolozzi had a long association with Germany, having worked in Berlin from 1974 as part of the Berlin Artist Programme of the German Academic Exchange Programme. He was a professor at the Fachhochschule in Cologne from 1977 to 1981, and later taught sculpture at the Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste in Munich. Paolozzi was fond of Munich and many of his works and concept plans were developed in a studio he kept there, including the mosaics of the Tottenham Court Road Station in London. He took a stab at industrial design in the 1970s with a 500-piece run of the upscale Suomi tableware by Timo Sarpaneva that Paolozzi decorated for the German Rosenthal porcelain maker's Studio Linie. Paolozzi's graphic work of the 1960s was highly innovative. In a series of works he explored and extended the possibilities and limits of the silkscreen medium. The resulting prints are characterised by Pop culture references and technological imagery. These series are: As Is When (12 prints on the theme of Paolozzi's interest in the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein; published as a limited edition of 65 by Editions Alecto, 1965); Moonstrips Empire News (100 prints, eight signed, in an acrylic box; published as a limited edition of 500 by Editions Alecto, 1967); Universal Electronic Vacuu (10 prints, poster and text; published by Paolozzi as a limited edition of 75, 1967); General Dynamic Fun. (part 2 of Moonstrips Empire News; 50 sheets plus title sheet; boxed in five versions; published as a limited edition of 350 by Editions Alecto, 1970). In the 1960s and 1970s, Paolozzi artistically processed man-machine images from popular science books by German doctor and author Fritz Kahn (1888‚Äì1968), such as in his screenprint \\"Wittgenstein in New York\\" (1965), the print series Secrets of Life ‚Äì The Human Machine and How it Works (1970), or the cover design for John Barth's novel Lost in the Funhouse (Penguin, 1972). As recently as 2009, the reference to Kahn was discovered by Uta and Thilo von Debschitz during their research of work and life of Fritz Kahn. ==Later career== Paolozzi mosaic designs for Tottenham Court Road Station. Location shown is the Central Line westbound platform (1982). Paolozzi was appointed CBE in 1968 and in 1979 he was elected to the Royal Academy. During the late 1960s, he started contributing to literary magazine Ambit, which began a lifelong collaboration. In 1980, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) commissioned a set of three tapestries from Paolozzi to represent 'present day and future societies in relation to the role played by ICAEW', as part of the institute's centenary celebrations. The three highly distinctive pieces - which Paolozzi wanted to \\"depict our world of today in a manner using the same bold pictorial style as the Bayeux tapestries in France\\" - currently hang in Chartered Accountants' Hall. He was promoted to the office of Her Majesty's Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland in 1986, which he held until his death. He also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1987. Paolozzi was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1989 as Knight Bachelor (). In 1994, Paolozzi gave the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art a large body of his works, and much of the content of his studio. In 1999 the National Galleries of Scotland opened the Dean Gallery to display this collection. The gallery displays a recreation of Paolozzi's studio, with its contents evoking the original London and Munich locations and also houses Scottish-Italian a restaurant, Paolozzi's Kitchen, which was created by Heritage Portfolio in homage to the local artist. In 2001, Paolozzi suffered a near-fatal stroke, causing an incorrect magazine report that he had died. The illness made him a wheelchair user, and he died in a hospital in London in April 2005. In 2013, Pallant House Gallery in Chichester held a major retrospective Eduardo Paolozzi: Collaging Culture (6 July ‚àí13 October 2013), featuring more than 100 of the artist's works, including sculpture, drawings, textile, film, ceramics and paper collage. Pallant House Gallery has an extensive collection of Paolozzi's work given and loaned by the architect Colin St John Wilson, who commissioned Paolozzi's sculpture Newton After Blake for the British Library. ==Notable works== * The mosaic patterned walls of the Tottenham Court Road tube station.

The Counts of Albon (Comtes d'Albon) were members of the medieval nobility in what is now south-eastern France. Guigues IV, Count of Albon (d. 1142) was nicknamed le Dauphin or the Dolphin. His nickname morphed into a title among his successors. By 1293, the lands ruled by the Counts Albon, the old comitatus Albionis, were known as the Dauphin√© of Viennois (Dalphinatus Viennensis).. The titles and lands had been part of the Holy Roman Empire since 1032. They passed to Philip VI of France in 1349 on condition that the heir apparent to the French crown always be titled Dauphin, and be personal holder of the lands and titles. By condition of the Emperor, the Dauphiny could never be united to France. When the King of France had no son, he would personally rule the Dauphiny separately, as Dauphin. Thus, the province technically remained in the Holy Roman Empire even after 1349, and it was administered separately from France well into the early modern period; it was incorporated into France only de facto with the rise of absolutism, in the 17th century. ==Lords of Ch√¢teau d'AlbonHouse of Albon=== * Guigues I of Albon the Old (c. 1000‚Äì1070), Count in Oisans, Gr√©sivaudan and Brian√ßonnais, Lord of Ch√¢teau d'Albon, ruled until 1070 * Guigues II of Albon the Fat (c. 1020‚Äì1079), Count in Gr√©sivaudan and Brian√ßonnais, Lord of Ch√¢teau d'Albon, ruled 1070‚Äì1079 ==Counts of AlbonHouse of Albon=== * Guigues III of Albon the Count (c. 1050‚Äì1133), first Count of Albon (the southern part of the ancient County of Vienne; the northern part was granted to the first Count of Savoy), ruled 1079‚Äì1133 * Guigues IV of Albon, le Dauphin (c. 1095‚Äì1142), Count of Albon, ruled 1133‚Äì1142 ==Counts of Albon and Dauphins of Viennois== * Robert V, Count of Auvergne married Marquise d'Albon, a daughter of Guigues IV.

The name is archaic, meaning \\"cradle of life\\". It consists of various continents and islands, including Faer√ªn, Kara-Tur, Zakhara, Maztica, Osse, Anchorome and Katashaka, a sub-Saharan-like continent south of Maztica, where humanity appeared. Toril was originally the name of Jeff Grubb's personal campaign world before it was merged with Ed Greenwood's Forgotten Realms setting. ==History== Toril was the name of Jeff Grubb's campaign world, and it was adopted as the name of the planet upon which the continent of Faer√ªn existed when he and Ed Greenwood were designing the original Forgotten Realms Boxed Set in 1987. Abeir- was added as a prefix to the planet's name so that it would be the first entry in the alphabetical encyclopedia of terms included in the set. The setting's entire planet underwent a major change during the 1989 Avatar trilogy, which detailed a series of events called the Time of Troubles, during which gods walked the earth and magic became unpredictable. These events caused permanent changes in gameplay that were outlined in the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition campaign setting books. In a significant retcon of the setting's history, Forgotten Realms material for the fourth edition of Dungeons & Dragons \\"reveals\\" that the world was split in two in prehistory, divided between the primordials (Abeir) and the gods (Toril). Toril is the world that has been showcased so far. A cataclysm called the Spellplague has caused several parts of the two worlds to switch places, displacing portions of Faer√ªn and the entire continent of Maztica with regions of Abeir: Tymanther, Akan√ªl, and Returned Abeir. A subsequent event called \\"The Sundering\\" reverted many of these changes and restored much of the pre-Spellplague Toril. ==ContinentsAnchorome=== Anchorome is almost unexplored and is at the North of Maztica. Its best-known inhabitants are the Azuposi, as well as the defunct Esh Alakarans and the xenophobic Poscadar elves. There is also a sahuagin realm called Itzcali located in the sea nearby. Long ago, Balduran, a sea captain who was the founder of Baldur's Gate, sailed to Anchorome and returned with a great wealth that was used to build the wall around the fledgling Baldur's Gate. It was revealed in the Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast expansion that Balduran returned to Anchorome and retrieved a second hoard of treasure from the Native kingdoms. Unfortunately, when he attempted to take on a number of locals to replenish his crew he discovered they were infected with lycanthropy. The resulting battle shipwrecked Balduran on an island, which was later discovered by a Merchant Guild from Baldur's Gate and subsequently by the player who is sent to confirm the finding, where both the original crews' and the natives from Anchorome's descendants were locked in a bloody lycanthrope feud. The fate of Balduran himself was never clearly revealed. After the discovery of Maztica by the mercenary captain Cordell, mercenaries from the Flaming Fist were sent to Anchorome. They built a keep, Fort Flame, in the shores of Balduran's bay (which is actually far below Balduran's resting place) but other than this it had been a complete disaster. It is speculated that it is the land where the Creator Race known as the Aearee retreated a long time ago. It is rumored that several tribes of thri-kreen make their home in Anchorome's western regions. ===Faer√ªn=Kara-Tur=Maztica=== Maztica, called by its inhabitants The True World, is a fictional continent that is a land of jungles and (to the Faer√ªnians) mystery. Early in its history it was a land fought over by the gods Qotal the Plumed Serpent and his brother Zaltec. For a crime against his sister, Qotal retreated from Maztica for an age but returned in recent times. It was 'discovered' by Amnian explorers led by one Captain-general Cordell and his Golden Legion in 1361 DR. Amn was quick to carve out its claim to the land for trade benefits, establishing the port city of Helmsport, and the church of Helm led the encroachment into the new land. The native peoples were devastated by foreign diseases and the ruthlessness of the invaders, and this, coupled with the difficulties encountered on Maztica backfiring against them, caused the church of Helm to come under heavy criticism. Lantan also claimed some lands. Maztica is divided into the nations of Nexal, Kultaka, Huacli, Kolan, Pezelac, and Payit. The region known as Far Payit neighbours Payit, both in the east around Helmsport. The native people of Maztica from Payit and Far Payit are known as Payits, whereas natives from the other nations are known as Mazticans. There are also the human races known as the Dog People and the Green Folk. Many monstrous races also live in Maztica, including wild halflings and Chacs‚Äîjaguar spirits. In very old times, Couatl came from Maztica to fight the Yuan-Ti of Chult. Some scorpionfolk from Maztica found an Underdark passage to the Underdark of Faer√ªn. North of Maztica is the continent of Anchorome. South of it (and separated by a strait) lies an unknown continent. Maztica was detailed for 2nd Edition Dungeons & Dragons in the Maztica Campaign Set by Douglas Niles, and in the Forgotten Realms novels of the Maztica Trilogy‚ÄîIronhelm, Viperhand and Feathered Dragon‚Äîalso by Douglas Niles. Maztica was also the name of the elder goddess who embodied the land of Maztica. Killed by her own son Zaltec, she was the wife of dead Kukul, but unlike her husband, continues to live on in the continued existence of the continent. In 4th edition, the Spellplague caused by Mystra's death caused Abeir and Toril to briefly merge and then instantly rip apart again. As a result, Maztica is no longer a part of Toril, having been replaced with a continent called \\"Returned Abeir.\\" On some maps, it has been renamed Anchorome. ===Zakhara=== Zakhara is a fictional realm styled after the themes and setting depicted in the Arabian Nights. The land is the setting of the Al- Qadim campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop role-playing game. Zakhara is a giant peninsula of the same supercontinent that hosts Faer√ªn and Kara-Tur on the planet Abeir-Toril. Zakhara is located east of Faer√ªn, and the closest Faer√ªnian lands to Zakhara are Dambrath (by sea) and Ulgarth or arguably Konigheim (by land). Zakhara is mostly isolated from the rest of the world, as the peninsula is separated from the main mass by the World Pillar Mountains (also known as Wu Pi Te Shao in Kara-Tur). The Zakharan pantheon consists of several cultures, like the culture of Enlightenment and more savage deities, such as Ragarra. Waters around Zakhara are bountiful with pirates and corsairs who charge traders tolls to cross \\"their\\" seas, such traders willingly pay these exorbitant fees as Zakhara's exotic trading goods tend to be well worth the price back in Faer√ªn. Occasionally the pirates decide to completely cut off Zakhara from Faer√ªn. The land is full of secretive cities, unwelcoming to travellers, huge deserts, lush oases and powerful genies who meddle in the affairs of humans frequently. The continent is ruled by a theocracy headed by the Grand Caliph, and tales tell of demon- infested cities and godless sorcerers (like the genie-binding Sha'irs) wielding strange magic. Powerful magic and great warriors of every like are to be found in Zakhara. Zakharans are firmly convinced they are more civilized than the rest of the world and treat \\"barbarians\\" accordingly. The capital city of Zakhara is Huzuz, the \\"City of Delights\\". ==Other featuresTears of Sel√ªne=== The Tears of Sel√ªne are a pack of asteroids trailing Abeir- Toril's moon, Sel√ªne. ===Wu Pi Te Shao=== Known as the World Pillar Mountains in Faer√ªn or Wu Pi Te Shao in Kara-Tur, the ‚ÄúRoof of the World‚Äù is the largest mountain range in the fictional fantasy world of Toril. It is inhabited by evil Yak-men and separates Zakhara from the rest of the supercontinent. ===Yal-Tengri=== Yal-Tengri (also known as The Great Ice Sea) is Toril's equivalent of the Arctic Ocean. It is barely known at all. In the ancient time, the major city on its shore was Winterkeep, it is now the trade city of Naupau, in Sossal. Far in the north of the sea is a small island dominated by a cathedral-like spire, inhabited by gnomes of Gond. The Yal-Tengri is free of ice for the six summer months of the year The Endless Ice Sea is the name of the western Faer√ªn part of it. Somewhere there is Jhoth√ªn, the long-forgotten capital of a mighty empire of Giants. ==References== ==External links== *Toril page on official Spelljammer website Category:Dungeons & Dragons locations Category:Fantasy worlds Category:Fictional planets ","title":"Abeir-Toril"},{"id":"834115","text":"Toril, meaning bullpen in Spanish, may refer to: ==Philippines== * Toril, a district of Davao City in the Philippines * Toril, a barangay in Samal, Davao del Norte, Philippines * Turil or Toril, a barangay or village in the municipality of Maribojoc, Bohol province in the Central Visayas region of the Philippines ==Spain== * Toril, C√°ceres, a municipality in Extremadura, Spain * Toril y Masegoso, a municipality in the province of Teruel, Aragon, Spain ==Other uses== * TorilMUD, a 1996 online game * Alberto Toril (born 1973), Spanish footballer and coach * Abeir-Toril, a fictional planet in the Dungeons & Dragons universe ==See also== *Torill, a Norwegian given name also written as Toril ","title":"Toril"},{"id":"834120","text":"New Work by La La La Human Steps in July 2011 in Vienna, Austria La La La Human Steps was a Qu√©b√©cois contemporary dance group in Canada, active between 1980 and 2015, known for its energetic, acrobatic style involving fast-paced and athletic physical contact.

The word is a portmanteau of zenshin taitsu (). Zentai is most commonly made using nylon/spandex blends. ==Use== The costumes are seen at major sporting events in North America and the United Kingdom. They created internationally recognized personalities out of The Green Men, two fans of the Vancouver Canucks NHL team. Various professional street dance/hip hop dance groups use the outfits, such as The Body Poets in the United States, and Remix Monkeys in the United Kingdom. Full-body suits are used for video special effects: the original colors offered enables the person wearing the chroma key suit to be lifted easily from a video image. Other applications have included music videos (Black Eyed Peas' song \\"Boom Boom Pow\\", including the live performance at the Super Bowl), breast cancer awareness, fashion modeling on an episode of America's Next Top Model, social anxiety workshops, television (Charlie Kelly as Green Man), a participant in public art project \\"One & Other\\", and social experiments.

The area of the municipality amounts to . The center of town is at above sea level, while its area is known as \\"lower Herzegovina\\". Almost the entire northern part of the municipality itself, however, belongs to \\"high Herzegovina\\", the highest point being the Bile stine (\\"White Rocks\\") near Donji Crnaƒç. === Climate === ≈†iroki Brijeg has mild submediterranean- mountain climate. Winters are chilly and often very cold. Summers are warm. === Terrain === The wider area of the municipality of ≈†iroki Brijeg is located on the characteristic, complex structural forms known as the \\"high karst zone\\" in geologic terms. The basic characteristic is the rocky limestone relief in various karst forms (sinks, caves, sinkholes, karst fields, etc.), as well as deeply cut valleys with occasional torrents flows. The ≈†iroki Brijeg area is located on the direction of tectonic units Rakitno-Hrgud and spreads over Rakitno, Vardi mountains, Mostarsko Blato, Rotimlje and Hrgud to Trebi≈°njica in the southeast. The area is made-up of up late Jurassic sediments, followed by Cretaceous and Paleogene age layers, then Neogene and Quaternary deposits. Highlights are early Cretaceous dun, well stratified limestone and dolomites. Late Cretaceous deposits, cenoman-turon, are represented by white and pink, massive limestone with the shoot. In Paleogenic layers function Liburnijska and alveolinic-nummulitic limestones, then eocenic flysch, which is represented by marl, sandstone, calcarenite and conglomerates. Neogenic layers are built of marl, sandy clay, sandstone and conglomerates, and can be found in the vicinity of Grabovo Drage and Mostarsko Blato. Quaternary banks of pebbles, sand and water karst saturated found on almost all rocky fields and drifts along the river beds. Between the lower mountain Vardi, Gvozd, Rujan and Trtle (altitude 600-900m) is a karstic depression Koƒçerinsko, Trnsko, Mokarsko and Ru≈æevo field and Mostar Blato (altitude of 220-300m). ≈†iroki Brijeg area belongs to typical bauxite courts Lokve Black - Kidaƒçke Njive, Resnica - deposit and Uzariƒái - Kne≈°polje. This area was devastated shoot landfills and tailings, and rehabilitation requirements. === Waters === The water from the municipality of ≈†iroki Brijeg belong to the basin of the Neretva river. The main surface currents towards Mostar Blato the ticket with Ugrovaƒça, Moka≈°nica, Crna≈°nica and ≈Ωvatiƒá. The river belongs Li≈°tica of surface waters ƒåabulje, who bujiƒçni aquifer Brinje collected from Ladin and Dobrinja. Brinje whose rudiments north of Bogodola, below kote Kulic (1199) runs to the west and on their way to Li≈°tica receives at Prskalo stream Ladin, and 2.5 kilometers below, the stream of water Dobrinski. These streams buy all surface waters during the period of abundant precipitation and dissolution of snow on the south-western parts of the mountain ƒåabulje. Surface waters come to Rakitno field are being dried by water points, Jelica, Zmijinac and during major precipitation formed a periodic watercourse Ugrovaƒça that going deeply carved canyon Brin, receiving side stream, and in the village of Trn, Koƒçerin water fields, and on the road to Blato Mostarskog, in Siroki Brijeg center connects with the river Li≈°tica. == History  Ancient period === The ruins from the Illyrian period confirm that the area of ≈†iroki Brijeg had a large population in pre-historic times. The evidence can be seen on the hill Gradina on the frontier of Mokro and ƒåerigaj. There is also evidence on the walls of the forts where they had been in past. During the ancient period there was plenty of life in that region. From the Roman period there are remains of a fort (refugium) in the village of Biograci and a basilica in Mokro; there are remain of the forts and roads there. === Middle ages === Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos mentions that Mokriskik was in that area . The basilica in Mokri was built and destroyed several times in the Middle Ages and it was used for its purpose. In her neighbourhood is nekrepola with steƒáak,which are present elsewhere. There number and size indicate that this region was (from 12th till 15th century) has been very populated and rich. From that period on Koƒçerin was kept the longest tablet on steƒáak written with Bosnian Cyrillic, known as Koƒçerinska ploƒça (‚ÄûKoƒçerin tablet\\"). The residues of middle-age fort can be found in the Bork, close to the source of river Li≈°tica. === Ottoman rule === After the Turkish conquest in the middle of 15th century the population was mainly rural and in the mountains. Until the middle of 19th century, Herzegovina was cut off from social, cultural and political events in other European countries. === Austria-Hungary = World War II and Yugoslavia === Italian fort above ≈†iroki Brijeg During the Second World War the Usta≈°e held the city together with Italian troops. During their presence, the Italians built several forts for observation of the city. Like some cities in West Herzegovina, ≈†iroki Brijeg was labeled as a pro-Usta≈°e and a pro-fascisct region. It was therefore demonized by the officials of Yugoslavia and was renamed Li≈°tica (by the name of the river) instead of ≈†iroki Brijeg (Wide Hill). Investment in the city was also very poor. A number of people emigrated to Zagreb and Dalmatia, as well as to Germany as gastarbeiters. In 1985, the local Communist Party built a monument to the Yugoslav Partisans in the centre of the town with Partisans ostensibly reburied beneath it. On 3 May 2013 the monument was removed to explore the mass grave, revealing the remains of 95 people. The remains were characteristic of those killed by the Partisans themselves, with bodies being tied up with wire and some German dog tags being recovered. == Settlements == == Economy  Agriculture === Agricultural production in the municipality of ≈†iroki Brijeg is mostly reduced to the production for their own use on yards and a minor part of the arable land. It is the production of agricultural products for the market is very small compared to the alternatives, and refers primarily to the production of wine, a little bit in the production of vegetables and flowers, very little in the livestock and milk production. This resulted in a large percentage of agricultural land is not used- according to latest statistics - even 60% that could be used for agricultural land is not processed. The lack of clear government strategy and orientation towards the launching and development of agricultural production is also very important feature of the present situation in agriculture .  Prior to the war  Unlike twenty years ago, is now in agricultural production there is no fundamental cultural production, production that would be meaningful and possible in a larger area of the municipality. For many years it was tobacco. Together with the war has fallen down and the existing state system and thus the former system of organization of agricultural production. In the entire period since then until today, the new system was established. It is the whole country, especially the area where the municipality brought nekontroliranom import all kinds of things. So the majority of agricultural products has become cheaper to import than produce. The result has already been mentioned drastically reducing obraƒëivanih area, reducing the number of cattle and even up to five times, the entire reduction in volume of agricultural production. Finally it came to life the feeling that it is impossible to engage in agricultural production as the production activity of which can be live or something and make money.  After the war  The municipality's overall economic performance is stronger than that of the surrounding municipalities - primarily in the Entrepreneurial Sector, and the time orientation and working-age population by non-sector higher. Therefore, the percentage of uncultivated land is the largest in the municipality in comparison to the surrounding ones- 60% (Posu≈°je 59%, 49% Ljubu≈°ki and Grude 47%). The number of residents who are engaged solely in agriculture is relatively smallest in Siroki Brijeg. ==Industry== In the area of industrial production in the municipality are significantly represented meat industry and metal industry, and to a smaller production of footwear, manufacture of construction products and stone processing, production of insulation materials, graphic activity, etc. Official statistics, which regularly publishes the Federal Bureau of Statistics tracked the movement of industrial production at the level of the Federation and cantons, so that these (official) data for the municipality does not have. However, the basic features of industrial production in this region in the West would be essentially similar and reflect the movement of industrial production for the municipality of Siroki Brijeg. In the period 2004/2005 the recorded slight growth of the index of industrial production (101.3). When the production of metals and production of metal products recorded a significant growth (index 2005./2004. = 134.3 and 180.4), production of paper products (index = 110.7), while other areas of industrial production recorded a significant decrease ( such as food and beverages: Index = 80.0, mining: index = 71.4). For further growth of industrial production are essential investments in the development of existing industrial capacity in the areas that are currently represented in the municipality and which employ a large number of workers.

It was founded and dedicated by Paramahansa Yogananda, on August 20, 1950 and is owned by the Self-Realization Fellowship. The site has lush gardens, a large spring-fed lake framed by natural hillsides, and a variety of flora and fauna, swans, ducks, koi, turtles, and lotus flowers. The property is a natural amphitheater. Thousands of visitors come each year. == COVID-19 pandemic == Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, Lake Shrine is open to visitors by advanced reservation only. The Lake Shrine website has the latest information. ==Overview== The visitor center (left) and windmill chapel (right) are beside the lake The visitor center provides information about Lake Shrine. There are waterfalls, fountains, flower beds, statues, white swans across the lake, lacy fern grottos, lily ponds, and a Dutch windmill which is used as a chapel. The Court of Religions, honoring five principal religions of the world, displays the symbols of these religions: a cross for Christianity, a Star of David for Judaism, a Wheel of Law for Buddhism, a crescent moon and star for Islam, and the Om symbol for Hinduism. Yogananda believed in an underlying harmony of all faiths that unites us all. Along with a few statues of Krishna and other Hindu deities, there is also a life-size statue of Jesus Christ, above the waterfall, as well as Francis of Assisi and the Madonna and Child. The golden lotus archway, a towering, sleek, white arch trimmed with blue tile, and topped with gold lotus blossoms, is visible from all parts of the grounds. The archway frames the Mahatma Gandhi World Peace Memorial, an outdoor shrine where an authentic 1,000-year-old Chinese stone sarcophagus holds a portion of the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi. The gardens are filled with little brick paths and short stairways which lead from the main trail to hidden alcoves where meditation or sitting and taking in the view is possible. The gift shop features arts and crafts from India which is adjacent to a museum focusing on Paramahansa Yogananda, the founder of Lake Shrine. There is a Dutch windmill converted into a chapel, a houseboat, a bookstore and a temple overlooking the lake. ==History== The site of the present day Lake Shrine was once part of a 460-acre parcel of land in the Santa Ynez Canyon, called Bison Ranch. It was purchased by the silent film producer and director Thomas H. Ince in 1912 to serve as his studio and was subsequently named Inceville. After Ince founded his new Triangle/Ince Studios in Culver City in 1915, the site was taken over by director William S. Hart and eventually renamed Hartville. The land was later purchased by Los Angeles real-estate magnate Alphonso Bell, Sr. In 1927, the surrounding hillsides were hydraulically graded to fill the canyon with the intention to level it for future development. The earth-moving project was never completed, which left a large basin in the portion of canyon that eventually filled with water from the numerous springs within the vicinity. The water body became known as Lake Santa Ynez; the only natural spring-fed lake within the City of Los Angeles. The lake was owned by the superintendent of construction for 20th Century Fox during the 1940s when it was again used as a film set, where a two-story Mississippi houseboat was imported and a replica of a Dutch windmill was constructed. The property was subsequently sold to an oil executive who had the intention of developing the lake into a resort until he purportedly began to have a recurring dream where the site was converted into a \\"Church of All Religions\\". When he looked up this name in the telephone directory, he came into contact with Paramahansa Yogananda who eventually accepted the property and hence constructed a temple, meditation garden, and the Mahatma Gandhi peace memorial. ==FeaturesGandhi shrine=== Sarcophagus of the Mahatma Gandhi World Peace Memorial The Lake Shrine is home for the Mahatma Gandhi World Peace Memorial, the \\"wall-less temple\\" erected in honor of Mahatma Gandhi, architect of India's freedom through nonviolent means. The focal point of the memorial is a thousand-year- old stone sarcophagus from China, in which a portion of Gandhi's ashes are encased in a brass and silver coffer. The sarcophagus is flanked by two statues of Guanyin. The ashes had been sent to Yogananda by an old friend, Dr. V.M. Nawle, a publisher and journalist from Pune, India. Following the dedication of the memorial, Dr. Nawle wrote: For some, enshrining Gandhi's ashes at Lake Shrine is controversial since the Hindu cremation ritual ends with immersion of the ashes in water. One report states that Gandhi's relatives want the ashes at Lake Shrine to be immersed in water.\\"US ashram hesitant to part with Gandhi ashes\\" Philippine Times Another report states that the descendants of Mahatma Gandhi do not want to have the ashes removed because it would entail breaking the shrines.\\"Gandhi's ashes to rest at sea, not in a museum\\" The Guardian. ===Windmill chapel=== Looking toward the Dutch windmill from houseboat The previous owners, the McElroys, built an authentic reproduction of a 16th-century Dutch windmill. Though the mill was never put to use, its sails are functional and capable of turning in the wind. Then came a boat dock and landing, whose peaked roof, carved figure-heads, and benches added yet another charming touch to the unusual setting. Yogananda converted the windmill into a chapel were meditations and services were held. Due to the erosion caused by the elements, termites, and the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the chapel was closed to the public in 2013. Cost overruns delayed the completion of the Windmill Chapel for another year. The reopening of the chapel took place on July 27, 2015. ===Lake, waterfalls and animal life=== Two waterfalls feed into the Lake Shrine, one that falls approximately , and another series-waterfall, that falls approximately . Yogananda (Paramahansa means supreme or highest swan) encouraged swans to live on the Lake Shrine. Their large nests can be seen in this locale. Anandamoy said in the recording, Is Peace Possible in Today's World that when he was a minister at the Lake Shrine, they had three pairs of swans: one white, one black, and one white with a black necks. The lake was big enough for everybody but the swans fought, fighting for the kill. They had to be separated, by dividing the lake into three sections. Anandamoy continues saying that swans are like people and as long as one party wants the \\"whole cake\\" there will be war. If people follow the laws of God, overcome selfishness and consider the welfare of everyone, we will have peace eventually. ==In popular culture== Elvis Presley loved the shrine. According to his friend, Jerry Schilling, he walked around the lake and picked up some brochures, and later sent away for information about Eastern philosophy. Elvis developed a 12-year relationship with Sri Daya Mata, the woman who was then the president of the Self-Realization Fellowship, and would often call her for advice when he was troubled. A peaceful romantic view of Lake Shrine George Harrison's funeral was held at the Lake Shrine. Anne-Marie O'Connor of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"After the death of George Harrison, one of the most high-profile members of the Self-Realization Fellowship, his family and friends gathered at the Lake Shrine's small Windmill Chapel for his funeral. Ravi Shankar was there with his wife.\\"Los Angeles Times The memorial service for Lux Interior, lead singer of the Cramps, was held on February 21, 2009 at the Windmill Chapel. Dennis Weaver was a member of the Self-Realization Fellowship and spoke once a month at the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine for seventeen years, while Gerry, his wife, played the organ. He said, \\"We called it our 'mom and pop' church and it was one of my great blessings. It was life-changing.\\" The actress Linda Evans was invited by Dennis Weaver, when she was doing a guest appearance on McCloud, to the SRF Lake Shrine, to hear one of his monthly Sunday sermons. Weaver gave her the Autobiography of a Yogi, saying that it changed his life. Linda wrote, \\"Because of Dennis I took the first in what would become a lifelong spiritual journey. After years studying the Self-Realization Fellowship at Malibu, I went on to learn from books and other teachers\\". Tom Petty's funeral was held at the Lake Shrine in October 2017. Jazz singer and actor Herb Jeffries's memorial service was held at the Lake Shrine on July 12, 2014. Paramahansa Yogananda was Jeffries' guru.Jeffries was internationally known for performing with Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and Earl \\"Fatha\\" Hines. He was also recognized as \\"The Bronze Buckaroo\\", the first African- American to take a lead role in westerns. == References == ==External links== * Official website * Self-Realization Fellowship's information on the Lake Shrine * Videos Category:1950 establishments in California Category:Buildings and structures in Los Angeles Category:Gardens in California Category:Landmarks in Los Angeles Category:Memorials to Mahatma Gandhi Category:Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles Category:Religious buildings and structures in Los Angeles Category:Parks in Los Angeles Category:Paramahansa Yogananda Category:Religion in Los Angeles Category:Religious organizations established in 1950 Category:Sunset Boulevard (Los Angeles) Category:Tourist attractions in Los Angeles ","title":"Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine"},{"id":"834195","text":"The title of Duke of Saint-Cloud was created in 1674. The intention behind the creation was to provide a noble title to be held by the Archbishop of Paris for the time being. The Bishop of Paris had only received the title Archbishop in relatively recent times, on October 20, 1622, so as to recognize the emergence of Paris as the royal capital. It was common enough in France for a number of bishoprics to be joined automatically to a noble title. There were, for example, the Bishop-Count of Beauvais, the Bishop-Count of Ch√¢lons and the Bishop-Count of Noyon. In this way, the incumbents of three ancient bishoprics in the kingdom had along with the title of the ecclesiastical see also the secular noble title of Duke and peer of France, the latter being a particularly high distinction for a restricted circle of the nobility. The three cases prior to 1674 were the Archbishop of Rheims and the Bishops of Laon and Langres. To these was added, then, the case of the archbishopric of Paris. In the existing cases, the title of the dukedom was the same as the bishopric. Presumably in the case of Paris, it seemed inappropriate for the bishop of the royal capital be Duke of Paris and so the dukedom or duchy created was given an alternative name. So it was that in 1674 the domain and lordships of Saint-Cloud, Maisons-Alfort, Cr√©teil, Ozoir-la-Ferri√®re, and Armenti√®res-en-Brie were erected into a duchy of Saint-Cloud, although the title was not registered in the parlement until 1690. The first to bear the title was Fran√ßois de Harlay de Champvalon, who had been Archbishop since 1671. It was then held by his successors at Paris till the Revolution. These four dukedoms, not being hereditary, did not become extinct on the death of the holder, but were assumed by the legitimate successor to the bishopric. However, all four dukedoms or duchies, along with the entire Peerage of France, were abolished during the French Revolution, on August 4, 1789, the Night of the Abolition of Feudalism. ==Dukes of Saint-Cloud== *Fran√ßois de Harlay de Champvalon (1625-1695), 1st Duke of Saint-Cloud (1671-1695) *Louis- Antoine, Cardinal de Noailles (1651-1729), 2nd Duke of Saint-Cloud (1695-1729) *Charles-Gaspard-Guillaume de Vintimille du Luc (1655-1746), 3rd Duke of Saint-Cloud (1729-1746) *Jacques Bonne-Gigault de Bellefonds (1698-1746), 4th Duke of Saint-Cloud (1746) *Christophe de Beaumont du Repaire (1703-1781), 5th Duke of Saint-Cloud (1746-1781) *Antoine-El√©onore-L√©on Le Clerc de Juign√© (1728-1811), 6th Duke of Saint-Cloud (1781-1789) ==Sources== * H√©raldique europ√©enne: Duch√© de Saint-Cloud (European Heraldry: Duchy of Saint-Cloud, in French) Category:Dukes of Saint-Cloud Saint-Cloud ","title":"Duke of Saint-Cloud"},{"id":"834197","text":"Dead or Alive Ultimate is a compilation fighting game developed by Team Ninja and released by Tecmo for the Xbox in 2004. It is a collection of the two previous games in the series, 1996's Dead or Alive and 1999's Dead or Alive 2. It marks the only game in the series to date to be a compilation. DOA Ultimate contains a high-resolution edition of the Sega Saturn version of Dead or Alive, and an enhanced remake of DOA2 which utilized the Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball graphics engine and offered Dead or Alive 3 game mechanics, new game content, online multiplayer capabilities, and the inclusion of Hitomi as a playable character. ==Gameplay== Dead or Alive Ultimate is a compilation game that includes a remade version of Dead or Alive 2, with re-developed graphics and new stages for the Xbox gaming system. It also includes the original Sega Saturn version of the first Dead or Alive, with smoothed graphics, but lacks the additional content received in the later-released North American PlayStation version (no Bass or Ayane characters or extra costumes). Both editions include online play. Dead or Alive Ultimate 1 is essentially identical to its original Sega Saturn version, and is generally considered more of a collector's disc than for its content. Dead or Alive Ultimate 2, being a remake created after the debut of Dead or Alive 3, takes elements and mechanics from both its original iteration and successor. The action of 3D-axis movement is as free-formatted as DOA3, and Hitomi is now a playable character albeit outside story mode. Other elements have been kept intact from DOA2. These include higher damaging counters than in DOA3, environmental hazards not warranting a knockout on a character, and a counter mechanism that is much harder to execute. Despite being able to freely move on a 3D axis in the Ultimate version of DOA2 however, most moves cannot be sidestepped as in other 3D fighters, as well as in DOA3. Another major change is in the revamped holding system in DOA2. The final major set of changes instituted in Ultimate is the inclusion of slopes, which are a type of environmental hazard where those knocked down them roll down the slope, taking damage as they fall. The game requires Xbox Live in order to play online. The service's support makes it the second online console 3D fighting game to be released in America and Europe (Mortal Kombat: Deception having been the first) and the first online console 3D fighting game in Japan. The system set forth by Tecmo for online play in Dead or Alive Ultimate was intended to recreate the feel of playing at an arcade. Players would log onto a shared \\"lobby\\" and then observe other matches until it was their turn to participate. Each lobby has a set of gameplay parameters that is determined by its creator, allowing for tournament-style play. While this game brings back the old mechanics of the Dreamcast version of Dead or Alive 2, some changes to the music and remixes were added. Each character except Hitomi (which was introduced in DOA3) has their own remix. The remixes only appear in the Dance Floor stage, The Ray House. ==Plot== The story mode of Dead or Alive Ultimate plays out as it did in the original. However, a new CG sequence is added further explaining the relationship and history of Ayane, Kasumi and Hayate leading into the first two Dead or Alive games. ==Development and release== In 2004, after the release of Dead or Alive 3, Team Ninja once again remade Dead or Alive 2, this time for the Xbox system. In the planning stages, this new game was named Dead or Alive Online for its addition of online support. On January 14, it was renamed to Dead or Alive Ultimate and promised fresh content, additional characters and an upgraded version of the original Dead or Alive for the Sega Saturn. According to Tecmo, the name change was due to the opinion that \\"Ultimate would more accurately describe the feeling players feel upon experiences with the game\\". In Japan, Dead or Alive Ultimate was released with a crystal-clear blue version of the Xbox system that included a controller of the same color, a copy of Dead or Alive Ultimate, and some bonus Kasumi-themed extras. In the United States, two trading cards with character pictures on them were randomly included in each game as part of a collector's edition. The game disc of the North American release also contains the Booster Pack for Dead or Alive 3, which adds numerous character costumes and a new opening cinematic for the game. This disc also included a G4-produced segment from their Icons series detailing the history of the Dead or Alive series, along with interviews featuring various people from the video game industry, including series creator Tomonobu Itagaki. With the December 14, 2006, backward compatibility update for the Xbox 360, the Xbox release of Dead or Alive Ultimate can now be played on the Xbox 360. ==Reception== ==See also== *Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate ==ReferencesCategory:2004 video games Category:3D fighting games Category:Dead or Alive (franchise) video games Category:Versus fighting games Category:Video game compilations Category:Video game remakes Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Xbox games Category:Xbox-only games ","title":"Dead or Alive Ultimate"},{"id":"834201","text":"The Corpus Christi Fury was a professional indoor football team based in Corpus Christi, Texas, United States. The Fury played its home games at the American Bank Center. ==History== The Fury began life as the Corpus Christi Hammerheads, a charter member of the Intense Football League. The Hammerheads are coached by ex-University of Houston QB and former IFL star Jason McKinley, son of former NFL player Bob McKinley, and led by a strong supporting cast of players such as quarterback Wes Cooper, wide receiver Shomari Buchanan, tight end Matt Ross, and linebackers Roy Salas and DeAndrae Filmore. They played their home games at the Memorial Coliseum in 2004 and at the American Bank Center in 2005 and 2006, both of which are in Corpus Christi, Texas. The team did not return to the American Bank Center for 2007 after the arena decided not to renew the team's lease and it became the home of the af2 team, the Corpus Christi Sharks. In 2007, the Hammerheads played in the Central Pavilion Arena in nearby Robstown, Texas. In 2008, head coach Jason McKinley guided the Hammerheads back to the Intense Football League's title game only to lose 65‚Äì36 in Lake Charles, Louisiana to the Louisiana Swashbucklers. After the Sharks folded following the 2009 season the Hammerheads announced they were returning to the American Bank Center for the upcoming 2010 season. For the 2011 season, the Hammerheads joined the Southern Indoor Football League. Finishing at 7‚Äì5, the Hammerheads lost to the Louisiana Swashbucklers in the first round of the playoffs. After the 2011 season, the Hammerheads left the SIFL to help start the Lone Star Football League. The team was removed from the Lone Star Football League following the 2012 season. In 2013, the team played in the Ultimate Indoor Football League and renamed as the Corpus Christi Fury (the logos were originally designed for a proposed 2012 UIFL expansion team, the Danville Dragons). After falling to the Florida Tarpons in Ultimate Bowl III, the Fury returned to the Ultimate Bowl in 2014. The team defeated the Tarpons 60‚Äì23 to claim their first championship in franchise history. For the 2015 season, the Fury played in the X-League after the UIFL ceased operations. The Fury would also go winless in this season. On October 1, 2015, the Fury joined American Indoor Football after the X-League folded. The team cancelled several games during the 2016 season and only played one game against another AIF member. While never announced by the team itself, the Fury appeared to have folded before their May 15, 2016, game against the New Mexico Stars, giving the Stars 24 hours' notice that they would be unable to make the game. They also announced their May 22 home game was cancelled on the day of the game over social media without explanation. They were removed from the AIF website after the completion of the 2016 season. AIF would cease all operations in July 2016 but the Fury appear to have folded prior to and independently of this. In October, a new indoor football team was announced to begin play in 2017 out of the American Bank Center called the Corpus Christi Rage. The new team had no connection to the former Hammerheads/Fury franchise and was a member of the new National Arena League. This team, however, also went winless and failed to complete the 2017 season. == Final roster == == Season-by-season == -  colspan=\\"6\\" align=\\"center\\"  Corpus Christi Hammerheads (Intense Football League) - 2004  8  8  0  5th League  ‚Äî -  colspan=\\"6\\" align=\\"center\\"  Corpus Christi Hammerheads (NIFL) - 2005  8  6  0  2nd Pacific South  Won PC Quarterfinal (S.W.

It was one of few attempts at car production in Norway, but only five cars were ever built. ==The car== The Troll was built as a 2+2 sports car with a glass-reinforced plastic (or fibreglass) body. The idea was to build the first mass-produced car outside the US in this material. In the US Chevrolet made its Corvette in fibreglass, but no one in Europe had built cars in plastic, except for the East German Trabant, which was also a 2-cylinder, 2-stroke car. Fibreglass was a relatively new material in the late 1950s, and the benefits were many. It would not rust, it would be 130 kg lighter than an equivalent metal car, and the production would be significantly simpler and therefore cheaper. The chassis was taken from a Gutbrod Superior and made 15 cm longer. The gearbox was a three speed Hurth gearbox. ===Engine=== *700 cc straight-twin two-stroke engines made by Gutbrod of Germany with Bosch fuel injection. *30 hp (22 kW) *Top speed: ca 130 km/h *Fuel consumption: 5 litres/100 km (47mpg) There were plans to change to a SAAB engine, but these were never implemented. ==The storyThe beginning=== Engineer Per Kohl-Larsen got hold of the molds for the car in Germany. The man behind the design was Hanns Trippel. ===The first car=== The first Troll car was revealed to the press in October 1956. It was not completely finished, and although the form of the chassis was final, the car could not be driven. This car was later used as a prototype, and many changes were made during later testing. Norwegian and foreign press showed much enthusiasm towards the project, and the car was compared with brands like Porsche, Citro√´n and SAAB. The first customer received his car May 1, 1957. ===Production and bankruptcy=== As the production commenced, Kohl-Larsen had to work hard to get a permit from the government to sell the car. He was allowed to sell only 15 cars in Norway. The reason for this was a barter treaty Norway had with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to buy cars from them as they bought fish products from Norway. The government was afraid that domestic car production would disrupt this trading balance. Kohl-Larsen therefore started plans to export the cars to Germany and Denmark. There were also requests from other countries like Finland and Belgium. At one point there were plans to build 2,000 cars per year, but after some moderation they said they would be happy with one finished car per day. However, the company was never allowed to sell more than those 15 cars on the Norwegian market. In addition they did not secure the investment capital necessary to start large scale production. When the government made it clear that they never wanted to support the Troll car, all the potential investors closed negotiations. Hence, one of Norway's few ventures into car production went bankrupt in early 1958. Only five complete cars had been produced. ==External links== *Online.no: The Troll automobile Category:Car manufacturers of Norway Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers Category:Defunct companies of Norway Category:Cars introduced in 1956 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1956 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies disestablished in 1958 Category:1956 establishments in Norway Category:1958 disestablishments in Norway ","title":"Troll (automobile)"},{"id":"834222","text":"Will Rogers State Historic Park is the former estate of American humorist Will Rogers. It lies in the Santa Monica Mountains in Los Angeles, in the Pacific Palisades area. ==Geography== In what is now the Los Angeles neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, Rogers built his ranch, where he lived with his wife Betty and their three children, Will Jr., Mary and James. The 31-room ranch house, which includes 11 baths and seven fireplaces, is surrounded by a stable, corrals, riding ring, roping arena, golf course, polo field‚Äîand riding and hiking trails that give visitors views of the ranch and the surrounding countryside‚Äî186 acres (757,000 m¬≤). The ranch became a State Park in 1944 after the death of Mrs. Rogers, and the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. California State Parks has completed a major renovation of the ranch house. The project included reconstruction of flagstone areas that surround the house, seismic safety work, replacement of electrical systems and installation of a new heating and air conditioning system. The house has reopened to the public as of March 2006. Polo field and downtown Los Angeles from the park Beyond the ranch and the stables are the trails that lead to views of the countryside around the park. Since Will Rogers State Historic Park is on the tip of the Santa Monica Mountains, the trails have vistas of both the sea and the mountains. Visitors can hike to Inspiration Point, take the Rogers trail around the perimeter of the park or continue on into Topanga State Park via the Backbone Trail System. ==History== The ranch reflects Will Rogers' roots in horsemanship, starting with the polo field, which is the first thing the visitor sees when looking south from the parking area. The field is the only outdoor polo field in Los Angeles County, and the only field that is regulation size. The ranch has been in many movies and television shows, including Star Trek IV, in which it stood in for Golden Gate Park.http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/StarTrek/04TheVoyageHome/ The polo field features a gentle slope that forms an area for viewing the polo action. Up from the parking area are the ranch buildings, including the visitor center, which once was the ranch guest house. The visitor center features a film on the life of Will Rogers, literature and an audio tour of the grounds. The ranch buildings and grounds are maintained as they were when the Rogers family lived there in the late 1920s and 1930s.

Modern Two, formerly the Dean Gallery, in Edinburgh, is one of the two buildings housing the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, one of Scotland's national art galleries. It is operated by the National Galleries of Scotland. Since its opening it has housed the Paolozzi Gift, a collection of his works given to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in 1994 by Sir Eduardo Paolozzi. It contains a large collection of Dada and Surrealist art and literature, much of which was given by Gabrielle Keiller. It is also used for temporary exhibitions. The Dean Gallery is twinned with Modern One which lies on the opposite side of Belford Road. ==Building history== The building was a replacement for the Orphan Hospital, built 1734 on ground owned by Trinity College Kirk on Leith Wynd in the valley between the High Street and Calton Hill, to make way for the construction of Waverley Station. The building, known as the Dean Orphanage, was designed by Thomas Hamilton in 1831 and took three years to build. Built in Craigleith stone from the nearby quarry, it is in English Baroque style with classical detail. The towers over the staircases contain chimneys and contribute to the Edinburgh skyline in the west of the city centre. The clock above the entrance comes from the original Orphan Hospital and in turn from the 1764 demolition of the Netherbow Port on the High Street, which formerly separated the High Street from the Canongate.Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh, by Gifford McWilliam and Walker The building, which is still owned by the City of Edinburgh Council, served as the Dean Education Centre for many decades before conversion to a gallery. The plot of allotment gardens at the main entrance dates from 1940 when many school grounds were used for such purposes. ==Conversion to gallery== The conversion of the building into a gallery was designed by the architect, Terry Farrell. The gallery opened in 1999 opposite the existing Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. In a rebranding exercise in 2011, the buildings were renamed Modern Two and Modern One respectively. ==Other information== A selection of works are available to view online. A free shuttle bus service links the gallery to the city centre galleries.

The firm was founded in Ludwigsburg by Wilhelm Gutbrod in 1926. It originally built \\"Standard\\" branded motorcycles. In 1933 the company relocated to the nearby Stuttgart suburb of Feuerbach, and from 1933 to 1935, Standard Superior cars were built with rear- mounted engines. An updated version of the Gutbrod Superior introduced in 1953 benefited from developments towards fuel injection undertaken by Mercedes-Benz dating initially from 1935: this Gutbrod was the first car in the world to be offered with fuel injection, some three years before fuel injection appeared in a production engine offered by Mercedes themselves. The small Gutbrod Superior model was produced from 1950 to 1954 using the company's own, front- mounted twin-cylinder two-stroke engines initially of 593cc. In April 1953 the engine size was increased to 663 cc for more expensive 'Luxus 700' versions of the car, while the standard model continued to be offered with the original smaller engine. Claimed power output was for the base version, while for the larger engine or was claimed according to whether fuel feed came via a carburettor or a form of fuel injection. Press reports commended the speed and secure handling of the cars but indicated that the sporty handling came in return for sacrificing some comfort. It was also noted that normal conversation became impossible at speeds above about 80 km/h (50 mph) due to the noise. 7726 cars were produced before the factory was forced to close. The car was developed at the company's small factory at Plochingen am Neckar by Technical Director Dr. Hans Scherenberg during the time of Walter Gutbrod who had taken over the firm in 1948 on the death of his father, Wilhelm Gutbrod (26 February 1890 - 9 August 1948). Scherenberg arrived at Gutbrod from Mercedes where the victorious war-time allies had enforced a pause in engine fuel-injection development, and in 1952 he would return to that firm. A Gutbrod injection engine can still be seen in the Deutsches Museum in Munich. It was a small two seater car, the overall length was , width and the total weight , max speed . The car was offered as standard version for a price of DM 3990, and as Superior Luxus for DM 4380. Recently, a restoration project of an injection model was sold in Geneva for CHF 3000.

Boyden improved upon a turbine developed by French engineer Fourneyron by adding a conical approach passage for the incoming water‚Äîsubmerged diffusers, guide vanes and a diverting exit passage.ASME biography Uriah A. Boyden Uriah was also the younger brother of Seth Boyden, also a notable inventor who perfected a process for making patent leather, among other developments. ==Early life== Uriah Atherton Boyden was born in Foxborough, Massachusetts on February 17, 1804, the son of Seth Boyden and Susannah Atherton. His father was farmer and blacksmith who had invented a machine to split leather.Uriah A.

He also worked under Loammi Baldwin on the dry dock at the Boston Navy Yard, as other mills in Lowell and the Boston and Lowell Railroad. While at Lowell, Boyden worked with British- born engineer James B. Francis, who in 1848 developed the Francis turbine, which superseded Boyden's earlier invention. However, Boyden-type turbines continued to be manufactured, including those installed at Harmony Mills in Cohoes, New York in the early 1870s, and those used at the first Niagara Falls hydroelectric plant in 1895. In 1850, Boyden settled in Boston, and devoted himself to the study of chemistry and physics. He never married. He died in Boston on October 17, 1879.Universities and their sons: history, influence and characteristics of American universities, with biographical sketches and portraits of alumni and recipients of honorary degrees, Volume 2 ==Legacy== Upon his death in 1879, Boyden's will left about a quarter of a million dollars to a suitable astronomical institution that would build an observatory on a mountain for the better atmospheric seeing conditions than those available at lower altitudes. His heirs challenged the will, but it was found valid. In 1887, Edward Charles Pickering convinced the trustees of Boyden's will to award the Boyden Fund to Harvard College Observatory, of which he was director. Although he initially planned to establish an observatory at Mount Wilson, those plans were abandoned (although the Mount Wilson Observatory was later built by a different group). Instead, needing an observation station for southern hemisphere skies, Harvard College Observatory established the \\"Boyden Station\\" at Arequipa, Peru in 1889. In 1927, Boyden Station was moved to South Africa due to better weather conditions and became known as the Boyden Observatory. Uriah also contributed to the Boyden Public Library in his hometown of Foxborough, Massachusetts. The National Museum of American History in Washington, DC is home to the Uriah A.

These small cars were designed according to the patents by Josef Ganz and featured rear-mounted two-stroke engines. After World War II, the same company made Gutbrod cars and introduced the model Gutbrod Superior. ==History== In the first half of 1932, Wilhelm Gutbrod, the President of the Standard Fahrzeugfabrik, came into contact with German engineer Josef Ganz. Ganz had been working on a small car design since the early 1920s and had so far built two prototypes, one for Ardie in 1930 and one for Adler in 1931, called the Maik√§fer (May Beetle). After a demonstration with the Maik√§fer by Ganz, Gutbrod was most interested to build a small car according to this design. The Standard Fahrzeugfabrik then purchased a license from Ganz to develop and build a small car according to his design. The prototype of this new model, which was to be called Standard Superior, was finished in 1932. It featured a tubular chassis, a mid-mounted engine, and independent wheel suspension with swing-axles at the rear. ==Models== The first production model of the Standard Superior was introduced at the IAMA (Internationale Automobil- und Motorradausstellung) in Berlin in February 1933. It had a transverse 396cc, two-cylinder, two-stroke engine mounted in front of the rear axle. Because of some criticism to the body design, not in the least by Josef Ganz in Motor- Kritik, it was followed in April 1933 by a slightly altered model. In November 1933 the Standard Fahrzeugfabrik introduced yet another new and improved model for 1934, which was slightly longer with one additional window on each side and had a small seat for children or as luggage space in the back. This car was advertised as the German \\"Volkswagen\\" (a term that means, literally, \\"people's car\\" in German). ==The Volkswagen Beetle connection== With the Ardie-Ganz, Adler Maik√§fer and Standard Superior cars, as well as his progressive writings and promotion of the concept of a Volkswagen (people's car) in Motor-Kritik magazine since the 1920s, Josef Ganz is claimed by some to have had input into the Volkswagen Beetle.Was Volkswagen's creator Jewish? (a Dutch website) These cars had some of features of the later Volkswagen Beetle, such as the tubular chassis, rear-mounted engine and independent wheel suspension with swing axles. While the Volkswagen Beetle was produced in its millions after World War Two, the name of Josef Ganz was largely forgotten. In 2004, Dutch journalist Paul Schilperoord started researching the life and work of Josef Ganz, and in 2011 he published The Extraordinary Life of Josef Ganz: The Jewish Engineer Behind Hitler's Volkswagen. ==The Jaguar logo connection== The cat used in Jaguar's logo was part inspired by the Standard logo in which the feline is shown \\"racing\\". ==References== *Did Josef Ganz Create the Beetle? *Joseph Ganz Archive *Joseph Ganz Foundation Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of Germany Category:Volkswagen Group Category:Rear- engined vehicles Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Automobiles with backbone chassis ","title":"Standard Superior"},{"id":"834362","text":"Cecilia Maria Altonaga (born December 26, 1962) is a Florida United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. She is the first Cuban-American woman to be appointed as a federal judge in the United States. ==Biography== Altonaga was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and is an alumna of Florida International University, where she received her Bachelor of Arts degree in 1983. She graduated from the Yale Law School with a Juris Doctor in 1986. She worked as an attorney in the Miami Dade County Attorney's Office from 1986‚Äì1987, and then served as a law clerk to Edward B. Davis of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida from 1987-88 before returning to the County Attorney's Office until 1996. In 1996, Governor Lawton Chiles appointed her as a County Court Judge on Florida's Eleventh Judicial Circuit Court. In 1999, she was elevated to Circuit Court Judge in that district by Governor Jeb Bush. She was nominated for a seat on U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida by George W. Bush on January 15, 2003, to a seat vacated by Shelby Highsmith. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 6, 2003, and received her commission the following day. During her time on the federal bench, Altonaga has been noted for her strong support of the recently created Florida International University College of Law, having served as the keynote speaker in the 2004 Convocation, judged several moot court competitions, and employed FIU law students as summer interns. ==Notable rulings== On June 14, 2007, Altonaga ruled that US Sugar Corporation's practice of pumping untreated wastewater into Lake Okeechobee was in violation of the Clean Water Act. Largely as a result of this decision, on June 25, 2008 the state of Florida announced plans to purchase of land controlled by US Sugar, which will be used to restore vital water flow between Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades National Park, helping to ensure its survival in the face of competition for water from surrounding development. She also presided over the trial of Charles McArthur Emmanuel, son of former Liberian dictator Charles Taylor, for torture. In September 2006, Dubai Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum was accused of encouraging the abduction and enslavement of thousands of boys for use as jockeys in camel racing.

In 2012, Judge Altonaga disqualified the entire firm of Morgan & Morgan PA from a class action suit for \\"deplorable behavior\\" including insisting on holding depositions in a Dunkin' Donuts, appearing at depositions dressed in t-shirt and shorts, bragging about playing Angry Birds during depositions, and drawing then showing off \\"pictures of male genitalia\\" during depositions. On December 5, 2016, Judge Altonaga rejected the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs $450,000 penalty against the City of Miami‚Äôs budget director for deceiving municipal bond investors, instead fining Michael Boudreaux $15,000. ==Supreme Court speculation== In July 2005, following the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Judge Altonaga's name was raised as a potential George W. Bush Supreme Court candidate, a position for which she was promoted by Florida's Hispanic community. However, it would be a very rare occurrence for a sitting District Court judge to be appointed to the Supreme Court. At 43, Altonaga was younger than most other Hispanics or women who were being mentioned as possible nominees, which might have made her a more attractive choice to the President. However, President Bush went through several other nominees, and nominated Judge Samuel Alito for the position. ==See also== *George W.

In addition to the Supreme Court of the United States, whose existence and some aspects of whose jurisdiction are beyond the constitutional power of Congress to alter, Congress has established 13 courts of appeals (also called \\"circuit courts\\") with appellate jurisdiction over different regions of the United States, and 94 United States district courts. Every judge appointed to such a court may be categorized as a federal judge; such positions include the chief justice and associate justices of the Supreme Court, circuit judges of the courts of appeals, and district judges of the United States district courts. All of these judges described thus far are referred to sometimes as \\"Article III judges\\" because they exercise the judicial power vested in the judicial branch of the federal government by Article III of the U.S. Constitution. In addition, judges of the Court of International Trade exercise judicial power pursuant to Article III. Other judges serving in the federal courts, including magistrate judges and bankruptcy judges, are also sometimes referred to as \\"federal judges\\"; however, they are neither appointed by the president nor confirmed by the Senate, and their power derives from Article I instead. ==Powers and duties== The primary function of the federal judges is to resolve matters brought before the United States federal courts. Most federal courts in the United States are courts of limited jurisdiction, meaning that they hear only cases for which jurisdiction is authorized by the United States constitution or federal statutes. However, federal district courts are authorized to hear a wide range of civil and criminal cases. District court judges are recognized as having a certain degree of inherent authority to manage the matters before them, ranging from setting the dates for trials and hearings to holding parties in contempt or otherwise sanctioning them for improper behavior. In other circumstances their actions are dictated by federal law, the federal rules of procedure, or \\"local\\" rules created by the specific court system itself. ==Tenure and salary== \\"Article III federal judges\\" (as opposed to judges of some courts with special jurisdictions) serve \\"during good behavior\\" (often paraphrased as appointed \\"for life\\"). Judges hold their seats until they resign, die, or are removed from office. Although the legal orthodoxy is that judges cannot be removed from office except by impeachment by the House of Representatives followed by conviction by the Senate, several legal scholars, including William Rehnquist, Saikrishna Prakash, and Steven D. Smith, have argued that the Good Behavior Clause may, in theory, permit removal by way of a writ of scire facias filed before a federal court, without resort to impeachment.Saikrishna Prakash & Steven D. Smith, \\"How To Remove a Federal Judge\\" , 116 Yale L.J. 72 (2006). As of 2019, federal district judges are paid $210,900 a year, circuit judges $223,700, Associate Justices of the Supreme Court $258,900 and the Chief Justice of the United States $270,700. All were permitted to earn a maximum of an additional $21,000 a year for teaching. Chief Justice John Roberts has repeatedly pleaded for an increase in judicial pay, calling the situation \\"a constitutional crisis that threatens to undermine the strength and independence of the federal judiciary\\". The problem is that the most talented associates at the largest U.S. law firms with judicial clerkship experience (in other words, the attorneys most qualified to become the next generation of federal judges) already earn as much as a federal judge in their first year as full-time associates.Debra Cassens Weiss, \\"Scalia Denies Abortion Views Influenced by Religion, Calls His GPS Opinion 'Defendant Friendly'\\", ABA Journal, 4 February 2012. Thus, when those attorneys eventually become experienced partners and reach the stage in life where one would normally consider switching to public service, their interest in joining the judiciary is tempered by the prospect of a giant pay cut back to what they were making 10 to 20 years earlier (adjusted for inflation). One way for attorneys to soften the financial blow is to spend only a few years on the bench and then return to private practice or go into private arbitration, but such turnover creates a risk of a revolving door judiciary subject to regulatory capture. Thus, Chief Justice Roberts has warned that \\"judges are no longer drawn primarily from among the best lawyers in the practicing bar\\" and \\"If judicial appointment ceases to be the capstone of a distinguished career and instead becomes a stepping stone to a lucrative position in private practice, the Framers' goal of a truly independent judiciary will be placed in serious jeopardy.\\" ==Duty station== Each federal judge serves at a particular \\"duty station\\" for the duration of his or her federal service. This is important because of the relationship among several federal statutes. First, 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 456(a) entitles federal judges to reimbursement of transportation and \\"subsistence\\" expenses incurred while transacting official business away from their duty stations. Section 456 also prescribes that the District of Columbia is the duty station of all members of the U.S. Supreme Court, the D.C. Circuit, the Federal Circuit, and the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Second, there are several reasons federal judges need to transact official business outside of their regular courthouse. 28 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 291 and 292 authorize a broad variety of temporary reassignments of circuit and district judges, both horizontally (i.e., to other circuits or districts) and vertically (so that a district judge can hear appeals and a circuit judge can try cases). Many federal judges serve on administrative panels like the judicial council for their circuit or the Judicial Conference of the United States. Some of the larger circuit courts like the Ninth Circuit hold regular sessions at multiple locations, and randomly select three-judge panels to hear appeals from all sitting circuit judges regardless of duty station. (Videoconferencing is sometimes now used to reduce the burden of frequent travel on circuit judges.) ==Discipline== The discipline process of federal judges is initiated by the filing of a complaint by any person alleging that a judge has engaged in conduct \\"prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts, or alleging that such judge is unable to discharge all the duties of the office by reason of mental or physical disability.\\". See generally . If the chief judge of the circuit does not dismiss the complaint or conclude the proceedings, then they must promptly appoint himself or herself, along with equal numbers of circuit judges and district judges, to a special committee to investigate the facts and allegations in the complaint. The committee must conduct such investigation as it finds necessary and then expeditiously file a comprehensive written report of its investigation with the judicial council of the circuit involved. Upon receipt of such a report, the judicial council of the circuit involved may conduct any additional investigation it deems necessary, and it may dismiss the complaint. If a judge who is the subject of a complaint holds their office during good behavior, action taken by the judicial council may include certifying disability of the judge. The judicial council may also, in its discretion, refer any complaint under 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 351, along with the record of any associated proceedings and its recommendations for appropriate action, to the Judicial Conference of the United States. The Judicial Conference may exercise its authority under the judicial discipline provisions as a conference, or through a standing committee appointed by the chief justice. ==Retirement== Once a judge meets age and service requirements they may retire and will then earn their final salary for the remainder of their life, plus cost-of-living increases. The \\"Rule of 80\\" is the commonly used shorthand for the age and service requirement for a judge to retire, or assume senior status, as set forth in Title 28 of the U.S. Code, section 371(c). Beginning at age 65, a judge may retire at their current salary, or take senior status, after performing 15 years of active service as an Article III judge (65 + 15 = 80). A sliding scale of increasing age and decreasing service (66 + 14, 67 + 13, 68 + 12, 69 + 11) results in eligibility for retirement compensation at age 70 with a minimum of 10 years of service (70 + 10 = 80). Under section 376 a survivor's annuity to benefit the widow, widower or minor child of the judge may be purchased via a deduction of 2.2% to 3.5% from the retirement benefit. ==Number of judges== There are currently 870 authorized Article III judgeships: nine on the Supreme Court, 179 on the courts of appeals, 673 for the district courts and nine on the Court of International Trade. The total number of active federal judges is constantly in flux, for two reasons. First, judges retire or die, and a lapse of time occurs before new judges are appointed to fill those positions. Second, from time to time Congress will increase (or, less frequently, decrease) the number of federal judgeships in a particular judicial district, usually in response to shifting population numbers or a changing workload in that district. Although the number of Supreme Court justices has remained the same for well over a century, the number of court of appeals judges has more than doubled since 1950, and the number of district court judges has increased more than three-fold in that period.Federal Judicial Center. In addition, some district court judges serve on more than one court at a time. ==Non-Article III judges== Unlike the judges of Article III courts, non-Article III judges are appointed for specified terms of office. Examples include United States magistrate judges and judges of the United States bankruptcy courts, United States Tax Court, United States Court of Federal Claims, and United States territorial courts. Although the term \\"non-Article III judges\\" is used to describe the absence of tenure and salary protection, bankruptcy courts are formally designated as divisions of U.S. District Courts, whose district judges are Article III judicial officers. Moreover, in Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868 (1991), the Supreme Court concluded that the judges of the U.S. Tax Court (and their special trial judges) exercise a portion of \\"the judicial power of the United States.\\" ==See also== *Federal judicial appointment history *List of United States federal judges by longevity of service *List of current United States Circuit Judges *List of current United States district judges ==References== * ==External links== *Judicial Financial Disclosure Reports ","title":"United States federal judge"},{"id":"834371","text":"thumb 1933 Goudey Baseball Card of Dazzy Vance #2 Charles Arthur \\"Dazzy\\" Vance (March 4, 1891 ‚Äì February 16, 1961) was an American professional baseball player. He played as a pitcher for five different franchises in Major League Baseball (MLB) in a career that spanned twenty years. Known for his impressive fastball, Vance was the only pitcher to lead the National League in strikeouts seven consecutive seasons. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955. ==Early life== Born in Orient, Iowa, Vance spent most of his childhood in Nebraska. He played semipro baseball there, then signed on with a minor league baseball team out of Red Cloud, Nebraska, a member of the Nebraska State League, in 1912. After pitching for two other Nebraska State League teams in 1913 (Superior) and 1914 (Hastings Giants), Vance made a brief major league debut with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1915 and appeared with the New York Yankees that year as well. However, it took several years before he established himself as a major league player.https://www.baseball- reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=vance-001cla Vance was discovered to have an arm injury in 1916 and was given medical treatment. He continued to work on his pitching in the minor leagues, appearing with teams in Columbus, Ohio; Toledo, Ohio; Memphis, Tennessee; Rochester, New York; and Sacramento, California. He only reappeared in the major leagues once for the Yankees, pitching two games in 1918. Vance said he was suddenly able to throw hard again in 1921 while pitching for the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association: he struck out 163 batters and finished the season with a 21‚Äì11 win-loss record. The Pelicans sold his contract to the Brooklyn Robins in 1922. The Robins wanted to acquire catcher Hank DeBerry, but the Pelicans refused to complete the deal unless Vance was included in the transaction. ==Major league career== Vance and DeBerry formed a successful battery during their tenure with Brooklyn. In 1922, Vance produced an 18‚Äì12 record with a 3.70 earned run average (ERA) and a league-leading 134 strikeouts. His best individual season came in 1924, when he led the National League in wins (28), strikeouts (262) and ERA (2.16) (see Triple Crown) en route to winning the National League Most Valuable Player Award. He set the then-National League record for strikeouts in a nine-inning game when he fanned 15 Chicago Cubs in a game on August 23, 1924. (He struck-out 17 batters in a 10-inning game in 1925.) On September 24, 1924, Vance struck out three batters on nine pitches in the second inning of a 6‚Äì5 win over the Chicago Cubs. Vance became the fifth National League pitcher and the seventh pitcher in MLB history to accomplish the nine-strike/three-strikeout half-inning. He finished the season with 262 strikeouts, more than any two National League pitchers combined (Burleigh Grimes with 135 and Dolf Luque with 86 were second and third respectively). That season, Vance had one out of every 13 strikeouts in the entire National League. Vance pitched a no-hitter on September 13, 1925 against the Phillies, winning 10‚Äì1. Vance was involved in one of the most famous flubs in baseball history, the \\"three men on third\\" incident during the 1926 season. With Vance on second and Chick Fewster on first, Babe Herman hit a long ball and began racing around the bases. As Herman rounded second, the third base coach yelled at him to go back, since Fewster had not yet passed third. Vance, having rounded third, misunderstood and reversed course, returning to third. Fewster arrived at third. Herman ignored the instruction and also arrived at third. The third baseman tagged out Herman and Fewster; Vance was declared safe by rule. Vance's play began to decline in the early 1930s and he bounced to the St. Louis Cardinals (becoming a member of the team known as the Gashouse Gang), Cincinnati Reds and back to the Dodgers. On September 12, 1934, Vance hit his seventh and final major league home run at 43 years and 6 months, the 2nd oldest pitcher to do so to this day.http://calltothepen.com/2016/05/09/mlb-history-five-oldest-pitchers-hit- homerun/5/ However, just a week later commenting for a newspaper article, Vance said that he did not recommend baseball as a career to young men. He pointed out that very few people could make a good living out of it, especially during a time when increasing major league salaries were attracting many college-educated men who would have previously chosen other work. He retired after the 1935 season. Vance led the league in ERA three times, wins twice, and established a National League record by leading the league in strikeouts in seven consecutive years (1922‚Äì1928). He retired with a 197‚Äì140 record, 2,045 strikeouts and a 3.24 ERA ‚Äì remarkable numbers considering he only saw 33 innings of big league play during his twenties. ==Later life== Vance duck hunting in Crystal River, Florida, January 1952 Vance enjoyed hunting and fishing when he retired to Homosassa Springs, Florida, where he had lived since the 1920s. In 1938, Vance became ill with pneumonia. The illness worsened and kept him hospitalized for several months.Skipper, p. 177. Vance recovered and became a frequent guest at Brooklyn old-timers games. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955. He learned of his election when a highway patrolman got his attention on a local highway and told him that a photographer was at his house.Skipper, p. 179. A Dazzy Vance Day celebration was held in Brooklyn. Biographer John Skipper characterized his Hall of Fame induction as \\"subdued\\" compared to the celebration in Brooklyn.Skipper, p. 183. Vance died of a heart attack in 1961 in Homosassa Springs. His obituary in The Sporting News said that he had been under a doctor's care but that he was active and thought to be in relatively good health when he died. His survivors included his wife Edyth and a daughter. ==Legacy== In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. Vance is mentioned in the 1949 poem \\"Line-Up for Yesterday\\" by Ogden Nash: ==See also== * Major League Baseball Triple Crown * List of Major League Baseball annual ERA leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual strikeout leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual wins leaders * List of Major League Baseball pitchers who have struck out three batters on nine pitches * List of Major League Baseball career strikeout leaders * Major League Baseball titles leaders * List of Major League Baseball no-hitters ==Notes== ==References== * == External links == * * Vance Was Violent Pitcher With Power, Speed To Burn, by Harry Grayson, May 26, 1943 * Category:1891 births Category:1961 deaths Category:Baseball players from Iowa Category:People from Adair County, Iowa Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:National Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:New York Yankees players Category:Brooklyn Dodgers players Category:Brooklyn Robins players Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:Cincinnati Reds players Category:National League Pitching Triple Crown winners Category:National League ERA champions Category:National League strikeout champions Category:National League wins champions Category:York Prohibitionists players Category:Superior Brickmakers players Category:Hastings Reds players Category:St. Joseph Drummers players Category:Columbus Senators players Category:Memphis Chickasaws players Category:Toledo Iron Men players Category:Rochester Hustlers players Category:Sacramento Senators players Category:New Orleans Pelicans (baseball) players Category:People from Citrus County, Florida ","title":"Dazzy Vance"},{"id":"834379","text":"Clachnacuddin Football Club is a part-time senior professional football club from the city of Inverness who currently play in the Scottish Highland Football League.

From the time that he began his work, the average number of children in Thai families has decreased from 7 to 1.5.TED Talk, 7 October 2010 ==Early life== Mechai was born in Bangkok to a Scottish mother and a Thai father, both of whom were doctors and had met when studying in Edinburgh. He is one of four children. His younger brother, Sunya, is the founder of the Pattaya International Hospital. One of his sisters, Sumalee Viravaidya, was a noted journalist in the 1970s, writing for the Bangkok Post and the Nation. Mechai was educated in Australia at Geelong Grammar School and at Trinity College at the University of Melbourne, where he obtained a Bachelor of Commerce degree. In 1965, he returned to Thailand and in 1966 started to work in family planning, emphasizing the use of condoms. In 1973, he left the civil service and founded a non-profit service organization, the Population and Community Development Association (PDA), to continue his efforts to improve the lives of the rural poor. He used such events as holding condom blowing contests for school children, encouraging taxi drivers to hand out condoms to their customers, and founding a restaurant chain called Cabbages and Condoms, where condoms are given to customers with the bill. An interesting side note is the family planning clinic which openly operates next to the Cabbages and Condoms restaurant. This is one of several places in Bangkok where poor women can receive pregnancy termination, a practice which is legal in the country per Section 305 of the Thailand penal code, but often perceived as illegal.Thailand Penal Code Section 301-305Thailand , in The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality, 1997-2001 The clinic is permitted by the authorities due to the dangers of unsafe abortion by Thai women because of \\"economic difficulties\\".The Health Impact of Unsafe Abortion ==Later life== Mechai served as deputy minister of industry from 1985 to 1986 under prime minister Prem Tinsulanonda. He served as senator from 1987 until 1991. During this time AIDS appeared in Thailand, and he increased his efforts to promote sexual-safety awareness. A military coup in 1991 installed prime minister Anand Panyarachun who then appointed Mechai minister for tourism, information and AIDS. He was able to start a large and quite successful AIDS education campaign and served until 1992. At that time he became the chairman of the Foundation for International Education, the non-profit organization that serves as the governing body of NIST International School. Mechai continued to serve as the chair until stepping down in May, 2002. In 1995 he was appointed an Honorary Officer of the Order of Australia, for \\"service to Australian-Thai relations and contributions to the world AIDS debate\\".It's an Honour In 2004, Mechai again became a senator. In 2006 he won praise from the toilet industry (but criticism from the retail industry) for proposing that retailers be obliged to build a public toilet for every 10 square metres of retail space.Toilet-train food firms: Mechai, The Nation, 18 November 2006 As of 2007, he continues to oversee rural development and health initiatives as the Chairman of PDA, now the largest NGO in Thailand, with 600 employees and 12,000 volunteers.

Historic item by the Tboli tribe, from the display of the Tboli museum, Lake Sebu, South Cotabato. The Tboli people () are one of the indigenous peoples of South Cotabato in Southern Mindanao. The body of ethnographic and linguistic literature on Mindanao, they are variously known as Tboli, T'boli, Tb√∂li, Tagabili, Tagabilil, Tagabulul and Tau Bilil. They term themselves Tboli. Their whereabouts and identity are somewhat imprecise in the literature; some publications present the Tboli and the Tagabili as distinct peoples; some locate the Tbolis to the vicinity of the Lake Buluan in the Cotabato Basin or in Agusan del Norte. The Tbolis, then, reside on the mountain slopes on either side of the upper Alah Valley and the coastal area of Maitum, Maasim and Kiamba. In former times, the Tbolis also inhabited the upper Alah Valley floor. After World War II, i.e., since the arrival of settlers originating from other parts of the Philippines, they have been gradually pushed onto the mountain slopes. As of now, they are almost expelled from the fertile valley floor. Like their immediate tribal neighbors, the √öb√ªs, Bl√†an, Blit, T√†√∫-Seg√©l, and the Tasaday, they have been variously termed hill tribes, pagans, animists, etc., as opposed to the indigenous Muslim peoples or the Christian settlers. In political contexts, however, the term Lumad groups (derived from the Cebuano term for native people) has become popular as a generic term for the various indigenous peoples of Mindanao. ==Musical== The Tboli have a musical heritage consisting of various types of agung ensembles ‚Äì ensembles composed of large hanging, suspended or held, bossed/knobbed gongs which act as drone without any accompanying melodic instrument. Other instruments include the hegelung. ==Indigenous Tboli religion== T'nalak cloth of T'boli dream weavers have patterns inspired by dreams and blessed by Fu Dalu, the god of abac√° The T'boli people believe in a highly-complex traditional religion that is unique to the region. Their religion is regionally-complex and is composed of the life ways and belief systems inherent to the Tboli psyche. However, in modern times, their religion has been degraded to a certain extent due to the introduction of Roman Catholicism, Protestanism, and Islam. Nevertheless, some communities continue to preserve and conserve the religion practices of their ancestors, which has been established thousands of years ago. ===Immortals=== *Bulon La Mogoaw: one of the two supreme deities; married to Kadaw La Sambad; lives in the seventh layer of the universeCasal, G.

The term was coined by anthropologist Jenifer James to express sex workers' movements' \\"goals of removing laws used to target prostitutes\\".M. G. Grant, Playing the Whore (Verso/Jacobin, 2014), p. 112 The reverse process is criminalization. Decriminalization reflects changing social and moral views. A society may come to the view that an act is not harmful, should no longer be criminalized, or is otherwise not a matter to be addressed by the criminal justice system. Examples of subject matter which have been the subject of changing views on criminality over time in various societies and countries include: *abortion *breastfeeding in public *drug possession, and recreational drug use *euthanasia *gambling *homosexuality *polygamy *prostitution *public nudity *steroid use in sport In a federal country, acts may be decriminalized by one level of government while still subject to penalties levied by another; for example, possession of a decriminalized drug may still be subject to criminal charges by one level of government, but another may yet impose a monetary fine. This should be contrasted with legalization, which removes all or most legal detriments from a previously illegal act. It has also been noted that while some acts have been decriminalised, such as homosexuality and adultery, others have increased in their criminalization, such as familial sexual activities, or incest. ==Drug-use decriminalization topics== *Decriminalization of non-medicinal marijuana in the United States *Legal history of cannabis in the United States *Cannabis legalization in Canada *Colorado Amendment 64 *Marijuana Policy Project *Psilocybin decriminalization in the United States *Law Enforcement Against Prohibition *Legality of cannabis *Timeline of cannabis law *Responsible drug use *War on Drugs ==See also== *Drug liberalization *Drug policy of the Soviet Union *Legal issues of anabolic steroids *Legalization *Liberalization *Alcohol prohibition *Prostitution in Canada *Prostitution in Rhode Island *Public-order crime *Sex worker *Sodomy law *Timeline of LGBT history *Unenforced law *Victimless crime ==References== Category:Classical liberalism Category:Criminal law legal terminology Category:Drug policy reform ","title":"Decriminalization"},{"id":"834412","text":", sometimes referred to in Japanese as , is a series of puzzle games first released in the arcade, and later primarily for several platforms such as the Neo Geo Arcade, Super Famicom, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, Bandai WonderSwan, GBC and the Neo Geo Pocket Color; most of which were published by Data East. ==Gameplay== A stack of random colored bubbles descend from the top, and a player is defeated when a bubble hits the bottom. Bubbles can be picked up and dropped by the player's clown at the bottom, and are destroyed when three or more of the same color are put together on a single column. Chains are formed either when a single drop caused a chain reaction, or when more than one group of bubbles is destroyed in quick succession. The game is normally played with two players (one may be a computer opponent), and chains cause the opponent's stack to descend faster. There are 24 characters, all but the Black Pierrot being named after a tarot card (although the Strength card has been represented by two characters throughout the series). Different characters have different attack patterns. The columns of the opponent's stack will descend at different rates relative to each other depending on the character chosen. This causes a disjunction of colors that may make it more difficult for the other player to clear their stack. For example, with the character Devil, all the columns will descend at the same rate, whereas with Sun, the middle columns will descend faster than the others. ==History== In 1995, Data East released the first game in the series as a coin-operated version of this game titled Magical Drop (known in North America as Chain Reaction). Despite the arcade game being released worldwide while using the English title in North America and Europe, Data East gave the official English names of its successors the same names as their Japanese counterparts, while the home versions of the first game were never released outside Japan. The series became better known for its Neo-Geo sequels, Magical Drop II and Magical Drop III, due to the popularity of the Neo-Geo platform. The last games in the series released in the United States were Magical Drop Pocket for the Neo Geo Pocket Color in 1999 and Magical Drop for the Game Boy Color in 2000. G-mode bought and currently now owns the intellectual rights to the Magical Drop franchise along with several other of Data East's franchises and titles. While Data East declared bankruptcy in 2003, other publishers have re-released the PlayStation titles Magical Drop 3 + Wonderful and Magical Drop F. Magical Drop II and Magical Drop III are also available on the subscription service GameTap. In 2007, the Super Famicom version of the first Magical Drop title was released in Japan on the Virtual Console for the Wii by G-mode. In 2009, versions of Magical Drop for Android phones and iPhone were released in May and September, respectively. On May 25, 2010, Magical Drop II was released on the Virtual Console by G-mode. In 2010, Magical Drop III was included as part of Data East Arcade Classics and released on the Virtual Console in Japan on July 6, 2010. At E3 2011, UTV Ignition Entertainment announced a new sequel, Magical Drop V. Handled by the French developer Golgoth Studio, the game was released for PC on November 15, 2012. ==CharactersIntroduced in Magical Drop=== *Fool: A little man wearing a purple robe. He is always seen carrying a cat with him, which happens to share the same mannerisms as him. In the sequel, it is revealed in his ending that there are, in fact, two Fools, and they are brothers *Magician: A young man with a narcissistic streak. While seeming mature, he has an absurd sense of humor *High Priestess: A scholarly young lady who spends most of her time reading books *Chariot: A hot-blooded knight who has no fear and never backs down from danger *Devil: A mischievous young boy with demonic traits such as horns and dragon wings *Star: A girl who carries two jugs of water. While cheerful, she can also turn into a crybaby *World: A goddess-like woman with three eyes and a ribbon covering parts of her body. She debuted in the original game as the final opponent and was not playable until the sequel ===Introduced in Magical Drop II=== *Justice: A teenage girl with a strong sense of justice, true to her namesake *Strength: A muscular man who wears iron knuckles. He is sometimes referred to as Father Strength *Empress: A villainous woman who wears a dominatrix outfit, though she was originally a kind and gentle woman. She debuted in the game as the final opponent *Black Pierrot: An evil jester-like demon who acts as the game's secret boss. He was responsible for the corruption of Empress ===Introduced in Magical Drop III=== *Emperor *Hierophant *Lovers *Young Strength *Death *Temperance *Sun *Judgement *Hermit *Moon *Hanged Man *Tower *Wheel of Fortune ==GamesMagical Drop („Éû„Ç∏„Ç´„É´„Éâ„É≠„ÉÉ„Éó)=== The first game in the series, first released to arcades in 1995. It features Fool, Magician, High Priestess, Chariot, Devil, and Star as playable characters. It features a single-player mode, where the player battles each playable character before taking on World in one final encounter, as well as a two-player multiplayer mode. The game received an updated version named Magical Drop Plus 1! („Éû„Ç∏„Ç´„É´„Éâ„É≠„ÉÉ„ÉóPLUS1!), which adds a Solo Play mode that challenges players to obtain a high score without having to battle an AI opponent. Magical Drop Plus 1! was released in English as Chain Reaction. Magical Drop was ported to the Super Famicom, which includes a puzzle mode that challenges players to solve preset puzzles given a limited number of possible moves. The game was re- imagined for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn with different, pre-rendered characters. Finally, a port of the game is part of Magical Drop III + Wonderful; this includes the PAL version of III + Wonderful, which retains the Magical Drop Plus 1! name as opposed to using Chain Reaction. ===Magical Drop II („Éû„Ç∏„Ç´„É´„Éâ„É≠„ÉÉ„Éó2)=== Gameplay screenshot showcasing a match between Chariot and Star. The second game in the series moved from Data East's proprietary arcade hardware to SNK's Neo Geo. It first released in 1996. In addition to the cast of the first Magical Drop, Magical Drop II introduces Justice, as well as antagonists Strength, Empress, and Black Pierrot. One notable gameplay change is that normal bubbles and \\"special\\" bubbles can now be matched together, unlike the first game where they were considered completely separate. The \\"Solo Play\\" mode, now known as Puzzle Mode, is also changed to add more rows to the player's playfield. Finally, the Japanese version of Magical Drop II contains a third mode named Hirameki that offers preset puzzles for the player to solve. Magical Drop II was ported to the Neo Geo CD, Super Famicom, and Sega Saturn. The Super Famicom and Saturn ports add short conversations between the characters in cutscenes, while the Super Famicom version also allows players to adjust the characters' parameters. By 2017, the Neo Geo version of the game was released on Nintendo Switch. ===Magical Drop III („Éû„Ç∏„Ç´„É´„Éâ„É≠„ÉÉ„Éó3)=== Gameplay screenshot showcasing a match between World and Justice. The third Magical Drop game, first released in 1997, was also developed for the Neo Geo. This games adds representatives for the remaining Tarot Major Arcana, as well as introducing a \\"daughter\\" Strength character that more closely resembles the traditional depiction of Strength. The game adds a third button, which allows players to add rows to their field at any time. Additionally, attacks now sends lines to the opponent in non-even rows that vary by character. Hirameki mode is replaced by Adventure Mode, which is a board game that challenges players to reach Empress before CPU-controlled rivals. The English versions of Magical Drop III remove the hardest difficulty setting in Vs. CPU Mode and rival opponents in Adventure Mode. The game was ported to the Sega Saturn and twice to the Sony PlayStation, alongside various other direct ports of the Neo Geo version. The Sega Saturn version changes the speed and various other aspects of gameplay. The first PlayStation port, Magical Drop III: Yokubari Tokudaigou! („Éû„Ç∏„Ç´„É´„Éâ„É≠„ÉÉ„Éó3 „Çà„Åè„Å∞„ÇäÁâπÂ§ßÂè∑), allows the player to choose between the Saturn's rebalanced version and a version more faithful to the arcade release; the second PlayStation port, Magical Drop III + Wonderful („Éû„Ç∏„Ç´„É´„Éâ„É≠„ÉÉ„Éó3Ôºã„ÉØ„É≥„ÉÄ„Éõ„Éº!) features the rebalanced gameplay mode from Yokubari Tokudaigou! alongside a port of Magical Drop Plus 1!. Magical Drop III + Wonderful was released in PAL regions as simply Magical Drop III by Swing! Entertainment. The game was also ported to the Neo Geo Pocket Color (as Magical Drop Pocket) and the Game Boy Color (as simply Magical Drop). The Game Boy Color version does not include a CPU mode, and thus players only gain access to Magical Drop III's full roster by playing the two-player mode. By 22 February 2018, the Neo-Geo version was released worldwide on the Nintendo Switch by HAMSTER Co. and released in Japan on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. ===Magical Drop F - Daibouken Mo Rakujyanai! („Éû„Ç∏„Ç´„É´„Éâ„É≠„ÉÉ„ÉóF„ÉªÂ§ßÂÜíÈô∫„ÇÇ„É©„ÇØ„Åò„ÇÉ„Å™„ÅÑ!)=== The fourth entry in the Magical Drop series released exclusively on the PlayStation in Japan in 1999. It features Magical Drop III's entire cast of characters. Magical Drop F includes character-specific items, which give players unique abilities during gameplay. The game replaces Adventure Mode from III with an RPG mode. The game's music and updated aesthetics were used in Magical Drop for Wonderswan („Éû„Ç∏„Ç´„É´„Éâ„É≠„ÉÉ„Éó for „ÉØ„É≥„ÉÄ„Éº„Çπ„ÉØ„É≥), which released in 1999 for Bandai's WonderSwan. ===Magical Drop Touch=== The fifth game was developed by Data East staff and published by G-mode and released on October 20, 2009 for the iOS and Android platform. The game was specifically designed to make use of touch screen and respond to screen tilting and incorporates only six characters from the first two games. By March 30, 2012 the game was discontinued. ===Magical Drop V („Éû„Ç∏„Ç´„É´„Éâ„É≠„ÉÉ„ÉóV)=== The sixth Magical Drop game was developed by French independent studio Golgoth and published by UTV Ignition for Steam in 2012. Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network ports were announced, but ultimately never materialized. The game features a much smaller selection of characters, omits items, and removes Puzzle Mode; however, it adds new online gameplay modes. Characters from the cancelled Data East puzzle game Ghostlop are introduced; these three characters use Ghostlop gameplay instead of traditional Magical Drop mechanics. ==Reception== In Japan, Game Machine listed Magical Drop on their September 1, 1995 issue as being the tenth most-successful arcade game of the year. A review of the arcade version of the original game in Next Generation stated: \\"Chain Reaction is proving quite popular in Japan, despite the fact that this kind of game has been around now for at least five years.\\" The reviewer scored the game two out of five stars, concluding, \\"It's not brilliant nor innovative, certainly not new, but it's fun and as addictive as sex after lunch... in a jester suit.\\" Mean Machines gave the Saturn version an 84 out of 100, with the reviewers remarking that the game is addictive and offers numerous options, but is frustratingly difficult in single-player mode. They disagreed as to whether it is better or worse than its competitor Baku Baku Animal. In Japan, Game Machine listed Magical Drop II on their May 1, 1996 issue as being the fifth most-successful arcade game of the year. Next Generation gave the Neo Geo AES version of Magical Drop II three out of five stars, saying that it becomes monotonous after a while, but is overall solid and reasonably addictive. He found the game's most distinctive quality was its accelerated pace, remarking that, \\"You don't have to be as precise as [in] some puzzle games, but there is no time to think, just time to do.\\" Reviewing the Nintendo Switch release, Nintendo Life called it \\"a true classic, and a must-play for puzzle game fans.\\" Similarly to Next Generation, the reviewer said that the game is defined by how it rewards fast reflexes rather than strategy, particularly noting that there is no need to plan out combos as in most games of its type, a variation which he found \\"nothing short of exhilarating.\\" Additionally praising the colorful atmosphere and presentation, catchy music, engaging multiplayer, and ideal use of the Joycon controller, he gave it 8 out of 10 stars. In Japan, Game Machine listed Magical Drop III on their April 1, 1997 issue as being the third most-successful arcade game of the year. Engadget and Destructoid gave Magical Drop V mixed-to-negative reviews, citing numerous glitches, lack of series-staple features and mechanics, and an incredibly poor translation. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1995 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Data East video games Category:Marvelous Entertainment franchises Category:Game Boy Color games Category:Mobile games Category:Neo Geo CD games Category:Neo Geo Pocket Color games Category:Neo Geo games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:SNK franchises Category:SNK games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video game franchises Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble Category:Virtual Console games Category:WonderSwan games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Data East arcade games ","title":"Magical Drop"},{"id":"834413","text":"Francesco Fontana (, Naples - July 1656, Naples) was an Italian lawyer and an astronomer. Francesco Fontana studied law at the University of Naples and then he became a lawyer in the court at the Castel Capuano. But failing to always find truth in the Court, he began to study mathematics and astronomy. He created woodcuts showing the Moon and the planets as he saw them through a self-constructed telescope. Fontana traced, in 1636, the first drawing of Mars and discovered its rotation. In February 1646 he published the book Novae coelestium terrestriumq[ue] rerum observationes, et fortasse hactenus non vulgatae, where he presented all the observations of the Moon made from 1629 until 1645, the drawings of the bands seen on Jupiter's disc, the strange appearances of Saturn, as well as of the stars of the Milky Way. With a Fontana's telescope, the Jesuit Giovanni Battista Zupi observed for the first time in 1630 the horizontal bands on the atmosphere of Jupiter and in 1639 the phases of Mercury, an evidence, together with the phases of Venus observed by Galileo in 1610, that the Copernicus's heliocentric theory was correct. In 1645, he claimed to have observed a satellite of Venus (Paul Stroobant demonstrated in 1887 that all similar observations were not related to a putative satellite of Venus). He died of plague in Naples with the whole family in July 1656. The lunar crater Fontana and the crater Fontana on Mars are named in his honor. Note: See Donato Creti for paintings of planets from the next century. ==Microscope== Fontana also claimed to have invented the compound microscope (two or more lenses in a tube) in 1618, an invention that has many claimants including Cornelis Drebbel, Zacharias Jansen or his father Hans Martens, and Galileo Galilei.A Practical treatise on the use of the microscope by John Thomas Quekett ==References== * Francesco Stelluti, Persio tradotto..., Roma 1630, p. 47; * Athanasius Kircher, Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae, Romae 1646, pp. 16, 831; * Giovanni Battista Riccioli, Almagestum novum, Bononiae 1651, pp. 203, 208, 485 ss.; * Lorenzo Crasso, Elogii de gli huomini letterati, II, Venezia 1666, pp. 296-300; * Christiaan Huygens, Oeuvres compl√©tes, I, La Haye 1888, ad Indicem; * Edizione nazionale delle opere di Galileo Galilei, XVII, pp. 192, 308, 363, 375, 383 s.; XVIII, pp. 18, 85; XX, p. 442; * Il carteggio linceo della vecchia Accademia di Federico Cesi, a cura di Giuseppe Gabrieli, in Memorie della Reale Accademia nazionale dei Lincei, classe di scienze morali storiche e filologiche, s. 6, VII (1942), pp. 1008, 1124, 1127, 1131, 1144 s., 1205; * Le opere dei discepoli di Galileo Galilei.

Shortly after, the family moved to Missouri and eventually settled in Columbia. Following his father's death in 1830, Hardin worked in the family's tannery business. Hardin began his secondary education in 1837 at the Indiana University Bloomington. He transferred to Miami University in 1839 and graduated in 1841. During his time at Miami University, he helped to found Beta Theta Pi fraternity. Following graduation, he studied law with James M. Gordon in Columbia, MO, passed the bar, and opened a practice in Fulton, Missouri in 1843. Hardin married Mary Bar Jenkins in 1844. He began public service in 1848 as an attorney for the Second Judicial Circuit, and then served in the Missouri House of Representatives. In 1860, he was elected to the Missouri Senate. As state senator, he attended Claiborne Fox Jackson's secessionist meeting in Neosho, Missouri, and was the only senator present to vote against secession. During the war, he returned to the family farm in Audrain County, Missouri. Hardin and his family moved to Mexico, Missouri, where he established a new law practice and co-founded Mexico Southern Bank, following the close of the war. In 1872, Hardin was again voted to the state senate. He served as 22nd Governor of Missouri between 1875 and 1877. During his term, Hardin reduced Missouri's debt from the Civil War and state funding for railroad expansion by ending wasteful practices and refinancing bonds. He was a Democrat. Hardin was a founder and board chair of Hardin College. He died in 1892 in Mexico, Missouri. He was initially buried in a private graveyard in Audrain County, Missouri, but was later re-buried at the Jewell family cemetery in Columbia, Missouri. Charles H.

He is best known for being \\"the voice of the Pittsburgh Steelers\\". Cope was a color commentator for the Steelers' radio broadcasts for 35 years. He was known for his distinctive, higher-pitched nasally voice with an identifiable Pittsburgh accent, idiosyncratic speech pattern, and a level of excitement rarely exhibited in the broadcast booth. Cope's most notable catch phrase was \\"yoi\\" . Cope was the first football announcer inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame. Cope's autobiography, Double Yoi!, was published in 2002. == Education and career == Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Jewish parents of Lithuanian ancestry, Cope graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School in 1947 and was inducted into their alumni hall of fame in 2009. He also graduated from the University of Pittsburgh. He was originally a journalist before becoming a broadcaster. His first job was in Erie, Pennsylvania, with the Daily Times, and by the summer of 1951, he was working for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Cope then became a freelance journalist, most notably for Sports Illustrated, the Saturday Evening Post, and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. In 1963, Cope received the E.P. Dutton Prize for \\"Best Magazine Sportswriting in the Nation\\", for a portrayal of Cassius Clay. Cope spent the 1983 college football season as a color analyst for the Pittsburgh Panthers. In 1987, he was named by the Hearst Corporation as a noted literary achiever, along with Mark Twain, Jack London, Frederic Remington, Walter Winchell, and Sidney Sheldon. At its 50th Anniversary, Sports Illustrated selected Cope's profile of Howard Cosell as one of the 50 best written works ever published in the magazine. == Family life == Cope married Mildred Lindberg of Charleston in 1965, and the couple moved to Mt. Lebanon. In 1972, the Copes moved to nearby Upper St. Clair. Mildred died on September 20, 1994. In 1999, Cope moved back to Mt. Lebanon, to a condo in the Woodridge neighborhood. He remained there until his final days, when he entered a Mt. Lebanon nursing home. Cope had three children, Elizabeth, Martha Ann, and Daniel. Martha Ann died shortly after her birth. His son, Daniel, was born with severe autism; he has lived most of his life at the Allegheny Valley School, an institution specializing in intellectual developmental disabilities. Cope devoted much of his time and energy to Pittsburgh causes addressing autism, and spoke candidly about his experiences as the parent of a child with autism and his efforts to better educate the public at large about autism. == Steelers broadcasting == Cope waves a Terrible Towel at Heinz Field ‚Äì October 31, 2005 In 1968, Cope began doing daily sports commentaries on what was then WTAE-AM radio in Pittsburgh. He then took over a nightly talk show on the station in 1973. His unique nasal voice, with a distinctive Pittsburgh area accent, was noticed by the Steelers' brass, and he made his debut as a member of the Steelers' radio team in 1970. During Cope's 35-year broadcasting career with the Steelers‚Äîthe longest term with a single team in NFL history‚Äîhe was accompanied by only two play-by-play announcers: Jack Fleming, with whom he broadcast until 1994, and Bill Hillgrove. In keeping with his comic personality, a series of television commentaries on WTAE-TV saw Cope calling himself \\"Doctor Cope\\" and wearing a white lab coat while pretending to examine the opposing team's strengths and weaknesses. His predictor was known as the \\"Cope-ra-scope.\\" === Catchphrases and nicknames === Like other sports announcers in Pittsburgh, particularly Penguins commentator Mike Lange and the late Pirates announcer Bob Prince, Cope had a repertoire of unique catchphrases employed in his broadcasts, such as \\"Mmm-Hah!\\" (when he loses his train of thought, or forgets a player's name) and \\"Okel Dokel\\" (his version of \\"okey dokey\\"). Cope often used Yiddish expressions, especially \\"Feh!\\" and \\"Yoi!\\" (sometimes multiplied as \\"Double Yoi\\" or rarely \\"Triple Yoi\\"). Cope also created nicknames for many players and opposing teams. It was Cope who popularized \\"The Bus\\" as a nickname for former Steelers running back Jerome Bettis, \\"Jack Splat\\" for Jack Lambert, and he gave Kordell Stewart the nickname \\"Slash.\\" Cope also used the term \\"Cincinnati Bungles\\" to describe their division rivals, known during the 1990s for a string of bad seasons and numerous draft busts. == Terrible Towel == Cope played a large role in the invention of the Terrible Towel. Needing a way to excite the fans during a 1975 playoff game against the Baltimore Colts, Cope urged fans to take yellow dish towels to the game and wave them throughout. Originally, Cope wanted to sell rubber Jack Lambert masks, but realizing the high costs for the masks, opted for the inexpensive option for the Terrible Towel. The Terrible Towel has gained much popularity since its invention and \\"is arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team\\". The catchphrase is: \\"The Terrible Towel is poised to strike, and so are The Steelers.\\" In 1996, Cope gave the rights to The Terrible Towel to the Allegheny Valley School in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania. The school provides care for more than 900 people with intellectual disabilities and physical disabilities, including Cope's son who has severe autism. Proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise $3 million for the school. == Retirement and death == A special edition of \\"The Terrible Towel\\" was created in honor of Cope's retirement following the 2005 Steelers' season. Cope announced his retirement from broadcasting on June 20, 2005, citing health concerns. Eight days later, it was announced that Cope was the recipient of the Pete Rozelle Award for \\"long-time exceptional contributions to radio and television in professional football.\\" Upon his retirement, the Steelers did not replace Cope, opting instead to downsize to a two-man broadcast team. On October 31, 2005, Cope was honored for his lifetime accomplishments at halftime of the contest between the Steelers and the Ravens. In addition, the Steelers produced a special commemorative edition Terrible Towel with his familiar expressions printed on it. As seen on the towel, production was limited to 35,000 towels, representing 35 years of service to the Steelers. Later that season when the team advanced to Super Bowl XL, many Steelers fans wanted Cope to come out of retirement just to call \\"The one for the thumb.\\" Cope declined partially for health reasons and partially to enjoy retirement. Cope died of respiratory failure at a Mt. Lebanon nursing home on the morning of February 27, 2008. In the days following his death, many ceremonies were held in his honor, including the local sporting events of the Pittsburgh Panthers college basketball team. Two days after his death, hundreds of people gathered in heavy snow in front of the Pittsburgh City Hall to honor Cope; included in the ceremony was one minute of silent Terrible Towel waving. His funeral, which was held on February 29, 2008, was private. Due to Cope's large impact on the Pittsburgh area, Bob Smizik, a local sportswriter wrote, == List of awards and honors == Cope received many awards and honors, including: * 1963 ‚Äì E.P.

He worked at the Pic du Midi Observatory, investigating the surface features of Mars using visual and photographic techniques. A crater on the moon and a crater on Mars were named after him. Focas was born in Corfu on July 20, 1909 and he was interested in astronomy since adolescence. Being very skilful in painting, the young Fokas designed wonderful sketches of the planets and the Moon. Appreciating the work, astronomer Stavros Plakidis proposed to the then director of the National Observatory of Athens Prof D. Eginitis to hire Focas at the Observatory in 1931. There, under the guidance of Eginitis and later Prof. Plakidis he acquired basic knowledge and experience in scientific observations, and made thousands of observations of sunspots, variable stars and comets. He also realized the value of long-term continuous observations of a target. Although he did not have a formal university education, the zeal, the willingness and proficiency in five European languages helped to fill the gaps in his education and established himself in the field of planetary astronomy. When Focas learned that the Observatory of the Peak du Midi had installed a special 60 cm telescope for observing planets, he managed to obtain permission to observe this opposition of Mars in 1954. These observations established him internationally as a planetary astronomer. Returning to Athens, he brought with him new methods and techniques learned in France, photography, photometry, polarimetry and micrometric observations planets. He established a collaborative project between the National Observatory of Athens and Paris-Meudon Observatories, under which Focas visited France every year for observations. He dedicated more than 300 nights to measure the polarization of light in different areas of the Martian surface. Indeed, the last work of his life, published posthumously, was a comprehensive memorandum on the Martian polarimetry. In 1961, he was awarded a PhD from the University of Paris for a thesis entitled \\"√âtude photom√©trique et polarim√©trique des ph√©nom√®nes saisonniers de la planete Mars\\". (No advisor is mentioned in his thesis. However the committee consisted of: Andre Luis Danjon, Pr√©sident - Maurice Fran√ßon and √âvry Schatzman, Examinateurs). In 1960 Focas, using the Newall refractor at Penteli, observed a large white spot on Saturn's atmosphere and studied its evolution. In 1964 he visited the Lowell Observatory in Arizona to assess the huge collection of photographic plates assembled by Earl C. Slipher since 1907. As to the planet Jupiter, Fokas devised a novel factor for the expression of atmospheric activity. At the end of the same year, he resigned from his position at the Athens Observatory to work at the IAU planetary observations collection center at the Observatory of Paris-Meudon. In his new position, having at its disposal more than 14,000 photos, he continues publishing and pursuing his own observations from Pic du Midi and Meudon. In Meudon, the completion by John Fokas cartographic work of planet Mars, commenced by Eugene Antoniadis, with the additional use of photographic and photometric techniques, influenced IAU in adopting the nomenclature system of Antoniades for the planet, making the official names of all almost all major areas of being Greek. Focas died on January 3, 1969, at the age of 60 from a heart attack while in Greece, where he was visiting for the holidays. Named after him was the crater Fokas (Focas) in the southern hemisphere of the Moon, with a diameter of 22 km, as well as the crater Fokas (Focas) in the northern hemisphere of Mars with a diameter of 76,5 km. ==References== Category:1909 births Category:1969 deaths Category:Greek astronomers Category:French astronomers Category:20th-century astronomers Category:French people of Greek descent ","title":"Jean Focas"},{"id":"834437","text":"Josef Ganz, 1946 Dipl.-Ing. Josef Ganz (1 July 1898 ‚Äì 26 July 1967) was a German car designer born in Budapest, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Hungary). ==Early years== Josef Ganz was born on 1 July 1898 into a Jewish family living in Budapest, then the second-largest city within Austria-Hungary. His mother was Maria T√∂r√∂k (1872‚Äì1926) from Hungary. His father was Hugo Markus Ganz (1862‚Äì1922) from Mainz in Germany who worked as a political and literary writer and journalist for the Frankfurter Zeitung. At an early age, Josef Ganz was fascinated by technology. After moving from Budapest to Vienna, the family moved to Frankfurt am Main in Germany in 1916 and took on German nationality. In July 1916, Ganz voluntarily enlisted in the German army and fought in the German navy during the First World War. After the war, in 1918, Josef Ganz resumed his mechanical engineering studies at the Technische Hochschule Wien. After three semesters, he switched to the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt.https://www.tu- darmstadt.de/media/daa_responsives_design/01_die_universitaet_medien/aktuelles_6/publikationen_km/hoch3/pdf/web- hoch3-2017-4.pdf He completed his studies in 1927. During this period, he became inspired with the idea of building a small car for the price of a motorcycle. Josef Ganz in the Ardie-Ganz prototype, 1930 Josef Ganz in the Maik√§fer prototype, 1931 First model of the Standard Superior, 1933 Second model of the Standard Superior, 1934 Brochure for the Standard Superior, 1934 ==Prototypes and the Standard Superior== In 1923, as a young mechanical engineering student, Ganz made his first auto sketches for a car for the masses. This was a small lightweight car along the lines of the Rumpler Tropfenwagen with a mid-mounted engine, independent wheel suspension, swing- axles and an aerodynamic body. Lacking the money to build a prototype, he began publishing articles on progressive car design in various magazines and, shortly after his graduation in 1927, he was assigned as the new editor-in- chief of Klein-Motor-Sport. Josef Ganz used this magazine as a platform to criticize heavy, unsafe and old-fashioned cars and promote innovative design and his concept of a car for Germany's general population. The magazine gained in reputation and influence and, in January 1929, was renamed Motor-Kritik. Contributors to the magazine included B√©la Bar√©nyi, a young engineering student who designed cars with similar design. Post-war Volkswagen director Heinrich Nordhoff later said \\"Josef Ganz in Motor-Kritik attacked the old and well-established auto companies with biting irony and with the ardent conviction of a missionary.\\"\\"'A Revelation of a Secret Love'\\", LIFE International, page 73, October 24, 1960. Companies in turn fought against Motor-Kritik with lawsuits, slander campaigns and an advertising boycott. Publicity for the magazine and Josef Ganz increased. In 1929, Josef Ganz started contacting German motorcycle manufacturers Z√ºndapp, Ardie and DKW for collaboration to build a prototype, small people's car. This resulted in a first prototype, the Ardie-Ganz, built at Ardie in 1930 and a second one completed at Adler in May 1931, which was nicknamed the Maik√§fer (‚ÄòMay- Beetle‚Äô, common European cockchafer Melolontha melolontha). News about the prototypes spread through the industry. At Adler, Josef Ganz was assigned as a consultant engineer at Daimler-Benz and BMW where he was involved in the development of the first models with independent wheel suspension: the Mercedes-Benz 170 and BMW AM1 (Automobilkonstruktion M√ºnchen 1). The first company to build a car according to the many patents of Josef Ganz was the Standard Fahrzeugfabrik, which introduced its Standard Superior model at the IAMA (Internationale Auto- und Motorradausstellung) in Berlin in February 1933. It featured a tubular chassis, a mid-mounted engine, and independent wheel suspension with swing-axles at the rear. Here the new Chancellor Adolf Hitler expressed interest in its design and low selling price of 1,590 Reichsmark. Under the new anti-Semitic government, however, Josef Ganz was a target for his enemies from the automotive industry that opposed his writings in Motor-Kritik. ==Influence on Porsche== Porsche Typ 12, 1931/32 by Z√ºndapp N√ºrnberg After news about the results achieved with the Ardie-Ganz and Adler Maik√§fer prototypes reached Z√ºndapp, the company turned to Ferdinand Porsche in September 1931 to develop an \\"Auto f√ºr Jedermann\\"‚Äîa \\"car for everyman\\".Z√ºndapp, Volkswagen Entwicklung 1932 ‚Äì Entwurf Porsche, Stuttgart, 5-Zylinder-Sternmotor (PDF) Porsche already preferred the flat-4 cylinder engine, as was also tried out by Daimler-Benz under supervision of Josef Ganz almost a year previous, but Z√ºndapp preferred a watercooled 5-cylinder radial engine. In 1932, three prototypes were running.TheSamba.com :: Gallery Search All of those cars were lost during the war, the last in a bombing raid over Stuttgart in 1945. The influence of Ganz on the design of the Volkswagen Beetle is a matter of dispute. ==Arrest== Josef Ganz himself was arrested by the Gestapo in May 1933 based on falsified charges of blackmail of the automotive industry. He was eventually released. He fled Germany in June 1934 ‚Äì the month Adolf Hitler assigned Ferdinand Porsche to design a mass- producible auto for a consumer price of 1,000 Reichsmark.\\"Der Fall Ganz: Wie der VW K√§fer wirklich entstand\\", Technology Review (German edition), November 2005. After a short period in Liechtenstein, Josef Ganz settled in Switzerland where with government support he started a Swiss auto project. In Germany production of the Standard Superior and the Bungartz Butz ended. The first prototypes of the Swiss auto were constructed in 1937 and 1938 and plans were formed for mass-production inside a new factory. After the start of World War II, however, Ganz was again under threat from the Gestapo and Swiss government officials who claimed the Swiss auto project as their own. After the war, a small number of Swiss auto were built by the Rapid car company. Ganz took the Swiss to court. After five years of court battles, Ganz left Switzerland in 1949 and settled in France. Here he worked on a new small car, but could no longer compete with the Volkswagen. In 1951 Josef Ganz emigrated to Australia.Ganz, Josef - Migration and naturalisation, 1951-1968, National Archives of Australia, MP1194/1, V1961/21998 For some years he worked there for General Motors ‚Äì Holden, but suffered ill health after a series of heart attacks in the early 1960s. In 1965 the Federal Republic of Germany sought Australian Government permission to bestow on Josef Ganz the Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. However under regulations existing at that time in relation to foreign awards to Australian citizens, the request was denied.Decorations and awards - Germany - Ganz, Josef, National Archives of Australia, A1838, 1535/25/17 Josef Ganz died in obscurity in Australia, residing at Edgewater Towers, St Kilda, Melbourne. ==Literature== * Paul Schilperoord, The Extraordinary Life of Josef Ganz: The Jewish Engineer Behind Hitler's Volkswagen, RVP Publishers, New York 2011, ==External links== *Joseph Ganz Archive *Joseph Ganz Foundation *https://web.archive.org/web/20081016055947/http://www.schouwer- online.de/technik/bungartz.htm *http://www.bungartz.nl/hist-bungartz.html *BMW Car Designers Josef Ganz in the overview of automotive designers working for BMW. *Ganz: How I Lost My Beetle - documentary ==Notes== Category:1899 births Category:1967 deaths Category:Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to Switzerland Category:German automotive pioneers Category:German automobile designers Category:German automotive engineers Category:German journalists Category:German male journalists Category:German male writers Category:Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt alumni Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Josef Ganz"},{"id":"834440","text":"Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque ( / , ) is a mosque in the city of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Built in the 16th century, it is the largest historical mosque in Bosnia and Herzegovina and one of the most representative Ottoman structures in the Balkans. Being the central Sarajevo's mosque since the days of its construction, today it also serves as the main congregational mosque of the Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is located in the Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija neighborhood in the Stari Grad municipality and, being one of the main architectural monuments in the town, is regularly visited by tourists. ==History== The Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque was built in 937 AH (1530/1531 AD) as the central object of the Beg's endowment, which also included a maktab and a madrasa (Islamic primary and secondary schools), a bezistan (vaulted marketplace), a hammam (public bathplace) etc. The foundation of this waqf by the contemporary Ottoman governor of Bosnia had a crucial point in the development of the town. The architect's name is unknown, but after some speculations, which even included famous Mimar Sinan as an option, most scholars agreed that Acem Esir Ali \\"Ala√ºddin\\", Ottoman mimar of Persian ancestry, is the most probable builder. It is still possible that Sinan himself did inspect the work on the spot, since he was in the region at the time. Historical documents testify that Ragusan masons, requested from their government by Gazi Husrev-beg, participated in the building process. Gazi Husrev-bey Mosque was the first mosque in the world to receive electricity and electric illumination in 1898 during the period of Austro-Hungarian Empire.Izvor: Dnevni avaz, br. 4297, godina XII, nedjelja, 9.9.2007., Panorama, str. 14 ==Architecture== Call to prayer. Note the Arabic numerals on the Ottoman-era clock tower. The mosque belongs to the type of complex-spaced, multi-domed mosques and it is a represent of the Early Period of Classical Ottoman Architecture (sometimes referred to as Early Istanbul Style). The central rectangular space, framed by high walls and covered with a dome resting on pendentives, represents the spine of the structure, while lower extensions lean to it and expand the volume of the interior space. The Kibla side of the mosque is extended with a rectangular space which is covered by a semi-dome resting on two highly developed muqarnas structures. They stand in function of pendentives, reducing the rectangular outline of the ground level to the near semi-circle shape in level of the semi-dome. This area houses central architectural elements with religious purposes: mihrab, minbar and kursi and, being open to the central space with a huge arch, represents the focal point of the mosque. Two smaller spaces, called tetime (sg. tetima) are located on the left and right sides of the central space, placed furthest from the Kibla side. They are covered by two lower domes resting on pendentives. The exterior is dominated by the main dome, topped out only by a simple, yet monumental minaret. The entry side is marked with a portico resting on four wide columns and covered with little domes, only the central one, above the portal, being a bit greater than others, and resting on muqarnas-adorned pendentives, in contrast to others which are laid on simple, plain-surfaced pendentives. The monumental portal is richly decorated with muqarnas, as well as columns' capitels. In his legacy, he stated: \\"Good deeds drive away evil, and one of the most worthy of good deeds is the act of charity, and the most worthy act of charity is one which lasts forever. Of all charitable deeds, the most beautiful is one that continually renews itself.\\" === Destruction and reconstruction === During the Siege of Sarajevo, Serbian forces purposely targeted many centers of the city's culture, such as museums, libraries, and mosques, and fired on them generally.

The old and faded layer of Austro-Hungarian decoration was removed and, since remains of older, historical layers of decorative painting weren't found, a completely new interior was designed and applied by Bosnian calligrapher Hazim Numanagiƒá in 2001/2002. Austro-Hungarian decoration, performed mostly in pseudo-Moorish style, remains only on the portal of the Mosque today. ==Gallery== File:Sarajevo Begova Mosque 1900.jpgMosque in 1900 File:Sarajevo Gazi Husrev Beg Moschee 5.JPGThe entrance File:Sarajevo Gazi Husrev Beg.JPGEast side of the mosque File:Mosqu√©e Gazi Husrev Begova √† Sarajevo.jpgView from the market File:Sarajevo Gazi Husrev Beg Moschee 1.JPGThe fountain in the courtyard of the mosque File:Begova Dzamija.jpgGazi Husrev bey mosque File:Call to prayer (close up Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque).JPGCall to prayer (close up Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque) == See also == *Timeline of Islamic history *Islamic architecture *Islamic art *List of mosques == References == == External links == * Gazi Husrev-Beg Mosque - location and informations * Gazi Husrev-Beg Mosque - Sarajevo * Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1531 Category:Mosques in Sarajevo Category:Stari Grad, Sarajevo Category:Ottoman mosques in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:16th-century mosques Category:Rebuilt buildings and structures in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:National Monuments of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:1531 establishments in the Ottoman Empire Category:Attacks on religious buildings and structures during the Bosnian War Category:Tourist attractions in Sarajevo ","title":"Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque"},{"id":"834465","text":"Ferdinand de la Cerda (23 October 1255 - 1275) was the heir apparent to the Crown of Castile as the eldest son of Alfonso X and Violant of Aragon.
