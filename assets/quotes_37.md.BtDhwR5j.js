He was born in the village of Acequ√≠as, Granada on the edge of the Sierra Nevada. == Biography == Cazador met the poet Federico Garc√≠a Lorca at the Residencia de Estudiantes in Madrid in 1919. Lorca, who was born in Fuente Vaqueros, saw a kindred spirit in his fellow Granadino.Ian Gibson, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca: A Life, , p. 93 The two developed a close relationship driven by their shared love of the poetry of Jos√© Hern√°ndez, in particular the gauchesco epic Mart√≠n Fierro.Ian Gibson, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca: A Life, , p. 112 Cazador's own poetry was admittedly influenced by Hernandez, reflected in his reappropriation of the Argentine 'payada'. As a poet of the Generation of '27, his work has been critically overlooked because of its overreliance on bucolic imagery and use of blank verse.Pedro Salinas, Reality and the Poet in Spanish Poetry, 1940, p. 149 Nonetheless, his later work has attracted much attention in recent years and Steve Jones-Broule & Dr Susana Bay√≥ Belenguer of Trinity College Dublin's Department of Hispanic Studies are currently working on a forthcoming anthology of Cazador's work.https://www.tcd.ie/Hispanic_Studies/news/Jones- Broule_Bayo-Belenguer_CazadorPressReleasehttp://trinityjolt.com/wp- content/uploads/2015/06/JOLT-2015.pdf , p.36 During his lifetime, he travelled extensively around the Iberian Peninsula, spending many of his later summers in the Sintra region of Portugal. He became well acquainted with the son of Carvalho Monteiro, the visionary and owner behind the Quinta da Regaleira estate and was known to spend hours gazing at the Waterfall Lake.Malcolm Jack, Sintra : A Glorious Eden, 2002, p. 39 == Political beliefs == Cazador's political beliefs were firmly rooted in the libertarian socialism school of political philosophy, and were inspired by the works of Rudolf Rocker, Pierre- Joseph Proudhon and Errico Malatesta in particular.Christopher Gudgeon, The Fifth Column Inch, (OUP, London: 2001), p. 191 These beliefs are especially identifiable in Cazador's Pastorales (I-XXI) in which he poignantly describes the small and semi-autonomous communities of the Sierra Nevada. Cazador's political convictions led him to become a firm proponent of the right to self- determination. Writing in the periodical Solidaridad Obrera on 29 February 1919, he said: I support Ireland's right to be a sovereign and independent nation, freed from the shackles of British imperialism. The subjugation, hardship, and imposition of Protestant culture upon Ireland over the course of the last five centuries must cease.Christopher Gudgeon, The Fifth Column Inch, (OUP, London: 2001), p. 215 == Poetry == * Pastorales (I-XXI) * La incandescencia de la luci√©rnaga com√∫n y otras poemas * Super Bock == Death == Cazador died on June 4, 1956 while hunting ibex on the outskirts of the village of Ronda, M√°laga. He is buried in the nearby town of Zahara de la Sierra. According to Gibson, his blood was collected in a container by his son and brought back to his hometown of Acequ√≠as, to be poured onto the earth outside his house.Ian Gibson, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca: A Life, , pp. 112-3 == See also == Nominative determinism == References  Sources == *D√°maso Alonso, Poetas Espa√±oles Contempor√°neos, (Biblioteca Rom√°nica Hisp√°nic - Editorial Gredos, Madrid: 1952) *Federico Bonaddio, A Companion to Garc√≠a Lorca, (Monograf√≠as A), (Woodbridge, Tamesis: 2007) *Ian Gibson, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca: A Life, (Faber and Faber, London: 1990) *Christopher Gudgeon, The Fifth Column Inch, (OUP, London: 2001) *Malcolm Jack, Sintra: A Glorious Eden, (Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon: 2002) Category:1899 births Category:1956 deaths Category:Spanish male poets Category:20th-century Spanish poets Category:20th-century Spanish male writers ","title":"Juan Cazador"},{"id":"46332057","text":"Johnny S√¶ther is a Norwegian former professional racing cyclist.

BAI Communications, 15 July 1998. ==Development== Julian was known as a motorcycle speedway racer. He decided to design his own autogyro and on 4 November 1991 the CAA issued the Wombat a restricted Permit to Test. It was test flown at the St Merryn airfield in Cornwall. In May 1997, when Julian was 60 years old, he was killed in the crash of a different model gyroglider at the Kemble airfield. After Julian's death the Wombat design rights passed to former helicopter pilot Mark Harrisson in July 2000. Harrisson had intended to put the aircraft back into production, but in 2013 instead donated the prototype to The Helicopter Museum in Weston-super-Mare, where it arrived on 9 July 2013. ==Design== The Wombat was designed to comply with the British Amateur-built aircraft rules. It features a single main rotor, a single-seat semi-enclosed cockpit with a cockpit fairing and windshield, tricycle landing gear, plus a tail caster and a twin cylinder, air-cooled, two-stroke, single-ignition Rotax 532 engine in pusher configuration. The aircraft fuselage is made from bolted-together aluminum tubing. Its two-bladed Dragon Wings aluminium rotor has a diameter of , including a hub bar. Rotor cyclic control is via torque-tubes.

Feldman (October 4, 1922 - February 17, 2014) was a civil rights activist and longtime educator from the U.S. state of Illinois. Feldman taught at the University of Tulsa for thirty-seven years and lectured across the United States and internationally. Feldman was inducted to the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame in 1995. Her advocating for the expansion of art education in Tulsa public schools remains one of her biggest legacies. Feldman and her husband traveled to some of the most remote locations in the world during their retirement and worked to connect Tulsa with the world through the Tulsa Global Alliance. ==Early life== Nancy G. Feldman grew up in Highland Park, IL, a suburb of Chicago. She had one younger brother and one older sister. Her parents moved to Highland Park with several of their college friends, providing a tight-knit community of family friends in which Nancy was raised. Her parents did well financially and sent Feldman to Elm Place Grammar School, a school in which you learned through tactile activities. Feldman was raised Jewish, though she had a broad exposure to many religions and ethnic backgrounds. Her parents were very influential in her education and strongly encouraged her to attend an eastern women's college. Outside of school, Feldman was involved with the Girl Scouts and athletics. She was an accomplished diver and trained for the Olympics until she broke her back at age 16 in 1939. This unfortunate accident refocused Feldman's efforts into becoming a scholar rather than an athlete. Education Feldman took classes at Northwestern University while still in high school. Although she was accepted to all of the schools she applied to, Feldman ultimately decided to attend Vassar College. She initially started out majoring in music but later changed. Feldman attended Vassar for two years and briefly transferred back to Northwestern. After a discussion with her lawyer brother-in-law, Feldman applied and was accepted to the University of Chicago Law School. She graduated with her Juris Doctor in the spring of 1946 as the top woman of her class. While at the University of Chicago, Feldman met her husband, Raymond Feldman, a native Oklahoman from Tulsa. Before marrying, Nancy traveled to Tulsa with Raymond and was horrified by the racial segregation at work. Raymond proposed that she \\"marry [him] and change it.\\" The two married in March 1946 and moved to Tulsa. ==Career== At the time when Feldman moved to Tulsa, female lawyers were not readily hired. She easily changed her path and became a professor of sociology at the University of Tulsa, where she taught for 37 years. Feldman was extended invitations to lecture in England, India, Egypt, Israel, Peru and around the United States. Feldman was a dedicated educator, as well as a mother and wife at the time. Feldman was chosen by Oklahoma State University to work for five years in a \\"Professors of the City\\" program, which helped to create the Model Cities Plan for economic and educational development in Tulsa. While at the University of Tulsa, Feldman co-authored an article that gained the attention of the National Space Institute, who were looking for a humanist to add to their board. Feldman was chosen for the position and served 9 years on its Board and Executive Committee. Feldman championed many causes in her active life. The five main beneficiaries of Feldman's energy include Family and Children's Services, local and national Planned Parenthood, Community Service Council, local, national and international Girl Scouts, and the Arts and Humanities Council. She was instrumental in the expansion of art education in Tulsa schools. Feldman was strongly opposed to the current segregation in Tulsa and did everything she could to work toward racial equality. She volunteered herself in several sit-ins at what is now Wild Fork and became a member of NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People). Feldman successfully lobbied for the first black student to be admitted to Holland Hall, the school her children attended at the time. Not only was she a champion of race rights, but she was an advocate of all civil equality. She was the state chairperson of the Commission on the Status of Women, the Oklahoma Civil Liberties Commission, and applied herself in the effort to get the ERA (Equal Rights Amendment) passed in 1972. She also founded the Tulsa Center for the Physically Limited and the International Council of Tulsa, later known as the Tulsa Global Alliance. Feldman was the first woman president of a major Tulsa arts organization. As the president of the Tulsa Ballet, she wrote the first set of bylaws for the organization that helped it expand from a local company to a company of international acclaim. ==Retirement== In retirement, Feldman and her husband traveled around the world and completed seven Himalayan treks. The couple's travels to some of the most remote parts of the world have become a legend in Tulsa. Feldman is quoted as saying that Nepal is one her favorite locations that she and Raymond visited in their extensive travels. Feldman died in 2014 due to the complications of cancer.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. ==Architecture and history== The library is set at the southeast corner of Old Point Avenue and Pleasant Street, near the center of the main village of Madison. It is a single-story structure built of brick and stone, with Classical Revival features. The building is roughly triangular in shape, with two rectangular sections joined by an angled main facade that faces the street corner. The rectangular sections have standing-seam metal hip roofs, interrupted at the center by an octagonal tower, whose front-facing sections have diamond-pane windows, and which is encircled by a band of decorative brick corbelling. The front facade has a recessed entry section with stone columns and brick pilasters flanking, and a band of corbelled brickwork below a stone balustrade. The interior of the building is arranged with reading rooms and stacks in the rectangular side wings. The Madison Public Library was founded in 1886, and was housed in commercial spaces until this building was built in 1906, supported in part by an $8,000 grant from Andrew Carnegie. Designed by the local firm of Snow and Humphreys, its tower and angled wings are distinctive features not seen in other libraries throughout the state. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Somerset County, Maine *List of Carnegie libraries in Maine ==References *Madison Public Library web site Category:Libraries on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Neoclassical architecture in Maine Category:Library buildings completed in 1906 Category:Libraries in Somerset County, Maine Category:Carnegie libraries in Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Somerset County, Maine Category:Libraries established in 1906 Category:1906 establishments in Maine ","title":"Madison Public Library (Madison, Maine)"},{"id":"46332502","text":"Ko Yu-ting (; born 18 January 1994) is a Taiwanese football player. ==International career== International goals :Scores and results list Chinese Taipei's goal tally first. {  style=\\"font- size:100%;\\" !

It belongs to the Diocese of Lund. ==History and architecture== The presently visible stone church was built at the end of the 12th century, but preceded by two stave churches on the same location. The remains of these were discovered during a renovation of the church in 1960. The oldest part of the presently visible church is the nave. The round tower was built slightly later than the rest of the church. Hammarlunda Church is one of only four churches in the province of Scania with such a round tower, the others being Bollerup, Blentarp and Hammarl√∂v. The shape of the tower indicates that it originally also served a defensive purpose. Under the base of the tower, the graves of a man in his fifties, a woman and a child were found during a renovation in 1965. These graves are possibly those of the family of the founder of the church. The church is Romanesque in style, and largely unchanged since the Middle Ages. In the 1880s, plans were made to enlarge the church but the congregation failed to raise enough money to execute the plans. It has a rectangular nave, a shorter and lower choir and an apse. Several of the church fittings are original, and among these the baptismal font is the oldest. It dates from the time of the church's construction and is made of sandstone. The church has two chalices, one carved from oak wood and one made of silver and donated to the church in 1820 by Jacob De la Gardie, owner of nearby L√∂ber√∂d Castle. All the church silver was stolen in 1808, and as a new chalice was only given to the church by De la Gardie in 1820, the wooden chalice was used until then. The church has two bells, made in 1898 and 1924 respectively but replacing two older church bells, one of which is today on display at the Lund University Historical Museum in Lund. Before the Reformation, the church was dedicated to Saint Anne and a local pilgrimage site. ==References * Category:Churches in Sk√•ne County Category:Churches in the Diocese of Lund Category:Churches converted from the Roman Catholic Church to the Church of Sweden ","title":"Hammarlunda Church"},{"id":"46332560","text":"Basil Soda (c. 1967 ‚Äì March 30, 2015) was a Lebanese fashion designer based in Beirut.

The songs were later presented in 33 1/3 rpm and 45 rpm sets, respectively. This set featured many of Bing's great hits such as: Silver Threads Among the Gold and Now Is the Hour. ==Background== Bing Crosby had enjoyed unprecedented success during the 1940s with his discography showing six No. 1 hits in 1944 alone. His films such as Going My Way and The Bells of St. Mary's were huge successes as were the Road films he made with Bob Hope. On radio, his Kraft Music Hall and Philco Radio Time shows were very popular. Decca Records built on this by issuing a number of 78rpm album sets, some featuring freshly recorded material and others utilizing Crosby's back catalogue. Ten of these sets were released in 1946, nine in 1947 and twelve more in 1948. ==Reception== Billboard commented: :This, the 12th Decca album of Crosby, shows Bing at his sober sentimental best, doing tunes selected for sacrosanct dignity and hallowed usage. Most of the sides have had field days as singles, but their group character is reasonably certain to insure the package of a wide sale.

Binimetinib is a selective inhibitor of MEK, a central kinase in the tumor- promoting MAPK pathway. Inappropriate activation of the pathway has been shown to occur in many cancers. In June 2018 it was approved by the FDA in combination with encorafenib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive melanoma. == Mechanism of action == Binimetinib is an orally available inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), or more specifically, a MAP2K inhibitor. MEK is part of the RAS pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation and survival. MEK is upregulated in many forms of cancer. Binimetinib, uncompetitive with ATP, binds to and inhibits the activity of MEK1/2 kinase, which has been shown to regulate several key cellular activities including proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. MEK1/2 are dual-specificity threonine/tyrosine kinases that play key roles in the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and are often upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types. Inhibition of MEK1/2 prevents the activation of MEK1/2 dependent effector proteins and transcription factors, which may result in the inhibition of growth factor-mediated cell signaling. As demonstrated in preclinical studies, this may eventually lead to an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and an inhibition in production of various inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1, -6 and tumor necrosis factor. == Development == In 2015, it was in phase III clinical trials for ovarian cancer, BRAF mutant melanoma, and NRAS Q61 mutant melanoma. In December 2015, the company announced that the mutant-NRAS melanoma trial was successful. In the trial, those receiving binimetinib had a median progression-free survival of 2.8 months versus 1.5 months for those on the standard dacarbazine treatment. NDA submitted Jun 2016,Array Bio submits marketing application in U.S. for lead product candidate in certain type of melanoma. June 2016 and the FDA should decide by 30 June 2017. In April 2016, it was reported that the phase III trial for low-grade ovarian cancer was terminated due to lack of efficacy. Binimetinib was studied for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, but a phase II trial did not show benefit. In 2017, the FDA informed Array Biopharma that the phase III trial data was not sufficient and the New Drug Application was withdrawn. In June 2018, it was approved for the treatment of certain melanomas by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in combination with encorafenib. The FDA approved binimetinib based primarily on evidence from one clinical trial (NCT01909453) of 383 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma that was advanced or could not be removed by surgery. The trial was conducted at 162 sites in Europe, North America, and various countries around the world. == References  * Category:Benzamides Category:Cancer treatments Category:Fluoroarenes Category:Pfizer brands Category:MEK inhibitors Category:Organobromides Category:Orphan drugs ","title":"Binimetinib"},{"id":"46332711","text":"Homalopteroides stephensoni is a species of the genus Homalopteroides in the family Balitoridae.Randall, Z.S. & Page, L.M.

It was filmed and produced at locations in Switzerland by Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen SRF. == Plot (excerpt) == The real estate agent Rolf Aebersold is trying to sell his aunt Martha's (Trudi Roth) house without her knowledge, but the ad has ended up in the section \\"Furnished rooms for rent\\". Nobody's fool, the tough old lady welcomes several lodgers, whose various problems are addressed by this new community, which is \\"almost a family\\". Unusual ideas result in confusion and mayhem in every episode. The main setting is the shared kitchen. == Title == The series title means almost a family in Swiss German. == Cast and characters ==  Martha Aebersold (Trudi Roth)  * Trudi Roth as Martha Aebersold (1994‚Äì1999) Tante Martha (meaning aunty Martha) is a good-hearted, somewhat old-fashioned old lady of endearing naivety, and is the owner of the house. Esoteric issues are her special hobby, and because she is always ready to think well of everybody, she is the perpetual victim of gurus of all kinds. Her temporary obsessions usually last for just one episode and then replaced by new ones. In the short term, her special interests result in highly complicated situations ‚Äì especially when her nephew, the estate agent, tries to use her latest spleen to have Martha and the new 'family' evicted from her house. Trudi Roth' attended the Ernst Ginsberg drama school in Basel, followed by performances with the cabaret-doodle-doo and Cabaret Cornichon. Later she starred in comedies and musicals, radio plays and Swiss TV productions. Trudi Roth died on the night of 11 June 2016 in a nursing home in Z√ºrich. According to her family, cause of death was her age of 86, and dementia.  Hans Meier (Walter Andreas M√ºller)  * Walter Andreas M√ºller as Hans Meier (1994‚Äì1999) Hans Meier (in his late forties) is a small, bustling waiter with a marked inclination to higher goals in his life, but he is good-natured. He has no doubt that he was born for the stage, and that someday someone will recognize his talent and give him the chance he needs for his 'breakthrough'. Until then, he shines as the star in amateur theatricals, where he always tries to play the lead roles. Hans, who is an excellent impersonator, takes every opportunity to take on a role, even in his private life. Walter Andreas M√ºller is just as good an impersonator as Hans Meier. He worked at almost every major theatre in Switzerland, among them Bernhard-Theater Z√ºrich, Theater am Hechtplatz and Theater an der Winkelwiese. Besides, M√ºller works as a freelance actor, comedian, radio host, impersonator and parodist.  Flip (Martin Schenkel)  * Martin Schenkel as Flip (1994‚Äì1998) Flip (actually Philipp) is in his mid-twenties and a born survivor. He paints T-shirts with funny slogans and sells them on the street, always managing to earn just enough to get by with an absolute minimum of work (and keeping Martha waiting for his rent). The fact that he keeps raiding the fridge is a source of constant bickering. Martin Schenkel was born in Basel in 1968, and attended drama school in Bern. Then he moved to Germany for an engagement at the State Theater, Karlsruhe. After \\"Fascht e Familie\\", he was in L√ºthi und Blanc from 1999 to 2003, contributing the song \\"Whenever\\". He was also successful as a rock musician. Martin Schenkel died on 27 March 2003 in Zermatt after a brief illness.  Vreni Hubacher (Hanna Scheuring)  * Hanna Scheuring as Vreni Hubacher (1994‚Äì1998) Vreni Hubacher (early twenties) is the youngest member of the \\"family\\". The brave peasant girl from the countryside came to the city and is now working at a bank. Vreni believed to be at the beginning of a great business career, and is a wannabe yuppie ready to do for promotion (almost) everything. But Vreni is so appealing that no one likes to spoil the enjoyment of her dreams. Hanna Scheuring was born near Z√ºrich as the youngest of four daughters. After training as an actress at the Conservatory of Music and Theatre in Bern, she played several years in Germany, at the State Theatre Marburg and at the Theater Trier. In Switzerland, she was primarily known for her role as \\"Vreni\\". \\"L√ºthi and Blanc\\" was her next Swiss engagement, thenafter in various films. She is still on stage. In addition, Hanna Scheuring has also worked as a trainer and coach to support people in culture and business performance skills. She has been involved for some time for UNICEF and traveled to Somalia to gather information on site about female circumcision.  Rolf Aebersold (Andreas Matti)  * Andreas Matti as Rolf Aebersold (1994‚Äì1999) Rolf Aebersold (aged at end of thirty) was \\"the man you love to hate\\", the nephew of Tante Martha, smart, greedy real estate trader and permanent legacy hunter, and no hypocrisy and no vulgarity is hypocritical to mean, if he just achieves his goal. Repeatedly new attempts to get his aunt's house are his further trademarks, but he fails against the new \\"family\\" of Martha who fends off his attacks. Andreas Matti, born 1959 in Saanen, made his acting training at the Academy of Arts in Bern. He was a regular guest at the Schauspielhaus Z√ºrich, and also starred in L√ºthi und Blanc, as well in Swiss films.  Anne K√§thi Tobler (Sandra Moser)  * Sandra Moser Anne K√§thi Tobler (1997‚Äì1999) Anne K√§thi Tobler (somewhere in the late twenties) works as a midwife and dancer, is well tempered and extremely goodhearted, but sometimes she has a waggish sense of humour. Annek√§thi joined the \\"family\\" in the third season and replaced Vreni and Flip. Sandra Moser starred at the Schauspielhaus Hannover in Brecht's Threepenny Opera in 1992, thenafter she toured for several years with Karls k√ºhne Gassenschau through Switzerland and played in several plays, as she does in the present days. == Production == The serial was shot and produced in the canton of Thurgau in Switzerland. Guest roles had among others J√∂rg Schneider, Beat Marti, Ines Torelli and Stephanie Glaser. Between 1994 and 1999, in all five seasons with 99 episodes and one epilog of 25 minutes each were produced in the Swiss German language, and around 1997 synchronized in Swiss Standard German to be broadcast in the German and probably Austrian television. The production was done with an audience which had to applaude and to laugh as practiced in US sitcoms. == Reception == First aired on 4 November 1994, Fascht e Familie is still very popular in the Swiss German culture, and from time to time re-broadcast in the Swiss German television. In 1997 the RTL-Group in Germany asked for an adoption for the German television, and so the dialogues were synchronized in the Swiss Standard German language, but the Swiss German oriented humour did not fit the audience's gusto in Germany, and even in Austria, and so just 40 episodes have been broadcast between January and October 1997 as Fast ‚Äône Familie on Super RTL. == Awards (excerpt) == * 1995: Sparten-PRIX WALO for Radio/TV/Filmproduktion. == Home media == The entire sitcom was released, including 99 episodes and one epilog, as the Fascht e Familie Gesamtedition collection on DVD (RC2). == References  External links == * Category:1994 German television series debuts Category:1999 German television series endings Category:1990s Swiss television series Category:German-language television shows Category:Television series about dysfunctional families Category:Television shows set in Switzerland ","title":"Fascht e Familie"},{"id":"46332735","text":"Clara Rousby (1848‚Äì1879) was an actress who made notable appearances on the London stage. ==Life== Clara Marion Jessie Dowse was born in 1848 at Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight.

It is a tree that is threatened by habitat loss, endemic to the Western Ghats of India (including Agastya Mala, the Megamalai Wildlife Sanctuary, the Anaimalai and Palni Hills, the Nilgiri mountains, and Baba Budangiri), and also Sri Lanka. == Description== A large tree; bark is brown with grey highlights and presents a cracked appearance. Leaves measure √ó and are elliptic with both ends tapering. Flower petals are white, measuring about across; sepals measure between , narrow at their innermost, and ever broader as they approach the outermost perimeter; carpels are sessile. Fruits measure in length, with many warty yellow follicles each about long, containing 1 to 2 scarlet seeds. ==Botanical classification== Magnolia nilagirica was originally described and published under the name Michelia nilagirica (the basionym) by Jonathan Carl Zenker (1799‚Äì1837) in Plantae Indicae, quas in montibus ‚Ä¶ , 2: 21, t. 20. 1836. In 2000 it was reclassified under the genus Magnolia by Richard B. Figlar (In: Proceedings of the International Symposium on the Family Magnoliaceae, 23. 2000. Guangzhou, China). ==Ecological vulnerability== Due to this tree's excellent wood quality, it is under severe threat of being over- logged. In general, the forests in which it grows are rapidly being harvested, at a faster pace than is needed to allow the forests a chance to regrow; it is estimated that this species in particular has lost 40% of its wild growing population during a period of about 180 years. The IUCN (2015) has determined that no improvements have been implemented to halt this pace of deforestation, and therefore have assessed its status as \\"vulnerable\\". IUCN has not determined whether the stands of trees are becoming fragmented from within, or are more or less shrinking in area from the perimeter of their ranges. ==Vernacular names== This tree is known by different common names in various languages of India, as shown below: *Hindi: pila champa *Tamil: kattu shanbagam *Kannada: bana sampige, bili sampige, bilisampage, dodda sampige *Telgu: tella sampanga *Sinhala: wanasapu *Malayalam: kattuchempakam (‡¥ï‡¥æ‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡µÅ‡¥ö‡µÜ‡¥Æ‡µç‡¥™‡¥ï‡¥Ç) ==References== *India Biodiversity *Microfungi association *The Plant List ==External links== *Natural range in India of Magnolia nilagirica from IUCN nilagirica Category:Flora of India (region) Category:Flora of Sri Lanka Category:Plants described in 1836 ","title":"Magnolia nilagirica"},{"id":"46332786","text":"John Nightingale may refer to: *John Nightingale (academic) (born 1960), British academic *John Nightingale (actor) (1942‚Äì1980), British actor *John Nightingale (figure skater) (born 1928), American figure skater *John Nightingale (police officer) (1913‚Äì2002), British police officer *Jack Nightingale (1899‚Äì1967), full name John Gladstone Nightingale, English footballer ","title":"John Nightingale"},{"id":"46332795","text":"Costume is a Finnish language monthly women's and fashion magazine published in Helsinki, Finland.

IRAKs are essential components of the Interleukin-1 receptor signaling pathway and some Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) detect microorganisms by recognizing specific pathogen- associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and IL-1R family members respond the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines. These receptors initiate an intracellular signaling cascade through adaptor proteins, primarily, MyD88.Suzuki, N., Suzuki, S., and Saito, T. 2005. IRAKs: Key Regulatory Kinases of Innate Immunity. Curr. Med. Chem. ‚Äì Anti-Inflammatory & Anti- Allergy Agents, 4(1), 13-20. This is followed by the activation of IRAKs. TLRs and IL-1R members have a highly conserved amino acid sequence in their cytoplasmic domain called the Toll/Interleukin-1 (TIR) domain. The elicitation of different TLRs/IL-1Rs results in similar signaling cascades due to their homologous TIR motif leading to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the IŒ∫B kinase (IKK) complex, which initiates a nuclear factor-Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B) and AP-1-dependent transcriptional response of pro- inflammatory genes. Understanding the key players and their roles in the TLR/IL-1R pathway is important because the presence of mutations causing the abnormal regulation of Toll/IL-1R signaling leading to a variety of acute inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. IRAKs are membrane proximal putative serine-threonine kinases. Four IRAK family members have been described in humans: IRAK1, IRAK2, IRAKM, and IRAK4. Two are active kinases, IRAK-1 and IRAK-4, and two are inactive, IRAK-2 and IRAK-M, but all regulate the nuclear factor-Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Some special/significant features of each IRAK family member: *There is some evidence that IRAK-1 functions in regulating other signaling cascades leading to NF-Œ∫B activation. One signaling pathway in particular nerve growth factor (NGF) may be dependent on the function of IRAK-1 in its signaling pathway for its activation and cell survival. *IRAK-2 has 4 isoforms IRAK-2a, IRAK-2b, IRAK-2c, and IRAK-2d. The latter two have negative feedback in the TLR signaling pathways. IRAK-2a and IRAK-2b positively activate NF-Œ∫B/TLR pathway by stimulating LPS. *IRAK-M is specific to monomyeloic cells (monocytes and macrophages) while the other IRAKs that are ubiquitously expressed. IRAK-M negatively regulates TLR signaling by inhibiting the IRAK-4/IRAK-1 complex *The newest described IRAK family member, IRAK-4, has been found to be critical for the recruitment of IRAK-1 and for its activation/degradation. IL-1 stimulates IRAK-4 to the IL-1R complex initiating the Toll/IL-1 receptor signaling cascade upstream of IRAKs, so the deletion of IRAK-1 does not abolish the activation of NF-Œ∫B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. ==Discovery== IRAKs were first identified in 1994 by Michael Martin and colleagues when they successfully co-precipitated a protein kinase with type I interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1RI) from human T cells. They speculated that this kinase was the link between the T cell's transmembrane IL-1 receptor and the cytosolic signalling pathway's downstream components. The name ‚ÄúIRAK‚Äù came from Zhaodan Cao and colleagues in 1995. The DNA sequence analysis of IRAK's domains revealed many conserved amino acids with the serine/threonine specific protein kinase Pelle in Drosphila, that functions downstream of a Toll receptor. Cao's lab confirmed the kinase's activity as necessarily associated with the IL-1 receptor by immunoprecipitating the IL-1 receptors from different cell types treated with IL-1 and without IL-1. Even cells without over-expressed IL-1 receptors showed kinase activity when exposed to IL-1, and were able to co-precipitate a protein kinase with endogenous IL-1 receptors. Thus the human IL-1 receptor's accessory protein was named Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinase. In 1997, MyD88 was identified as the cytosolic protein that recruits IRAKs to the cytosolic domains of IL-1 receptors, mediating IL-1's signal transduction to the cytsolic signal cascade. Subsequent studies associated IRAKs with multiple signalling pathways triggered by interleukin, and specified multiple IRAK types. ==Structure== Functional domains All IRAK family members are multidomain proteins consisting of a conserved N-terminal Death Domain (DD) and a central kinase domain (KD). The DD is a protein interaction motif that important for interacting with other signaling molecules such as the adaptor protein MyD88 and other IRAK members. The KD is responsible for the kinase activity of IRAK proteins and consists of 12 subdomains. All IRAK KDs have an ATP binding pocket with an invariable lysine residue in subdomain II, however, only IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 have an aspartate residue in the catalytic site of subdomain VI, which is thought to be critical for kinase activity. It is thought that IRAK-2 and IRAK-M are catalytically inactive because they lack this aspartate residue in the KD. :The C-terminal domain does not seem to show much similarity between IRAK family members. The C-terminal domain is important for the interaction with the signaling molecule TRAF6. IRAK-1 contains three TRAF6 interaction motifs, IRAK-2 contains two and IRAK-M contains one.Flannery, S., & Bowie, A. G. (1215). The interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases: Critical regulators of innate immune signalling IRAK-1 contains a region that is rich in serine, proline, and threonine (proST). It is thought that IRAK-1 undergoes hyperphosphorylation in this region. The proST region also contains two proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S) and threonine (T)-rich (PEST) sequences that are thought to promote the degradation of IRAK-1. ==Role in immune signaling== Interleukin-1 receptor signaling IL-1R Signaling pathway Interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs) are cytokine receptors that transduce an intracellular signaling cascade in response to the binding of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1). This signaling cascade results in the initiation of transcription of certain genes involved in inflammation. Because IL-1Rs do not possess intrinsic kinase activity, they rely on the recruitment of adaptor molecules, such as IRAKs, to transduce their signals. IL-1 binding to IL-1R complex triggers the recruitment of the adaptor molecule MyD88 through interactions with the TIR domain. MyD88 brings IRAK-4 to the receptor complex. Preformed complexes of the adaptor molecule Tollip and IRAK-1 are also recruited to the receptor complex, allowing IRAK-1 to bind MyD88. IRAK-1 binding to MyD88 brings it into close proximity with IRAK-4 so that IRAK-4 can phosphorylate and activate IRAK-1. Once phosphorylated, IRAK-1 recruits the adaptor protein TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and the IRAK-1-TRAF6 complex dissociates from the IL-1R complex. The IRAK-1-TRAF6 complex interacts with a pre-existing complex at the plasma membrane consisting of TGF-Œ≤ activated kinase 1 (TAK1), and two TAK binding proteins, TAB1 and TAB2. TAK1 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK). This interaction leads to the phosphorylation of TAB2 and TAK1, which then translocate to the cytosol with TRAF6 and TAB1. IRAK-1 remains at the membrane and is targeted for degradation by ubiquitination. Once the TAK1-TRAF6-TAB1-TAB2 complex is in the cytosol, ubiquitination of TRAF6 in triggers the activation of TAK1 kinase activity. TAK1 can then activate two transcription pathways, the nuclear factor-Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B) pathway and the mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. To activate the NF-Œ∫B pathway, TAK1 phosphorylates the IŒ∫B kinase (IKK) complex, which subsequently phosphorylates the NF-Œ∫B inhibitor, IŒ∫B, targeting it for degradation by the proteasome. Once IŒ∫B is removed, the NF-Œ∫B proteins p65 and p50 are free to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of proinflammatory genes. To activate the MAPK pathway, TAK1 phosphorylates MAPK kinase (MKK) 3/4/6, which then phosphorylate members of the MAPK family, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. Phosphorylated JNK/p38 can then translocate into the nucleus and phosphorylate and activate transcription factors such as c-Fos and c-Jun. Toll-like receptor signaling Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important innate immune receptors that recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiate the appropriate immune response to eliminate a particular pathogen. PAMPs are conserved motifs associated with microorganisms that are not found in host cells, such as, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), viral double-stranded RNA, etc. TLRs are similar to IL-1Rs in that they do not possess intrinsic kinase activity and require adaptor molecules to relay their signals. Stimulation of TLRs can also result in NF-Œ∫B and MAPK mediated transcription, similar to the IL-1R signaling pathway. It has been shown that IRAK-1 is essential for TLR7 and TLR9 interferon (IFN) induction. TLR7 and TLR9 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) recognize viral nucleic acids and trigger the production of interferon-Œ± (IFN-Œ±), an important cytokine for inducing an antiviral state in host cells. TLR7 and TLR9 mediated IFN-Œ± induction requires the formation of a complex consisting of MyD88, TRAF6 and the interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7). IRF7 is a transcription factor that translocates into the nucleus when activated and initiates transcription of IFN-Œ±. IRAK-1 was shown to directly phosphorylates IRF7 in vitro and the kinase activity of IRAK-1 was shown to be essential for IRF7 transcriptional activation. It was subsequently shown that IRAK-1 is required for the activation of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5). IRF5 is another transcription factor that induces IFN production following stimulation of TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 by specific viruses. In order to be activated, IRF5 must be polyubiquitinated by TRAF6. It has been shown that TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination of IRF5 is dependent on the kinase activity of IRAK-1. IRAK-1 has also been shown to play a critical role in TLR4 interleukin-10 (IL-10) induction. TLR4 recognizes bacterial LPS and triggers the transcription of IL-10, a cytokine regulating the inflammatory response. IL-10 transcription is activated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). IRAK-1 forms a complex with STAT3 and the IL-10 promoter element in the nucleus and is required for STAT3 phosphorylation and activation of IL-10 transcription. IRAK-2 plays an important role in TLR-mediated NF-Œ∫B activation. Knocking down IRAK-2 has been shown to impair NF-Œ∫B activation by TLR3, TLR4 and TLR8. The mechanism of how IRAK-2 functions is still unknown, however, IRAK-2 has been shown to interact with a TIR adaptor protein that does not bind to IRAK-1, called Mal/TIRAP. Mal/TIRAP has been specifically implicated in TLR2 and TLR4 mediated NF-Œ∫B signaling. In addition, it has been shown that IRAK-2 is recruited to the TLR3 receptor. IRAK-2 is the only IRAK family member that is known to play a role in TLR3 signaling. One of the most distinct features of IRAK-M is that it is a negative regulator of TLR signaling to prevent excessive inflammation. It is thought that IRAK-M enhances the binding of MyD88 to IRAK-1 and IRAK-4, preventing IRAK-1 from dissociating from the receptor complex and inducing downstream NF-Œ∫B and MAPK signaling. It has also been shown that IRAK-M negatively regulates the alternative NF-Œ∫B pathway in TLR2 signaling. The alternative NF-Œ∫B pathway is predominantly triggered by CD40, lymphotoxin Œ≤ receptor (LT), and the B-cell activating receptor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF receptor). The alternative NF-Œ∫B pathway involves the activation of NF-Œ∫N-inducing kinase (NIK) and subsequent phosphorylation of the transcription factors p100/RelB in an IKKŒ±-dependent mechanism. It was observed that IRAK-M knockout resulted in increased induction of the alternative NF-Œ∫B pathway but not the classical pathway. The mechanism by which IRAK-M inhibits NF-Œ∫B signaling is still unknown. IRAK-4 is an essential component of MyD88 mediated signaling pathways and is therefore critical for both IL-1R and TLR signaling. MyD88 acts as a scaffold protein for the interaction between IRAK-1 and IRAK-4, allowing IRAK-4 to phosphorylate IRAK-1, leading to autophosphorylation and activation of IRAK-1 [1,2]. IRAK-4 is critical for IL-1R and TLR NF-Œ∫B and MAPK signaling pathways as well as TLR7/9 MyD88-mediated interferon activation. ==Role in disease== Interleukin 1 is a cytokine that acts locally and systemically in the innate immune system. IL-1a and IL-1√ü are known for causing inflammation, but can also cause induction of other proinflammatory cytokines, and fever. Because IRAKs are a crucial step in the IL-1 receptor signalling pathway, deficiencies or over-expression of IRAKs can cause suboptimal or overactive cellular response to IL-1a and IL-1√ü. Thus Interleukin-1 Receptor Associated Kinases are promising therapeutic targets for autoimmune-, immunodeficiency-, and cancer-related disorders.Bahia MS., Kaur M., Silakari P, Silakari O. 2015. Interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase inhibitors: Potential therapeutic agents for inflammatory- and immune-related disorders. Cell. Sig. 27: 1039-1055 Cancer Inflammation signalling is known to be a major factor in many cancer types, and an inflammatory microclimate is a key aspect of human tumours. IL-1√ü, which activates the inflammatory signalling pathway containing IRAKs, is directly involved in tumour cell growth, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. In tumour cells containing the L265P MyD88 mutant, protein-signalling complexes spontaneously assemble, activating IRAK-4's kinase activity and promoting inflammation and growth independent of Interleukin-1 signalling. IRAK-4 inhibiting drugs are thus a potential therapeutic treatment for lymphoid malignancies with the L265P MyD88 mutation, especially in Waldenstr√∂m's Macroglobulinaemia, in which BTK and IRAK1/4 inhibitors have shown promising but unconfirmed results. In 2013, Garrett Rhyasen and his colleagues at the University of Cincinnati studied the contribution of active IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 in human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). They found that IRAK1 knockout therapy incited apoptosis and impaired leukemic progenitor activity. They also established that IRAK4, while imperative to proliferation of human hematologic malignancies, is not imperative to the pathogenesis of MDS/AML.Rhyasen GW., Bolanos L., Starczynowski DT. 2013. Differential IRAK signaling in hematologic malignancies. Exp. Hematology. 41: 1005-1007. Further testing of IRAK- inhibitory therapy could prove essential to cancer therapy development. Autoimmune Disorders Autoimmune disorders such as MS, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and psoriasis are caused by innate immune system deregulation inducing chronic inflammation. In most cases, inhibition of IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 are suspected to the most effective targets for knockout drugs, as their functions are integral to the cytokine pathways inducing chronic inflammation. Mutations in the gene for IRAK-M have been identified as contributors to early onset asthma. Compromised IRAK-M leads to overproduction of inflammatory cytokines in the lungs, eventually triggering T cell mediated allergic reactions and exacerbation of asthma symptoms. Researchers have proposed that increasing IRAK-M function in these individuals may moderate asthma symptoms. ==References== Category:EC 2.7.11 Category:Immunology ","title":"Interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase"},{"id":"46332879","text":"Homalopteroides weberi is a species of the genus Homalopteroides in the family Balitoridae.Randall, Z.S. & Page, L.M.

KickStart designs and mass-markets climate-smart irrigation technology to smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, in order to enable a transition from subsistence agriculture to commercial irrigated agriculture. Donor funds are used to design the irrigation pumps, establish supply chains, demonstrate and promote the pumps, and educate farmers on the benefits and methods of small- scale irrigation. ==Background== Food supply across sub-Saharan Africa is highly unstable due to its unpredictable climate and water reserves. Only 6% of Africa's cultivated land is irrigated, limiting the volume of crops that can be grown out of season, but increased access to irrigation systems stands to increase food productivity by up to 50%. ==History== KickStart was founded in 1991 by Dr. Martin Fisher and Nick Moon. Fisher first went to Kenya on a Fulbright Fellowship to study the Appropriate Technology Movement, where he met Moon, who was in Kenya with the Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO). The two worked closely together on a variety of development interventions, including building rural water systems, constructing schools, and creating job training programs. Out of frustration with traditional development models, Fisher and Moon developed an alternative model for poverty alleviation.The New Heroes. https://www.pbs.org/opb/thenewheroes/meet/moon.html Their model was based on a five-step process to develop, launch and promote simple money-making tools that poor entrepreneurs could use to create their own profitable businesses. Together, they founded ApproTEC, which later became KickStart International in 2005. Starting in 1998, KickStart began developing a line of manually operated irrigation pumps, designed to enable farmers to easily pull water from a river, pond, or shallow well, and pressurize it through a hose pipe to reach their crops. Through this small-scale technological intervention, farmer can harvest their crops year-round, facilitating a transition from rain-fed subsistence farming to year-round commercial irrigated agriculture.The MoneyMaker Max can pressurize water to a total height of 50 feet, pushing it through a hose pipe as far as 200 m, and can irrigate as much as two acres of land.Michael D.

The first hospital was a 7-room house on the corner of Yakima and Naches Avenues. The hospital cared for 37 patients the first year, and within a year the hospital moved to a larger building to keep up with the capacity. St. Elizabeth's grew from performing their first surgery on a kitchen table in the 1890s to opening the first coronary care unit in the state in the 1960s and the region's first comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation facility in the 1980s. In 1994, St. Elizabeth Medical Center became Providence Yakima Medical Center, and in 2003 the name was changed to Yakima Regional Medical and Cardiac Center. In 2017, the hospital joined a healthcare system called Astria Health and was renamed Astria Regional Medical Center. The cardiac services were expanded and within the hospital, the expert cardiology staff, state of the art facilities and cardiac programs were renamed Astria Heart Institute.

He progressed through the club's youth ranks and signed his first professional deal with the club in the summer of 2014, retaining him for the 2014‚Äì15 season. During the 2014‚Äì15 season, Phillips became the captain of the development and under-18 teams. Phillips joined the first team for the trip to Sunderland in the FA Cup third round on 4 January 2015; he was unused substitute in a 1‚Äì0 defeat. On 30 March 2015, Leeds Academy coach Jason Blunt revealed that he felt the form of Phillips for the under-18 and development tems would see Phillips become a future first team fans favourite. Phillips made further appearances on the bench for the first team in league matches over the following months before making his professional debut against Wolverhampton Wanderers in 4‚Äì3 defeat on 6 April 2015. Along with Sam Byram, Charlie Taylor, Alex Mowatt and Lewis Cook, Phillips was the latest graduate of a promising group of academy players to regularly feature under former youth manager Neil Redfearn in the 2014‚Äì15 season. On 11 April 2015, Phillips retained his position in the Leeds starting 11, making his home debut against Cardiff City at Elland Road. Phillips marked the match with his first senior goal in only his second appearance, although the match finished in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Cardiff. At the end of the season, he was offered and accepted a new two-year contract. On 31 July 2015, Phillips was given the number 27 shirt for the upcoming 2015‚Äì16 season. However, with Redfearn replaced as head coach during the summer, Phillips made just 10 league appearances over the course of the season under head coaches Uwe R√∂sler and then Steve Evans. 2016‚Äì2019 In June 2016, only days after the appointment of new head coach Garry Monk, Phillips was offered a new three-year contract at Leeds.

England manager Gareth Southgate watched Phillips in January 2020 ahead of a possible call up.After the English football season was paused in March 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the season was resumed during June. Phillips would go on to score a direct free-kick in Leeds' 3‚Äì1 win over Blackburn Rovers on 4 July 2020, however his season would be ended just a week later following a knee injury picked up in the 1‚Äì0 win over Swansea City.

Phillips made his international debut on 8 September 2020 against Denmark in the UEFA Nations League. ==Style of play== After starting his career as a box-to-box or central midfielder, Phillips was converted into a defensive midfielder by Marcelo Bielsa before the start of the 2018‚Äì19 season. He is known for his range of short sharp passing, long ball distribution and ability to start attacks whilst covering his defensive duties, with him described as a 'lynchpin'. Marcelo Bielsa described his style \\"He's very good at getting the ball and putting it into another space, a better space. He's very good when he has to cover the team when our full-backs go in attack. And when we are outnumbered, he is very good with his defending.\\" Phillips was also converted into playing as a centre back under Bielsa.

Tensions reportedly started with violent incidents over Christmas 2007 which resulted in the burning of over 100 churches and church institutions, including hostels, convents, and over 700 houses. Three persons were also killed during the three days after Christmas. The Hindutva groups and activists of the Kui Samaj were mostly involved in the 2007 attacks. The violence began after the murder of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Lakshmanananda Saraswati on 23 August by maoists. According to government reports the violence resulted in at least 39 people killed, all Christians. More than 395 churches were vandalized or burnt down, over 5,600 houses plundered or burnt down, over 600 villages ransacked and more than 54,000 people left homeless. Reports put the death toll at nearly 100 and suggested more than 40 women were sexually assaulted. Many Christians were forced to convert to Hinduism under threat of violence. This violence was led by the Bajrang Dal, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the VHP. == Background == Hateful anti-Christian campaigns in Kandhamal had already begun in the late 1960s, and continued for a long time, creating violence against minorities at frequent intervals including the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.  Kandha‚ÄìPana tensions  The Kandhamal district houses more than 100,000 Christians where 60% of them converted from the Scheduled Castes (SC) and are locally called as the Pana Christians (Pana) and they speak Kui language like tribal Kondhs or Kandhas. The district has been ethnically divided for decades between the tribal Kui-speaking Kandha tribals, and lower caste Kui-speaking Panas, who occupy a dominant position in their society. The Kui Samaj or the Kui association claimed to represent all the Kandha tribals, who were nearly 52% of the population in the district The tribal Khonds were historically animists but the extended contact with the Oriya Hindus made them to adopt many aspects of the Hinduism and Hindu culture. The tribal Panas were also animists before their conversion to Christianity. According to the Constitution, the reservation benefits are removed from the SCs after conversion and the Pana Christians demanded the Scheduled tribe (ST) status after the Presidential Order of 2002 which mentioned the Kui tribes in the ST category since they also speak the kui language. This was opposed by the VHP, the Kui Samaj and other political leaders who depend on Hindu tribals to supported their vote bank in the area. These tensions soon transformed into communal. The Kui Samaj called for a Shutdown on December 25, 2007 to protest against the allowing of ST caste status to the SC Pana Christians. With the shutdowns on Christmas Day, Christians, Christian institutions and Churches targeted by activists belonging to the Kui Samaj and the VHP. Christians were killed and churches were burnt and damaged in the violence during the Christmas of 2007 that slowly calmed down till the murder of Swami Lakshmanananda, which created a massacre during August 2008. The National Commission for minorities reported that the tensions between the Kandha and the Pana tribals were partly responsible for the agitation and violence.  The Sangh Parivar  A senior Home Department official said that the present struggle between the mostly Christian-Dalit Panas and the Kandh tribe, mostly pro-Hindus, was the outcome of the ethnic, social and religious divide that helped Maoists to set up their base. While over 1200 Churches and 400 Christian institutions became an eyesore for Hindutava forces, conversion was also a strong issue that had helped Sangh Parivar to strengthen its roots in Orissa. American political Scientist, Paul Brass argued that the generally insignificant, local communal conflicts in India are made into larger communal violence by groups he terms as 'conversion specialists'. In his book Constructing Indian Christianities: Culture, Conversion and Caste, Chad M. Bauman argued that the Sangh Parivar leaders followed the same technique in the Kandhamal riots by linking their local politics and clashes with broader national fears like extinction of Hinduism, a Christian demographic increase and even a 'Christian military coup'. Thereby providing justification for the anti-christian violence and also issuing a 'national call to arms' for the defense of the Khandamal Hindus.  December 2007 violence  The Human Rights Watch reported that the first wave of violence occurred on December 24, 2007 during an argument between Christians and Hindus over Christmas celebrations in the Kandhamal district. A Christian group attacked a vehicle belonging to the VHP leader Lakshmanananda Saraswati and in retaliation 19 Churches were completely burned down and razed. The Hindutva groups and the activists of the Kui Samaj were mostly involved in the 2007 attacks. The Kui Samaj and the VHP called for a bandh on December 25 to protest against the granting of ST status to the Pana Christians. The VHP also called for a bandh on Christmas Day for the attack on Lakshmananda's car. This led to Clashes between both the groups which continued for days where 837 families lost their houses. A mob of 500 strong attackers also torched a police station and burned the police vehicles and a Congress parliamentarian's house was also attacked. Saffron activists and Kui tribals who opposed the tribal status to the predominantly Christian Pana tribals joined together in the attacks. According to various Non-Governmental Organizations, the VHP exploited the tensions between the Kui Samaj and Pana Christians to propel the Christmas attacks. From December 24 to 27, 2007, at least three persons were killed and over 100 churches and church institutions, including convents and hostels, about 700 houses and other structures were burnt during in the riots. On 1 January 2008 further violence was reported at several places. Police said at least 20 houses and shops were torched at Phiringia, Khajuripada, Gochapada and Brahmanigaon by rioters. Murder of Swami Lakshmanananda On the evening of Saturday, 23 August 2008, unknown militants entered into the Ashram at around 8.00 p.m. and fired bullets from an AK-47 on the frail body of 84 years old Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati at Jalespata Vanabashi Kanyashram in Kandhmal District of Orissa. After killing him brutally, the proxy militants allegedly also cut various parts of his body by chisel and axe as it appeared. Others who tried to rescue the Swami, namely Sadhwi Bhakti Mata who was overall charge of the Kalyan Ashram, Kishore Baba, Amritanand Baba and a visitor guardian of an inmate of the school, were also killed. The dead body of Bhakti Mata was also defaced and ripped by brutal cut injuries. The attackers, estimated at thirty gunmen, were suspected of being Maoist insurgents but the Sangh Parivar family blamed it upon local Christian evangelical groups.Dialogue, Sacrifice and Reconciliation:A Study of Kandhamal Violence, Odisha Both the manner of attack and a letter found at the attack provided the basis for this. The government announced a special investigative probe into the attack.Orissa announces judicial probe into murder of VHP leaders The Hindu - 24 August 2008Protests in Orissa over killing of VHP leader NDTV - 24 August 2008 While the government held the Maoist insurgents of being responsible for the attacks, the Sangh Parivar groups blamed the incident on the Christians. The VHP state general secretary, Gouri Ram Prasad blamed the murder on the Christians and also said that the organization would retaliate on the Christians and also called for a ban on churches in the district. In October 2008, a senior Maoist leader claimed responsibility for the murder of Laxmanananda and police officials confirmed that the Maoists trained youth in the tribal community to murder Laxmanananda. ==Kandhamal Riots== A young Christian girl who was bruised and burnt during the anti Christian violence. It occurred when a bomb was thrown into her house by the extremists. On 25‚Äì28 August, Hindu mobs angered by the multiple murders of Saraswati and the four others, also allegedly incited by Manoj Pradhan, an elected state legislator from the Bharatiya Janata Party, set fire to many Christian settlements, and at least 45 people were killed.[the court] convicted Pradhan for the murder of Bikram Nayak from Budedipada of Tiangia village under Raikia police station limits on 26 August 2008. ... for setting ablaze houses of people belonging to the minority community and inciting communal violence. ... the riots in Kandhamal which claimed at least 38 lives in the aftermath of the killing of VHP leader Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati. The violence damaged or destroyed an estimated 1,400 Christian homes and more than 80 places of worship. In addition, an estimated 18,500 Christians were forced to flee their villages to refugee camps \\"after their houses were attacked by rampaging mobs.\\" The violence was led by the Bajrang Dal, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The Government of Orissa and police, military and paramilitary forces deployed in the state failed to respond efficiently, effectively or appropriately. To protest the five killings of Hindus including that of Lakshmananda, the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and the Bajrang Dal called for a statewide shutdown on Monday, 25 August 2008. On the same day, rioters attacked a Christian orphanage at Khuntpalli village in Bargarh district. A local Hindu woman employee in her 20s was gang- raped and burnt alive by the mob after she was mistaken for a Christian, when the orphanage was set on fire. The VHP claimed that Hindu people in the area had taken the death of the Swami \\"very seriously, and now they are going to pay them back.\\" A curfew was imposed in all towns in Kandhamal. Despite this, violence continued in Phulbani, Tumudibandh, Baliguda, Udaygiri, Nuagaon and Tikabali towns. Many others fled into the jungle or into neighbouring districts and states. All nine towns in Kandhamal district were under a curfew, and the police had license to shoot. Curfew was also imposed in Jeypore town of Odisha's Koraput district. Five police personnel were injured in mob violence. The state government sought additional paramilitary forces to combat the continuing violence. On 28 August, a letter of denial (denying responsibility for the murder of Saraswati) was received by some media houses suspected to be from a Maoist group. While the letter denied that the Central Committee of the Kotagarha branch of the Maoists had approved the attack, it claimed that some Maoists may have been lured by \\"nefarious elements\\" to launch the attack. But the local police force continued to maintain that Maoists were behind the operationKandhmal: Mystery surrounds Swami's death NDTV - 4 September 2008 Soon after the appearance of the aforementioned letter, \\"Azad\\", another leader of the splinter Maoist People's Liberation Guerrilla Army group, claimed responsibility for the murder of Lakshmanananda in another letter. Azad was suspected by the police of leading the attack himself. Finally, on 9 September 2008 the Maoists, who work underground, made an official press release claiming responsibility for the killing of Lakshmanananda. Many Maoist sympathizers of south Odisha had initially denied the role of CPI-Maoist in the murder of VHP leaders that sparked off communal violence in Kandhamnal district. Communist Party of India (Maoist) leader Sabyasachi Panda claimed that they killed Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati and four of his disciples at his Jalespeta ashram on 23 August, for his Anti- Maoist hate speech, in the state of Odisha and the tribal Kandhamal region in particular. Finally, on 7 October 2008, the Odisha police announced they arrested three Maoists in connection with the murder of the Swami.3 arrested in Laxmanananda murder case Indian Express - 7 October 2008 On 16 October 2008, in an interview to PTI the IG police Arun Ray told that \\"Maoists trained certain youths of the tribal community to eliminate Saraswati\\", the \\"tribal community\\" believed by the Hindu Extremist to be a reference to the converted Christians of the region led to the \\"Fuel in the Fire\\" in the riots. The plan to eliminate Lakshmanananda was made in 2007, he added. Elaborating the probe by the crime branch, Ray said investigations also showed that a group had collected money from some villages in Kandhamal which was given to the Maoist group to train their youth for the purpose. The police said that they already arrested three persons, including two tribals and others who belong to the extremist Maoist groups and efforts were now on to arrest the other accused.Maoists were hired to kill Laxmanananda: Police Press Trust of India - 16 October 2008 District authorities said they had received dozens of complaints of forced conversions to Hinduism. Some victims have put saffron flags atop their home to prevent any future attacks and those sheltered in the refugee camps have been told they can go home only if they become Hindus. During the Kandhamal riots of 2008, some small villages in rural areas were targeted by extremists. They killed the pastor of Mukundapur, a small village in Gajapati District.The Hindu, 27 Aug 2008 Continued violence On 1 September 2008 the state government of Odisha claimed that the situation was under control. However, several houses and places of worship were burnt in the riots, especially in worst-hit Kandhamal district. 12,539 people were fed in relief camps, 783 people were fed in two relief camps in Rayagada district. In all, 12 companies of para-military forces, 24 platoons of Odisha State Armed Police, two sections of Armed Police Reserve forces and two teams of Special Operation Group (SOG) were deployed to control the riots. On 4 September 2008 a group of nearly 2500 extremists barged into the Tikabali Government High School Relief Camp shouting at the Christian refugees and took away supplies meant for the refugees, while police remained as silent spectators. On the same day, over 300 VHP incited tribal women attacked a relief camp for the Christian riot victims in Tikabali, demanding food, employment and relief for non-Christian population, who they said had been starving following the 12-day-old curfew order clamped by the district administration to contain communal violence. On 7 September 2008 VHP leader Praveen Togadia announced that an all-India agitation would be launched if the killers of Saraswati were not arrested. The Church and Christian groups in turn demanded dismissal of the state government. On 15 September 2008, it was reported that there was an attack on two Hindu temples in Odisha's Sundergarh district. One was attacked on the night of 14 September, and the other 2 weeks earlier. On 30 September 2008, a Christian nun initially accused the mob of raping her on 25 August at Nuagaon in Kandhamal district but retracted her statements soon afterwards when a police complaint was lodged and police sources later confirmed: \\"Though the nun had denied the rape allegation during recording of her statement, she later given a written complaint alleging that she was raped by one person from among the mob\\". During a press conference she said that a group of unidentified persons, dragged her along with Fr Thomas Chellan to the deserted Jana Vikas building. The priest was doused with petrol and beaten up. She reported that the mob paraded her on the streets in the presence of a dozen policemen Eventually, four men were arrested for the attack, and a senior police office suspended over the delayed investigation. After the complaint was launched, police had a medical examination of the nun carried out, which confirmed her rape. Police sent the clothes of the said nun to the state forensic laboratory for further verification. Police arrested nine people in connection with the crime while the nun in case was in hiding for fear of reprisals. The Crime branch took charge of the probe following a government decision after the medical report. On 22 October 2008, the Supreme Court of India, rejected an appeal by the Archbishop of Cuttack, Raphael Cheenath, for a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the incident and asked the victim to look at an identity parade of those accused to identify the culprit with the help of the state police itself. Reuters reported the nun's media conference under the headline '40 men gang-raped me, says nun'; though she had made no such statement. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom reported that by March 2009, and at least 3,000 individuals were still in government camps, reportedly because of their inability to return to their family homes unless they ‚Äúreconvert‚Äù to Hinduism. After two weeks, a month long series of \\"reconversion\\" rituals and processions with the slained Swami's ashes were announced. There was no immediate police response. Many Christians allegedly took place in these ceremonies due to the fear of additional violence, property destruction and harassment.United States Commission on International Religious Freedom - Annual Report ‚ÄìChapter on India ==Total casualties and damages== Government reports suggested that the violence resulted in at least 39 killed, over 365 Churches vandalized or destroyed, over 5,600 houses were looted or burnt down, 600 villages ransacked and more than 54,000 were left home less. While other reports put the death toll to nearly 100 and suggested more than 40 women were sexually assaulted and many Christians were forced to convert to Hinduism with the threat of violence. The report by the Centre for Child Rights reported that at least 300 churches were destroyed; 13 Colleges, schools and 5 NGO offices were damaged. About 30,000 people lived in relief camps for months. About 2,000 people were forced to convert to Hinduism. According to a research by the Kandhamal Committee for Peace and Justice, 395 churches and places of worship and more than 6,500 homes were ransacked and razed to the ground during the August 2008 attacks. Initial reports suggested that more than 18,000 were injured and 50,000 displaced. Another report said that around 11,000 people were still living in relief camps, as of October 2008. Some tribals even fled away to border districts in neighbouring states. 310 villages were affected with 4,640 homes, 252 churches, and 13 educational institutes torched during attacks. Multiple Hindu temples and an unknown number of Hindus were also killed during the riots, excluding the five Hindu sadhus (including Saraswati) who were killed in the beginning itself. On 14 October 2008, Cuttack Archbishop Raphael Cheenath moved the Supreme Court seeking Rs 30 million as compensation to rebuild the demolished and vandalized churches in the riot-hit areas. He also sought Rs 550,000 for the kin of those killed in the riots and compensation of Rs 60,000 to those whose houses were damaged or torched. On 6 November 2008, Dhanu Pradhana, a VHP activist, was murdered in Kandhamal. He was shot when he was at a school in Kumbharigaon. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader of Eastern Odisha, Prabhat Panigrahi, was killed by Maoist insurgents in late March 2009.Orissa Hindu activist shot dead BBC News - 19 March 2009 Hindus have also been attacked by members of their own faith, for having Christian relatives. One woman, who is herself a Hindu, says she was gang-raped by her grandparents' neighbors due to her uncle's refusal to renounce his Christian beliefs. == Investigations == A report by the National Commission for Minorities blamed the violence on Sangh Parivar outfits and the Bajrang Dal. The Director general of police of Gujarat, CP Singh, stated on record that ‚Äúorganisations like the VHP and Bajrang Dal are clearly behind the violence. The CPM member Basudeb Acharia blamed the Bajrang Dal of the attacks and said that within an hour after the swami's murder the Bajrang Dal and the VHP armed with swords and spears started to attack the Christians and burnt-down their houses. In a press release made on 21 September, The National Commission for Minorities blamed the Sangh Parivar and Bajrang Dal for the communal violence in states of Karnataka and Odisha. Shafi Qureshi, member of the NCM team stated that the NCM teams had determined activists of Bajrang Dal were involved in these attacks in both in state of Odisha and Karnataka. Condemning the attack on churches in Kandhamal and other areas of Odisha and in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Chikmagalur and Mangalore in Karnataka, the Commission stressed the need for immediate confidence building measures to allay the fear from the minds of the minorities in both states of Odisha and Karnataka. ==Political and legal fallout== At the time of the Kandhamal riots in 2008, the ruling government of Odisha, headed by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, was a coalition of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD). In the 147-member state assembly the BJD-BJP combine had 93 members, 32 of whom are from the BJP. Some BJP legislators blamed the government for not providing adequate protection to Saraswati, despite other attempts on his life. They called for withdrawing support from the government, which would lead to its collapse. In the runup to the 2009 elections, Patnaik broke his ties with the BJP, saying that the alliance in the state had to be broken because it became impossible for him to stay with the BJP after the Kandhanmal riots which \\"horrified the entire world\\". In November 2009, after winning the elections again, this time without the support of the BJP and therefore free from political compulsions, re-elected chief minister of Odisha Naveen Patnaik, claimed that the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, the Bajrang Dal, and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh were involved in the Kandhamal violence in which at least 38 people were killed.asianews Orissa Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik says, \\"Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Viswa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and the Bajarang Dal (BD) were involved in the violence\\". On 4 September 2008, the Supreme Court of India issued an order on a petition filed by Catholic Archbishop Raphael Cheenath seeking a CBI enquiry and dismissal of the state government. The order refused to dismiss the Odisha state government but asked it to report on steps taken to stop the wave of communal rioting that had claimed at least 16 lives. In his petition, the Archbishop claimed that VHP leader Pravin Togadia carried out a procession with Saraswati's ashes after his cremation, an act that clearly inflamed further communal tension and rioting. The Supreme Court, in its order, asked the state government to file an affidavit explaining the circumstances under which this procession was allowed. However, it later emerged that Saraswati was never cremated in the first place (as a Hindu sannyasi, the holy man had already symbolically cast his physical body into fire while alive by wearing saffron robes, and set the soul free). As is the tradition of sannyasis, Saraswati was not cremated but instead buried and entombed after death. Since no cremation ever took place, Togadia replied that there was no question of \\"ashes\\" being proposed to be carried in any procession at all, and therefore the claims of \\"asthi kalash yatra\\" (carrying of the ashes) were untrue. He also alleged that Archbishop Raphael Cheenath had therefore \\"lied under oath to the apex court\\", because no such procession ever took place. ==Arrests and convictions== On 29 June 2010, a fast-track court set up after the Kandhamal riots found Manoj Pradhan, a Bharatiya Janata Party politician and a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Odisha, guilty of murder of Parikhita Digal, a Christian from Budedi village who was killed by the mob on 27 August 2008. Manoj Pradhan who was nominated by the BJP while imprisoned pending trial,Saffron party defends riot-tainted candidate was sentenced to seven years rigorous imprisonment. However, pending his appeal, he was granted bail by the High court on 6 July. A number of others have also been sentenced in riot-related cases. On 9 September 2010, another judge found Pradhan guilty in the murder of Bikram Nayak from Budedipada on 26 August 2008. In December 2010, 24 people were convicted. The Hindutva groups blamed the local Christian tribals for the murder of Lakshmanananda even-though the killers were suspected of being Maoist insurgents by the government. Later a senior Maoist leader claimed responsibility for the murder, the police also confirmed that the Maoists trained tribal youth to carry out the murder. ==Response== 's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called the Odisha violence a \\"shame\\" and offered all help from the Centre to end the communal clashes and restore normalcy. He said he would speak to Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik to urge him to take all necessary steps to end the violence. http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-08-29/india/27922690_1_orissa- violence-swami-lakshmanananda-saraswati-naveen-patnaik The church network - including the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India, the Evangelical Fellowship of India and the National Council of Churches in India - organized for all Christian institutions to remain closed on 29 August 2008 in protest. On Wednesday, 27 August 2008, Pope Benedict XVI condemned the violence and expressed solidarity with the priests, nuns, and laypeople being victimized.http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-35197320080827 He \\"firmly condemned\\" the violence and called upon Indian religious and civil authorities \\"to work together to restore peaceful co-existence and harmony between the different religious communities.\\" In doing so he said: \\"I learnt with great sorrow the information concerning the violence against the Christian community in Orissa which broke out after the reprehensible assassination of the Hindu leader, Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati. This led to derisive remarks in the press about the Italian origins of Sonia Gandhi, a Catholic, under whose leadership, the United Progressive Alliance was ruling India at time.\\" 25px Human Rights Watch, a US-based outfit, expressed extreme dismay at the mob violence against Christians instigated by the VHP. The organization also expressed concern at the state government's lack of action following the Christmas 2007 violence. 's Foreign Ministry called on India's ambassador to demand 'incisive action' to prevent further attacks against Christians. The National Human Rights Commission of India(NHRC) sought a report from the Odisha government on the ongoing religious violence in the state. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) demanded the Indian authorities take immediate steps to quell the violence and order a probe to find out the perpetrators of the attacks. \\"The continuing attacks targeting Christians represent the second major outbreak of religious violence in Orissa since December which underlines the pressing need for Indian government to develop preventive strategies,\\" USCIRF said. \\"State governments must be held accountable for violence and other unlawful acts that occur in their state\\" Commission Chair Felice D Gaer said in a statement. USCIRF called on the US State Department to urge the central government and its Human Rights and Minority Commissions to continue their investigations, issue reports on the status of their investigations, and take further appropriate measures to address the situation, including ensuring that perpetrators of the violence are brought to account. expressed concern over the violence against Christians in Odisha and hoped that the ruling government would bring the perpetrators to justice. == See also == *1998 attacks on Christians in southeastern Gujarat *Violence against Christians in India *2007 Christmas violence in Kandhamal *2008 Kandhamal nun gang rape case == References == Category:Violence against Christians in India Category:Violence against Christians Category:Religiously motivated violence in India Category:Anti- Christian sentiment in Asia Category:Hate crimes Category:Attacks on churches in Asia Category:Hindu nationalism Category:Persecution by Hindus Category:Persecution of Christians Category:Sectarian violence Category:Hinduism-motivated violence in India == Further reading == * *Unjust Compensation - An Assessment of Damage and Loss of PrivateProperty during the Anti-Christian Violence in Kandhamal, India ","title":"2008 Kandhamal violence"},{"id":"46333036","text":"Dylan Mottley-Henry (born 2 August 1997) is an English professional footballer who plays for Bradford City as a winger. ==Career== Bradford City Mottley-Henry played youth football for Bradford City, joining the first-team in November 2014.

Gwinn of New York (98 Congressional Record 8542). Most recently, it was presented for the consideration of the 112th Congress on March 15, 2011, in the form of House Joint Resolution No. 50 (\\"proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States relative to abolishing personal income, estate, and gift taxes and prohibiting the United States Government from engaging in business in competition with its citizens\\") by then-United States Representative Ron Paul of Texas (157 Congressional Record 3989). Paul offered detailed explanatory remarks about the proposed constitutional amendment which were printed in the Congressional Record (157 Congressional Record 4099). As presented by Paul, the text of the proposed constitutional amendment reads as follows: ‚ÄúSection 1. The Government of the United States shall not engage in any business, professional, commercial, financial, or industrial enterprise except as specified in the Constitution. ‚ÄúSection 2. The constitution or laws of any State, or the laws of the United States, shall not be subject to the terms of any foreign or domestic agreement which would abrogate this amendment. ‚ÄúSection 3. The activities of the United States Government which violate the intent and purposes of this amendment shall, within a period of three years from the date of the ratification of this amendment, be liquidated and the properties and facilities affected shall be sold. ‚ÄúSection 4. Three years after the ratification of this amendment the sixteenth article of amendments to the Constitution of the United States shall stand repealed and thereafter Congress shall not levy taxes on personal incomes, estates, and gifts.‚Äù As of June 2018, the proposal has not commanded the approval of both houses of Congress in order to submit it for the consideration of the states for ratification, as the aforementioned Article V provides. Nor have the legislatures of a sufficient number of states applied to Congress for the calling of an \\"Article V Convention\\" on the topic. == Explanation of purpose == In addition to those articulated by former Texas Congressman Ron Paul in 2011, the purposes and asserted needs for the proposed \\"Liberty\\" Amendment were extensively explained by the late United States Representative Larry McDonald of Georgia who inserted into the Congressional Record of October 9, 1975, a highly-detailed question-and-answer accounting (121 Congressional Record 32634-32641). Boiled down to its basics, the purpose of the \\"Liberty\\" Amendment is to guard against the Federal government engaging in commercial enterprises in competition with American citizens‚Äîunless such activities are specifically authorized by the Constitution, such as package delivery by the U.S. Postal Service (whose Constitutional situs is found in Article I, Section 8, Clause 7 thereof). Supporters of this proposed amendment believe that the U.S. Federal Government should liquidate approximately 900 agencies and business-like activities, using the proceeds to then reduce the federal debt. They further believe that the government could then operate on a substantially reduced budget and, in turn, reduce various taxes. == Support of the \\"Liberty\\" Amendment within the state legislatures == Nine states have endorsed the Liberty Amendment through some type of action: Wyoming (1959), Louisiana (1960), Nevada (1960), Texas (1960), Georgia (1962), South Carolina (1962), Arizona (1979), Indiana (1982) and Mississippi (1982) Asking Congress alone to propose the \\"Liberty\\" Amendment with no desire expressed for an \\"Article V Convention\\" *Nevada ‚Äì In 1960, the Nevada Legislature adopted Senate Joint Resolution No. 7 in support of Congress proposing the \\"Liberty\\" Amendment for ratification (106 Congressional Record 10749); and *Arizona ‚Äì In 1979, the Arizona Legislature adopted House Joint Memorial No. 2001 likewise in support (125 Congressional Record 12287).

Starring Michael Keaton as businessman Ray Kroc, the film portrays the story of his creation of the McDonald's fast- food restaurant chain. Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch co-star as McDonald's founders Richard and Maurice McDonald. The film premiered at Arclight Hollywood on December 7, 2016 and was released theatrically in the United States on January 20, 2017 by The Weinstein Company. It grossed $24 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Keaton's performance. == Plot == In 1954, Ray Kroc is a traveling milkshake machine salesman. While he has a supportive wife named Ethel and has saved enough to live a comfortable life in Arlington Heights, Illinois, he craves more. Ray also observes that many of the drive-in restaurants that he tries to sell to are inefficiently run. After learning that a drive-in in San Bernardino is ordering an unusually large number of milkshake mixers, Ray drives to California to see it. What he finds is McDonald's‚Äîa highly popular walk-up restaurant with fast service, high-quality food, disposable packaging and a family-friendly atmosphere. Ray meets with the two McDonald brothers, Maurice \\"Mac\\" and Richard \\"Dick\\" McDonald. They give Ray a tour of the kitchen and he notes the employees' strong work ethic. Ray is astounded with the restaurant, and takes the brothers to dinner. They tell him the origin story of McDonald's and how they came to design their \\"fast food\\" system. The next day, Ray suggests that the brothers franchise the restaurant, but they hesitate, pointing out that they already tried, only to have encountered absentee franchisees who were lackadaisical in upholding their system. Ray persists and eventually convinces the brothers to allow him to lead their franchising efforts on the condition that he agrees to a strict contract, which requires all changes be subject to the McDonald brothers' approval. Initially, Ray begins building a McDonald's restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, while attempting to entice wealthy investors (specifically fellow members at his country club) to open franchises, but encounters the same poor management ethic which doomed the original franchise efforts. Eventually Ray hits on the idea of franchising to middle-class investors, who have more incentive to be hands-on and are willing to follow the McDonald's formula. This proves successful, and new franchises begin opening across the Midwest, with Ray representing himself as the creator of McDonald's. During this time, Ray meets Rollie Smith, an upscale restaurant owner in Minnesota who wishes to invest, and his wife Joan, to whom Ray is immediately attracted. Despite his success, Ray begins to encounter financial difficulties as his share of franchise profits are limited due to his contract, which the McDonald brothers decline to renegotiate. Meanwhile, the owners are encountering higher than expected costs, particularly for refrigeration of large quantities of ice cream for milkshakes. Joan suggests a powdered milkshake as a way to avoid these costs, but the brothers consider it degrading to their food quality. Ray is called to the bank as his mortgage is past due, but this is overheard by Harry Sonneborn, a financial consultant, who requests to review Ray's books. Sonneborn realizes that the real profit opportunity is in providing real estate to the franchisees, which will not only provide a revenue stream, but give Ray leverage over his franchisees and the brothers. Ray incorporates a new company, Franchise Realty Corporation, and attracts new investors. This allows him to open new restaurants without the brothers approval. This upsets the brothers and emboldens Ray: he increasingly defies them by circumventing their authority and providing powdered milkshakes to all franchisees. Ray also divorces Ethel, who gets all his assets except any shares in his business. Ray renames his company the McDonald's Corporation and demands to be released from his contract and buy the McDonald brothers out, the news of which sends Mac into diabetic shock. Ray visits him in the hospital and offers a blank check to settle their business. The brothers agree to a $2.7 million lump sum payment (equivalent to $26 million in 2020) , ownership of their original restaurant in San Bernardino, and a 1% annual royalty, but when the time comes to finalize the agreement, Ray refuses to include the royalty in the settlement and instead offers it as a handshake deal. Afterwards, Dick asks Ray why he had to take over their business, when he could have easily stolen their idea and recreated it. Ray argues that the true value of McDonald's is the name itself, which expresses all the attributes of Americana (as opposed to his Czech Slavic-sounding name of Kroc). The McDonald brothers are forced to take their own name off the original restaurant and Ray opens a new McDonald's franchise directly across the street, finally putting the brothers out of business. Later in 1970, Ray is preparing a speech where he praises himself for his success and that he was able to achieve his success through persistence, and not through talent or a strong work ethic, in his elaborate mansion with his new wife, Joan. An epilogue reveals that the McDonald brothers were never paid their royalties, which would have been in the area of $100 million a year, and that everyday McDonald's feeds approximately 1% of the Earth's population. == Cast == * Michael Keaton as Ray Kroc * Nick Offerman as Richard McDonald * John Carroll Lynch as Maurice McDonald * Linda Cardellini as Joan Smith * B. J. Novak as Harry J. Sonneborn * Laura Dern as Ethel Kroc * Justin Randell Brooke as Fred Turner * Kate Kneeland as June Martino * Patrick Wilson as Rollie Smith * Wilbur Fitzgerald as Jerry Cullen ==Production== The screenplay for The Founder was written by Robert Siegel, based on Ray Kroc's autobiography, and on an unauthorized biography. According to early reports, the film was to be developed in the same vein as There Will Be Blood and The Social Network. According to Deadline Hollywood, it was ranked the 13th best unproduced script of 2014. In December 2014, John Lee Hancock was signed to direct the picture. Casting In February 2015, Michael Keaton was signed to the role of Ray Kroc. Laura Dern joined the film on May 11, 2015, to play Kroc's wife, Ethel Fleming, whom Kroc divorced in 1961. The next day, it was announced that Nick Offerman joined the film, set to play Richard \\"Dick\\" McDonald. On May 28, 2015, it was announced that B. J. Novak joined the film as Kroc's financial consultant, Harry J. Sonneborn. On June 9, 2015, it was reported that Linda Cardellini had joined the film, and on June 26, 2015, it was announced that John Carroll Lynch and Patrick Wilson had also been cast. Filming Principal photography on the film began in Newnan, Georgia, on June 1, 2015. Production designer Michael Corenblith had previously worked on films such as Apollo 13, Saving Mr. Banks and The Blind Side, where attention to historic detail was important. Corenblith worked from archival photos, training films, materials provided by the McDonald family, blueprints obtained from eBay, and research at the oldest McDonald's restaurant in Downey, California. The McDonald brothers original octagonal San Bernardino restaurant was built in Newnan in the parking lot of the Coweta County Administration building. After a month of searching for suitable location, an old-style McDonald's building set with the \\"golden arches\\" was constructed in a church parking lot in seven working days in Douglasville, Georgia. The set included a working kitchen with period-accurate kitchen equipment that was brought up to current code. Rearrangement of exterior features such as parking lot striping allowed that set to serve as each franchise location portrayed in the film. Both interior and exterior portions of the restaurant were modular, allowing countertops or entire wall sized glass panes to be removed to make room for cameras and other equipment. *Douglasville, Georgia site of McDonald's building set: The J. Mack Robinson College of Business Administration Building in Downtown Atlanta, which houses a Bank of America branch, served as the Illinois First Federal Savings & Loan association building for the film. Some interior sets such as the McDonald's' offices and Kroc's \\"Prince Castle Sales\\" interior were built on soundstages at EUE Screen Gems Studios in Atlanta. Atlanta's East Lake Golf Club served as Rolling Green Country Club in the film. ==Release== On March 2, 2015, The Weinstein Company paid $7 million for the film's distribution rights. On March 26, 2015, the studio set the film for a November 25, 2016 release date. In March 2016, the film was moved up to August 5, 2016. On July 13, 2016, the film's release date was delayed until a limited December 16, 2016 date, followed by a wide release on January 20, 2017. The film ultimately opened in the United States at Arclight Hollywood on December 7, 2016, in order to qualify for the 2017 Oscars, before expanding wide on January 20. In February 2017, FilmNation Entertainment, one of the film's production companies, sued The Weinstein Company for $15 million. The Weinstein Company released Gold on January 27, 2017, a week after The Founder, which FilmNation claimed was a breach of contract, saying the two companies had an agreement that no Weinstein Company film would be released within a week before or after The Founder. ==Reception== Box office The Founder grossed $12.8 million in the United-States and Canada and $11.3 million in others territories, for a worldwide total of $24.1 million. In North America, the film was expected to gross $3 million from 1,115 theaters in its opening weekend. It ended up earning $3.8 million, finishing 9th at the box office. In its second week, the film made $2.6 million, a drop of 23.4%. Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 81% based on 238 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.95/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Founder puts Michael Keaton's magnetic performance at the center of a smart, satisfying biopic that traces the rise of one of America's most influential businessmen ‚Äì and the birth of one of its most far- reaching industries.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score 66 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers gave the film three out of four stars, stating that director Hancock and screenwriter Siegel \\"strive hard ‚Äì and mostly succeed ‚Äì at keeping Hollywood sentiment out of the storytelling.... Set more than a half century ago, The Founder proves to be a movie for a divisive here and now. Step right up. You might just learn something.\\" RogerEbert.com's Matt Zoller Seitz gave the film three out of four stars, stating that despite the film over-relying on exposition and failing to skillfully incorporate Ray Kroc's personal life into the narrative, \\"I'd be lying if I said I hadn't thought about The Founder constantly since seeing it... It's an ad that becomes a warning before circling around and becoming another, darker kind of advertisement, and one of the most intriguing and surprising things about The Founder is that, in the end, it seems vaguely ashamed of itself for letting this happen\\".

The film is director Marc Brener's first feature, which he began to write just after the success of his short film Say It Ain't Solo (Best of Fest and Best Direction 2012 LA Comedy Festival). During production, the Metro North line between New York and Connecticut broke down. Since most of the cast was New York based, one crew member was pulled off all other duties to spend all their time figuring out what trains were running when, and to where, and how to get Vanessa Ray back to the city to shoot an episode of Blue Bloods at 7 AM when she had been on set until midnight. Sending the actors down the street in full costume attracted a crowd, which then had to be dispersed by the crew in order to shoot. People were curious what the colorful furry creatures were, asking, \\"What is a Rumperbutt?\\" The film used this phrase as part of the promotional campaign. In New Haven, at the Yale club Toad's, a number of extras didn't show up, making the it look empty. The production team made calls, trying to recruit anyone they knew in the area, because the club needed to be packed in order for the scene to work. A group of 60-70 student huggers appeared outside, and the first Assistant Director convinced them to come inside and see a free Mates of State show for a couple of hours. He didn't tell them it would be the same song played repeatedly, but he managed to wrangle them inside for an hour so that the scene could be filled with people. == Soundtrack == The Rumperbutts Soundtrack, written by Marc Brener and Mates of State, was released in May 2015.

Street, on Monday, June 1, 2015. Seventeen episodes were broadcast on the Fox Network, including episode nine on Tuesday, July 21, 2015, which was a special celebrating the tenth anniversary of the show titled \\"A Decade of Dance Special Edition\\". The sixteen regular episodes aired each week on Mondays, rather than Wednesdays as it had been in recent previous seasons. On September 14, 2015, Gaby Diaz won the competition and made history by becoming the first tap dancer to win the title. Auditions were held in Dallas TX, Detroit MI, Los Angeles CA, Memphis TN and New York NY. ==Judges== Series creator and executive producer Nigel Lythgoe returned as a member of the permanent judging panel, along with new permanent members Paula Abdul and Jason Derulo. The Team Captains, Travis Wall for Team Stage and tWitch for Team Street, were consulted on the selections for each team during the Vegas Call Backs. Mary Murphy, who was a permanent judge in seasons 3 through 6 and seasons 8 through to 11, has not returned. Host Cat Deeley returns for her eleventh consecutive season. ==Format== Season 12 featured a significant shift in format in that it was the first season where contestants were not selected based on their gender. Contestants were selected based on whether the competitor considered themselves a \\"Stage\\" dancer or a \\"Street\\" dancer. Stage styles included ballet, ballroom, contemporary, jazz, latin and tap, while the Street styles included freestyle, break dancing, hip-hop, and krump. Previously, the Dancers were selected across all genres and were divided by gender, with ten men and ten women being selected for the Top Twenty. This new format allowed the judges to respond to the strong number of female street dancers, and resulted in the Top Twenty, being eleven female and nine male dancers. Once the \\"Top 20\\" were selected the public voted on their favourite dancers and the three stage and three street dancers with fewest votes were in danger of elimination. The mediums through which the public could vote continued from the previous season's methods of online through the So You Think You Can Dance website on fox.com, the Fox Now app, and SMS. Voting via telephone was once again not available. The judges selected one stage and one street dancer from the remaining four dancers to be eliminated from the competition. When ten dancers were left in the competition, dancers were then eliminated purely on the votes from the public. Season 12 saw the introduction of the ability for the audience to save one contestant from the stage and street teams from elimination, but only for the first four eliminations. When the Bottom 6 dancers were revealed during the live show, a five-minute period for Twitter voting was announced with one vote allowed for stage and for street per Twitter account. Once those contestants were saved, the judges were allowed to save one more dancer from each team for the first three eliminations; since the fourth was a double elimination, the Twitter vote was the only save; the judges had no say that week. Once Top Ten were revealed, neither the audience nor judges were allowed to save any contestants. ==Auditions== Open auditions for season 12 were held in five cities beginning on January 24, 2015. Lythgoe, Abdul and Derulo were the three judges for all the auditions. In a change from previous years, the city auditions no longer had a \\"choreography round,\\" where dancers whom the judges thought might not be able to handle someone else's choreography were taught a routine they then had to perform. {  - center; background:#ccc;\\"  style=\\"width:120px;\\"Air Date  style=\\"width:225px;\\"Audition Venue  style=\\"width:170px;\\"City  style=\\"width:120px;\\"Audition Date -  June 22, 2015  Manhattan Center Grand Ballroom & Hammerstein Ballroom  New York, New York  January 24, 2015 -  June 1, 2015  Southern Methodist University, McFarlin Memorial Auditorium  Dallas, Texas  February 14, 2015 -  June 8, 2015  The Fillmore Detroit  Detroit, Michigan  February 22, 2015 -  June 1, 2015  Orpheum Theatre  Memphis, Tennessee  March 8, 2015 -  June 15, 2015  Orpheum Theatre  Los Angeles, California  March 15, 2015 } ==Callbacks== Callbacks were held in Las Vegas for season 12, a return to previous practice after season 11's were held in Los Angeles. A total of 219 dancers were given tickets at the five audition cities to the Las Vegas callbacks: 114 were selected for Team Stage, mentored by Travis Wall, and 105 were selected for Team Street, mentored by Stephen \\"tWitch\\" Boss.

Fossils from this period have allowed scientists to identify some of the species that existed during this transition, such as Tiktaalik and Acanthostega. Many of these species were also the first to develop adaptations suited to terrestrial over aquatic life, such as neck mobility and hindlimb locomotion. The late Devonian vertebrate transition was preceded by the plant and invertebrate terrestrial invasion. These invasions allowed for the appropriate niche development that would ultimately facilitate the vertebrate invasion. While the late Devonian event was the first land invasion by vertebrate organisms, aquatic species have continued to develop adaptations suited to terrestrial life (and vice versa) from the late Devonian to the Holocene. == Overview of transition == The vertebrate species that were important to the initial water to land transition can be sorted into five groups: Sarcopterygian fishes, prototetrapods, aquatic tetrapods, true tetrapods, and terrestrial tetrapods. Many morphological changes occurred throughout this transition. Mechanical support structures changed from fins to limbs, the method of locomotion changed from swimming to walking, respiratory structures changed from gills to lungs, feeding mechanisms changed from suction feeding to biting, and mode of reproduction changed from larval development to metamorphosis. == Evolutionary timeline == Lungfish appeared approximately 400 million years ago. It is a species that endured rapid evolution during the Devonian era, which became known as the dipnoan renaissance. The Acanthostega species, known as the fish with legs, is considered a tetrapod by structural findings but is postulated to have perhaps never left the aquatic environment. Its legs are not well-suited to support its weight. The bones of its forearm, the radius and ulna, are very thin at the wrist and also unable to support it on land. It also lacks a sacrum and strong ligaments at the hip, which would be integral to supporting the animal against gravity. In this sense, the species is considered a tetrapod but not one that has adapted well enough to walk on land. Furthermore, its gill bars have a supportive brace characterized for use as an underwater ear because it can pick up noise vibrations through the water. Tetrapods that adapted to terrestrial living adapted these gill bones to pick up sounds through air, and they later became the middle ear bones seen in mammalian tetrapods. Ichthyostega, on the other hand, is considered to be a fully terrestrial tetrapod that perhaps depended on water for its aquatic young. Comparisons between the skeletal features of Acanthostega and Ichthyostega reveal that they had different habits. Acanthostega is likely exclusive to an aquatic environment, while Ichthyostega is progressed in the aquatic to terrestrial transition by living dominantly on the shores. An evolutionary timeline of the late Devonian vertebrate terrestrial invasion demonstrates the changes that took place. A group of fish from the Givetian stage began developing limbs, and eventually evolved into aquatic tetrapods in the Famennian stage. Pederpes, Westlothiana, Protogyrinus, and Crassigyrinus descended from these species into the carboniferous period and were the first land vertebrates. A particularly important transitional species is one known as Tiktaalik. It has a fin, but the fin has bones within it that are similar to mammalian tetrapods. It has an upper arm bone, a lower arm bone, forearm bones, a wrist, and fingerlike projections. Essentially, it is a fin that can support the animal. Similarly, it also has a neck that allows independent head movement from the body. Its ribs are also able to support the body in gravity. Its skeletal features exhibit its ability as a fish that can live in shallow water and also venture onto land. == Driving factors == It took many millions of years for vertebrates to transition out of water onto land. During this time, both the competitive pressures that would push species out of the water and the niche occupation incentives that would pull species onto land were slowly building. The culmination of these driving factors are what ultimately facilitated the vertebrate transition.  Evolutionary pushes  Scientists believe that a long period of time where biotic and abiotic factors in the aquatic environment were unfavourable to certain aquatic organisms is what pushed their transition to shallower waters. Some of these push factors are environmental hypoxia, unfavourable aquatic temperatures, and increased salinity. Other constantly present factors such as predation, competition, waterborne diseases and parasites also contributed to the transition. A theory put forth by Joseph Barrell possibly helps explain what may have initiated these push factors to become relevant in the late Devonian. The extensive oxidized sediments that were present in Europe and North America during the late Devonian are evidence of severe droughts during this time. These droughts would cause small ponds and lakes to dry out, forcing certain aquatic organisms to move on land to find other bodies of water. Natural selection on these organisms eventually led to the evolution of the first terrestrial vertebrates.  Evolutionary pulls  The pull factors were secondary to the push factors, and only became significant once the pressures to leave the aquatic environment became significant. These were largely the niches and opportunities that were available for exploitation in the terrestrial environment, and include higher environmental oxygen partial pressures, favourable temperatures, and the lack of competitors and predators on land. The plants and invertebrates that had preceded the vertebrate invasion also provided opportunities in the form of abundant prey and lack of predators. == Barriers to transition == There were many challenges that the first land vertebrates faced. These challenges allowed for rapid natural selection and niche domination, resulting in an adaptive radiation that produced many different vertebrate land species in a relatively short period of time.  Sensory systems  Depending on the water depth at which a species lives, the visual perception of many aquatic species is better suited to darker environments than those on land. Similarly, hearing in aquatic organisms is better optimized for sounds underwater, where the speed and amplitude of sound is greater than in air.  Homeostasis  Homeostasis was almost definitely a challenge for land invading vertebrates. Gas exchange and water balance are highly different in water and in air. Homeostasis mechanisms suitable for a terrestrial environment may have been necessary to develop before these organisms invaded land.  Anatomy  The primary anatomical barrier is the development of lungs for proper gas exchange, however other anatomical barriers also exist. The stressors of the musculoskeletal system are different in air than they are in water, and the muscles and bones must be strong enough to withstand the increased effects of gravity on land.  Behaviour  Many behaviours, such as reproduction, are specifically optimized to a wet environment. Navigation and locomotion are also highly different in aquatic environments compared to terrestrial environments. == Notable adaptations ==  Placement of eyes on head  The ancestral species of tetrapods that lived entirely in water had tall and narrow skulls with eyes facing sideways and forwards to maximize visibility for predators and prey in the aquatic environment. As the ancestors of early tetrapods started inhabiting shallower waters, these species had flatter skulls with eyes at the tops of their heads, which made it possible to spot food above them. Once the tetrapods transitioned onto land, the lineages evolved to have tall and narrow skulls with eyes facing sideways and forwards again. This allowed them to navigate through the terrestrial environment and look for predators and prey.  Head and neck mobility  Fish do not have necks, so the head is directly connected to the shoulders. In contrast, land animals use necks to move their heads so they can look down to see the food on the ground. The greater the mobility of the neck, the more visibility the land animal has. As lineages moved from completely aquatic environments to shallower waters and land, they gradually evolved vertebral columns that increased neck mobility. The first neck vertebra that evolved permitted the animals to have flexion and extension of the head so that they can see up and down. The second neck vertebra evolved to allow rotation of the neck for moving the head left and right. As tetrapod species continued to evolve on land, adaptations included seven or more vertebrae, allowing increasing neck mobility.  Fused sacrum  The sacrum connects the pelvis and hindlimbs and is useful for motion on land. The aquatic ancestors of tetrapods did not have a sacrum, so it was speculated to have evolved for locomotive function exclusive to terrestrial environments. However, the Acanthostega species is one of the earliest lineages to have a sacrum, even though it is a fully aquatic species. Once species moved onto land, the trait was adapted for terrestrial locomotion support, which is evidenced by additional vertebrae fusing similarly to permit additional support. This is an example of exaptation, where a trait performs a function that did not arise through natural selection for its current use.  Lost adaptations  As the lineages evolved to adapt to terrestrial environments, many lost traits that were better suited for the aquatic environment. Many lost their gills, which were only useful for obtaining oxygen in water. Their tail fins became smaller. They lost the lateral line system, a network of canals along the skull and jaw that are sensitive to vibration, which does not work outside of an aquatic environment. == Future invasions == For successful land invasion, the species had several pre-adaptations like air-breathing and limb-based locomotion. Aspects such as reproduction and swallowing, however, have bound these species to the aquatic environment. These pre-adaptations have allowed vertebrates to venture onto land hundreds of times, but were not able to accomplish the same degree of prolific radiation into diverse terrestrial species. To understand the potential of future invasions, studies must evaluate the models of evolutionary steps taken in past invasions. The commonalities to current and future invasions may then be elucidated to predict the effects of environmental changes. ==See also== *Skeletal changes of organisms transitioning from water to land == References == Category:Evolution ","title":"Vertebrate land invasion"},{"id":"46333285","text":"Eye Eye was a Canadian rock band in the 1980s.Eye Eye at canoe.ca's Canadian Pop Music Encyclopedia. ==Background== The band had its roots in The Oh Nos, a Toronto band whose members included vocalist Bill Wood and guitarist Andy Ryan. After that band broke up, Wood formed the band Billy Club,\\"Eye Eye is growing up slowly and loving every minute of it\\". Windsor Star, October 22, 1986. while Ryan joined with drummer Mark Caporal to form Eye Eye as a duo, to which vocalist Michael Bell and bassist Doug Ruston were soon added. Both bands were finalists in Q107's Homegrown talent competition in 1984, which Eye Eye won; the following year, Eye Eye were also finalists in CBC Television's Rock WarsKeith Sharp, Music Express: The Rise, Fall & Resurrection of Canada's Music Magazine. Dundurn Press, 2014. . p. 143. and the Rock Express/MuchMusic Talent Search. With this success, the band entered the studio to record a demo which attracted interest from several record labels, but their early contract offers were withdrawn when Bell left the band. Wood then joined the band as Bell's replacement, and the band signed to Duke Street Records in late 1985. Their song \\"Essence of You\\" featured in the 1988 horror film Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood. ==Recording== They released the album Just in Time to Be Late in 1986 on Duke Street, and released the singles \\"Out on a Limb\\" and \\"X-Ray Eyes\\". \\"Out on a Limb\\" peaked at #51 in the RPM100 Singles chart the week of August 23, 1986,Chart for this week not archived at Library and Archives Canada; however, the following week's chart (RPM Volume 44, No. 23, August 30, 1986) puts the song at #51, with no change up or down from the previous week. and \\"X-Ray Eyes\\" peaked at #52 the week of November 22,RPM100.

It differs from the mandrakes found around the Mediterranean (Mandragora autumnalis and/or Mandragora officinarum) chiefly by being larger. ==Description== Mandragora turcomanica is a perennial herbaceous plant with a thick, often branched tap- root. It has little or no stem, the leaves being arranged in a basal rosette. The lowest leaves are up to long by across (less in Iranian specimens), the upper leaves being smaller. The lower leaves are usually irregularly toothed towards the end, the upper leaves being entire. Both sides of the leaves have scattered hairs, mainly along the veins. Flowering time is autumn to early spring (October to March) in Turkmenistan, late winter to early spring (February to March) in Iran. The flowers are borne in the centre of the rosette, on stalks (pedicels) up to long, usually singly but sometimes with up to 6 flowers. The five sepals are fused at the base to form a bell-shaped cup, lobed to about two thirds of its length of when in flower, lengthening in fruit. The five violet or purple petals are long and similarly fused and lobed. The stamens are included within the flower, joined to the fused petals at the base. The anthers are pale blue. The ripe fruit (a berry) is yellow to orange, in diameter, described as smelling of melons, and containing yellow to light brown seeds, by . ==Taxonomy== Mandragora turcomanica was first described in 1942 by Olga F. Mizgireva (–û–ª—å–≥–∞ –§–æ–º–∏–Ω–∏—á–Ω–∞ –ú–∏–∑–≥–∏—Ä—ë–≤–∞), a Turkmenian botanist and former artist. Mizgireva differentiated M. turcomanica from the Mediterranean mandrakes chiefly by the size of the plant (M. turcomanica is larger), the colour of the anthers and the relative sizes of the calyx and corolla. Ungricht et al. in their 1998 revision of the genus Mandragora retained M. turcomanica as a separate species, although they were not able to examine either any herbarium specimens or any live plants. They said that further study was needed to compare the ranges of variation of this species and their concept of Mandragora officinarum. In 2003, Akhani and Ghorbani reported the occurrence of M. turcomanica in Iran. They considered that it was sufficiently similar to the Mediterranean species that the rank of subspecies rather than species might be appropriate, although further study was needed. A 2010 molecular phylogenetic study placed M. turcomanica in a clade with the authors' concept of Mandragora autumnalis. ==Distribution and habitat== Mandragora turcomanica was first discovered in the south-western Kopet Dag mountains in Turkmenistan. Ungricht et al. queried whether it might also occur in the same mountain chain across the border in Iran. It was reported in Iran in 2003, near the village of Dahaneh close to the Golestan National Park. It was growing in gardens, where it had been transplanted from wild sources. In Turkmenistan, the species grows in shrubland, in ravines and on stony mountain slopes, especially among Paliurus spina-christi, at altitudes of . ==Conservation== Mandragora turcomanica was reported to be \\"on the verge of extinction\\" in Turkmenistan in 2001. There were said to be fewer than 500 plants in their natural habitats in Turkmenistan in 1999. Only about 50 plants were in cultivation in the sole Iranian location in 2010. ==Toxicity and uses== All the species of Mandragora are described as toxic and to have had traditional medicinal uses. Mizgireva is reported to have said in 1942 that it was used by the local people in Turkmenistan as a medicinal plant. In Iran, the discoverers of M. turcomanica described it as an \\"old medicinal and mythically important plant\\" but said that they were unable to discover earlier local uses. At the beginning of the growth cycle, the leaves of M. turcomanica contained 0.3% of alkaloids; later the roots contained 0.2%. By contrast the unripe fruits contained only 0.07% and the ripe seeds only 0.03%. The main alkaloids were the tropane alkaloids scopolamine (hyoscine), apohyoscine and hyoscyamine; others detected included belladonnine, norhyoscyamine, apoatropine, 3Œ±-trigloyloxytropan-6Œ≤-ol and tigloidine. Tropane alkaloids are potentially highly toxic. A wide range of lipids and lipid-like compounds were also identified. ==References== Category:Plants described in 1942 Category:Solanoideae Category:Poisonous plants ","title":"Mandragora turcomanica"},{"id":"46333565","text":"Peter Allen Peyser is a United States public affairs consultant.

Peyser's professional and personal lives intersected dramatically in 1991 when his wife at the time, Penny E. Gentilly, suffered a severe traumatic brain injury in an auto accident. Gentilly had recently left her post as Executive Director of the House of Representatives Democratic Caucus, where she was one of the highest ranking female staff Members on Capitol Hill. Legislation was pending at that time to make airbags and other head injury protection mandatory in autos sold in the U.S.. Because of both his and his wife's profile on Capitol Hill a group called Advocates for Auto and Highway Safety asked Peyser to join a pro bono lobbying effort on behalf of the legislation. The legislation was adopted as part of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) and signed into law by President George H.W.

He was familiar with the frankfurter, named for Frankfurt-am- Main in his native land. Feltman's operation began operating a pushcart pie wagon at the Coney Island beach in 1867, selling food to beachgoers. In 1867 he came up with the idea of inserting a frankfurter in a specially-made elongated roll which could conveniently be held and eaten on the street or at the beach. Feltman called his 1867 creation the Coney Island red hot, and it was soon the eating rage. Henry Collins Brown, a New York historian, explained its attraction: \\"It could be carried on the march, eaten on the sands between baths, consumed on a carousel, used as a baby's nipple to quiet an obstreperous infant, and had other economic appeals to the summer pleasure seeker\\". However, it took some time for the public to decide what to call Feltman's creation. Frankfurter, sausage, Coney Island red hot; none of them really captured the public's imagination. Coney Island chicken and weenie (from the Austrian wienerwurst) both had their proponents. But it was popular uncertainty about exactly what kind of meat was in these casings that ultimately determined that it would be called \\"hot dog\\". in 1871, Feltman leased land and began building his restaurant complex. It achieved its heyday in the 1920s, serving nearly 5,250,000 people a year, being a large restaurant complex with several restaurants, two bars, a beer garden, a famous carousel, and other attractions, and offering many types of food beyond hot dogs. Nathan Handwerker was working at Feltman's as a roll slicer when he quit to found rival Nathan's. Handwerker undersold Feltman, offering hot dogs for five cents instead of ten, at a more downscale operation than Feltman's, but eventually Nathan's became the most successful and iconic Coney Island hot dog purveyor and a nationwide brand which thrived into the 21st century. ==Family and business after his death== Feltman died in 1910 (he is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York) after which his family ran the business. Feltman's sons Charles L. Feltman and Alfred F. Feltman and grandson Charles A. Feltman, who had been operating the restaurant, sold the operation in 1946 to Alvan Kallman and others. The restaurant closed in 1954. The land was later used to construct the Astroland amusement park which opened in 1962 and closed in 2008, subsequently replaced by a new Luna Park. The last remnant of Feltman's ‚Äì the building that had housed the kitchen ‚Äì was demolished in 2010. Charles' Feltman's grandson Charles A. Feltman invented the Shooting Star Tommy Gun, a pneumatic BB machine gun used in fair and amusement park stalls for many decades and continuing well into the 21st century (the device is used by players to shoot out all traces of a red star on a paper target). Shooting Star Games was founded by Charles A. Feltman and continues to manufacture the device in the 21st century. There was for years a shooting gallery on the original Feltman's site. In the 2010s, entrepreneur Michael Quinn opened a hot dog emporium named Feltman's of Coney Island in New York's East Village, in homage to the original Feltman's and on Memorial Day, 2017, he cut the ribbon on a Coney Island location in the very structure where the aforementioned shooting gallery had been located, on the original Feltman's site. ==References== Category:1841 births Category:1910 deaths Category:Hot dogs Category:People from Brooklyn Category:German emigrants to the United States ","title":"Charles Feltman"},{"id":"46333675","text":"The United Nations Secretariat, in April 2010, pursuant to Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2002/5, promulgated United Nations Staff Selection System administrative instruction (ST/AI 2010/3) dated 22 April 2010. Administrative instruction ST/AI 2010/3 supersedes and abolishes the administrative instructions titled \\"Staff selection system\\" (ST/AI/ 2006/3/Rev.1), \\"Technical cooperation personnel and OPAS officers\\" (ST/AI/297 and Add.1), and \\"Movement of staff from the Field Service category to the Professional category\\" (ST/AI/360/Rev.1 and Corr.1). The new administrative instruction will remain in effect \\"until specifically amended or abolished\\". ST/AI 2010/3 applies to all appointments up to the D-2 level that have contracts of 1 year or longer. It excludes appointments at the Assistant Secretary-General and Under- Secretary-General levels, temporary appointments, and appointment of staff selected through a competitive examination. The intent of the new system is to integrate \\"recruitment, placement, promotion and mobility of staff within the Secretariat\\" up to and including D-1 and equivalent posts. The new system introduces a new requirement of periodic 'mobility' for promotion for \\"Staff in the Professional and above categories, up to and including those at the D-2 level\\". == ST/SGB and ST/AI== In the hierarchy of UN laws, ST/Secretary- General bulletins (ST/SGB) are higher than ST/AI. ST/SGB are bulletins that promulgate \\"Regulations adopted by the General Assembly, establish Financial Rules, Staff Rules and the organizational structure of the Secretariat and contain important decisions of policy. They are issued by the Secretary- General and remain in effect from a given date until specifically amended or abolished\\". The ST/AI series are administrative instructions that implement ST/SGB. These \\"prescribe instructions and procedures ... and set forth office practices and procedures to be applied in more than one department of the Secretariat. These instructions remain in effect from a given date until specifically amended or abolished\\". == Staff Selection System and gender equality in the UN == Affirmative measures to achieve gender equality in the UN system are contained in administrative instruction ST/AI/1999/9, \\"Special Measures for the Achievement of Gender Equality\\". This remains in force, and is listed under the heading Appointments, placement and promotion in the Annual Index to Administrative Issuance along with the administrative instruction on the Staff Selection System (ST/AI/2010/3). Since 2010, the UN Secretariat has contended that section 13.3 of the new Staff Selection System (ST/AI 2010/3) supersedes the administrative instruction on gender equality (ST/AI 1999/9), especially its section 1.8 on affirmative action as it is inconsistent with 2010/3. Similar provisions for gender equality existed in earlier Staff Selection System administrative instructions (ST/AI/2006/3). However, it has been reported that administrative instruction addressing gender equality in the UN has become a more prominent issue since 2010 and has been implemented reluctantly with diminishing enthusiasm by UN entities. UN Women, in contrast, continues to affirm that ST/AI/1999/9 is in effect and applicable. The Secretary General has also reiterated to the general assembly that ST/AI/1999/9 remains in effect. == Manuals on staff selection== The administrative instructions on the Staff Selection System have been supplemented with several manuals that are designed to serve as guidance on the responsibilities of (a) the head of the department, (b) the hiring manager, (c) the staff member/applicant, (d) the central review body members, (e) the recruiter (namely, the Office of Human Resources Management [OHRM]), as well as others. The main manuals, which are periodically updated by OHRM, are: (a) The Applicant's Manual: Manual for the Applicant on the Staff Selection System (Inspira); and (b) Manual for the Recruiter on the Staff Selection System. ==Jurisprudence== The Staff Selection System (ST/AI 2010/3) has been a frequent cause of litigation, especially with regard to affirmative action policies promulgated in ST/AI 1999/9. UN tribunals have ruled in favor of the UN gender equality policies in ST/AI 1999/9. Recent tribunal judgements are: Appleton (2012) In August 2012, the tribunal acknowledged that \\"The general provisions to give women preferential treatment for appointments are found in ST/AI/1999/9\\" and that during \\"selection, vacancies shall be filled by a woman if her qualifications (a) meet the requirements for the vacant post and (b) are substantially equal or superior to those of competing male candidates (sec. 1.8)\\"Judgment No.: UNDT/2012/125 Date: 14 August 2012 UNITED NATIONS DISPUTE TRIBUNAL:APPLETON v. SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS, http://www.un.org/en/oaj/files/undt/judgments/undt-2012-125.pdf As a result, the tribunal confirmed the mandatory character of the \\"rules in ST/AI/1999/9 concerning preferential treatment of women in selection processes\\". Farrimond (2014) In August 2014, the UN administration accepted in the United Nations Dispute Tribunal that administrative instruction ST/AI/1999/9 was valid in a selection process. In examining whether the relevant sections of ST/AI 1999/9 had \\"been correctly applied to the case at hand\\", the tribunal concluded that the administration failed to respect the provisions of ST/AI 1999/9 and rescinded the initial selection decision for this and other infractions. ==See also== *United Nations Secretariat *Special measures for gender equality in the United Nations ==References External links == *Manual for the Applicant on the Staff Selection System *Manual for the Recruiter on the Staff Selection System *United Nations Human Resources Fact Sheet * Legislative basis for the UN Mandate on Representation of Women in the United Nations System Category:United Nations Secretariat Category:United Nations legislation Category:United Nations documents Category:Human resource management ","title":"United Nations Staff Selection System"},{"id":"46333677","text":"The Quiksilver Pro Gold Coast 2015 was an event of the Association of Surfing Professionals for 2015 ASP World Tour.

The Kurganets-25 will evolve into various models, gradually replacing BMP, BMD, MT-LB and other types of tracked Soviet armored platforms. The Kurganets-25 will have modular armor that can be upgraded for specific threats. The Kurganets-25 IFV and APC variants were first seen in public (initially with the turret and main armament shrouded) during rehearsals for the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade. If preliminary and state tests go well, serial production could begin by 2016. ==Design== The Kurganets-25 is designed to bring the Russian tracked troop carrier fleet up to standard with Western designs like the American M2 Bradley and British Warrior, which outclassed their Soviet Cold War BMP-series counterparts. Kurganets-25 is based on Armata Universal Combat Platform while being lighter than the T-15 Armata \\"heavy IFV\\" based on the same and similar to wheeled VPK-7829 Bumerang. There are two versions of the vehicle: a heavily armed infantry fighting vehicle carrying 6-7 troops; and a lightly armed APC carrying 8 troops. Other variants proposed for the Kurganets include an armored ambulance, an 82 mm Vasilek mortar carrier, anti- tank vehicle, armored recovery vehicle, a reconnaissance vehicle, a command vehicle, and an armored engineering vehicle.Russia Hopes Its New Super Combat Vehicle Will Rule the Battlefield - Nationalinterest.org, 30 July 2016 The vehicle represents a departure from traditional Russian low profile designs, having a higher floor more suited for mounted combat rather than troop carrying, which also provides better IED and mine protection. While the T-15 is expected to be deployed with T-14 tanks in armored formations, Kurganets-25 platforms will equip mechanized units.Kurganets-25 ‚Äì a new family of medium troop carriers from Russia - Defense-Update.com, 24 April 2015 Armament The Kurganets-25 IFV features the Bumerang-BM remote control turret with its 2A42 30 mm autocannon, a 7.62 mm coaxial PKT machine gun and a bank of two Kornet-EM anti-tank guided missiles on either side. The Kurganets-25 APC variant has a 12.7 mm MG RWS instead of the Bumerang-BM turret. An SPAAG version with a 57 mm autocannon and a Kurganets-25 SPG with a 125 mm are planned. Mobility The Kurganets-25 weighs 25 tonnes. This allows the Kurganets-25 to be light enough to be mobile on water. The maximum speed of the vehicle is 80 km/h on land and 10 km/h on water. Both the IFV and APC variants have a front-mounted engine rated at 800 hp. Protection The Kurganets-25 IFV has 360-degree coverage from its active protection system launcher tubes. This APS is smaller than the one found on the T-14 Armata and T-15, but like the T-15, it's attached close the top of the hull. A two-part projectile detection system is placed on various places on the hull and turret. The Kurganets-25 APC variant, when revealed in the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade, had a scaled down APS systems which were attached only to the turret. The APC variant had no APS tubes attached to the hull. Ergonomics and Crew According to the first vice president and co-owner of Concern Tractor Plants, Albert Bakov, the Kurganets-25 uses a console similar to a Sony PlayStation gamepad. It is wider than previous generations of Russian APCs and IFVs. Also, the front located engine increases crew comfort and ease of access. ==Variants== A few different versions of Kurganets-25 are in development. * Kurganets-25 IFV (Industrial designation ‚Äì Object 693); * Kurganets-25 APC (Industrial designation ‚Äì Object 695). * Kurganets-25 ARV ‚Äì Equipped wth a crane, a winch and armed with a 12.7mm heavy machine gun. ==Operators== * ‚Äì Russian Armed Forces would receive the first batch of Kurganets-25 IFVs for trials in 2019. ==See also== * Bumerang-BM * VPK-7829 Bumerang * T-15 Armata * Typhoon (AFV family) ==References Category:Infantry fighting vehicles Category:Infantry fighting vehicles of Russia Category:Armoured personnel carriers of Russia Category:Amphibious infantry fighting vehicles Category:Amphibious armoured personnel carriers Category:Tracked infantry fighting vehicles Category:Armoured personnel carriers of the post‚ÄìCold War period Category:Kurganmashzavod products ","title":"Kurganets-25"},{"id":"46333723","text":"Nina Johnsen is a Norwegian former professional racing cyclist.

He amassed La Liga totals of 176 games and three goals during seven seasons, representing Barcelona, Mallorca, Burgos, Lleida and Espanyol. He added 117/3 in Segunda Divisi√≥n, in a 21-year senior career where he also competed professionally in Portugal. ==Club career== Herrera was born in Copenhagen, Denmark to Spanish parents, at the time working in the country. He graduated from FC Barcelona's La Masia, after joining their youth system at the age of 11. During the 1990‚Äì91 season, after making his senior debuts with the reserves and the third team, manager Johann Cruyff allowed Herrera to appear in five competitive games with the main squad. His debut occurred on 5 December 1990 in a 0‚Äì1 home loss against Real Madrid for the Supercopa de Espa√±a, and he also started in the second leg which ended with a 1‚Äì4 defeat; on 5 May 1991, as they had already been crowned champions, he played his first match in La Liga, coming on as a late substitute for Michael Laudrup in a 2‚Äì1 home win over Real Zaragoza. Herrera spent the following three campaigns on loan, being relegated from the top division with RCD Mallorca, Real Burgos CF and UE Lleida. In between those spells, he was demoted to Barcelona's B-team; he scored his first goal in the competition on 3 November 1991, but in a 1‚Äì2 home defeat to Athletic Bilbao. In the summer of 1994, 25-year-old Herrera moved across the Camp Nou and signed with RCD Espa√±ol ‚Äì soon to be renamed Espanyol. He rarely missed a league match with his new club, often partnering Argentine Mauricio Pochettino in the centre of the defence; at the end of 1994‚Äì95, in which he started in all his 36 appearances to help to a sixth-place finish straight out of Segunda Divisi√≥n, he was voted Defender of the Year by magazine Don Bal√≥n. Even though he still had a contract running, in 1997 Herrera asked to be released alleging personal reasons, and moved to the Canary Islands with UD Las Palmas for 125 million pesetas. Subsequently, he represented fellow second level side CD Logro√±√©s. After a spell in the Portuguese Primeira Liga with S.C. Farense, being briefly coached by compatriot Paco Fortes and also suffering a serious knee injury early into his second year, which ended in relegation, Herrera returned to Spain and played exclusively in lower league or amateur football, retiring at 39.

It is a diesel-electric attack submarine which is designed by DCNS (French naval defence and energy company) and was manufactured at Mazagon Dock Limited in Mumbai. == Etymology and motto == The ship inherits its name from INS Kalvari (S23) which served in the Indian Navy from 1967 to 1996. Kalvari is the Malayalam word for tiger shark, a deep-sea predator in the Indian Ocean. The name symbolizes agility, strength and predatory power. The tiger shark (Galeocerdo Cuvier) is a species of requiem shark which are found in tropical and temperate waters. The ship's motto is \\"Ever Onward\\" which represents the submarine's zeal and indomitable spirit. == History and construction == The submarine was designated as Yard 11875 at Mazagon Dock Limited and construction began on 14 December 2006 with the first cutting of steel. The five separate sections of the submarine were welded together, called \\"Boot Together\\", on 30 July 2014. She was undocked to a pontoon from the East Yard dock on 6 April 2015 in the presence of Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar. She is the first Indian Naval vessel to be built using a modular approach. After completing the important milestones of vacuum test and battery loading, she was launched at the Naval Dockyard on 27 October 2015 by Ritu Shrawat, wife of then CMD, Rear Admiral R K Shrawat (Retd). She was brought back to Mazagon Dock Limited for completion of the Basin trials and Harbour Acceptance trials phase. After conquering numerous challenges faced during the ‚ÄòSetting to Work‚Äô phase and undergoing rigorous Harbour tests & trials to the complete satisfaction of the customer, she commenced sea trials on 1 May 2016. She was expected to be inducted into the Indian Navy fleet in 2012 but this was delayed.

Like P.T. Barnum, his neighbor on Broadway, Genin had a remarkable knack for using publicity to boost his business. In 1850, at Barnum's urging, Genin made the winning auction bid of $225 for the first seat sold for the sensational cross-country tour by the singer Jenny Lind, the Swedish Nightingale, and reaped the tremendous publicity that followed. Every important newspaper in the country reported Genin's bid. Barnum wrote in his \\"Struggles and Triumphs\\" (1865) that \\"John N. Genin, the hatter, laid the foundation of his fortune\\" with that purchase. Throughout the country, men and women took off their hats to check whether they were wearing \\"a Genin\\". When the Hungarian patriot Louis Kossuth came to New York City in 1851, Genin again seized the moment. He met Kossuth's ship off Sandy Hook, and gave him and his followers hats from his \\"dead stock\\", with black feathers added, for them to wear as they paraded up Broadway. Genin, as soon as the parade was over, briskly sold the rest of his \\"dead stock\\". In 1852, when Amelia Bloomer needed a hat to go with the Bloomer-pants outfit she had designed, she turned to Genin, who produced the first round hat for fashionable young women, giving them an alternative to the bonnet. A proposed design for Genin's bridge across Broadway. Wood engraving by J. W. Orr. When public officials, in 1854, ignored public demands for cleaner streets, Genin took the bull by the horns, and hired, at his own expense, one hundred men and carts to do the work. For this act he was offered the nomination for mayor, but declined the honor, preferring to remain in the hat business. But John Genin's greatest scheme was a pedestrian bridge across Broadway. From the late 1830s to the early 1860s, New York City's fashionable shopping area was on Broadway, near City Hall. That area, particularly where Park Row met Broadway, was a traffic nightmare, and only the most adventurous pedestrians even tried to cross the street there. One wag claimed that it took \\"more skill to cross Broadway than to cross the Atlantic in a clamboat\\". Things got so bad that a special squad of policeman was detailed to help shoppers get from one side of Broadway to the other. ==References== 1\\\\. Richman, Jeffrey I.

The Board sought to provide relief for Jewish immigrants and soon became the central provider of relief for the Jewish poor in London. After an amalgamation with other charities in the 1990s, the Jewish Board of Guardians became Jewish Care, an organization that still exists today. ==Early history and foundation== The Jewish Board of Guardians was a charity established in the East End of London by members of the Jewish community in 1859.Magnus, p. 9 The situation of the Jewish poor in London was increasingly problematic by the late 19th century. Christian missionaries and conversionists targeted the Jewish poor, which became a concern for their co-religionists. Members of the Jewish community deemed existing methods of relief for the Jewish poor in London as insufficient.Magnus, p. 10 The Board of Guardians was established to consolidate and effectively provide relief where other charities had failed. The Board of Guardians was established because of the introduction of the 1834 Poor Law amendments by secular authorities.Black, p. 71 These laws applied a workhouse test to qualify for poor relief; the workhouse was unsuitable for the Jewish community because of their special religious constraints and requirements. The three main Ashkenazi synagogues of London thus established the Board of Guardians. These were the Great Synagogue, the Hambro' Synagogue, and the New Synagogue. These establishments voted in 1958 to establish a conjoint committee to tackle the issue of the Jewish poor. The first meeting of the Jewish Board of Guardians was held at the Great Synagogue chambers on March 16, 1859. The Board was initially led by Ephraim Alex, overseer of the poor for the Great Synagogue, who secured a grant of less than ¬£500 from the three synagogues to assess the Jewish poor in London.Magnus, p. 24 The seventeen members who founded the Board were delegates of the Ashkenazi synagogues. They included financiers, businessmen and professionals. Lionel Louis Cohen was the honorary secretary of the Board until he succeeded Alex and became president of the Board in 1869.Rozin Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild began terms as Treasurer in 1868 and 1875.Thornton, Dora (2001), \\"From Waddesdon to the British Museum: Baron Ferdinand Rothschild and his cabinet collection\\", p. 57, Journal of the History of Collections, 2001, Volume 13, Issue 2, pp. 191‚Äì213, doi: 10.1093/jhc/13.2.191 The headquarters were initially an extension on the Jewish Soup Kitchen, but later moved to Middlesex Street.Black, p. 73 On its foundation the Board stated that, ‚Äúthe teachings of religion, the impulses of humanity and the doctrines of social sciences alike concur in recommending and consecrating an enlarged and expansive charity, and in distinguishing it from mere alms-giving\\".Magnus, p.26 The Board later became concerned with the poor from the Netherlands, Germany, and increasingly Eastern Europe. In their 29th annual report, the Board stated that \\"Organization such as possessed by the board is necessary from an economic point of view, so as to practically eradicate the great problem of relief in a manner which will do the largest amount of good with the means at disposal; and the fact must not be ignored that a larger expenditure is not a sure indication of an increase in pauperperism and nursing but may reflect a removal of poverty by a prompt wrestling with discovered suffering through the bestowal of an adequate and measured assistance.\\"The Jewish Board of Guardians 29th annual report, p. 10 ==Work== Initial aims The Board of Guardians was established to help the poor Jewish community in London. The Board aimed to create a system that would help this community without creating a class dependent on it for survival. As Eugene C. Black states,\\"the board strove to avoid any form of aid that might pauperise the recipient or crease passive dependency\\".Black, p. 93 Unlike other Victorian charities the Board could not rely on the workhouse and had to create useful and novel practices to help their own community. The Board aimed to provide relief that would help others in the long term. \\"From the outset the Board found it hard to meet the needs of the ever-increasing poor Jewish community\\".Black, p. 78 The Board relied on donations from eminent Jewish families to fund their charitable work. However, the needs of the community soon expanded far past the resources available.Magnus, p. 40 As Laurie Magnus states in the volume to commemorate the first fifty years of the board, \\"from the very onset of its work the board found it difficult to maintain this equilibrium. They community required its services. And this fact, proved somewhat embarrassing when the fresh duties were thrust upon the board without the corresponding resources\\". Eligibility for relief The Board was particular about to whom charitable relief was provided. There was no relief without inquiry. Visiting officers made the appropriate checks to ensure that the Board's limited resources were not wasted. This meant they visited every applicant.Magnus, p. 46 Black similarly states that \\"Home visits went hand in hand with relief and the Board reinvestigated any case lasting over six months\\".Black, p. 78 The relief provided by the Board was also not available to new immigrants until after a six-month initial period.Magnus, p. 92 This allowed the Board to advertise in continental papers against migration to England in hope of receiving aid. In using this method, the Board of Guardians hoped to stem the tide of foreign migration.Magnus, p. 91 By 1896 the investigation of cases was assigned to an official committee, who brought legal action against those they deemed to be unworthy or misusing the Board's charity. Applicants for relief The application of relief from the Jewish Board of Guardians was from those, especially within the Jewish community who were in great need. The scope of people who applied for relief from the board was expansive but included groups such as: widows, children, orphans, asylum seekers and people seeking medical or financial aid. The 1905 Annual Report of the Board shows that the highest group of people receiving temporary relief was those with illnesses and the lowest being those with husbands in prison.Jewish Board of Guardians' Annual Report 1905 Deserted wives received little help. The Board tried to help those they considered to be most in need, more so than deserted wives. However, because of a lack of alternative systems of relief the Board decided they had to help them. The Board not only attempted to identify those who should be helped by categorisation such as orphans and widows, they also attempted to do it through government categorisation of the deserving and undeserving poor. \\"The deserving were those in need who are unable to work because they are too old, disabled, or too sick.\\" Hernist.org Hqwever, ‚Äòthe undeserving were people who didn‚Äôt want to work but could, these were the people the Board tried to avoid helping.' Furthermore, the number of applicants fluctuated, with \\"the number of poor immigrants including wives and children ranging annually from about 250-1,000 varying on the condition in other countries.\\"Lipman, p. 32 \\"The Board focused on the welfare of the children as they were the future and would also prevent further generations of Jewish poor\\".Lipman, p. 111 As seen above, the main group of applicants were immigrants, said to be escaping persecution. Lipman emphasises this majority by stating that, \\"native born applicants, from 1800-1900 were only 10% of all applicants.\\"Lipman, p. 83 Although, this is not the figures of applicants that have recently arrived in the country, as \\"earlier immigrants had become absorbed in the resident population and had become reliant on the Board for relief.\\" From 1889 to 1914, the Jewish Board of Guardians was the primary organization that dealt with the foreign poor in a narrow area of the East End which suffered from a great deal of overcrowding. ==Controlling the Immigration of the Jewish Poor== Although the Board had been providing relief to the Jewish poor since 1859, it was not used to dealing with the vast numbers of Jews that began to settle in London, resulting in a number of issues. These issues included problems of overcrowding which caused increases in rent and poor living conditions. Bad living conditions and appalling sanitation resulted in the spread of illness and disease, meaning medical relief was limited. There was also higher competition for jobs and widespread unemployment. The Board were concerned with the number of Jews potentially arriving to seek relief temporarily instead of aiming for long-term self-improvement. Therefore a six-month rule was devised, which was primarily a probation period for the Jewish immigrants. Relief was not given unless Jews had been in the country for at least six months. This rule was proposed by Ephraim Alex, the first president of the Board (1859‚Äì69), in, A Scheme for a Board of Guardians, to be formed for the relief of the necessitious foreign poor.Rozin, p.134 However, relief was distributed to the new immigrants in cases of emergency. In the 1880s it became apparent that the elite would be faced with an influx on immigration as immigrants left Eastern Europe either to start a new life in England, or to use England as a temporary stopping point as they aspired to reach America. The Board initiated several methods to control immigration, as it became transparently impossible to limit it, such as transmigration, dispersion and repatriation.Jews were either emigrated on to countries such as America, Canada and Australia or repatriated back. From 1881-1914, the Board helped 17,087 people to settle in London, however, it managed to reduce overcrowding by emigrating 8,152 and repatriating 7,574 people. Nathan S. Joseph, chairman of the Executive of the Conjoint Committee of the Russo-Jewish Committee and Board of Guardians 1893-1909, to differentiate the ‚Äòindustrial fitness‚Äô of the Jewish immigrants. The classification was as followed: \\"firstly, skilled artisans, who were vigorous, robust and healthy, secondly, those fit to transmigrate and thirdly, the poor and weak, the adventurer and mendicant.\\"Jewish Chronicle, 12 March 1893, quoted by Rozin, p.140 Generally, those who were put into the first category, mainly being young, fit and healthy were offered help to transmigrate. More immigrants, however were repatriated as it was the most cost efficient option. Historian Vivian D. Lipman, argued that it is Jewish tradition \\"to give applicants enough to get them to get them on to the next town and the next overseer.\\" ==Systems of Relief== Loans The Board provided relief through the use of loans. \\"Money was almost never used and the Board considered cash relief an ultimate last resort.\\" The Board established a loans committee that oversaw the distributions by the charity. \\"In its first 17 years the Board provided 1767 loans totaling ¬£226322\\". Despite their wish to keep them low, loans given by the Board did increase. One of the initial reliefs given by the Board was the loaning of sewing machines. \\"These machines were lent to deserving borrowers, who paid for them in installments.\\" Magnus, p.27 The Board used the money gained from this to buy more machines and repeat the process. \\"By 1864 they had managed to by 26 machines.\\" This system of relief was later taken over by Messrs Singer themselves. \\"In 1866 the loans committee became a department in itself, under the supervisions of David Benjamin, a benefactor of the committee.\\"Magnus, p.29 Under this new system the loans could be organized and controlled more closely. It also allowed the more respectable classes to apply for relief in private separately to the wider public. The security of the loans committee created a confidence, which encouraged donations. The provisions attached to the loans also meant they were not misused. \\"In 1887 the capital of the loans committee was increased and donations such as the 3,000,000 francs by Baronesse de Hirsch allowed the committee to expand.\\"Magnus, p.35 By 1907 it had an annual turnover of ¬£13,000. Education, Apprenticeships and Employment The Jewish Board of Guardians main aim was to create a self-supporting class. They focused on education and apprenticing the future generations to stop them becoming impoverished. \\"The work committee acted in conjunction with the loans committee and became the industrial committee in 1872.\\"Magnus, p.31 The Board aimed to provide apprenticeships for boys and girls. Laurie Magnus states that, \\"Following the loans of sewing machines the industrial committee used this money to accomplish 2 main purposes: #Loan of tools and implements to carpenters, cabinet makers, show-makers, printers, book-binders and other mechanics on the same basis as the on which the loans of sewing-machines to tailors and umbrella makers had hitherto conducted. #Giving security for tailors and mechanics to enable them to obtain work from warehouses and workshops.\\" \\"In 1903 a ladies sub-committee was enacted which focused on the apprenticeship of girls\\".Magnus, p.37 The Board considered education one of its main aims, to create an educated class and to keep skilled workers in long-term employment.

The Board vowed to help this class of the strange poor which mainly came from Europe. \\"In 1881 the problem of immigration was increased by the influx of immigrants seeking refuge from the pogroms of Russia...The Board of Guardians created a joint committee with the Mansion House Fund to tackle this issue.\\" \\"By 1885 the problem had further increased and the Board set up temporary shelters.\\"Magnus, p.98 The Board of Guardians also encouraged repatriation and transmigration. They sent many migrants back to their countries of origin, as well as on to other countries, especially the United States. \\"The Board denied welfare to those who had been in the country less than six months\\". The Jewish Board of Guardians did not want the new immigrants to become burdens on the preexisting community. Eugene C Black states,\\"those who could not adapt and were poor prospects for emigration, Board leaders argued, should not remain burdens on the community\\".Black, p.96 Those who came to England could not necessarily be transmigrated by the Board on to countries such as the United States. \\"In 1886 authorities in New York denied entry to those who could not show they had the means of supporting themselves nor a benefactor to rely on.\\"Magnus, p.99 They faced similar problems in Hamburg and the Board could not support these migrants. The Board paid for immigrates travel to Hamburg and on to other countries if they failed to find employment in England. In September 1886, the Hamburg authorities stopped this policy.Magnus, p.100 This thus increased the number staying in England and increased the Board's work.

Laurie Magnus states that,\\"The Board believed that the central problem of relief lay in the homes of the poor\\". The dwelling of the East End population was considered to be inadequate and central to the problem of poverty. Magnus continued...\\"The Board established Medical and Sanitary committees to tackle this problem. The medical Board was given medical officers and ¬£293 and 18s to solve this issue...The issues faced by the Board included insufficient food and clothing, a neglect of proper standards of cleanliness, bad ventilation, overcrowded dwellings and deficient light...The visiting committee, which was established in 1862, dealt with housing'\\".Magnus, p. 110/112 Furthermore, they looked at the conditions of the Jewish quarters and reported their findings to The Jewish Board of Guardians. \\"The medical Board provided nursing until 1906.\\"Magnus, p.124 \\"The prescriptions distributed by the Board were fulfilled by the Metropolitan Free Hospital...By 1871 visits and applications for medical relief reached 41,000...By 1873 the medical committee was completely reorganized to stop a misuse of funds...The Board later disbanded the medical committee in favour of state organized relief. To ensure sanitary efficiency, as well as clean homes and water supplies, the Board established a sanitary committee. The Sanitary Committee visited 2,317 cases and visited 132 workshops\\"Magnus, p.116 This committee was remodelled and became the Health Committee. ==Partnerships== The Russo-Jewish Committee was established in 1882 to oversee all matters of Jewish immigrants. The Conjoint Committee an amalgamation of the Russo-Jewish Committee and the Jewish Board of Guardians, aimed to tackle all matters of immigration. This committee collaborated with the Board (between 1893 and 1909) and became the primary source of aid to the Jewish poor. \\"The Conjoint Committee was the lineal descendent of the Mansion House Committee \\"Magnus p.94 Despite the fact that the two organizations were a partnership, the Board of Guardians continued to dominate the majority of decisions. Sir Julian Goldsmid, chairman of the Russo-Jewish Committee, cooperated with Benjamin Cohen, who was the president of the Jewish Board of Guardians at this time. Any disagreements between the two leaders were settled by the interests of the elite as a whole. As a result of the six month rule, other charities developed in order to aid the immigrants.\\"In the process of adjustment those immigrants were helped by relatives, kinsmen, landsleit, and alternative smaller and more flexible institutions, such as Hevras\\" Rozin, p.137-138 Hevras, a charity also established in the East End, offered help for immigrants to overcome the distress‚Äô caused by the immigration process. This charity was less hierarchical and more democratic than the Board. For many, Hevras represented traditional Jewish morals within the charities policies. Many immigrants turned to Hevras because of the Board of Guardians restrictive policies, such as the six-month rule. ==Public Opinion and the Aliens Act== Public opinion of the Jewish Poor in London is hugely significant in understanding why the Board was created, and in part, what the Board sought to achieve. Bad public opinion regarding foreign poor was due to the massive influx of immigration effecting London‚Äôs resources and the commonly held myth of \\"the Dirty Jew being reinforced by the foreign poor.\\"Jbooks.com Even Alfred Cohen a brother of Leonard Cohen, who was a Board member, regarded alien Jews as \\"dirty squalid and unpleasant.\\" \\"The foreign poor were accused of causing overcrowding, increases in rents and demands for premiums.\\"Lipman, p.89 The Aliens Act of 1905 can be seen as responding to this negative public opinion of immigrants, non-specifically Jewish. However, the act \\"is generally believed to have been chiefly a response to heavy East European Jewish immigration into Britain after 1880.\\"Jewishvirtallibrary.org This therefore shows correlation with Jewish immigration. The act was also created in part because of negative public view of the migrant Jewish community; with \\"agitation to restrict Jewish immigration beginning in the 1880s and becoming more outspoken through the actions of a number of right-wing groups and activists.\\"Jewishviruallibrary.org The Aliens act was the \\"first piece of immigration legislation in 20th century Britain\\" and the first \\"to define some groups of migrants as undesirable.\\"20tcenturylondon.org.uk It is said that, \\"The Act ensured that leave to land could be withheld if the immigrant was judged to be undesirable by falling into one of four categories: a) if he cannot show that he has in his possession ... the means of decently supporting himself and his dependents ...; 'b) if he is a lunatic or an idiot or owing to any disease of infirmity liable to become a charge upon the public rates ...; c) 'if he has been sentenced in a foreign country for a crime, not being an offence of a political character ...; or d) if an expulsion order under this act has (already) been made.\\"20thcenturylondon.org.uk The above statement can be seen to relate to the Board‚Äôs own category of defining applicants as deserving or undeserving but also represents the stereotypes immigrants may receive from the outburst of negative public opinion. \\"The Board members were of a higher social stance than the Jewish immigrants and poor they were helping.\\"Rozin, Pp. 123-146 They used their upper-class status to gain funds from friends and colleagues which allowed the Board to function as well as it did. Rozin supported this by stating that the \\"Cohens were supported morally and financially by the wealthy class as a whole.\\"Rozin, Pp.123-146 Furthermore, the work of the Board, therefore, may have been more for preservation of the existing Jewish community and identity in as far as it sought to help the poor altruistically. ==The Board in the 20th Century== The work of the Board of Guardians diminished in the 20th Century. The medical committee had been disbanded in favour of relief provided by the official state authorities, and later more committees reduced their work in favour of state funded welfare. The Board had been at the forefront of innovation, but a lack of change meant it began less prevalent. Eugene C Black argues that, \\"for its first thirty years the Board had been in the forefront of innovation in social work, for the next thirty, it fell further and further behind.\\"Black, p.99 \\"The Board slowly adapted its administrative attitudes, arrangements and commitments.\\" \\"The liberal government increased social welfare legislation in 1905, and further increased it after the December 1910 election\\".Black, p.100 The introduction of old age pensions in 1908, national insurance in 1911 affected the Board's work. The 1905 Aliens Act similarly worked in the Board's favour by decreasing the number of immigrants allowed to enter Britain. \\"However, some of these reforms were not fully applicable, especially of many of the Board's recipients were not British citizens and therefore could not qualify.\\" By 1920 a broader scope of unemployment laws meant that they began to help the Jewish community. \\"Much of the Board's work shifted to the public sphere, with most relief being provided by the state apparatus.\\"Black, p.102 In the 1990s the Jewish Board of Guardians merged with other Jewish charities to become Jewish Care, an organization that still exists today. ==Criticisms of the Board== Despite the Board being a charity, they did receive criticisms from ex-members and the general public. Some of the main criticisms of the Jewish Board of Guardians come from those within the Jewish community itself. The general organization of the Board was criticized, with some claiming \\"the private donor was uninformed and misdirected, so often gave to the wrong people, the wrong amount and in the wrong way.\\"Lipman, p.29 Lipman went as far as to state that, \\"there was no attempt at budgetary control.\\"Lipman, p. 46 However, despite the need to be critical of how the Board could have improved efficiency, it cannot be ignored that the reasons for these mistakes were the Board trying to deal with an increasing number of cases. This meant that \\"the time staff could spend on one case and money they had to give was decreased.\\"Lipman, p.109 The process of checking if an applicant was worthy for relief was also analyzed. People \\"criticized the Board for a lack of sympathy in the administration of relief, claiming the applicants were interviewed standing up behind a brass rail.\\" The Board was also accused of losing sight of the applicant‚Äôs real needs and failing to provide constructive help in the early 20th century. However, the main criticism the Board faced was regarding emigration and repatriation. Many felt that the Board‚Äôs great work encouraged people who were not suffering persecution to come to England purely for a better standard of living, giving the impression that the Board were encouraging immigration. However, the Board‚Äôs way of dealing with this has also been highly criticized. They created the six-month rule to refuse relief to those that had been in the country less than six months. But this rule \\"meant the new immigrants in the greatest distress were denied relief...However this was counteracted by the fact that discretionary power relieved those in need despite the amount of time they were in the country for... Repatriation as a whole was criticized. As many believed it was \\"endangering the lives of the repatriates as took them back into discrimination and awful conditions.\\" However, in 1905 after the Pogrom the Board stopped repatriation completely but was persuaded to bring it back due to a mass of requests from applicants. \\"The Board was also generally under scrutiny from other organizations. The \\"American-Jewish establishment suggested that the Board were not making as much effort as they could.\\"Black, p.264 Additionally, old Board members such as Asher I Myers published \\"sustained criticism in the Jewish Chronicle.\\" Nevertheless, this was an organization experiencing increasing pressure on their resources and relying almost entirely on donations. The Board was also \\"always hampered by the fact that if they developed their services too far they might be encouraging immigrants.\\"Lipman, p. 109 ==NotesReferences== *Black, Eugene.

She grew up poor during the Great Depression and has recounted being discriminated against by her teachers and peers for following Orthodox Judaism. == Personal life == Klotman's family did not have enough money to send her to college right away. Though she was trained as a secretary, she went to work as a ship dispatcher for the National Maritime Union. The left-wing union was one of the few integrated spaces in Galveston, and Klotman became good friends with the secretary, an African- American woman. She eventually joined the NAACP at the same time as two white men she knew from the union. In 1941, Klotman met her husband, Robert, through a blind date arranged by her sister. They were married in 1943. Robert, who was originally from Cleveland, Ohio, served in the United States Army during WWII, and Klotman followed him during his relocations to bases in Missouri and California while working for the American Red Cross. She said she did not know at the time that the Red Cross segregated blood plasma and did not find out until several years later. Klotman and her husband had three children, but lost their first, Eric, to Tay-Sach's disease when he was two years old. Klotman is also the mother of Dr. Paul Klotman, the current president and CEO of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. == Education == Klotman took her first college course part-time at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland when she was 29 years old. In 1961, she graduated summa cum laude with B.A. degrees in English and French from Cleveland College, the school for adults at Western Reserve University. After graduation, she was awarded the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship in American Studies. She earned her master's degrees in American studies and English in 1963 and was a teaching fellow at Case Western for two years after. After moving to Michigan with her family in 1967, Klotman became an English instructor at the Lawrence Institute of Technology in Southfield, Michigan, while continuing to go to school part-time. She received doctoral degrees in English and Afro-American literature/American literature from Case Western in 1969 with a dissertation on African American narrative. == Career == In 1970, Robert was hired to build a music education program at Indiana University's Jacobs School of Music in Bloomington, Indiana. Klotman commuted to her new position as assistant professor in English at Indiana State University. While there, she taught the school's first course in black literature. The next year, she was hired by Dr. Herman C. Hudson as an assistant professor of Afro-American Studies at Indiana University, which was in the midst of building an Afro-American Studies Department. She has praised Hudson for allowing her to create her own courses and write them into the curriculum. Klotman was promoted to full professor in 1978. She and Robert took several trips together as visiting professors to schools in Yugoslavia, China, and across the United States. Klotman became the Dean of Women's Affairs at IU in 1986 and remained in that position until 1993. ==Preservation== Klotman founded the journal Black Camera and helped to amass a large archive on black cinema at Indiana University which now includes thousands of films, photographs, oral histories and memorabilia. ==References== Category:1924 births Category:2015 deaths ","title":"Phyllis R.

Prior to that, Uvarov had been in charge of a small locust research unit in London, formed in the 1920s within the Imperial Bureau of Entomology. The unit later became known as the Centre for Overseas Pest Research. During World War II, the ALRC concentrated on its forecasting and advisory services with regard to anti-locust campaigns in the Middle East and Africa. After the war it became a dedicated research centre on locusts, making important contributions in the areas of taxonomy, population biology and locust control. Its primary aims at this time were the coordination of international research into the biology of locusts and the organisation of international cooperation in the control of locusts. In 1964, both the ALRC and the Imperial Bureau of Entomology became part of the Ministry of Overseas Development.

The series revolves around a general store in Chicago and the store's proprietor Luke Gray, played by Jim Jordan. Whenever a customer came into the general store to ask Uncle Luke, as Gray was affectionately known, for something, the typical response from Luke would be \\"we're smack out of that\\" (hence the title of the show). But that never stopped Luke from telling one of his signature tall tales to the customer. Jordan also played a regular customer named Jim and Marian Jordan portrayed the main roles as Teeny, a little girl and regular customer, and Marian, Jim's girlfriend. Smackout was broadcast from Chicago's NBC radio affiliate WMAQ before becoming nationally syndicated through the NBC Blue Network beginning in April 1933. New episodes of Smackout were broadcast six days a week from March 2, 1931, to August 30, 1935. The series, after capturing the eye of the wife of an executive at Johnson Wax, was the basis to Jim and Marian Jordan's more successful and memorable radio series Fibber McGee and Molly. ==Premise== The radio show Smackout revolves around a general store in Chicago and its customers. Outside of its customers, Smackout mainly stars Jim Jordan's character of Luke Gray who is known affectionately as Uncle Luke. Luke is the grizzled old proprietor of the general store located in the small community of Smackout Corners. In their exhaustive biography of Jim and Marian Jordan, historians Tom Price and Charles Stumpf describe the character of Luke; \\"His favorite pastimes were whittling and pitching horseshoes, which he would rather do than tend to the store. Frequently, Luke would deny that the store was open, and almost always told customers he was 'smack out' of whatever it was they were asking for ..... However, he was always well-stocked with a goodly supply of tall tales, such as the one about the time he taught some woodpeckers to tap out messages into Morse code, and another one about the time he grew square tomatoes to use in bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches.\\" In addition to playing Luke, Jim Jordan also played the radio version of himself, a young Smackout Corners regular known only by the name of \\"Jim\\". Jim would enliven the episodes by singing while his girlfriend Marian, played by his real-life wife Marian Jordan, accompanied him on the store's piano. Jim and Marian Jordan provided voice of all the characters on the series. Jim's larynx contained such personalities as Augie Pigmeyer, the German immigrant farmer, village idiot Perky McSnark; local conman Squire Lovejoy; and Luke's old crony, Mort Toops. In addition to playing Marian, Marian Jordan also played the roles of Teeny, a young girl who always \\"bothered the whey out of\\" crusty old Luke, Mrs. J. High-Hat Upson, Widow Wheedledeck, and Bertha Boop. It was estimated that during the four-and-a- half-year run of the series, between the Jordans provided voices for 150 characters during the series.Hollis, p. 15 ==The Jordans== Early lives The stars and only performers on the series were James Edward \\"Jim\\" Jordan (November 16, 1896-April 1, 1988) and Marian Irene Driscoll (April 15, 1898-April 7, 1961) who were both natives of Peoria, Illinois. Jordan was the seventh of eight children born to James Edward Jordan and Mary (n√©e Tighe) Jordan, while Driscoll was the twelfth out of thirteen children born to Daniel P. and Anna (n√©e Carroll) Driscoll. The son of a farmer, Jim wanted to be a singer; Marian, the daughter of a coal miner, wanted to be a music teacher. Both attended the same Catholic church, where they met at choir practice. Marian's parents had attempted to discourage her professional singing and acting aspirations. When she started seeing young Jim Jordan, the Driscolls were far from approving of Jim and his ideas. Jim's voice teacher gave him a recommendation for work as a professional in Chicago, and he followed it. He was able to have steady work but soon tired of the life on the road. In less than a year, Jim came back to Peoria and went to work for the Post Office. His profession was now acceptable to Marian's parents, and they stopped objecting to the couple's marriage plans. The pair were married in Peoria on August 31, 1918. Vaudeville and early radio days Shortly after Jim was drafted into the army, he fell ill and was honorably discharged. After he returned home to Peoria, the couple decided to go into the Vaudeville circuit. The couple did several small-town vaudeville acts before going into radio. While staying with Jim's brother in Chicago in 1924, the family was listening to the radio; Jim said that he and Marian could do better than the musical act currently on the air. Jim's brother bet him $10 that they could not. To win the bet, Jim and Marian went to WIBO, where they were immediately put on the air. At the end of the performance, the station offered the couple a contract for a weekly show which paid $10 per week. The sponsor of the show was Oh Henry! candy, and they appeared for six months on The Oh Henry! Twins program and on The Air Scouts program before switching to radio station WENR in 1927. The first series they did on WENR was entitled Luke and Mirandy, the basis for Smackout. In that series, Jim played a farmer who was given to tall tales and face-saving lies for comic effect. In 1929, the Jordans starred in their second of two weekly series on WENR, this one entitled The Smith Family. That series, which ran until 1932, starred the Jordans as a police officer and his Irish long- suffering wife. The Smith Family is often regarded as the first and earliest example of the soap opera. ==From WENR to Smackout== In 1931, the Jordans hired Donald \\"Don\\" Quinn to serve as their writer for The Smith Family. Quinn was an out of work cartoonist who was then working in radio for WENR. And it was while working on the WENR farm report, Jim Jordan heard a true story about a shopkeeper from Missouri whose store was brimming with stock, yet he claimed to be \\"smack out\\" of whatever a customer would ask him for. The story reached the halls of nearby Columbia College, and the students began visiting the store, which they called \\"Smackout\\", to hear the owner's incredible stories. Quinn and Jordan decided to take their idea of Smackout to Chicago station WMAQ which had just recently became an affiliate of the National Broadcasting Company. Smackout premiered on March 2, 1931 under the title Smackout ‚Äì The Crossroads of the Air. The series was set in a rural hamlet and revolved around the operation of a general store and its owner who always refuses services to his customers but never refuses to tell the customers a good tall tale. The series was broadcast on a sustaining basis. However, the ratings were just as good as if the show was sponsored. Ratings were so good that NBC decided to syndicate it nationally over its Blue Network beginning in April 1933. In 1933, Mrs. Henrietta Johnson Lewis (or Louis depending on certain sources) took an interest in Smackout and, more importantly, Quinn and the Jordans. Lewis was the daughter of an executive at the Johnson Wax Company and saw potential in the power trio. At that same time, Johnson Wax was looking for a new program to sponsor. Lewis saw potential in the Jordans and decided to give them a show of their own entitled Fibber McGee and Molly with Quinn serving as head writer. The character of Luke Gray was the basis of the Fibber McGee character and the character of Teeny was brought on to the series virtually unchanged. The start of Fibber McGee in April 1935 was the end of Smackout which broadcast its last telecast on August 31, 1935.Hollis, p. 35 ==Cast and characters== Jim and Marian Jordan played and provided voices for all the characters on the series. It is estimated that they provided voices to over 150 characters during the entire run of the series. Below is a list of all the main and supporting characters they portrayed during the course of the series; Jim Jordan: :*\\"Uncle\\" Luke GrayThe character of Fibber McGee on radio's Fibber McGee and Molly was based on Luke Gray. \\\\- The main protagonist of the series, Luke Gray, affectionately known as Uncle Luke, is the proprietor of the Smackout Corners General Store.

In 2005-2006 he studied at the University of Maryland under a Hubert H. Humphrey Fellowship. In 2012 he received a fellowship from the Nieman Foundation for Journalism to study at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. == Life == He was born in 1962 in Ha Tinh Province, Vietnam. He served in the Vietnamese army for eight years and fought in the Sino-Vietnamese Border War of 1979 and the Vietnamese-Cambodian War in the 1980s. He then became a journalist, based in Ho Chi Minh City. He wrote for several newspapers such as Tuoi Tre, Thanh Nien, and Sai Gon Tiep Thi. Until 2010 he also wrote a blog called Osin, which was ranked as the most popular blog in Vietnam. The blog was critical of the Vietnamese government, attempting to \\"push the line but not cross the line\\". In 2009 he was dismissed from his post at Sai Gon Tiep Thi (Saigon Marketing), a state-run newspaper, because of comments on his blog. Since then he has been a freelance journalist. While studying at Harvard, he published his book B√™n Th·∫Øng Cu·ªôc (The Winning Side). The book describes life in Vietnam after the end of the Vietnam War and the reunification of the country. It is a two-volume work. The first volume, Gi·∫£i Ph√≥ng (The Liberation), was published as an e-book in 2012, followed by a hardcover edition. Even before publication he published excerpts and chapters on his Facebook page; the excerpts were widely circulated through the internet. The second volume, Quy·ªÅn B√≠nh (The Power), was published the same year. The name \\"The Winning Side\\" is inspired by a quote from Vietnamese poet Nguy·ªÖn Duy: \\"In every war, whichever side wins, after all/ It's the people who take the fall.\\" The Vietnamese government has not officially banned the book, but the state-run media has been critical of it. In some cases the Vietnamese government has seized copies of it and questioned people who had them. Critics have described the book as \\"perhaps the first critical, comprehensive history of Vietnam since 1975 by someone inside the country.\\" The book ranked number one in the category Southeast Asia History for several weeks on Amazon, and since its publication it is one of the most downloaded electronic Vietnamese books.

The bronze-like bust was placed in Fort Greene Park in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, New York City, on April 6, 2015. It was attached to a Doric column on the perimeter of the park's Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument, a memorial and crypt which honors and inters the more than 11,500 American prisoners of war who died in the American Revolution while housed on British prison ships. Affixed atop an existing column, the bust was mounted by three anonymous artists and their helpers, who were dressed in white construction helmets and reflective vests in imitation of Parks Department workers, early in the morning of April 6, then covered and taken down by NYC Parks officials later that day. A hologram tribute to Snowden was subsequently installed after the sculpture was removed. ==Development and design== The piece was conceived in 2014 by two artists from New York City and a sculptor from the West Coast. The sculptor volunteered his time and skill in creating the bust, with the piece eventually costing thousands of dollars to create over six months. The artwork consisted of a high, bust of Snowden on top of a Doric column, with a Plexiglas stand with Snowden's name on it. The piece was fused to Fort Greene Park's Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in the pre-dawn hours of April 6, 2015. The sculptor recommended that the two artists create a bust after they had suggested a life-size statue of Snowden. The bust was made from Hydrocal, a plaster-like substance resembling bronze in appearance, which was then fixed to the pre-existing column with a non-damaging adhesive. The piece was designed to be similar in style to other sculptures in the park. While it was very important to the artists that the piece be more than just a prop or papier-mache effigy, they also wished not to damage the surface to which the bust would be bound. After some debate, they decided on an adhesive that would firmly hold the head in place, yet could be removed without marring the monument. The sculpture had Snowden's name at its base, consistent with the names on the bases of other sculptures in the park. The Guardian newspaper expressed the view that the bust also looked like the former White House press secretary Jay Carney and some people thought it looked more like him than it did Snowden. Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument 2.0 is one of at least six sculptures and monuments to Snowden that have appeared around the world. In October 2014, a statue of Snowden appeared in Union Square, Manhattan, near Henry Kirke Brown's Abraham Lincoln statue. It was shown in conjunction with the Art in Odd Places festival and was sculpted by Jim Dessicino, a Delaware artist. One of the bust's observers compared Snowden to Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers to The New York Times. ==Installation== The creators of the sculpture, who were dubbed \\"guerrilla artists\\" by some in the media, released a statement to the Animal New York website detailing their motivations and documenting the bust's installation in exchange for anonymity. In their statement, the artists said: The artists also expressed their dismay with perceived public apathy at Snowden's revelations. While anticipating the sculpture's probable demise, the creators told Mashable on April 6, 2015 that they \\"hope New York will embrace and protect this piece, much as when the Wall Street Bull was granted a permanent public home after its guerrilla placement. Even though it's already on way towards being removed, the possibility exists for the city to make the piece available for public viewing in a sanctioned way.\\" The unsanctioned bust had appeared a few hours after HBO's broadcast of John Oliver's Last Week Tonight interview with Snowden in Moscow. ==Removal and aftermath== Local residents had varied responses. The sculpture was up for only 12 to 13 hours before it was covered by blue tarpaulin and bound with rope at 12:30 pm on April 6, 2015, almost immediately after an official discovered it, then taken down an hour later. Calling it an \\"art prank\\", investigators from the New York City Police Department's Intelligence Division reportedly gathered DNA and examining other evidence in an attempt to determine the identity of the artist or artists. According to a spokesperson for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, \\"[t]he erection of any unapproved structure or artwork in a city park is illegal.\\" Some passersby were annoyed at the covering of the bust, however. The bust was being held at the NYPD's 88th Precinct pending the investigation's outcome. Hours after the sculpture was removed, a group of New York artists calling themselves The Illuminator Art Collective‚Äîunrelated to the three artists who created the bust‚Äîused smoke and projection equipment to create an ephemeral \\"hologram\\" image of Snowden in place of the missing sculpture. This projection included Snowden's face above one of the pillars, as well as \\"Snowden\\" in white letters at the bottom of the pillar. Collective artists said, \\"Our feeling is that while the State may remove any material artifacts that speak in defiance against incumbent authoritarianism, the acts of resistance remain in the public consciousness. And it is in sharing that act of defiance that hope resides.\\" The original artists said they were \\"touched\\" to see their bust and nameplate \\"reinstalled\\" with the use of light, adding that they were \\"surprised to see the way the statue was covered up before its removal, as though it were a profane statement.\\" New York City has had a number of pieces of street art, like the Charging Bull, which have become cultural icons and tourist attractions. An online petition sought the return of the bust to the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument. The New York Daily News reported on April 14, 2015, that Ron Kuby, a lawyer representing the unidentified artists, had asked New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton to return the sculpture to its creators. Kuby stated, \\"The statue itself is not contraband. Whatever the right of the Parks Department to remove an unauthorized sculpture, that does not translate into the right of the police to indefinitely detain a work of art.\\" The artists planned to submit an application for authorized public display, and a Manhattan art gallery also expressed interest in exhibiting the Snowden sculpture. ==Return of sculpture== After negotiations with the artists' attorney, the city returned the sculpture on May 6, 2015, assessing each artist a $50 fine for non-criminal trespassing due to their having illegally entered Fort Greene Park at night. Ron Kuby promised his clients' fines would be \\"promptly paid\\", and expressed gratitude that potential removal and storage fees for the sculpture were waived. A police summons identified the artists as Andrew Tider and Jeff Greenspan. The undamaged bust had its first post-police custody exhibition from May 8‚Äì17 at The Boiler in Brooklyn, in a show titled anonymity, no longer an option. The artists were reportedly applying to have the sculpture legally exhibited by New York City through the city's \\"Art in the Parks\\" program: \\"This time they're dotting their i's and crossing their t's,\\" Kuby said. It was thereafter exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum. ==NotesReferences* 3D model of the statue and column on Sketchfab * 3D model of the Snowden bust on Sketchfab * Interview with Jeff Greenspan about the Edward Snowden statue on Webydo Category:2015 in New York City Category:2015 politics in New York (state) Edward Snowden Category:Anonymous works Category:Busts in New York City Category:Collection of the Brooklyn Museum Category:Cultural depictions of Edward Snowden Category:Culture jamming Category:Fort Greene, Brooklyn Category:Guerilla art and hacking art Edward Snowden Category:Sculptures of men in New York City ","title":"Bust of Edward Snowden"},{"id":"46334533","text":"James B.

In many cases predatory educators are most expert at helping students access various forms of financial aid ‚Äì helping them complete paperwork that will free up financial assistance that will allow the student to purchase more education. In the US it is common for such schools to get as much as 90% of their revenue from federal student aid programs. == Comparison with diploma mills== Predatory educators are different from what are commonly known as diploma mills. Strictly speaking the term diploma mill is most commonly used to describe an entity that issues counterfeit diplomas bearing the names of real universities. == Comparison with degree mills== A degree mill issues diplomas from unaccredited institutions which may be legal in some states but are generally illegitimate. This is not the case with predatory educators who generally are accredited and typically rely on that accreditation to access government funding. == Legislation == Predatory educators are often enabled by government programs designed to provide students with access to paid education. In the US for example the 1998 $3.1 billion Workforce Investment Act provides students with vouchers worth $3,000 to $5,000 to help them acquire training. Although it is a federal program state and local officials decide what schools and programs are eligible to receive the funds, and have been criticized for not providing adequate oversight. The Obama administration attempted protecting students by forcing colleges to disclose the information required to help students make good decisions, and enforcing performance by limiting access to government funds:  Certification requirements  Institutions must certify that each of their gainful employment programs meets applicable institutional or program-level accreditation requirements and state or federal licensure standards.  Accountability metrics  To maintain Title IV eligibility, gainful employment programs will be required to meet minimum standards measured by two metrics: debt-to-earnings and program cohort default rate. A program becomes ineligible to provide Title IV aid for 3 years if it fails in any 2 out of 3 consecutive years OR It is in the zone (or a combination of being in the zone and failing) for 4 consecutive years. A program becomes ineligible to provide Title IV aid for 3 years if it fails for 3 consecutive years.  Disclosures  Institutions will be required to make public disclosures regarding the performance and outcomes of their gainful employment programs.

The campground offers four loops of campsites, including \\"drive-up\\" sites suitable for RVs and trailers, as well as walk-in tent-only campsites, and is open from late May into October. Much of the campground was built between 1936 and 1942 by crews of the Civilian Conservation Corps; this section is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The campground is located in the village of Seawall, in the town of Southwest Harbor on Maine State Route 102A. ==Description and history== The Seawall Campground is located on of parkland near the southern end of the western lobe of Mount Desert Island, in a portion of Acadia National Park that is separated from the largest portion, which is on the island's eastern lobe. It is on the north side of Route 102A, the main loop road around the coast of that part of the island. The entrance road leads north to the checkin station, north of which four loops of campsites branch. Other public facilities include comfort stations with toilets and hot showers, and an amphitheater, while service facilities including park staff housing and other utility buildings. Acadia National Park was established in 1916 as a National Monument and was designated a national park in 1919, the first in the United States park system located east of the Mississippi River. The first master plan for the park, published in 1927, included a call for campgrounds, but funding did not become available until the jobs programs of the 1930s. In 1935 the site of Seawall Campground was chosen, and construction began in 1936 by Civilian Conservation Corps crews funded by the Works Progress Administration. Loops A and B were the first to be built, using the park service's principles of Rustic design. They were completed by the end of season in 1937, except for the comfort station in Loop B, which was built in a subsequent season. Work continued on Loop C and the checkin/ranger station, but progress on these was delayed by US entry into World War II, and they were not finished until 1942. Loop D, which consists of walk-in tent campsites, and the amphitheater were built in the 1950s as part of a \\"Mission 66\\" program by the park service to expand facilities ahead of its fiftieth anniversary in 1966. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hancock County, Maine *National Register of Historic Places listings in Acadia National Park ==References *Camping at Acadia National Park Category:National Register of Historic Places in Acadia National Park Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1942 Category:Campgrounds in Maine Category:Buildings and structures in Hancock County, Maine Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:1942 establishments in Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hancock County, Maine Category:Temporary populated places on the National Register of Historic Places Category:National Park Service Rustic architecture ","title":"Seawall Campground"},{"id":"46334657","text":"Verbascum bugulifolium is a species of Verbascum native to Bulgaria and western Turkey. ==Description== Verbascum bugulifolium grows to tall, with a basal rosette of ovate leaves long and wide.

It emerged from 19th century precursors (such as the Holiness movement, the Higher Life movement, revivalism, the divine healing movement, and the like) between 1870 and 1910, taking denominational form from c. 1927. From the early 1930s, pentecostal denominations multiplied, and there are now several dozen, the largest of which relate to one another through conferences and organizations such as the Australian Pentecostal Ministers Fellowship. The Australian Christian Churches, formerly known as the Australian Assemblies of God, is the oldest and longest lasting Pentecostal organization in Australia. The AOG/ACC is also the largest Pentecostal organization in Australia with over 300,000 members in 2018. Until 2018, Hillsong Church was one of 10 megachurches in Australia associated with the ACC that have at least 2,000 members weekly. According to the church, over 100,000 people attend services each week at the church or one of its 80 affiliated churches located worldwide (around 40,000 in Australia). Scholars in recent years, such as Sam Hey, have noted the growth in Pentecostal membership accelerated in the 1970s with an increase in the \\"youth generation\\". Australian Pentecostal denominationalism began in the early 20th century under the leadership of Sarah Jane Lancaster. Pentecostal/ Charismatic movements, on the other hand, had a much longer history. The atmosphere was laid with Australia's colonization under the British Empire in the 18th century, its tradition of immigration, and non-class based society. Sarah Jane Lancaster set up the first church called Good News Hall, and then merged with other burgeoning Pentecostal churches under the name Apostolic Faith Mission of Australia. They experienced conflict and debate over Oneness theology, leading to the schismatic foundation of new denominations. In 1937, the Assemblies of God in Australia was formed from elements of the Apostolic Faith Mission, the Queensland pentecostal churches which emerged from the 1924 Macknade revival (federated in 1929 as the Queensland Assemblies of God), and A.C. Valdez's Pentecostal Church of Australia. The Assemblies of God became known as Australian Christian Churches in 2007. == Early history == The creation of Australia as a prison colony for Great Britain caused the members of the colony early on to adapt to a non-class based system. The primary religion was Anglican, however the local people rejected Anglican authority on the grounds of their non-class based system. It was in this \\"free church\\" context that other religious traditions such as Catholicism and Methodism found adherents. The Catholic Apostolic Churches in Australia, which emerged under Edward Irving from a confluence of Scots revivalism and Spanish millennialism, maintained charismatic practice from 1853 through until the end of the 19th century, and significantly influenced the global healing movement. News of revivals happening worldwide reached Australia in the mid-19th century and similar stirrings began in Australia, particularly within Methodist circles of influence. Barry Chant identifies from 1870 a group of Methodist \\"Sounders\\", led by Joseph Marshall in rural Victoria, among whom glossolalic practice was directly connected via family links to the early Pentecostal movement. These trends contributed to a rise in the public practice of divine healing in similar areas, by people such as James Moore Hickson. It was with this backdrop that Sarah Jane Lancaster, the founder of the first Pentecostal church in Australia, practiced Methodism and began to learn about spiritual healing and related gifts of the Holy Spirit. She was introduced to Pentecostalism when she requested a pamphlet called Back to Pentecost from leadership in England. This pamphlet claimed that God had never revoked the gifts of the Holy Spirit, so she prayed for these gifts to come upon her. She was finally baptized in the Holy Spirit in 1908. == Apostolic Faith Mission of Australia == In 1909 Sarah Lancaster opened Good News Hall, the first Pentecostal church in Australia. After the opening of the church, Sarah Lancaster began a series of preachings around the country to spread the message of Pentecostalism. Many accepted her message and created Pentecostal churches of their own, but did not formally unite under Lancaster's church until 1926 when a South African pastor named Fredrick Van Eyck recommended uniting under the title Apostolic Faith Mission of Australia (AFM). The AMF had problems from the start because the anti-doctrinal approach and the emphasis on personal interpretation led to disunity. == Reorganization of denominations == In the same year, the Pentecostal Church of Australia was formed under the leadership of A.C. Valdez, an American convert from the Azusa Street Revival that had taken place in Los Angeles. With growing tensions within the AFM, some of the churches broke off and renamed themselves the Assemblies of God Queensland. In 1937, the Assemblies of God Queensland and the Pentecostal Church of Australia merged under the title Assemblies of God in Australia. Though the AOG adopted the name \\"Australian Christian Churches\\" in 2007, this group AOG/ACC has since been the largest Pentecostal denomination in Australia. == Pentecostalism in Australia today == Though other denominations dominate Australia's population today (including from the top Catholicism, Anglicanism, Uniting Church and Presbyterian/Reformed) studies show that the number of proportional adherents of these traditions have all dropped. Conversely, the proportional number of adherents for Pentecostalism rose between the years 1991 and 2001. Adherence to Pentecostalism increased from nearly 220,000 in 2006 and 238,000 in 2011 to 260,500 in 2016. Including independent charismatic churches, in 2018 Pentecostal churches on any given Sunday in Australia represent approximately half of all active Protestants.[Reference?] The average age of a Pentecostal congregation is 25. In 2007, the Assemblies of God changed its name to \\"Australian Christian Churches\\", under the leadership of Brian Houston. This change occurred in order to be less limiting in name recognition and to increase participation. Until 2018, the largest church associated with the AOG/ACC in Australia was the popular Hillsong church, founded in 1983 by husband and wife Brian and Bobbie Houston. The Hillsong megachurch boasts (within Australia) more than 40,000 members every week and has over 30 affiliated congregations in Sydney. Hillsong Church was one of 10 megachurches in Australia associated with the ACC that have at least 2,000 members weekly. Its growth internationally, and increasing focus on North America, led in September 2018 to Hillsong's withdrawal from the ACC, and formation as its own denomination. While much attention has been paid to Hillsong and to the ACC, two other significant Australian international pentecostal networks centre on the C3 Global Network (founded by Phil Pringle and a number of others in 1980) and the INC network (founded by Clark Taylor in what is now called Citipointe Church in Brisbane). In 2018, Scott Morrison became Australia's first Pentecostal prime minister. == Extreme fundamentalist Pentecostalism == There are, in Australia, relatively many examples of the more extreme, American/African/Latin American/Caribbean-style fundamentalist cult-like forms of Pentecostalism. The counter marginal trend, represented most notably by the infamous Logos Foundation, led by Howard Carter in Toowoomba, Queensland, and later by 'manifest glory' movements such as Bethel Church, Redding can be found in congregations such as the Range Christian Fellowship. The Range Christian Fellowship in Blake Street Toowoomba, is known for exuberant worship services and the public manifestation of charismatic phenomena and manifestations that place it well outside of mainstream Pentecostal church expression. It is possibly one of the prime Australian examples of churches associated with the New Apostolic Reformation, a fundamentalist Pentecostal religious right wing movement which has been described by American journalist Forrest Wilder as, \\"Their beliefs can tend toward the bizarre. Some prophets even claim to have seen demons at public meetings. They've taken biblical literalism to an extreme\\". It operates in a converted squash centre and was established on 9 November 1997 as a breakaway group from the Rangeville Uniting Church in Toowoomba over disagreements with the national leadership of the Uniting Church in Australia. These disagreements were predominantly around the ordination of homosexual people into ministry. The Range Christian Fellowship's diverse origins resulted in a divergent mix of worship preferences, expectations and issues. The church initially met in a Seventh Day Adventist church hall before purchasing the property in Blake Street, leaving the congregation heavily indebted, often close to bankruptcy, and with a high turnover of congregants. The congregation attributes their continued avoidance of financial collapse to God's blessing and regard this as a miracle. Whilst adhering to mainstream protestant Christian beliefs, the church supplements these beliefs with influences from the New Apostolic Reformation, Revivalism, Dominion theology, Kingdom Now theology, Spiritual Warfare Christianity and Five-fold ministry thinking. Scripture is interpreted literally, though selectively. Unusual manifestations attributed to the Holy Spirit or the presence of ‚Äòthe anointing‚Äô include women and at times even men, moaning and retching as though experiencing child birth, with some claiming to be having actual contractions of the womb (known as spiritual birthing).http://www.spiritwatch.org/fireimpart.htm, 4th paragraph Dramatic and apocalyptic predictions regarding the future were particularly evident during the time leading up to Y2K, when a number of prophecies were shared publicly, all of which were proven to be false by subsequent events. Attendees are given a high degree of freedom, influenced in the church's initial years by the promotion of Jim Rutz's publication, The Open Church, resulting in broad tolerance of expressions of revelation, a \\"word from the Lord\\" or prophecy. At times, people within the fellowship claim to have seen visions in either dreams, whilst in a trance-like state during worship, or during moments of religious ecstasy, with these experiences frequently conveying a revelation or prophecy. Other occurrences have included people claiming to have been in an altered state of consciousness (referred to as ‚Äòresting in the Lord‚Äô and 'slain in the spirit' among other names), characterized by reduced external awareness and expanded interior mental and spiritual awareness, often accompanied by visions and emotional (and sometimes physical) euphoria. The church has hosted visits from various Christian leaders who claim to be modern day Apostles as well as many others who promote themselves as prophets or faith healers. Perhaps surprisingly, speaking in tongues, which is common in other Pentecostal churches, does occur but is not frequent nor is it promoted; and is rarely witnessed in public gatherings. Neo-charismatic elements rejected elsewhere in classical pentecostalism, such as the Prayer of Jabez prosperity doctrine, the Toronto Blessing (with its emphasis on strange, non- verbal expressions), George Otis' Spiritual Warfare, Brownsville Revival (Pensacola Outpouring), Morningstar Ministries, Lakeland Revival, and the Vineyard group of churches, have been influential. The church has always been known for vibrant and at times euphoric and ecstatic worship utilising music, song, dancing, flags and banners. Range Christian Fellowship is part of the church unity movement in Toowoomba, with other like-minded churches (mainstream traditional denominations have a separate ecumenical group). This group, known as the Christian Leaders' Network, aspires to be a Christian right wing influence group within the city, at the centre of a hoped-for great revival during which they will \\"take the city for the Lord\\". The Range Christian Fellowship has thrown itself wholeheartedly into citywide events that are viewed as a foundation for stimulating revival, which have included Easterfest, \\"Christmas the Full Story\\", and continuous 24-hour worship events. The church retains an impressive resilience inherited from their Uniting Church heritage, which has weathered it through difficult times. Their beliefs and actions which place them on the fringe of both mainstream and Pentecostal Christianity are largely isolated to their Sunday gatherings or privately in their homes. Criticism of the church is regarded by some as a badge of honour, as it is viewed in terms of the expected persecution of the holy remnant of the true church in the last days. The church continues to be drawn to, and associate itself with fringe Pentecostal and fundamentalist movements, particularly those originating in North America, such as Doug Addison most recently. Addison has become known for delivering prophecies through dreams and unconventionally through people's body tattoos, and mixes highly fundamentalist Christianity with elements of psychic spirituality. == Notable members == * Scott Morrison, Prime Minister of Australia (2018‚Äìpresent) * Israel Folau, Australian professional rugby player * Stuart Robert, Australian politician == See also == * Australian Christian Churches * Evangelicalism == References == Category:Christian denominations in Australia ","title":"Pentecostalism in Australia"},{"id":"46334728","text":"Valanga nigricornis,Burmeister H (1838) Handbuch der Entomologie 2 2(I-VIII): 629. the Javanese grasshopper (also known as the Javanese bird grasshopper), is a species of grasshopper in the subfamily Cyrtacanthacridinae of the family Acrididae. It is found in southeastern Asia, the type location being Singapore. It was first described by the German zoologist Hermann Burmeister in 1838. There are more than twenty subspecies, most of which are endemic to different island groups; the subspecies V. nigricornis nigricornis is the type for the genus Valanga. ==Description== There is considerable sexual dimorphism in this species with the males measuring in length and the females . The adults are yellowish-brown, yellowish or green with bluish-black markings. The hind wings, which are visible in flight, are rose red. The nymphs are pale green with dark markings. ==Distribution== The Javanese grasshopper is native to Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, the Solomon Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. It is mainly a woodland species and is found in forest clearings, on trees and shrubs. It can be a serious pest in oil palm and rubber plantations, which are commonly found throughout its native range. The species has also been recorded in Australia (Christmas Island only, it being 430km south of Java), Guam, India, Micronesia, and Palau. ==Life cycle== The life cycle of the Javanese grasshopper varies in different parts of its range, but in general, there is a single generation of insects each year. Up to four egg pods are laid in moist soil in forest clearings. When the eggs hatch, the nymphs pass through six or seven instar stages before becoming winged adults. Both nymphs and adults are diurnal and like to bask in the sun. They feed on tree foliage. In Java the eggs remain dormant throughout the dry season and take six to eight months to hatch. After the nymphal stages they become immature adults which soon mature and start breeding. In Thailand, the eggs hatch after about two months, the nymphs grow during the wet season and remain as immature adults during the dry season. In west Malaysia there are two peak egg-laying periods, December/January and June/July, which suggests there are two physiological races present. ==Outbreaks== The Javanese grasshopper is not gregarious and is not known to form swarms. Nevertheless, it is much more locally common in some years than others and outbreaks occur particularly in dry years; heavy rain causes high levels of mortality among eggs and nymphs. In Java, an outbreak in 1915 was thought to be caused by a succession of dry years which encouraged synchronization of breeding in concentrated areas. Clearing of forests for cultivation may also promote breeding. ==Gallery== File:Javanese grasshopper (Valanga nigricornis) nymph.jpgNymph, Sabah, Borneo File:Female Javanese Grasshopper.pngAdult female, Marina Bay, Singapore File:Javanese_grasshopper.jpgFemale (larger) laying eggs, with male in attendance. == References == Category:Locusts Category:Orthoptera of Asia Category:Insects described in 1838 Category:Cyrtacanthacridinae Category:Taxa named by Hermann Burmeister ","title":"Valanga nigricornis"},{"id":"46334763","text":"The Colibr√≠ Center for Human Rights is a non-profit non-governmental organization that uses forensic anthropology and advocacy to identify lives lost on the United States-Mexico border and to help families find loved ones who have gone missing on the border.title=The Colibr√≠ Center for Human Rights website Their director Robin Reineke won a Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award in 2014. ==History== Founded in 2013 by co-founders Chelsea Halstead, Reyna Araibi, William Masson and Robin Reineke, Colibr√≠ came out of research on the US-Mexico border and in Mexico among forensic scientists, government officials, and families of the missing and dead.

In 1910, Hawthorne was involved in bringing Dr. Crippen to justice for the murder of his wife, Cora Henrietta Crippen, whom she had regarded as a good friend prior to her death. ==Early years== Born in Nashville, Illinois, as Lillian Hawthorne, she was one of four daughters of New Orleans estate agent Tazwell Wolfe (known as Hawthorne) and his wife Adrianna or Ada n√©e Rogers, a farmer's daughter from Pontotoc, Mississippi. In 1889 aged 12 Lilian Hawthorne was cast in the role of a small boy in the comic opera Paola after which she and her younger sister Adelaide joined the theatrical company The Bostonians for whom they appeared in The Knickerbockers, Robin Hood, and The Ogallalas. In 1892 they played Leila and Fleta in Iolanthe with Henry Dixey's company at Palmer's Theatre.

It became a public park in 1994. ==History== The Blessington Street Basin was built in the early 19th century by Dublin Corporation. Construction began about 1803 and finished in 1810, the plant was opened as the Royal George Reservoir, named in honour of King George III. The basin is rectangular, about 120 m long and 60 m wide basin took about 4 million gallons (15.1 million litres) of water. The water came from Lough Owel in County Westmeath, carried by pipe along the Royal Canal through a 3 km long pipeline into the basin at the western end of the Blessington Street. From its construction, the site was used as a public park. By 1869, the basin was not large enough for purpose, and water collection moved outside the city. The basin continued to serve the Jameson's and Powers' distilleries until the 1970s, and then went out of operation as a reservoir. There were worries about the stagnant water creating a typhoid outbreak in the late 1800s leading to the corporation wanting to fill in the basin and the stretch of water connecting the basin to the canal, this connection was finally filled in 1956. ==Refurbishment== In 1993 work began on the restoration of the site following a rejected proposal to extensively refurbish it in 1991. The refurbishment was carried out by the Dublin City Council aided by F√ÅS, and with financial support from the National Heritage Council and A.L.O.N.E.. It was reopened as a park on the 4 November 1994. The site also includes a lodge house built in a Tudor style in 1811, and another modern council building.

Deutsch, nee Strauch (1897‚Äì1980), a German autobiographical novelist. ==Life== Hertha Strauch was born in St Avold in Alsace-Lorraine, then part of Germany, on June 24, 1897. She grew up bilingual in German and French, going to school in Metz, where her family owned a small department store. During World War I she became a nurse for the Red Cross, at first in Metz and later in Berlin, where her family moved. During the 1920s she trained as a singer and actor at the Clara Lion Conservatory in Frankfurt. Writing as Adrienne Thomas, she drew on her Red Cross experiences for her semi-autobiographical anti-war novel Die Katrin wird Soldat (Katrin Becomes a Soldier), the diary of a young Jewish girl serving behind the German lines as a relief worker.

The firm used a Panama postal address but was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. In 1998, Harris claimed that his firm had funds under management of $1 billion and $35 million in capital. In March 1998, Jim Bennett, an offshore asset protection attorney, asked David Marchant, editor of the OffshoreAlert newsletter, to investigate Harris. Bennett had seen Harris speak in London at the Shorex offshore finance conference in London in 1997. Harris had already come to the attention of financial regulators in various countries by the time that Marchant published his findings in OffshoreAlert in March 1998 but Marchant's report was the first to show a complete picture of Harris's operation. Among other things, Marchant accused The Harris Organisation of being an insolvent Ponzi scheme. In April that year Harris responded by filing a $30 million libel claim against Marchant which Harris lost. In 2000, he also lost his appeal against the original ruling.EXHIBIT: Marc Harris, Anatomy of an Offshore Service Provider Gone Bad. Quatloos! 23 April 2006.

It is also found in nicotine containing liquids for vaping, and in flavored cigarettes. It is often used as a flavoring substitute for diacetyl, but may share similar human pulmonary toxicity. ==Safety== As a flavoring agent, it is an ingredient in some e-liquid products for use with electronic cigarettes to give a buttery or caramel flavor. There is substantial evidence of the pulmonary toxicity of Acetylpropionyl in animals. Rats exposed to acetylpropionyl develop both fibrosis and necrosis of the respiratory tract. Mice exposed to acetylpropionyl demonstrate more bronchial constriction in response to methacholine challenge. It is also known to cause genetic changes in animal brains. Acetylpropionyl has been used as a substitute for the toxic flavoring chemical diacetyl. However, in one flavoring manufacturing facility that substituted diacetyl for acetylpropionyl, abnormal lung function values were associated with total time spent in production areas. An investigation by NIOSH in 2009 at a facility that used buttermilk flavoring containing acetylpropionyl demonstrated that workers had higher than average reports of shortness of breath, asthma, and restrictive type spirometry defects. Another investigation by NIOSH in 2013 at a flavoring manufacturer that used acetylpropionyl revealed that those workers who spent the most time working with flavoring chemicals, including acetylpropionyl, were more likely to have abnormal lung function as detected by pulmonary function tests. ==See also== * Diacetyl, a similar diketone ==References== Category:Diketones Category:Flavors ","title":"Acetylpropionyl"},{"id":"46335488","text":"Margaret Leland Goldsmith (1894-1971) was an American journalist, historical novelist and translator who lived and worked primarily in England.

Ordained as a priest in the Episcopal Church of the United States and later a suffragan bishop in the Diocese of Arkansas and the Southwest, Demby worked against racial discrimination and for interracial harmony, both within and outside of his church. ==Early and family life== Born in Wilmington, Delaware in 1869, the eldest child of Edward T. Demby IV and Mary Anderson Tippett (both freeborn), Edward Demby received his initial education from his uncle, Eddy Anderson, who operated a school behind Ezion (Northern) Methodist Episcopal Church, a pillar of Wilmington's African American community.http://www.blackpast.org/aah/ezion-mount-carmel-united- methodist-church-wilmington- delaware-1789http://archives.delaware.gov/markers/ncc/NC-143.shtml He then moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to attend the prestigious Institute for Colored Youth and then to Baltimore for the Centenary Bible Institute. He also attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., Wilberforce University in Ohio and University of Chicago, and taught younger children to support himself.Beary entry concerning Demby in Henry Louis Gates and Evelyn Brooks Higgenbotham, African American Lives, Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 228. Demby's first wife, Polly Alston Sherrill, died while he was serving in Tennessee. He then moved to St. Augustine's Church in Kansas City where, in 1902, he married Antoinette Ricks who had been one of Howard University's first nurse graduates and was then head nurse at Kansas City's Freedman's Hospital. ==Ministry== From 1894 to 1896, by then ordained an African Methodist Episcopal Church minister, Demby was Dean of Students at Paul Quinn College near Dallas, Texas. While there he was confirmed in the Episcopal Church. Bishop John Franklin Spalding of the Episcopal Diocese of Colorado became his mentor and ordained him a deacon in 1898 and a priest the following year. First assigned to Mason, Tennessee, Demby served as rector of St. Paul‚Äôs Church in Mason, as well as principal of St. Paul‚Äôs Parochial School, and vice principal of Hoffman Hall. From 1900 to 1907 he ministered to parishes in Kansas City, Missouri, Cairo, Illinois, and Key West, Florida.http://www.episcopalarchives.org/Afro- Anglican_history/exhibit/leadership/demby.php Demby experienced the institutionalized segregation of the Jim Crow South.http://www.episcopalcafe.com/institutionalized_segregation/ He returned to Tennessee in 1907 as rector of Emmanuel Church in Memphis, where he helped the African American congregation build its own church, as well as established first a boarding then an industrial school.Negro Education: A Study of the Private and Higher Schools for Colored People in the United States, Volume 2, p. 565 (U.S. Government Printing Office 1917) Nonetheless, that year, he condemned Booker T. Washington for being too servile to whites and denounced his system of industrial education as not in the interest of many blacks, siding with W.E.B. DuBois. Although Demby initially favored the missionary bishop plan for church service among African Americans, as opposed to the suffragan bishop plan ultimately selected by the General Convention that year, he became secretary of the ‚Äúcolored convocations‚Äù (segregated southern churches) and Archdeacon for Colored Work in the Episcopal Diocese of Tennessee. After his 1918 consecration as a bishop at All Saints' Church in St. Louis,Bragg, p. 212.John Aaron Wright, African Americans in Downtown St. Louis, Arcadia publishing, 2003 p. 76. Demby became suffragan bishop of Arkansas (the first African American to become bishop, although James Theodore Holly had become bishop of Haiti and Archdeacon James Solomon Russell of Virginia (likewise an educator and missionary among African Americans) had declined the Arkansas position, as W.E.B. DuBois noted.) Demby worked with black hospitals, schools and orphanages, as well as sought full recognition of African Americans within the Episcopal Church.J.

In 1932, racist elements within the Arkansas diocese held a convention at Newport which purported to elect a new bishop, whom the next General Convention refused to recognize. Nonetheless, by 1934, Demby was again a bishop in name only he and turned his attention to work on the national level. He served on the Forward Movement Commission, the Joint Commission on Negro Work (which influenced the General Convention of 1940 to abandon the Missionary District plan), and the Race Relations Commission. He was also active on the Southern Conference on Human Welfare, the American Association of the Advancement of Colored People, the American League for a Free Palestine, the American Humane Society, and the Sociology Society.Gates & Higgenbotham, p. 229. Demby founded and edited The Southwest Churchman and became the leading spokesperson in the desegregation of the Episcopal Church. His other publications (some through the presses operated by the Rev. George Freeman Bragg) included articles on the \\"Doctrine of Intention\\" (1905) and many devotional books, including Devotions of the Cross and at the Holy Mass, My Companion, A Bird‚Äôs Eye View of Exegetical Studies, The Writings of Saints Paul and James, The Holy Sacrament of the Altar and Penance, and The Manual of the Guild of One More Soul.George Freeman Bragg, History of the Afro-American Group of the Episcopal Church, 1922 p. 212 https://books.google.com/books?id=RIfZAAAAMAAJ&dq;=demby+devotions+of+the+cross&source;=gbs_navlinks_s ==Death and legacy== Demby retired in 1938, but continued to serve individual parishes in Kansas, Pittsburgh and Cleveland. He died in Cleveland in 1957, as did his wife Antoinette. He had lived to see the U.S. Supreme Court's desegregation decision in Brown v. Board of Education and its support in Arkansas by Episcopal bishop R. Bland Mitchell, who had also reversed years of declining membership in the diocese.http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry- detail.aspx?entryID=1175 He was eulogized as someone who could eradicate racism by sheer good example, if that were possible.Gates and Higgenbotham, p. 229, better cite needed Both Demby and his wife Antoinette Demby are interred at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78107773 The Episcopal Church honors him and Henry Beard Delany, who was consecrated as suffragan bishop of North Carolina shortly before him with a feast day on the liturgical calendar on the anniversary of their mutual death (29 years apart), April 14.

When the children that work for the Vulture are discussing what to do after the Superior Spider-Man (Otto Octavius's mind in Spider-Man's body) brutally defeats the Vulture, the Green Goblin approaches the children and tells the group that he will be the one that crushes Superior Spider-Man. The Goblin is later shown having gathered a new gang of followers together in the sewers formed from discarded members of other villains' gangs like Vulture, Owl and the third White Dragon's gangs; these henchmen escaped their organizations unharmed because Superior Spider-Man is more focused on the larger threats (where the original Spider-Man would focus on individuals). While building an army to attack Superior Spider-Man, he acts as the Goblin King. The Hand ninjas who evaded capture arrive at the sewers and join up with the Goblin Nation. The group revels in the news that, thanks to Superior Spider-Man's assault, Goblin King now owns over half of New York's organized crime. He claims he now owns New York City as the Goblin Kingpin of Crime. With the help of Menace, Goblin King later releases Phil Urich from a prison transport and upgrades Urich's Goblin armor and weapons, asking in return only that Urich's only identity from here on shall be Goblin Knight. Goblin King trains Goblin Knight, anxious to confront Superior Spider-Man. Goblin King later poses as the Hobgoblin and is sighted by some of the Spiderlings. Upon Carlie Cooper being brought to the Goblin King's lair by Menace, he receives Carlie's journal from Menace which reveals to him that Otto's mind is in his nemesis's body. Goblin King douses Carlie with the Goblin formula, causing the woman to mutate into the new superhuman villain Monster. He demands to know Spider- Man's identity, but Monster first asks Goblin King to reveal his own identity. Goblin King assures Monster that he is Norman, but refuses to remove his mask until Carlie has proven a loyal follower and dispatches Monster and Menace on a mission. Goblin King battles and kills the Hobgoblin, although Goblin Knight discovers that it was the butler Claude with Roderick Kingsley still in hiding abroad. Having staged a coup of New York after spreading his resources by exploiting Otto's reliance on technology, the Goblin King directly confronts Superior Spider-Man, angry that he was cheated out of the opportunity to defeat his nemesis, but offering Otto the chance to join him and Otto rejects the offer. When Otto finds being unable to win against Goblin King's resources, having had various allies abandoned, and with faith in his own abilities gone, Otto sacrifices himself to restore the original Spider-Man's mind in order to save Anna Maria Marconi. When Spider-Man arrives for the final confrontation, Goblin King quickly realizes that the original Spider-Man is back when responding to his nemesis' taunts with his own wisecracks. In the duel that follows, Spider-Man unmasks Goblin King, learning that he has undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance, acting as Alchemax's CEO and intending to re-establish himself as businessman Mason Banks, now that Osborn has become too publicly known as a supervillain. Spider-Man defeats and strips the villain of his powers with a serum devised by Otto, but Norman manages to escape through Liz Allan's discreet aid. In hiding once again, he reflects that the various heroes will be unprepared for him when he returns with his new identity and approach as a businessman, seemingly no longer afflicted by the mental illness associated with the Goblin formula.Superior Spider-Man #31. Marvel Comics. Phil Urich Philip \\"Phil\\" Urich is the second character to use the Goblin King alias. Following the conclusion of The Superior Spider-Man storyline where the true Spider-Man returns, Urich now leads the Goblin Nation's remnants as the self-proclaimed Goblin King. He meets with Mister Negative where they wait for Eel to show up in order to divide the criminal underground following Osborn's defeat. The meeting is crashed by the Black Cat and Electro. Black Cat mentions to Goblin King and Mister Negative that Spider-Man had outed them and wants a share in their plans.Amazing Spider-Man vol. 3 #5. Marvel Comics.

When Goblin King confronts Kingsley in the latter's headquarters, Queen Cat comes to the defense. Goblin King recognizes Hollister as Queen Cat, but Lily does not recognize him. Following the attack, Missile Mate is convinced by Urich that the Hobgoblin would soon abandon the heroes that were trained. Missile Mate goes to the Goblin Nation's headquarters and asks Goblin King to join and be a supervillain. Goblin King is reluctant, but Missile Mate shows him that he has also gathered all the supervillains that Hobgoblin had \\"abandoned\\" (consisting of 8-Ball III, Killer Shrike II, Melter III, Tiger Shark II, and Unicorn IV) after becoming a good guy.AXIS: Hobgoblin #2.

If the processes involved in forming new tissue can be reverse-engineered into humans, it may be possible to heal injuries of the spinal cord or brain, repair damaged organs and reduce scarring and fibrosis after surgery. Despite the large conservation of the Hox genes through evolution, mammals and humans specifically cannot regenerate any of their limbs. This raises a question as to why humans which also possess an analog to these genes cannot regrow and regenerate limbs. Beside the lack of specific growth factor, studies have shown that something as small as base pair differences between amphibian and human Hox analogs play a crucial role in human inability to reproduce limbs. Undifferentiated stem cells and the ability to have polarity in tissues is vital to this process. ==Overview== Regeneration is determined by the level of amputation within the limb-field, and not with reference to the organism as a whole. A, Dorsal, and B, Ventral, views of a newt in which the legs were amputated above the thigh, and shanks were grafted in their place and subsequently amputated. C, Radiogram, showing that only the tarsus and foot have been regenerated: i.e. structures distal to the graft. Some amphibians and reptiles have the ability to regenerate limbs, eyes, spinal cords, hearts, intestines, and upper and lower jaws. The Japanese fire belly newt can regenerate its eye lens 18 times over a period of 16 years and retain its structural and functional properties. The cells at the site of the injury have the ability to undifferentiate, reproduce rapidly, and differentiate again to create a new limb or organ. Hox genes are a group of related genes that control the body plan of an embryo along the head-tail axis. They are responsible for body segment differentiation and express the arrangement of numerous body components during initial embryonic development.Wirtz, R. M. (2006). U.S. Patent Application 11/996,680. Primarily, these sets of genes are utilized during the development of body plans by coding for the transcription factors that trigger production of body segment specific structures. Additionally in most animals, these genes are laid out along the chromosome similar to the order in which they are expressed along the anterior‚Äìposterior axis. Variants of the Hox genes are found almost in every phylum with the exception of the sponge which use a different type of developmental genes. The homology of these genes is of important interest to scientists as they may hold more answers to the evolution of many species. In fact, these genes demonstrate such a high degree of homology that a human Hox gene variant ‚Äì HOXB4 ‚Äì could mimic the function of its homolog in the fruit fly (Drosophila). Studies suggest that the regulation and other target genes in different species are actually what causes such a great difference in phenotypic difference between species. Hox genes contain a DNA sequence known as the homeobox that are involved in the regulation of patterns of anatomical development. They contain a specific DNA sequence with the aim of providing instructions for making a string of 60 protein building blocks - amino acids- which are referred to as the homeodomain. Most homeodomain-containing proteins function as transcription factors and fundamentally bind and regulate the activity of different genes. The homeodomain is the segment of the protein that binds to precise regulatory regions of the target genes. Genes within the homeobox family are implicated in a wide variety of significant activities during growth. These activities include directing the development of limbs and organs along the anterior-posterior axis and regulating the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions, a process known as cellular differentiation. Certain homeobox genes can act tumor suppressors, which means they help prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Due to the fact that homeobox genes have so many important functions, mutations in these genes are accountable for a wide array of developmental disorders. Changes in certain homeobox genes often result in eye disorders, cause abnormal head, face, and tooth development. Additionally, increased or decreased activity of certain homeobox genes has been associated with several forms of cancer later in life. ==Limb development== Essentially, Hox genes contribute to the specification of three main components of limb development, including the stylopod, zeugopod and autopod. Certain mutations in Hox genes can potentially lead to the proximal and/or distal losses along with different abnormalities. Three different models have been created for outlining the patterning of these regions. The Zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) in the limb bud has pattern-organizing activity through the utilization of a morphogen gradient of a protein called Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Sonic hedgehog is turned on in the posterior region via the early expression of HoxD genes, along with the expression of Hoxb8. Shh is maintained in the posterior through a feedback loop between the ZPA and the AER. Shh cleaves the Ci/Gli3 transcriptional repressor complex to convert the transcription factor Gli3 to an activator, which activates the transcription of HoxD genes along the anterior/posterior axis. It is evident that different Hox genes are critical for proper limb development in different amphibians. Researchers conducted a study targeting the Hox-9 to Hox-13 genes in different species of frogs and other amphibians. Similar to an ancient tetrapod group with assorted limb types, it is important to note that amphibians are required for the understanding of the origin and diversification of limbs in different land vertebrates. A PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) study was conducted in two species of each amphibian order to identify Hox-9 to Hox-13. Fifteen distinct posterior Hox genes and one retro-pseudogene were identified, and the former confirm the existence of four Hox clusters in each amphibian order. Certain genes expected to occur in all tetrapods, based on the posterior Hox complement of mammals, fishes and coelacanth, were not recovered. HoxD-12 is absent in frogs and possibly other amphibians. By definition, the autopodium is distal segment of a limb, comprising the hand or foot. Considering Hox-12‚Äôs function in autopodium development, the loss of this gene may be related to the absence of the fifth finger in frogs and salamanders. ==Hox clusters== The eastern newt (Notophthalmus viridescens) As previously mentioned, Hox genes encode transcription factors that regulate embryonic and post-embryonic developmental processes. The expression of Hox genes is regulated in part by the tight, spatial arrangement of conserved coding and non-coding DNA regions. The potential for evolutionary alterations in Hox cluster composition is viewed to be small among vertebrates. On the other hand, recent studies of a small number of non-mammalian taxa propose greater dissimilarity than initially considered. Next, generation sequencing of considerable genomic fragments greater than 100 kilobases from the eastern newt (Notophthalmus viridescens) was analyzed. Subsequently, it was found that the composition of Hox cluster genes were conserved relative to orthologous regions from other vertebrates. Furthermore, it was found that the length of introns and intergenic regions varied. In particular, the distance between HoxD13 and HoxD11 is longer in newt than orthologous regions from vertebrate species with expanded Hox clusters and is predicted to exceed the length of the entire HoxD clusters (HoxD13‚ÄìHoxD4) of humans, mice, and frogs. Many recurring DNA sequences were recognized for newt Hox clusters, counting an enrichment of DNA transposon-like sequences similar to non-coding genomic fragments. Researchers found the results to suggest that Hox cluster expansion and transposon accumulation are common features of non-mammalian tetrapod vertebrates. After the loss of a limb, cells draw together to form a clump known as a blastema. This superficially appears undifferentiated, but cells that originated in the skin later develop into new skin, muscle cells into new muscle and cartilage cells into new cartilage. It is only the cells from just beneath the surface of the skin that are pluripotent and able to develop into any type of cell. Salamander Hox genomic regions show elements of conservation and variety in comparison to other vertebrate species. Whereas the structure and organization of Hox coding genes is conserved, newt Hox clusters show variation in the lengths of introns and intergenic regions, and the HoxD13‚Äì11 region exceeds the lengths of orthologous segments even among vertebrate species with expanded Hox clusters. Researchers have suggested that the HoxD13‚Äì11 expansion predated a basal salamander genome size amplification that occurred approximately 191 million years ago, because it preserved in all three extant amphibian groups. Supplementary verification supports the proposal that Hox clusters are acquiescent to structural evolution and variation is present in the lengths of introns and intergenic regions, relatively high numbers of repetitive sequences, and non-random accumulations of DNA transposons in newts and lizards. Researchers found that the non-random accretion of DNA-like transposons could possibly change developmental encoding by generating sequence motifs for transcriptional control. In conclusion, the available data from several non-mammalian tetrapods suggest that Hox structural flexibility is the rule, not the exception. It is thought that this elasticity may allow for developmental variation across non-mammalian taxa. This is of course true for both embryogenesis and during the redeployment of Hox genes during post- embryonic developmental processes, such as metamorphosis and regeneration. ==Gradient fields== Another phenomena that exists in animal models is the presence of gradient fields in early development. More specifically, this has been shown in the aquatic amphibian: the newt. These \\"gradient fields\\" as they are known in developmental biology, have the ability to form the appropriate tissues that they are designed to form when cells from other parts of the embryo are introduced or transplanted into specific fields. The first reporting of this was in 1934. Originally, the specific mechanism behind this rather bizarre phenomenon was not known, however Hox genes have been shown to be prevalent behind this process. More specifically, a concept now known as polarity has been implemented as one - but not the only one - of the mechanisms that are driving this development. Studies done by Oliver and colleagues in 1988 showed that different concentrations of XIHbox 1 antigen was present along the anterior-posterior mesoderm of various developing animal models. One conclusion that this varied concentration of protein expression is actually causing differentiation amongst various tissues and could be one of the culprits behind these so-called \\"gradient fields\\". While the protein products of Hox genes are strongly involved in these fields and differentiation in amphibians and reptiles, there are other causality factors involved. For example, retinoic acid and other growth factors have been shown to play a role in these gradient fields. ==References== Category:Vertebrate developmental biology Category:Developmental genes and proteins Category:Gene expression Category:Molecular genetics Category:Molecular biology Category:Regenerative biomedicine Category:Tissue engineering ","title":"Hox genes in amphibians and reptiles"},{"id":"46335540","text":"Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park is a National Park Service unit in the states of Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The park was created for the purpose of preserving, protecting, and interpreting the industrial heritage of the Blackstone River Valley and the urban, rural, and agricultural landscape of that region. The Blackstone River Valley was the site of some of the earliest successful textile mills in the United States, and these mills contributed significantly to the earliest American Industrial Revolution. The subsequent construction of the Blackstone Canal, a few years after the successful completion of the Erie Canal, helped to sustain the region's industrial strength. The park's establishment was included as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama on December 19, 2014. It is closely related to the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor, which is not a unit of the National Park System, but the National Historical Park contains only a subset of the sites associated with that National Heritage Area. The Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor continues to exist independently of the National Historical Park. ==Background== Samuel Slater, an English industrialist, constructed his first textile mill in Pawtucket, in 1793, along the Blackstone River. In addition to utilizing advanced new technology he had learned about in England, which had previously never been used in an American mill, Slater implemented an innovative management style that helped his factory find significant success. He went on to establish other factories, including the company towns like the village of Slatersville in North Smithfield, Rhode Island. The textile industry continued to expand in the Blackstone region, spawning numerous mill towns. By the late 1820s, the industry was thriving to such an extent that more efficient transportation methods were needed, which led to the construction of the Blackstone Canal connecting Worcester, Massachusetts to the sea port at Providence, Rhode Island. The region's advances were an important component in American industrial history. This history was deemed nationally significant by Congress in 1986 when it created the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor, a collaboration between the National Park Service, state and local governments, and non-profit entities to encourage preservation and tourism in the region. In looking for ways to enhance achieving those goals, Congress requested that the National Park Service conduct a special resource study to determine if certain sites in the region should be included as a formal unit of the National Park System. This study was completed in 2011, and recommended the creation of a National Historical Park, which was then established in 2014. ==Park sites== Slater Mill Based on its establishment legislation, the park encompasses the following sites: * Blackstone River State Park, Rhode Island: This park borders both the Blackstone River and Canal and contains bike paths, walking trails, and river access. The Wilbur Kelly Museum, built by former merchant ship's captain and mill owner Wilbur Kelly, is also within the park, and the museum tells the story of the region's transportation history. * Ashton Historic District, Rhode Island: Built in 1867 by the Lonsdale Company, the Ashton Mill village is the second generation textile mill village expanded from Wilbur Kelly's mill that was located directly across the Blackstone River in what is now the Blackstone River State Park. * Slater Mill National Historic Landmark District, Rhode Island: Originally built in 1793, the Slater Mill is one of the oldest successful textile mills in the United States and a contributor to the industrial development of the region. The mill complex is a National Historic Landmark. * Slatersville Historic District, Rhode Island: This district includes the Slatersville Mill and the company town established by Samuel Slater after he had achieved success at the original Slater Mill in Pawtucket. The district is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. * Whitinsville Historic District, Massachusetts: This district is centered around an 1826 brick mill building.

Oro-Medonte Township was one of several Simcoe County communities that raised a flag for pride week 2013. Fiert√© Simcoe Pride is an annual festival held in Simcoe County, Ontario, during the end of July and beginning of August each year. It is a celebration of the diversity of the LGBT community in Simcoe County. It is one of the larger regional gay pride festivals in Canada, featuring flag raisings and proclamations from across the County, educational events, artistic and cultural events, and a large signature closing event. Since forming, the organisation has expanded gradually, involving more year- round events. In 2016, the organisation celebrated its fifth anniversary Pride. ==Leadership and organization== Pride Week and year-round events are run by Fiert√© Simcoe Pride, a not-for-profit, volunteer-run organisation. The mission of Fiert√© Simcoe Pride is to \\"create and offer inclusive events, services, and educational opportunities that rise above heterosexism, hetero- normativity and homo/bi/transphobia, promoting safe communities within Simcoe County.\\" \\"Simcoe Pride - About Us\\" Fiert√© Simcoe Pride . The organisation also uses a list of objectives and values as guidelines.\\"About\\" Fiert√© Simcoe Pride. Fiert√© Simcoe Pride is managed by a volunteer Board of Directors, who handle the finances, logistics and operations of the organisation and events. They also oversee the long-term vision, objectives and values. In addition, volunteers are involved in running the events. The events are funded through donations, sponsorships, in-kind support, and fundraisers. ==LGBT history in Simcoe County== Drag queen \\"Madame Outrageous\\", founder and president of the Craig Russell Fan Club, at Dusty's Den in the early 2000s Organizing for the LGBT community in Simcoe County has been traced back to the mid 1980s/early 1990s with faith-based communities, various community-based committees, social groups and school-based supports. These community based supports either relied on fundraising from a small pool of supporters, were offered for a fee or were sponsored through an organization. With a lack of sustainability, many of these supports no longer exist or have evolved into different resources like those offered by Rainbow Health Ontario and programming provided by the AIDS Committee of Simcoe County.\\"LGBT Youth Needs Assessment: Making It Better Today\\" Rainbow Health Ontario, January, 2012.  Early celebrations and community  In 1984, the Gays and Lesbians Alliance of Simcoe County (GLAS) formed and ran until 2001. They held a cruise on the Serendipity Princess from 1996 to 2000, subsequently the boat cruise was run by: The Spot (bar) in 2001 and 2002, Club C'est La Vie from 2003 to 2005, Dusty's Den in 2006 and 2007, and Club Chill Events in 2008. The Simcoe County Metropolitan Community Church (SCMCC), led by Reverend Carol Galbraith founded in the early '90s, around 1993, and advocated for the LGBT community as well as the legalization of Same-sex marriage in Canada.\\"Metropolitan Community Churches\\" Perceptions: The Gay & Lesbian Newsmagazine of the Prairies . It also provided support to the community and each year held a banquet and awards ceremony to honour people and organizations who supported and advocated for the lesbian, gay, bisexual an transgender community the region.\\"Simcoe County Metropolitan Community Church: 2001 Heroes\\" Equal Marriage, September 30, 2001. The congregation met at Grove Street United Church and existed until the mid to late 2000s.\\"Gay congregation opens the doors as church grows\\" Huntsville Forester, December 19, 2003.  H.O.P.E. Theatre Troupe and youth  The Holding On through Peer Education (H.O.P.E.) Theatre Troupe (through the ACSC, now the Gilbert Centre) was a program that had some success with securing funding in the late 1990s, however it was limited. Although not an LGBT specific program, LGBT youth found it to be a safe space. In the early 2000s the program was no longer sustainable due to lack of funding. The LGBT Youth Drop-In, a sponsored program of the AIDS Committee of Simcoe County had success in the early 2000s although the program depended on community fundraisers and in-kind donations. Eventually this program could no longer sustain itself. In 2011 two Ryerson University students identified a need to support LGBT youth in Simcoe County. They started the LGBT Youth Connection with their own resources and support of other organizations. The program is still running, and has expanded from Barrie into other parts of the county.\\"Youth Programming\\" ACSC.  Opening Closets  In 2003, Huronia Transition Homes formed the Diversity Committee and ran the Opening Closets conference, which took place every other year. They eventually renamed themselves the Opening Closets Conference Committee. The conference was an opportunity to inform and train a variety of workers on sexual diversity and LGBT issues. In 2009 the Opening Closets conference had a particular focus on LGBT youth. This committee has been, to the best of knowledge, non-active since 2010.  Formalizing Pride and community work  In May 2002, PFLAG Barrie formed, running meetings to support for families, allies and people who are LGBT.\\"PFLAG Barrie - Our Meetings. The group struggled for several year, and had different people run it, until October 2008 when a dedicated family took it over.\\"Coming out as a family\\" Barrie Examiner Saturday, August 21, 2010. The group had been inactive from 2011 to approximately 2017, when it was revived again as PFLAG Barrie-Simcoe County. The group now runs several support groups throughout the county as well as a choir, known as The Quoir.

In 2008, LGBTA Barrie formed (formalizing in 2009), holding fundraisers and bar events at Memories. They also did a flag raising in 2008 to honour International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia (IDAHOT) and ran a pride week in August 2008 and 2009.\\"Community speaks out about homophobia\\" Barrie Examiner, Friday, May 15, 2009. Once Simcoe Pride formed, the Board decided to hold Simcoe Pride Week in or around the month of August (as opposed to during June, the popular month to hold Pride events) to honour the past pride events that existed in the County.  School-based support  The Georgian LGBTQA Association of Georgian College formed in 2009, holding a flag raising at the Barrie Campus. It has since rebranded twice, now operating under the name of Georgian Pride. In March of that year they held a World Caf√© in partnership with Rainbow Health Ontario (RHO). After this conference, several organizations and events formed, such as Muskoka Pride (first as a picnic, then a committee in 2010),\\"Past Muskoka Pride Picnic & Events Muskoka Pride. the Simcoe County LGBTQ Network, and the Safety and Equity Conference. In 2010 the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation District 17 Human Rights Committee organized their first conference for students who participated in their Gay- Straight Alliances (GSAs).

Image:Simcoe Pride 2012 Movie.jpgSome community members at the dusk till dawn movie night  Growth of support  Following the inaugural festival, Simcoe Pride, led by Mary Sue Robinet, began planning for pride week 2013, which took place from August 2 to 10. Simcoe Pride Week 2013 was larger than the year before, with eight days of events spread over nine days. In addition to hosting the first annual boat cruise, that did not happen the year before, the pride week (and its flag raisings) expanded from Barrie to other communities in the county, including Ramara, Oro-Medonte, New Tecumseth , Orillia, Innisfil, Bradford West Gwillimbury, Midland and Penetanguishene.\\"Pride in Simcoe\\" Orillia Packet & Times, Friday, July 26, 2013. Other events included Saturday a family fun fair, dusk till dawn movie night, candlelight vigil, 'Make It Safe' march, community art show and silent auction, and all-ages semi-formal and close-off party. The march, Robinet named 'Make It Safe', was held in response to an act of violence against a community member who was targeted and assaulted. Though violence and discrimination toward LGBT people is not unheard of, any victims are afraid to speak out. Although the march was planned earlier, organizers changed the name to reflect the violent attack as well as to raise awareness about other issues LGBT individuals face.\\"Victim using march to heal\\" Barrie Advance, August 6, 2013.\\"Simcoe Pride hosts candlelight vigil and march in Barrie\\" Barrie Examiner, Wednesday, August 7, 2013. The following year, Robinet made Simcoe Pride Week from July 31 to August 9, 2014. This pride week was a considerably large festival in comparison to the past prides, this is because the week had support from the county and the largest number of municipalities yet, with flag raisings at the County of Simcoe, and in Barrie, Orillia, Bradford West Gwillimbury, Ramara, Innisfil, Wasaga Beach, Chippewas of Rama First Nation, New Tecumseth, Midland, Penetanguishene, Clearview, and Oro Medonte. With the exception of Clearview, all also proclaimed pride along with Severn and Adjala‚ÄìTosorontio. Collingwood, which has a policy against flag raisings and proclamations, did promote the festival on their website as a way to provide recognition.\\"Clearview residents express disappointment in council, saying Pride flag should be flown\\" Collingwood Enterprise Bulletin, Tuesday, January 27, 2015. Essa, Springwater, Tay, and Tiny did not participate; Beausoleil First Nation did not reply and Canadian Forces Base Borden was not sent a request. As well as the growth in municipal support, the festival had more events across the county garnering over a thousand in attendance during the week and 2,500 attendees at year round events according to festival organizers.  2015 Pride and advocacy work  Fiert√© Simcoe Pride 2015 was held from July 30 to August 8. With the continued growth of support from community members, municipalities and media, there was an increased effort to get the rest of the County to participate in Fiert√© Simcoe Pride. In January 2015, the decision to fly the pride flag in Clearview was stalled at a Council meeting.\\"Decision to fly pride flag in Clearview stalls at council table\\" The Creemore Echo, Friday, January 16, 2015. The Township had a policy against issuing proclamations in support of organizations, and usually didn't raise flags either but in 2014, an exception was made and council agreed to fly the pride flag at the municipal office for the first time. Councillor Robert Walker me the request opposition saying that in his Christian belief he would not be supporting it. At a Council meeting later in January, residents spoke in support of raising the flag and urged Council to review its policy.\\"Clearview should fly Pride flag, say residents\\" The Wasaga Sun, Tuesday, January 27, 2015. After pressure from local residents and the attention of local, nation and international Pride organizations - including York Region Pride, Fiert√© Canada Pride and InterPride - Clearview Council reviewed its policy at the April 13 meeting and ruled in favour of issuing proclamations.\\"Clearview council changes rules on proclamations\\" The Wasaga Sun, Wednesday, April 15, 2015.\\"Clearview council to consider proclamations\\" The Creemore Echo, Friday, April 17, 2015.\\"Discussion of future of Creemore‚Äôs Collingwood Street bridge pits romantics against realists \\" The Collingwood Enterprise Bulletin, Thursday, April 16, 2015. Clearview has currently not approved to raise the flag due to the availability of flagpoles and flag etiquette, however Simcoe Pride is working with the township to find an appropriate place to raise the flag. In January 2015, Tiny Township decided 4-1 to proclaim Simcoe Pride Week 2015. They also requested a flag raising. The motion revised a resolution passed in March 2007, to the effect that the Franco-Ontario flag would be raised each year during Francophone Week, but that requests for other declarations and flag raisings would not be accepted. This Council decided to consider such requests case by case.\\"Report on Council: January 26, 2015\\" The Tiny Cottager, Monday, January 26, 2015. In 2015 there was 16 proclamations, 14 flag raisings, and one banner unveiling at Orillia Soldiers' Memorial Hospital.\\"Past Pride Weeks\\" Fiert√© Simcoe Pride Tay, Springwater and Essa, did not participate; Canadian Forces Base Borden was sent a request but was unable to participate, and Collingwood maintained a no flag raising and no proclamation policy but supports pride in other ways.

Williams before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources (December 17, 2013) She attended Michigan State University and received her Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry in 1976. Her graduate studies were at the California Institute of Technology, where she received her PhD in Chemistry in 1981, for research supervised by William Henry Weinberg.University of Maryland, Curriculum Vitae of Ellen D. Williams ==Career== Williams did postdoctoral studies at the University of Maryland under the supervision of R.L. Park from 1981 to 1983. Then promoted to assistant professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, which is part of the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences, she advanced to associate professor in 1987, and professor of Physics and the Institute for Physical Science and Technology in 1991. Building on her fundamental work on the morphology of solid surfaces, she founded the University of Maryland Materials Research Group in 1991 and led its expansion to become the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center in 1996. She served as its Director from 1996 through 2009. In 2000 she was named Distinguished University Professor. She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003,American Academy of Arts and Sciences, New Members, Class of 2003. and to the National Academy of Sciences in 2005. She served as the Chair of the NAS committee on Technical Issues Concerning the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty from 2009-11. In 2010, Williams took a leave of absence from UMD to become chief scientist at BP, a position which she held until April 2014. Then, having been nominated by President Barack Obama in November 2013 to become director of ARPA-E and awaiting Senate confirmation, she became a senior adviser in the office of the Secretary of Energy. She was confirmed on December 8, 2014, and subsequently sworn into her position at ARPA-E.Energy.gov, \\"Dr. Ellen Williams Confirmed as Director of ARPA-E\\" She served as ARPA-E director until the end of the Obama administration in January 2017, and then resumed her position as Distinguished University Professor at the University of Maryland. In May 2020, Williams was appointed as Director of the Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center at the University of Maryland. Her five year term as Director will begin in July 2020. She sits on the International Scientific Advisory Committee of Australia's ARC Centre of Excellence in Future Low-Energy Electronics Technologies.  Academic Research  Williams' research in experimental surface science explores fundamental issues in statistical mechanics, particularly including practical applications nanotechnology. Her research group pioneered applications of direct imaging techniques for atomic-scale structures on surfaces. She worked closely with theorists to design experiments to address theoretical and conceptual questions important to the fields of catalysis, thin film growth and nano-electronics. She has published over 200 academic articles, which have been cited over 8000 times. Her most widely cited work includes at least four areas of fundamental research (see Selected Publications below); structure-transport relationships in graphene, surface morphology and step fluctuations, electronic interactions with surface defects, and adsorbate-interactions.  Technical Issues in National Security  In parallel with her academic career, Williams has worked extensively in providing technical advice to the U.S. government, primarily through the Departments of Energy and Defense. As a result of her experience, in 2009 she was asked to lead a study on issues of verification of nuclear testing,‚ÄúAssessing the Treaty's verifiability, Interview with Ellen Williams, Director of the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Research Projects Agency ‚Äì Energy‚Äù CTBTO Spectrum Publication, issue 23, p. 13 (2015), which was one of the concerns cited in the Senate decision not to ratify the treaty in 1999. The resulting report,‚ÄúTechnical Issues Concerning the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,‚Äù National Research Council, 2012. reviews the verification capabilities in the US and at the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Organization (CTBTO), and shows that detection capability advanced significantly over the years after the 1999 U.S. decision not to ratify. The report places the state- of-the art detection capability in the context of different types of proliferation threats, and thus provides a valuable context for decision makers. The report also emphasizes the importance of sustaining and continuing to advance technical capabilities for verification, both in the U.S. and at the CTBTO. Williams is the vice-chair of JASON, an independent group of scientists offering advice to the US government on key science and technology issues‚ÄúJason‚Äîa secretive group of Cold War science advisers‚Äîis fighting to survive in the 21st century..  Chief Scientist at BP  At BP, Williams worked in Group Technology, where she was responsible for assurance of technology programs, and strategic research and program development. Early in her tenure, she set up the initial advisory structure for BP's Gulf of Mexico Research InitiativeGOMRI History. Within the company, she advocated for increased implementation of advanced computational approaches in molecular chemistry, fluid dynamics, and distributed sensing and ‚Äòbig data‚Äô analysis. She also led a strategic multi-university research program on natural resource constraints in the context of energy (the Energy Sustainability Challenge),.Energy and Natural Resources. In addition to the extensive University research publications that resulted from the program, the ESC team also created three reference booklets on energy-resource issues, ‚ÄúThe ESC Materials Handbook\\",Zepf V., Reller A., Rennie C., Ashfield M. & Simmons J.: Materials critical to the energy industry.

Williams has spoken widely about the need for advances in Science and Technology to sustainably supply the energy the world needs.  Department of Energy  Prior to Senate confirmation for her role in ARPA-E, Williams served as a senior advisor to the Secretary on DOE's technology transfer policies, issues, and plans. She established the Department's new Office of Technology Transitions Energy Department Announces New Office of Technology Transitions . to expand the economic impact of the Department's extensive Research and Development activities. Williams joined ARPA-E just before its sixth anniversary, as the Agency's portfolio of active and alumni technology development programs ARPA-E projects and programs. were forming a pipeline of energy technology innovation that ranges from early stage to more mature stages of technical readiness. As a result of ARPA-E's unique operational model, in which projects are managed both against ambitious technical and commercial goals, increasing numbers of the mature projects were proving attractive to follow-on investors, had products in field testing, or had early stage commercial products. ARPA-E Projects Receive more than $1.25 Billion in Private Follow-on Funding for Transformational Energy Technologies. During her tenure at ARPA-E, Williams focused on streamlining ARPA-E's administrative processes to better support the innovation teams working under ARPA-E funding, on strengthening the support given teams in preparing their new technologies for commercial uptake, and on establishing rigorous assessment practices.

It includes both modern turtles (Testudines) and all of their extinct relatives (also known as stem-turtles). ==Classification== The identity of the ancestors and closest relatives of the turtle lineage was a longstanding scientific mystery, though new discoveries and better analyses in the early 21st century began to clarify turtle relationships. Analysis of fossil data has shown that turtles are diapsid reptiles, most closely related either to the archosaurs (crocodiles, bird, and relatives) or the lepidosaurs (lizards, tuatara, and relatives). Genetic analysis strongly favors the hypothesis that turtles are the closest relatives of the archosaurs, though studies using only fossil evidence often continue to recover them as relatives of lepidosaurs. Studies using only fossils, as well as studies using a combination of fossil and genetic evidence, both suggest that sauropterygians, the group of prehistoric marine reptiles including the plesiosaurs and the often superficially turtle-like placodonts, are themselves stem-turtles. The cladogram shown below follows the most likely result found by an analysis of turtle relationships using both fossil and genetic evidence by M.S. Lee, in 2013. This study found Eunotosaurus, usually regarded as a turtle relative, to be only very distantly related to turtles in the clade Parareptilia. The cladogram below follows the most likely result found by another analysis of turtle relationships, this one using only fossil evidence, published by Rainer Schoch and Hans-Dieter Sues in 2015. This study found Eunotosaurus to be an actual early stem-turtle, though other versions of the analysis found weak support for it as a parareptile. Time-calibrated phylogeny recovered by Shaffer et al. (2017) dated the split of Pantestudines from its sister clade (the clade containing archosaurs and all tetrapods more closely related to archosaurs than to any other living animals) to mid-Carboniferous. ==References== Category:Prehistoric reptile taxa ","title":"Pantestudines"},{"id":"46335670","text":"The Northeastern German Football Association (), the NOFV, is one of five regional organisations of the German Football Association, the DFB, and covers the states of Berlin, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony, Saxony- Anhalt and Thuringia.Regional Associations DFB website.

In 1975, Peter Christianson, a race car driver whose father died in a car accident at a young age, joined the organization and began to develop methods that have become the basis of driver's education courses offered today by Young Drivers of Canada. In 1979, Young Drivers of Canada held their first rally to promote safe driving. In the same year, Young Drivers instructors began using full low-beam headlights during their lessons, which also turns on rear lights, to increase visibility to other drivers and reduce the risk of collisions. In 1984, Christianson was appointed President of Young Drivers of Canada and in 1989, Naumann retired and sold his portion of Young Drivers. In 1987, The company expanded to the United States and in 1990, Young Drivers of Canada Finland, Young Drivers Your License to Survive was established. In 1995, Young Drivers of Canada introduced its Collisionfree!‚Ñ¢ program, designed to aid experienced driver in developing proactive and reactive driving habits. Young Drivers of Canada was directly involved in developing the structure of Ontario's graduated licensing program in Ontario, Canada. In 1997, with input from Peter Christianson, Young Drivers of Canada was instrumental in designing the G2 driving license test requirements, the final test required by students to be licensed in Ontario. The U.S. division expanded until 1999 when the Ford Motor Company purchased Young Drivers of Canada. Ford focused development on the Canadian operations and the U.S. division was eventually closed. In 2003, Young Drivers of Canada introduced its CogniFit¬Æ program. The program trains students to use their cognitive abilities to handle issues with reaction time and divided attention. Later, the course was update to include a demonstration of the perils of texting and driving.\\"Think it‚Äôs easy to text and drive? Think again\\". Mike Drolet, Global News, September 19, 2016 The Ford Motor Company held equity in Young Drivers of Canada until 2005 when their interest was bought out by private investment. The company received national exposure when their students became involved in protests in front of local liquor stores, carrying the message that drinking and driving was not acceptable. In 2009, Young Drivers of Canada franchisees experienced a significant drop in revenue during the Ministry of Transportation Ontario, driving test strike, which continued for four months. During this time period, no road tests were taken, no exams were written and no licenses were issued. About this time, Young Drivers of Canada added a distance education program to the course curriculum. In 2013, the company began phasing out instruction with manual transmissions.\\"Driver instruction: is it time to ditch the stick shift?\\".

In 2017, Young Drivers of Canada operates 45 corporate driving centres in Canada with a staff of about 400, many of whom are driving instructors. The head office manages five corporate franchises with 45 classroom and about 175 employees. Due to the Covid 19 pandemic, in 2020 there are no physical classrooms operated in the Greater Toronto Area at least, and all classroom learning is offered online- only. With approval from other jurisdictions, expect this virtual classroom model to become the standard for all YD-served areas.

The method of using systematic reviews (a collection of available evidence on any given topic) is to provide evidence for use by policy makers, clinicians, regulators, and even the general public who benefit when these materials are easy to understand and are accessible. The vision of Evidence Aid is to create and satisfy an increasing demand for evidence to improve the impact of humanitarian aid by stimulating the use of an evidence-based approach. Evidence Aid was founded in 2004. It is currently a project that is housed by the Cochrane Collaboration and Queens University Belfast. Evidence Aid was established by several members of the international Cochrane Collaboration following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Evidence Aid was formed to provide systematic reviews on the effects of interventions and actions of relevance prior to, in the course of and during the aftermath of disasters or other humanitarian emergencies, in order to improve health-related outcomes; their aim is to work with those who need and use this evidence (those preparing for and responding to disasters and humanitarian emergencies ‚Äì policy-makers, guideline developers, trainers, as well as aid agencies and independent consultants), as well as working with researchers and publishers to facilitate freely accessible materials to meet the information needs for those facing humanitarian emergencies and disasters.

Evidence Aid collates knowledge from systematic reviews to provide a portal of resources for decision-makers. The systematic reviews seek to highlight which interventions work, which do not work, which need more research, and which, no matter how well meaning, might be harmful. Those in need have the right to receive humanitarian aid that has been proven to be effective and not harmful. With an increasing demand for \\"value for money\\", proof of impact and effectiveness in the provision of humanitarian aid it is essential to ensure that decisions and activities are evidence-based. They keep this information up to date where it can serve as a provision to other agencies, planning groups and first responders in, disasters, humanitarian crises or major healthcare emergencies. The objectives of Evidence Aid are to: * Establish and increase an evidence-based approach towards humanitarian action * Uphold and promote the value of evidence in health outcomes across sectors * Identify the gaps in evidence for humanitarian aid and build the resources and network to address them * Raise the capacity and commitment of those who guide the humanitarian sector to implement an evidence-based approach Evidence Aid also provides collections of evidence which are topic specific, such as collections for Ebola, the Health of Refugees and Asylum Seekers in Europe, Windstorms and Earthquakes. These collections contain evidence-based guidelines, randomised controlled trials, and other useful information. == Resources ==  Team  Evidence Aid‚Äôs office is based with the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (Oxford, UK) and it also has a desk in Cochrane (London, UK). The core team of four are based in two different locations. Mike Clarke, who founded the initiative and is now the Chair of the Board of Trustees and Research Director, is a Professor at Queen‚Äôs University and also has a position at the Centre for Global Health, Trinity College Dublin. Jeroen Jansen, Evidence Aid‚Äôs first Director, is based in London and Oxford overseeing the day-to-day management and activities of Evidence Aid, and Claire Allen, Operations Manager, who works from home in Weymouth, UK, channels the integration with the world in need and brings the project and research together to facilitate evidence-based aid when nations are at their most vulnerable. They are supported by Jane Higgins, part-time Office Administrator, based in Oxford, UK. The impact of Evidence Aid is currently undergoing impact evaluation by Dominic Mellon, a Public Health Specialty Registrar based in Bristol, UK, as part of a PhD research project supervised by Mike Clarke at Queen‚Äôs. In addition to the core team, Evidence Aid is supported by volunteers who work in various aspects of public health, humanitarian relief, and systematic reviews, where they collaborate from multiple locations around the world. Evidence Aid welcomes volunteers who are self-motivated and who can be flexible about the tasks assigned to them. Evidence Aid, as a Charity, registered with the Charity Commission in the UK also has a Board of Trustees which comprises Professor Mike Clarke (Chair), Dr Phil Davies, Lady Deborah Dixon (Treasurer), Mr Michael Stone, and Mrs Sue Wolstenholme.  Special Resources  Evidence Aid seeks to bring together systematic reviews of relevance to disasters, humanitarian crises, and major healthcare emergencies, in a single online resource where they can be accessed free of charge and are available to anyone. Though information on best practice and low-cost interventions may be known in the medical, scientific or academic communities, this same information may not be available or easily found by communities or countries in crisis. Evidence Aid and its volunteers search the literature identifying relevant systematic reviews and works with others to produce short evidence summaries so that the information can be easily understood and applied by end users, in this case, those who have suffered as a result of disasters or those facing or who are experiencing humanitarian crises. The organization then uploads them to the searchable resource page where they are offered for the use of all. Additional resources are added as the needs are identified. For example, \\"Landslides: A draft chapter from the upcoming book Koenig and Schultz‚Äôs Disaster Medicine: Comprehensive Principles and Practice, 2nd Edition\\" was made available as free access for Evidence Aid. Separately, Evidence Aid has partnered with Cochrane to co-ordinate and administer four special collections covering: flooding and poor water sanitation; earthquakes; burns; and posttraumatic stress disorder. The Cochrane Collaboration participated in the production of these collections and they are housed on The Cochrane Library.  Urgent response  Evidence Aid is able to provide a response to disasters and humanitarian emergencies, examples as follows: * Through its resources, it provides an urgent response to the evidence needs that arise pre, during and post event. Prior to the disaster, during and in the short-term after the event, Evidence Aid can bundle together very brief summaries of the findings of systematic reviews of relevance to, for example, the impact of windstorms depending on the nature of the event being responded to. * Evidence Aid works with partners to provide a context-specific resource for the evidence needs that arise during the subsequent weeks and months. This is critical because no disaster will be identical and the needs of the people and nations can change over time and context. It is possible to continue to learn from each disaster in order to adapt useful and relevant problem-solving strategies to meet the current needs. As information about what works best is shared the resources should also be useful as part of the planning for disaster risk reduction and alleviating the impact of a disaster. For an example, see the response to Ebola and the European migrant crisis. * Gathering information about the need for evidence and to seek to ensure that this need is met through up-to-date systematic reviews of the relevant research. Systematic Reviews are identified and included in the Evidence Aid resources. Evidence Aid works with volunteers and authors of systematic reviews to produce short summaries of each systematic review to help decision-makers to decide whether reading the full review is useful for their area of focus in the disaster.  Financial support  In addition to core staff and volunteer support, Evidence Aid has traditionally been financed by philanthropic organisations including, but not restricted to the McCall MacBain Foundation, the C&A; FoundatioN, Wiley, and the Unorthodox Prize. Evidence Aid works to provide optimal evidence that is location specific. == Policy setting == Evidence Aid has developed recommendations on evidence in humanitarian assistance which identify critical research needs and prioritizes them. Evidence Aid was awarded funds by the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) for a scoping study, \\"What evidence is available and what is required, in humanitarian assistance?\\" in 2014. This report was published to coincide with the anniversary of the 2004 tsunami. The aim of the study was to provide an independent analysis of the evidence base of evaluations in humanitarian assistance. It identifies areas where there are key gaps and where there is a need to prioritize rigorous evidence on issues that are most important and valuable. Evidence Aid worked with 3ie, the Karolinska Institutet, and Monash University to develop a working paper. The first scoping paper is \\"What evidence is available and what is required in humanitarian assistance?\\" The scope of this research goes beyond the question of impact evaluation, key recommendations were made to move the provision of evidence forward in the sector, including: * The case for evidence: agreement from policy makers on the need for an evidence base; * Priorities for evidence: a suggested framework; * Improved accessibility to evidence: through a one‚Äìstop portal and better classification; and * Common guidelines and standards: through templates and standards for data collection. Medical Rehabilitation in Natural Disasters: A Systematic Review looks at how rehabilitation can be managed in the course of a natural disaster where functional resources, skilled health care personnel and equipment may be limited Evidence Aid works with partners, contributors, and volunteers from multiple nations to achieve its aim of providing people and organizations with the knowledge tools they need to make well-informed decisions and choices in their efforts to improve health, increase the quality of life and reduce human errors in disaster management following disasters, humanitarian crises, and major healthcare emergencies.  Setting priorities  Evidence Aid helped set priorities for the Humanitarian Evidence Programme by the identification and prioritization of themes to meet the top 30 research needs for the sector for health outcomes in humanitarian response, this strategy is one way they can work with communities to ascertain what evidence is needed. This exercise is being co-ordinated by the Feinstein International Centre at Tufts University and Oxfam. == International aid contributions == In supporting this mission, Evidence Aid has undertaken the following activities: * One of Evidence Aid‚Äôs first projects was to inform psychiatrists and psychotherapists responding to the Indian Ocean tsunami that counsellors should not use ‚Äòbrief debriefing‚Äô (a single-session counselling service designed to prevent psychological trauma) as a means of preventing PTSD, given Cochrane Review evidence that this intervention is not effective, and, if anything, might be harmful. This decision not only led to better health for the affected population but also saved resources that were used in the deployment of more effective interventions. * Within 24 hours of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Evidence Aid provided the World Health Organization (WHO) with a comprehensive list of effective and efficient interventions for wound management, mental health, and infectious diseases. Evidence Aid worked with the WHO again in late 2010 to identify reviews that could assist with the widespread floods in Pakistan. * On the day of the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, Evidence Aid provided access to its online resources via The Cochrane Library, which were subsequently translated into Japanese. Evidence Aid was approached by the WHO to assist with the drafting of new public health guidelines for large-scale radiation emergencies. * Following Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, Evidence Aid packaged together a new set of relevant resources within 48 hours, providing responders in the Philippines with information on the health problems they might encounter. The link to the resources was promoted actively to those responding to the typhoon, both on the ground and at policy level, including those coordinating the United Nations and WHO responses. Evidence Aid compiled resources to supply guidance for ways that those on the ground could increase ways to provide effective care in the aftermath of the tragedy. * Evidence Aid worked with various individuals to create a resource for those responding to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in the latter half of 2014. It pulled together a multitude of freely accessible resource sites into a single resource, and identified both ongoing and published systematic reviews relevant to Ebola. * Wiley-Blackwell along with Cochrane and working with Evidence Aid, released resources and a call for disaster relief collaboration on the Nepal Earthquake Evidence Aid page. The National Library of Medicine has partnered with publishers to deliver temporary free access to major biomedical publications for healthcare professionals responding to the earthquake in Nepal. Access is available at http://eai.nlm.nih.gov/ * In 2016, Evidence Aid partnered with Cochrane and MSF to respond to the European migrant crisis by collating information for a collection titled the Health of Refugees and Asylum Seekers in Europe. Cochrane also collated their own reviews which resides alongside the Collection. * A delicate concern for consideration and balance in Humanitarian aid settings is how to make aid flexible enough to meet individual needs and yet structured enough to reduce fraudulent use of limited disaster relief funds. Three recent studies explore the effects unconditional cash transfers for assistance in humanitarian disasters have on the use of health services and health outcomes for individuals in low- and middle-income countries. The studies found that although early in the disaster benefits are present, additional high-quality evidence is needed to inform best practice and policy for unconditional cash transfers in terms of timing and distribution. * Malaria in endemic countries is a threat in disasters as stagnant water and people crowded in temporary housing can increase malaria risk. Evidence Aid has provided a free collection of references and evidence-based guidance on how to treat malaria and control malaria across geographical areas, diverse populations and in different conditions == Raising awareness == Evidence Aid has raised the profile of evidence-based actions in the humanitarian sector through international conferences in Oxford in 2011 with the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, Brussels in 2012 with the Belgian Red Cross‚ÄìFlanders, at which Herman van Rompuy, the President of the European Council in 2012 said \\"Evidence Aid has provided governments, agencies, NGOs, and individuals with the most reliable information in order to take the right choices in difficult circumstances‚Ä¶ the work you are doing is important for mankind\\", and a priority setting meeting in London in 2013. In addition, and in partnership with the South Asian Cochrane Centre, Evidence Aid offered its third conference in 2014 in Hyderabad, India ‚Äì fitting since responding to the Indian Ocean tsunami was the inspiration for the founding of Evidence Aid. Evidence Aid works with a number of organizations in different capacities. Caroline Fiennes, a blogger at Third Sector, wrote about using evidence in dealing with humanitarian crises in a post, \\"In the decade since the Asian tsunami, we're marshalling the evidence with far better effect.\\" == World hunger == In low and middle- income countries, research has found that providing additional food to children aged three months to five years may result in modest gains in weight and height, and haemoglobin. Food supplementation resulted in positive impacts on psycho-motor development. However evidence on mental development was mixed. Disasters, war and famine increase risk for food shortages and decreased family incomes both during the disaster and in the aftermath therefore getting food to children and vulnerable populations in safe, effective and efficient ways is an important priority in crisis relief. Malnutrition contributed to the deaths of more than three million children in 2011. Malnutrition leads to higher infection risks, plus it impairs physical and mental development making the undernourished child more susceptible to chronic disease in adulthood. A Cochrane systematic review pointed out that evidence about the effectiveness of nutrition interventions for young children, is fundamentally important. The Evidence Aid summary points to troubling news about the treatment of children in the home when food is scarce. The review found food was commonly redistributed within the family; when feeding was home-delivered, children benefited from only 36% of the energy given in the supplement. However, when the supplementary food was given in day care centers or feeding compounds, leakage was reduced; children took in 85% of the energy provided in the supplement. Supplementary food was more effective for younger children (under two years old) and for those who were poorer or less well-nourished. Quality supervision within feeding programs was found to result in a greater proportion of required daily food for energy. These discrepancies were less common in high-income countries, where two studies found no benefits for growth. == Refugee resettlement == The arrival in a host country is not always the refuge of safety the displaced person hopes for. During the passage they face the challenges of substandard shelter and sanitation, and dangerously long waits for food and water through treacherous weather and with disease ridden companions. Many including the children will witness the death, abuse and torture of fellow travelers and family members. This leaves the refugees vulnerable to mental health disorders including PTSD and depression, vaccine- preventable disease, skin disease such as Impetigo, Scabies and Cellulitis, Tuberculosis, snake and insect bite, malaria and they may also be exposed to violence and sexual abuse. This presents numerous challenges for the host countries as the conditions may not be common to their population, the refugees are unable to communicate in the host country language and their customs and culture may be at odds with the values commonly understood and practiced. Many displaced persons fear forced repatriation or detention and they are unable to navigate the bureaucracy around the local or national health care culture. This presents a public health issue as chronic health issues or respiratory infections including TB are untreated. The pregnant women may have had no prenatal care and the conflict and persecution they flee from may take its toll on their mental health. Evidence Aid has made evidence available to assist regulators, clinicians, and organizations to increase the ability of host nations to assist refugees settled or in flight. This initiative is a collaboration between Cochrane, Wiley, Kevin Pottie, Leo Ho and Evidence Aid and incorporates the contributions of many volunteers and experts in health.

It was one of 250 international submissions. Billions of dollars are spent annually on international humanitarian responses, yet aid budgets are not keeping pace with the increasing frequency and severity of disasters. There is also a movement to professionalize the field. Evidence Aid plays a role in this by: conducting systematic evidence reviews to identify optimal interventions and; providing this information in an easily accessible format to decision-makers and front-line relief workers. Evidence Aid bases their resources on epidemiological and evidence-based information (via systematic reviews) to meet the needs of the populations addressed. == References  Further reading == * Second Evidence Aid Conference: Prioritizing Evidence in Disaster Aid * Optimal Evidence in Difficult Settings: Improving Health Interventions and Decision Making in Disasters == External links == * * at Tufts University * at Oxford University Category:Development charities based in the United Kingdom Category:Disaster management Category:International responses to natural disasters Category:2004 establishments in England Category:International medical and health organizations Category:Health campaigns Category:Health research Category:Organizations established in 2004 ","title":"Evidence Aid"},{"id":"46335837","text":"Mitchel v. Reynolds1 PWms 181, 24 ER 347, 45 Digest (Repl) 395, [1558-1774] All ER Rep 26 is a landmark decision in the history of the law of restraint of trade, handed down in 1711. It is generally cited for establishing the principle that reasonable restraints of trade, unlike unreasonable restraints of trade, are permissible and therefore enforceable and not a basis for civil or criminal liability. It is largely the basis in US antitrust law for the \\"rule of reason.\\"See National Soc'y of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 689 (1978) (the rule of reason is the \\"standard for testing the enforceability of covenants in restraint of trade which are ancillary to a legitimate transaction\\"). William Howard Taft, then Chief Judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, later US President and then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, quoted Mitchel extensively when he first developed the antitrust rule-of-reason doctrine in United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co.,85 F. 271 (6th Cir. 1898) which was affirmed in 1899 by the Supreme Court.Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States. See Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 737-39 (1988) (dissenting opinion of Justice Stevens: \\"Although Judge Taft was writing as a Circuit Judge, his opinion is universally accepted as authoritative.\\"). The doctrine also played a major role in the 1911 Supreme Court case Standard Oil Company of New Jersey v. United States 221 U.S. 1 (1911).Mitchel is also referred to in Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 729 n.3 (1988), in which the Supreme Court declared certain types of price fixing to be potentially reasonable. Mitchel is also cited for the proposition that usually harmful practices may be rebuttably presumed unlawful, so that the burden of showing legitimacy is placed on the proponent of the practice.See concurring opinion of Justice White in United States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U.S. 174 (1963), where he argued that defrauding the patent office should be at least rebuttably presumed illegal under the antitrust laws, citing Mitchel. == Factual setting == A bake shop Reynolds was a baker at St Andrew Holborn, which included both Lincoln's Inn and Gray's Inn, and therefore a considerable number of lawyers. In this litigation-prone environment, Reynolds chose to rent his bakeshop business to Mitchel for five years and gave Mitchel a bond for ¬£50 with the condition that the bond would be void if Reynolds acted as a baker in the parish within the next five years. Reynolds resumed his trade as a baker at another location in the parish within the five years, and Mitchel sued on the bond. == The lawsuit == Reynolds defended by demurrer, contending that the bond was void because it was on a restraint of trade. His position was that any such restraint of trade was illegal per se, since it prevented him from exercising his trade as a baker. Although general restraints of trade are unlawful, the Court of the Queen's Bench, per Chief Justice Parker (Lord Macclesfield), held this restraint of trade reasonable and therefore lawful.Mitchel v. Reynolds, 1 P. Wms. 181, 24 E.R. 347 (Q.B. 1711). It was ancillary to a legitimate transaction (the rental or sale of the bakeshop business) and it was reasonably necessary to effectuate the main purpose. Its extent was limited to what was necessary to accomplish the main purpose of the transaction. If Reynolds reopened his bakery business, he would attract his old customers and deprive Mitchel of the benefit of his bargain with Reynolds, which included the goodwill of the business (i.e., the habit of the customers to continue to buy baked goods at the same location). Although a restraint of trade without a good reason to support it is presumed unlawful,Such a restraint is not \\"necessary\\" in the sense of being needed to accomplish the lawful main purpose of another undertaking. the court ruled, the presumption can be rebutted and overcome by facts such as those present here: the restraint of trade was necessary and ancillary to a lawful transaction.Judge Bork explained the doctrine in Rothery Storage & Van Co. v. Atlas Van Lines, Inc., 792 F.2d 210, 224 (D.C. Cir. 1986), in these terms: > To be ancillary, and hence exempt from the per se rule, an agreement > eliminating competition must be subordinate and collateral to a separate, > legitimate transaction. The ancillary restraint is subordinate and > collateral in the sense that it serves to make the main transaction more > effective in accomplishing its purpose. See also Schering-Plough Corp.v. FTC, 402 F.3d 1056,1073 (11th Cir.2005) (\\"In order for a condition to be ancillary, an agreement limiting competition must be secondary and collateral to an independent and legitimate transaction.\\"). == Recent interpretations of the Mitchel doctrine == Even if a restraint is necessary and ancillary, within the meaning of the Mitchel and Addyston Pipe cases, it may still be an unreasonable restraint of trade if its anticompetive effects, and consequent harm to the public interest, outweigh its benefits. As Judge Ginsburg opined in the Polygram case: > If the only way a new product can be profitably introduced is to restrain > the legitimate competition of older products, then one must seriously wonder > whether consumers are genuinely benefited by the new product.PolyGram > Holding, Inc. v. FTC, 416 F.3d 29, 38 (D.C. Cir. 2005). In the same vein, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission stated a similar approach in the 1995 Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property: > If the Agencies conclude that the restraint has, or is likely to have, an > anticompetitive effect, they will consider whether it is reasonably > necessary to achieve procompetitive efficiencies. If the restraint is > reasonably necessary, the Agencies will balance the procompetitive > efficiencies and the anticompetitive effects to determine the probable net > effect on competition in each relevant market.Antitrust Guidelines, ¬ß 4.2. > See also Rothery, supra note _. Questions have been raised as to how necessary a restraint must be to the accomplishment of the main purpose to which it is claimed to be ancillary. For example, must it be indispensable? Is it sufficient if it is of some aid? The FTC-DOJ 2000 Guidelines for Collaborations among Competitors say that, in determining whether a restraint is \\"reasonably necessary,\\" the issue is \\"whether practical, significantly less restrictive means were reasonably available when the agreement was entered into.\\"Id. ¬ß 3.2. A related issue is \\"necessary to what?\\" In one recent case, a court rejected a credit card issuer's attempted justification of a restriction against competitive dealings said to be reasonably necessary to promote \\"loyalty\\" and \\"cohesion.\\"United States v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 163 F. Supp. 2d 322 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), aff'd, 344 F.3d 229 (2d Cir. 2003). How necessary and necessary to what thus remain controverted issues under the doctrine of Mitchel v. Reynolds. == References == Category:Anti-competitive practices Category:Contract law ","title":"Mitchel v Reynolds"},{"id":"46335840","text":"The discourse of power is used when it comes to differentiating the levels of power due to cultural and social characteristics that come about through societal upbringing. The ways we think and talk about a subject influence and reflect the ways we act in relation to that subject. The idea of the discourse of power within media has a domino effect and it can play a huge role in determining the patterns of access to the mass media: who has preferential access to journalists, who will be interviewed, who will be quoted and described in news reports, and whose opinions will influence the public? Through access to the mass media, dominant groups also may have access to and partial control over the public at large. == The role of mass media and power in the United States == Those with power and influence know that media control or influence is crucial. A free press is crucial for a functioning democracy, but if not truly free, paves the way for manipulation and concentration of views, thus undermining democracy itself. The First Amendment to the U.S Constitution, which provides that \\"Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press,\\" has given the media an exceptionally strong basis for resisting government controls in the United States. A limited number of controls, such as regulatory laws, court decisions, and informational social pressures guard against excess by the media. In the United States courts have been loath to impose restraints prior to publication, such as granting injunctions that would stop publication of information on the grounds that it would cause irreparable harm. Major mass media conglomerates in the United States *Walt Disney Company *News Corporation *Time Warner *CBS Corporation *Viacom *General Electric These media conglomerates control 90% of the traditional media that is present in our daily lives, media has never been more consolidated. ==Power of media versus reality== The shaping of ones reality or perception is based on three elements including experienced reality, symbolic reality, and socially constructed reality. Much of the symbolic reality is based on media practices that we are exposed to daily. Individuals make assumptions on the world based on what their media tells them. The media is a hegemonic form of power that maintains their position, not through force, but through elaboration of a particular world view, an ideology, or a particular notion of common sense, which is widely infused into everyday cultural practices. This results in people consenting to power even when it may not be in their best interest. The assumption of media hegemony is that the ideas of the ruling class become ruling ideas in society, because of this the mass media are controlled by the dominant class in society which uses it as a vehicle for exerting control over the rest of society.  Socially constructed reality  Social construct examines the development of jointly constructed understandings of the world. It assumes that understanding, significance, and meaning are developed not separately within the individual, but in coordination among other human beings. To say something that it is socially constructed is to emphasize its dependence on contingent aspects of an individuals social selves. It can say this thing could not have existed had we not built it. Had someone been brought up in a different kind of society, had different needs, values, or interests, an individual might have built a different kind of thing, or built this social construct differently. It is important to be aware that the values we hold, the beliefs we harbor and the decisions we make are based on our assumptions, our experiences, our education and what we know for a fact. Social construct allows us rely on mass media for the current news and facts about what is important and what we should be aware of. We trust the media as an authority for news, information, education and entertainment. Considering that powerful influence, then, we should know how it really works. The degree of influence depends on the availability and pervasiveness of media. Traditional mass media still has a great influence within society today. Books once were supremely influential because they came first before newspapers, magazines, radio or television. Newspapers and magazines became large influencers after they were developed. Sound recordings and film were and still are influential. Radio and then television were very influential. As the 20th century closed, TV exposed us to a number of new examples advertising and marketing, suffering and relief, sexuality and violence, celebrity entertainment, and much more. New and influential media-distribution channels have appeared in the 21st century. We are currently being influenced through the internet by daily by blogs, popular culture websites and various social media outlets. Experienced reality Experienced reality is that reality that comes to us via the senses and also via insight or intuition. It underlies all of our cognitive efforts. Because direct experience is largely sensory, automatic and constant, we pay less attention to it than the reality we have to work at to construct. It is somewhat of an illusion that effort equates to importance in our culture. Events or experiences spark change in an individual. Through societal influence we are becoming a generation that needs to see to believe, and experienced reality is what initiates this idea. Power through this idea of experienced reality is relayed through the ideologies of the major media conglomerates and the way that they have created such a large cultural bias towards what we have experienced. Symbolic reality Symbols exist everywhere for an individual. Symbols are the intermediary between the world internal and the world external, between inner and external reality of human being as a person. The appeal to symbolic reality allows us to overcome personal boundaries including power struggles. Symbolic reality exists in and through person. Symbols are objects, characters, or other representations of ideas, concepts, or abstractions; they are the universal language in a culture. Symbols have been used for thousands of years, they help individuals communicate and interact with one another. Thus, as a representation, their meaning is neither instinctive nor automatic. The culture‚Äôs members must interpret, and over time reinterpret, Symbols convey meaning and occur in different forms, such as: verbal or nonverbal, written or unwritten, words on the page, drawings, pictures, gesture. They are things which act as triggers to remind people, in the culture, of its rules, beliefs‚Ä¶ Symbols can also be used to indicate status within a culture. Every society has evolved a system of symbols that reflects a specific cultural logic; and every symbolism functions to communicate information between members in much the same way as, but more subtly than, conventional language. Due to the level of power, media conglomerates have been using symbolic reality to relay their messages for years. ==References== Category:Mass media theories Category:Power (social and political) Category:Social constructionism Category:Social theories ","title":"Discourse of power"},{"id":"46335878","text":"Jo van Ammers-K√ºller (1937) Johanna van Ammers-K√ºller (13 August 1884, Noordeloos ‚Äì 23 January 1966, Bakel) was a Dutch writer.

It is within the Shire of Mornington. ==Geography== Sweers Island is approximately 8 kilometres long. It is located east of Bentinck Island (the largest island in the South Wellesley Islands) and north from Burketown on the Queensland mainland. ==History== Drawing of the Investigator tree on Sweers Island, 1857 Kayardild (also known as Kaiadilt and Gayadilta) is a language of the Gulf of Carpentaria. The Kayardild language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Mornington Shire Council. The island was named by explorer Matthew Flinders on 16 November 1802 after Salomon Sweers, a council member of the East India Company at Batavia who was one of those who instructed Abel Tasman to explore the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1644. Flinders was circumnavigating the Australian continent in the sloop HMS Investigator to map the coastline and establish if Australia was a single island or whether there were two or more islands (the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Great Australian Bight were suspected to be the entrances to straits between the islands). Robert Towns established Burketown in 1865 as a base for his extensive holdings in the Gulf Country. Burketown's development was limited due to the extent of tropical diseases suffered by its inhabitants. When a ship \\"Margaret and Mary\\" arrived in Burketown from Sydney carrying a fever (possibly typhoid), the majority of those on board died at Burketown. In the belief that Burketown was inherently unhealthy, William Landsborough evacuated most of the survivors to Sweers Island for 18 months, with only a further two people dying. Towns and Co then traded wool, tallow, hides and skins between Sweers Island and Batavia in October 1868. The Investigator Tree The Investigator Tree, 1871 Investigator tree at Queensland Museum (formerly at Sweers Island) In 1841, the island was visited by John Lort Stokes, commander of the Beagle on an exploration of northern Australia. Stokes discovered a tree on the western part of the island with the word \\"Investigator\\" carved into it by Flinders on this 1802 visit, giving the tree the name \\"The Investigator Tree\\". Stokes also carved the name \\"Beagle\\" to the tree. Subsequent visitors to the island also carved names including from Augustus Charles Gregory's expedition in 1856 and William Landsborough's search for the Burke and Wills expedition in 1861. A cyclone on 5 March 1887 severely damaged the tree so part of the trunk was removed to the Queensland Museum in 1889. ==Recreation== Recreational activities on Sweers Island include fishing and watching wildlife. Sweetlip is the most common table fish caught off the island, while other fish species include: coral trout, red emperor, golden snapper, nannegai and parrot fish. In winter fish species including spanish mackerel, grey mackerel, giant trevally, giant leatherskin, queenfish, northern blue fin tuna, and cobia can be caught. Accommodation, meals and boats are available at the Sweers Island Resort. ==Transport== The island has a all-weather gravel airstrip. ==See also== *List of islands of Australia ==References * Museum entry for The Investigator Tree with photo Category:Islands of Queensland Category:Shire of Mornington (Queensland) Category:Gulf of Carpentaria ","title":"Sweers Island"},{"id":"46336019","text":"Clarence J.

He was the President of the Marine Biological Association (MBA) from 1939 to 1945. == Life and career == George Parker Bidder was born on 21 May 1863 in London, to barrister George Parker Bidder, Jr. (1836‚Äì1896) and Anna McClean (1839‚Äì1910). His paternal grandfather was George Parker Bidder, an engineer and calculating prodigy, and his maternal grandfather was John Robinson McClean, a civil engineer and member of the Liberal Party. Bidder went to King's Preparatory School in Brighton and Harrow School. He then studied zoology at University College London under Ray Lankester for one year before joining Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took the Natural Sciences Tripos until 1886. In 1887 he began working at the Stazione Zoologica in Naples, Italy. He joined the MBA in 1893, becoming a member of the council (its governing body) in 1899. The same year he married Marion Greenwood and moved to Plymouth, where they stayed until 1902, when they moved to Cambridge. They had two daughters; one, Anna McClean Bidder (1903‚Äì2001), was a zoologist and academic. During the 1910s, Bidder suffered tuberculosis, which made him unable to work at the laboratory or take part in the First World War. In 1925, Bidder founded The Company of Biologists to save The British Journal of Experimental Biology from bankruptcy. Bidder died on 31 December 1954 in Cambridge. == Research == Bidder's research focused on sponges, especially their hydraulics. He also studied the movements bottom feeders, as well as marine geology, in particular coastal erosion. In 1932, Bidder made a major contribution to the field of biogerontology by proposing that senescence was the effect of a \\"regulator\\" responsible for ending growth. This theory, known as \\"Bidder's hypothesis\\" has been refuted in numerous experiments, starting with Alex Comfort's 1963 study on guppy, a species that ages while growing. Nonetheless, Bidder's hypothesis might be true for some species as a \\"private\\" mechanism of ageing. Between 1904 and 1906 Bidder conducted research that proved the East-to-West flow of North Sea currents, by releasing some 1,000 messages in bottles, designed to float a short distance above the sea bed. Finders were requested, in English, Dutch and German, to send a postcard enclosed in the bottle to the United Kingdom's Marine Biological Association in Plymouth, for a shilling reward. The majority were recovered just a few months later, but one was found on the German island of Amrum, as late as April 2015, and its postcard was duly returned to the MBA. In March 2016, Guinness World Records confirmed it to be the oldest message in a bottle. == Poetry == Since his youth, Bidder dedicated much of his free time to writing poems, the most famous of which is \\"Merlin's Youth\\" (1899). == References == Category:British marine biologists Category:1863 births Category:1954 deaths Category:English male poets Category:Scientists from London Category:People educated at Harrow School Category:Alumni of University College London Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:Writers from London Category:19th-century English poets Category:20th-century English poets Category:19th-century British male writers Category:20th-century British male writers Category:19th-century British zoologists Category:20th-century British zoologists ","title":"George Parker Bidder (marine biologist)"},{"id":"46336144","text":"FabricLive.74 is a DJ mix album by English electronic music duo Jack Beats.

In the case of government procurement, goods and services are bought using a reverse auction. == Types of auctions == When the term \\"government auction\\" is used it often means that a general auctioneer has been contracted to deal with stock that needs to be liquidated by various government bodies: * Customs: seized smuggled items * Defense: military surplus * Police auction: proceeds of crime * Post office, transport: lost property * Warrant sale: assets of debtors * Tax sale: seized assets * Court auction: items sold to satisfy a court judgment * Insolvent companies where the government is the liquidator (e.g. official receiver) * Unowned property Often goods sold at government auctions will be unreserved, meaning that they will be sold to the highest bidder at the auction. Auctioneers are normally contracted by the different government organisations within their local area. Sale of property owned by the government Government property sold at public auction may include surplus government equipment, abandoned property over which the government has asserted ownership, property which has passed to the government by escheat, government land, and intangible assets over which the government asserts authority, such as broadcast frequencies sold through a spectrum auction. Public auctions of government property may be conducted by whichever agency is auctioning the property. Some substantial items have been sold at public auction. For example, the United States Navy cruiser Philadelphia was sold at such an auction at the Puget Sound Navy Yard in 1927. Sale of private property in a public auction Private property may be sold in a public auction for a number of reasons. It may be seized through a governmental process to satisfy a judgment rendered by a court or agency, or to liquidate a mortgage foreclosure, tax lien, or tax sale. Usually, prices obtained at a public auction to satisfy a judgment are distressed ‚Äì that is, they are much lower than the price which would be obtained for that property if the seller were free to hold out for an optimal time to sell. In the United States, public auctions to satisfy judgments are usually conducted under the authority of the sheriff of the county or city in which the property to be auctioned was seized pursuant to the judgment, and an auction held for such a purpose is also called a sheriff's sale or sheriff sale. Real property may be subject to a public auction in order to partition the property between joint tenants who can not agree as to how the property should be divided. An estate sale conducted at the direction of a probate court may also be conducted as a public auction. == Countries ==  Ancient Roman Empire  In ancient Roman Empire, the maintenance of the public works such as aqueducts, roads, drains, etc. were let out by the censors by public auction to the lowest bidder, just as the vectigalia were let out to the highest bidder. These expenses were called ultrotributa, and hence we frequently find vectigalia and ultrotributa contrasted with one another.Livy xxxix.44, xliii.16.  United Kingdom  The Proceeds of Crime Act allows for a court to confiscate items that a criminal can't legally account for. Government auctions are usually held by nominated auction houses all around the UK. They will instruct an auction house which will sell the items on their behalf. There are many thousands of such court orders issued each year, and items that can't be returned to their legal owner are auctioned off at local auction houses all over the UK. Police auctions are an established route used by regional police forces across the country to dispose of proceeds of crime, lost and found, seized, and unclaimed stolen and confiscated property.  USA  Government auctions are often held onsite in the US, generally hosted by a professional auctioneer. A wide variety of merchandise is available from a number of websites both official and unofficial. The Internet provides services to various government agencies that allow them to sell surplus and confiscated items.  New Zealand  Government agencies sell goods via various contracted auctioneers and online on websites such as Trade Me.  Brazil  Brazil runs auctions auctions to sell surplus electrical energy. Brazilian state also holds auction for contracts for solar and wind power.  Germany  Germany established the website zvg-portal.de to announce court auctions of real estate. There are over 120 real estates every day auctioned on court auctions by German authorities.

Poplar was a poor borough, with a high level of poverty and \\"outdoor relief\\" which the council was required to fund for itself under the poor laws. The mural records that 30 councillors were imprisoned for contempt of court for refusing a comply with a court order requiring the precepts to be paid. The council continued to hold meetings while the councillors were in prison, with women councillors in Holloway Prison taken by taxi to meet with the men in Brixton Prison. The campaign was widely supported by the general public and trades unions, and in due course the councillors were released from prison. Parliament quickly passed the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act 1921 to try to equalise tax burdens between rich and poor boroughs. The mural was painted by Mark Francis in 1990. It has four panels, including an image of George Lansbury wearing his mayoral chain of office; placards reading \\"Can't Pay Won't Pay\\"', references reference to the campaign to abolish the 1990s era poll tax, and a list of the names of the imprisoned councillors.

Rokab expanded this concept by creating Love Thy Nature Journeys with expeditions and workshops which start with the screening of the film and then transitions into activities guiding attendees in the wilderness for nature communion and forest therapy. ==Synopsis== An award-winning film narrated by Liam Neeson, Love Thy Nature points to how deeply we‚Äôve lost touch with nature and takes viewers on a cinematic journey through the beauty and intimacy of our relationship with the natural world.

Yet, ‚ÄúBiomimicry‚Äù scientists look to the natural world for the most brilliant cutting-edge inventions, social ecologists unveil how nature restores communities, and doctors are finding new ways in which nature heals the body, mind, and brain. The film's mission is to show how a renewed connection with nature is critical to one's personal health and the health of our planet. Sapiens‚Äô journey reveals how a relationship with nature ignites a sense of meaning and wonder so profound that it touches the very core of what it means to be human. ==Cast and crew== Cast * Liam Neeson as Sapiens (voice), the narrative character of the film. ;Interviewees * Dayna Baumeister is a researcher, design consultant, author, public speaker and co- founder of Biomimicry 3.8 and the Biomimicry Guild.http://www.sustainabilityleadersnetwork.org/fellows/dayna-baumeister/ Her extensive Biomimicry research work resulted in establishing the first Biomimicry Professional Certification Program.https://biomimicry.net/bios/dr- dayna-baumeister/ * Brian Swimme is a cosmologist, CIIS professor, and Director of the Center for the Story of the Universe.

Eriberto Almeida Jr. and Rohan Chitrakar worked alongside Rokab as cinematographers while Fernanda Rossi and Elaine Souda worked on story development and script editing, respectively. Darius Fisher supervised digital and visual effects. Fisher, Sheila Laffey, Patrick Rokab, Andreas Gilb, Suzanne Gazda, and Jennifer Ingle served as associate producers. Mauro Contaldi and Keith English created the animation for the film. Fran√ßois Paul- A√Øche is the composer for the entire original soundtrack for Love Thy Nature. Lisbeth Scott is the composer for the film's trailer. In the credits, the song \\"Voices From The Past (Club Mix)\\" as performed by Ginkgo Garden and composed by Eddy F. Mueller was used as a courtesy of Sequoia Records and Earth Vision Music. ==Production== Background and development Director Sylvie Rokab was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to French and Italian parents, both originally from Egypt. Since a young age, Rokab's interest in the natural world was encouraged by her parents. Following her devastation at seeing the world's rapid destruction, Rokab relocated to the United States and became a wildlife cinematographer and filmmaker. After turning down an offer to direct a televised docu-series due to their negative portrayal of nature, Rokab wanted to make a film that would instead cause \\"[viewers to] feel compelled to explore and commune with nature\\". Rokab then worked on developing the story for Love Thy Nature, in hopes to make a project that would connect people to nature and promote personal and social transformation. Filming Filming began in October 2007, with Rokab directing interviews with experts at the Bioneers conference in San Rafael, California. Film locations The film was shot at a variety of locations internationally, with primary production being mainly located in Los Angeles County, California.http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/music/fliff-sylvie-rokab-talks- love-thy-nature-6405791 ==Promotion and release== Corinne Bourdeau, of 360 communications, was a leading proponent in organizing the film's outreach promotion.https://360degreecommunications.com/corinne-bourdeau/ Screenings Love Thy Nature had its world premiere at the Hollywood Film Festival in October 2014, screened at a series of film festivals as well as community screenings and was entered into award competitions. The film saw a limited theatrical release in 2016, primarily in North American movie theatres, as organized by Theatrical Bookings Manager Amy Segal https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-segal-19939110/ The film was the recipient of the Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation's \\"On-Screen-In-Person\\" grant, which resulted in the film being shown in 10 Mid-Atlantic cities.http://www.midatlanticarts.org/?s=love+thy+nature Millersville University embraced Love Thy Nature's \\"view and do\\" model and organized a series of nine events following and preceding the film screening stimulating students' likening of the nature-connection movement. These events included bird watching, nature journaling, sustainability lectures, a panel discussion, in addition to the film screening followed by a Q&A; with Rokab, attended by 330 audience members. During screening events, a slew of speakers made guest appearances, among them Natural Resources Defense Council's Joel Reynolds, Amazon Watch founder Atossa Soltani, actress Alexandra Paul, author Wallace J. Nichols, PhD, and Mom's Clean Airforce strategist Trisha Sheehan, as well as interviewees from the film. Partnerships From the onset of the distribution effort, Love Thy Nature formed partnerships with NGOs, public institutions, schools and universities, land trusts, spiritual groups, and activists. The film screenings became opportunities for these organizations to present their programs, acquire volunteers, expand their membership, and even fundraise with audience members ‚Äì strengthening their mission and impact. Screenings went beyond only watching a movie, they became an opportunity to engage with like-minded people, discover local environmental groups and join nature-connecting programs for adults and children. For viewers who joined our ‚Äúview and do‚Äù events, the screenings were followed by nature activities that ranged from visiting an organic garden in Santa Monica, California, to planting trees on a river bank in Millersville, Pennsylvania, to joining a shaman on a hike in Sedona, Arizona. The film's grass roots efforts include partnerships with organizations such as the Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society, National Park Service, TreePeople, Biomimicry Institute, NRDC, Wild Conservation Film Festival, Green City Challenge, Earth Day Initiative, Bioneers, Centers for Spiritual Living, Land Trust Alliance, Moms Clean Air Force, HAT, AORE, Animals Valley, Association of Nature and Forest Therapy, and Wild Life Center. Distribution and outreach Following the completion of filming Love Thy Nature, Rokab sought the help of Hybrid Distribution Consultant Peter Broderick who helped her develop a \\"5-year plan\\" to use her film to contribute to the Nature Connecting movement. After initial festival screenings, the film had a theatrical run. The film team expanded to include outreach efforts - currently spearheaded by Emma Piper-Burket - and Love Thy Nature became available on the DIY platform Tugg Inc., which enables individuals to host film screenings at their local cinemas or community venues of their choice.https://www.tugg.com/titles/love-thy-nature The Video Project is the educational distributor of the film for libraries and schools https://www.videoproject.com/Love-Thy-Nature.html and Kanopy handles digital educational distribution worldwide.https://www.kanopy.com/product/love-thy- nature Passion River distributes the film to digital platforms Amazon,https://www.amazon.com/Love-Thy-Nature-Liam-Neeson/dp/B06WLJK9HG iTunes,https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/love-thy-nature/id1221358981 Google Play,https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Love_Thy_Nature?id=DnQB6siAVVU&hl=en_US Vimeo, and Vudu.https://support.vudu.com/content/movies/details/Love-Thy- Nature/858670 Skeye TV In-flight entertainment distributes the film on commercial airlines including American Airlines, Lufthansa, Swiss Air, Air Canada, Turkish Airlines, Latam, Arab Emirates Airlines, Bangkok Airways, Egypt Air, Cathay Pacific, Qatar Airways, and Iberia Airlines. ==Reception== Critical response In The New York Times, Neil Genzlinger noted that Love Thy Nature advocates redefining the relationship between humans and the natural world.https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/movies/review-in-love-thy- nature-it-takes-a-planet.html Marcia G.

It is danced to two slow reels (), Earl of Erroll and the 23rd Countess of Erroll.United Kingdom Alliance of Professional Teachers of Dancing (2012). The UKA Highland, National and Hebridean Book. Blackpool. p. 15-16. The dance takes its name from James Hay, 15th Earl of Erroll. It has been suggested that it was choreographed by Francis Peacock for the eponymous Earl because the Earl of Erroll was listed as one of the subscribers to Peacock's 1805 book _Sketches Relative to the History and Theory but More Especially to the Practice of Dancing_ ; however, no evidence linking a choreography of this name to Peacock's teaching legacy survives and no Earl of Erroll dance is described within that book. Peacock, also a musician, did dedicate a published collection of tunes, including one with the title The Earl of Erroll, to the Earl of Erroll. The dance was likely originally performed in hard-soled dress shoes. The dance came back to the repertoire of Scottish dancers after it was published in 1953 by Mrs Isobel (Tibbie) Cramb,Cramb, Isobel (1953). Four Step Dances. Edinburgh. with reference to Frederick Hill's Manuscript (1841) and Miss Cruickshank of Aberdeen.

The Earl of Erroll is considered one of the hardest national dances to perform well. A Scottish country dance of a somewhat similar name, Earl of Errol's Reel, is performed in groups of 6 dancers (3-couple sets) as part of Scottish country dancing repertoire.

All the proceeds from the single will be contributed to the ongoing work being done by the Avril Lavigne Foundation.http://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz-tv/music/438059/Avril-Lavigne- new-single-Fly-Special-Olympics ==Background== \\"Fly\\" was written during the sessions for Lavigne's fifth studio album. It was inspired lyrically by the people she had met through her Foundation, which raises funds for young people living with disabilities and serious illnesses. The song was recorded in 2012 with the intention of being on the album, but it didn't make the final cut. Lavigne later mentioned the song in interviews, and her desire to release it in the future. After suggestion from her fanbase, she chose to release the song as a charity single to coincide with the 2015 Special Olympics World Games. Lyrically, the song sings about overcoming any obstacles someone might face. Originally, the song had a more pop production but Lavigne scrapped it for a more stripped-down, vocal-driven version. According to Lavigne, the song is composed of a \\"piano, orchestra and kick drum.\\" In September 2014, Charles Miguel Ignacio as part of the Avril Lavigne Foundation's support for Special Olympics, Lavigne launched a campaign for her 30th birthday, which raised funds to support 30 Special Olympics athletes competing in the 2015 Special Olympics World Games. During her 2014 World Tour, Lavigne visited a local Special Olympics Program in Shanghai to learn more about their work, and met with and invited more than 200 Special Olympics athletes to her shows in 14 countries. \\"Fly\\" was released 100 days before the start of the 2015 Special Olympics World Games, which took place from July 25 till August 2, 2015 in Los Angeles. During a new interview with Good Morning America, Lavigne said that the song has taken on another meaning now following her Lyme disease diagnosis, \\"[The song is] about inner strength and courage... The message of the song is to show the world that they can overcome the challenges and that everyone is meant to shine and this song took on a whole new meaning for me during the time that I've been sick, which was pretty magical.\\" She said that Lyme disease had left her bedridden for months; \\"I could barely eat, and when we went to the pool, I had to leave and go lie in bed. My friends asked, 'What's wrong?' I didn't know. I had no idea a bug bite could do this. I was bedridden for five months. I felt like I couldn't breathe, I couldn't talk and I couldn't move. I thought I was dying.\\"http://www.pressparty.com/pg/newsdesk/avrillavigne/view/124828/ ==Composition== Lavigne co-wrote \\"Fly\\" with her estranged husband Chad Kroeger and David Hodges, with production being handled by Lavigne herself and Chris Baseford. It is a power ballad which lasts over three minutes and six seconds. Its instrumentation features an orchestral piano, a string section, an acoustic drum kit and bass. Lyrically, the song talks about the inner strength and courage of someone to face the challenges in life. \\"This song means a lot to me personally,\\" Lavigne said of the track. \\"It is inspired by the many young people I've met throughout my work with my Foundation. They pursue their dreams no matter what obstacles they face... Special Olympics' mission is to unleash the human spirit through the transformative power and joy of sports, so they're a natural fit for this song.\\" she added.http://www.gigwise.com/news/99981/avril-lavigne-releases-single-fly-to- benefit-special-olympics ==Music video== The music video for \\"Fly\\" was directed by Avril Lavigne and Robb Dipple.

The match finished 2‚Äì2, but is best remembered for the sending off of three players and the subsequent Court case that took place as a result. An altercation after 17 minutes between Celtic's Frank McAvennie and Rangers goalkeeper Chris Woods resulted in both being red carded. Rangers defenders Terry Butcher and Graham Roberts were also involved, with Butcher receiving a yellow card for dissent. Roberts took over as Rangers goalkeeper for the rest of the match. On 33 minutes Andy Walker scored to put Celtic ahead, and two minutes later an own goal by Butcher doubled Celtic's lead. Rangers went down to nine men in the second half when Butcher was sent off for a foul on Celtic goalkeeper Allen McKnight. Despite their disadvantage, Rangers rallied and pulled a goal back through Ally McCoist. An unlikely comeback was completed by Rangers when Richard Gough equalised in the final minute. Amidst the celebrating Rangers supporters, Graham Roberts was seen to wave towards the fans, as if he was \\"conducting\\" their singing; songs which included sectarian chants. Three days later, the Procurator Fiscal ordered a Police enquiry into the events of the match. The Rangers trio of Woods, Butcher and Roberts, and Celtic's McAvennie, were later charged with breach of the peace and appeared at Court. After a trial lasting several days, Butcher and Woods were convicted and fined, Roberts was found not proven and McAvennie was found not guilty. ==Details== { width=92% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK 1 Chris Woods  - RB 2  Richard Gough - LB 3  Jimmy Phillips - CB 4 Graham Roberts - MF 5 Derek Ferguson - CB 6 Terry Butcher  - MF 7 Trevor Francis   - CF 8 Mark Falco   - CF 9 Ally McCoist - MF 10 Ian Durrant - MF 11 John McGregor - colspan=4Substitutes: - MF 12  Avi Cohen   - LW 14  Davie Cooper   - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\" Graeme Souness }  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=center colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK 1  Allen McKnight - RB 2  Chris Morris - LB 3  Derek Whyte   - CB 4 Roy Aitken - CB 5  Mick McCarthy - CM 6  Peter Grant - RM 7 Billy Stark - CM 8 Paul McStay - CF 9 Frank McAvennie  - CF 10  Andy Walker - LM 11  Tommy Burns   - colspan=4Substitutes: - LB 12 Anton Rogan   - LW 13 Owen Archdeacon   - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\" Billy McNeill } } ==See also== * Old Firm ==References== Category:1987‚Äì88 in Scottish football Category:Sports scandals in Scotland 1987 1987 Category:Scottish Premier League matches 1987 ","title":"Rangers F.C. 2‚Äì2 Celtic F.C.

In 1874 the pair collaborated to create what was effectively Japan's first manga magazine, Eshinbun nipponchi (Illustrated News). In 1874 Robun turned to journalism, joining the Yokohama mainichi shinbun and going on in 1875 to found his own newspaper, the Kana-yomi shinbun (Kana Newspaper). His newspaper pioneered the genre of \\"dokufu-mono,\\" criminal biographies of female outlaws, and Kanagaki Robun's own Tale of Takahashi Oden the She-Devil (written rapidly after Takahashi Oden was beheaded for killing a man) is the most famous example of the genre. He also wrote illustrated biographies, including an adapted biography of Ulysses S. Grant published for Grant's 1879 visit to Japan. ==Works== * Ansei f≈´bunsh≈´, 1856 * Ansei korori ry≈´k≈çki, 1856 * Hanagoromo kitsune no s≈çshi, 1863 * Seiy≈ç d≈çch≈´ hizakurige (Shank's Mare to the Western Seas), 1870‚Äì76 * Aguranabe (The Beef Eater), 1871. * Kyurisukai (The Cucumber Messenger), 1872 * Sekai miyakoji shusho eiri (Roads to the world's capitals), 1872 * Saga denshinroku, 1874 * Genkon Shina jij≈ç, 1875 * 'Seiyo kabuki Hamuretto' (Hamlet: a Western Kabuki), Hiragana eiri Shinbun (Illustrated hiragana newspaper), 1875 * Takahashi Oden yasha monogatari (The Tale of Takahashi Oden the She-Devil), 1879 * Inaba koz≈ç sett≈ç shinwa, 1883 * Hamuretto Yamato Nishikie (Hamlet), 1886 ==References== Category:1829 births Category:1894 deaths Category:Japanese journalists Category:19th-century Japanese novelists ","title":"Kanagaki Robun"},{"id":"46336426","text":"Adelbert David Bishop (March 15, 1942 - July 8, 2017) was a Canadian politician.

After completing his schooling, he spent several years in Canada working as a member of the Salvation Army Field Force. On his return to Newfoundland, he became superintendent of Salvation Army schools. Cave reached the rank of major before he resigned in 1916 and set up a dry goods business in St. John's. In 1899, he had married Emma Allan; the couple had three children. In 1919, Cave finished second in the two member riding of Bay de Verde, five votes ahead of Albert Hickman, the Liberal Progressive candidate. Hickman appealed the result of the election, citing voting irregularities; Cave filed a counter-suit accusing Hickman of bribery. The Newfoundland Supreme Court found both men guilty and set aside the result of the election. In the subsequent by- election, Cave was re-elected. Cave had been named Minister of Shipping following the general election; although this was not a cabinet post, this may have helped him win the by-election. He was re-elected in 1923 and was named to the Newfoundland cabinet as Minister of Finance and Customs. Cave was defeated when he ran for re-election in 1924 and again in 1928.

It commemorates nearly 1,400 men from the British Merchant Navy who died on active service with Royal Navy in the Second World War, and who have no known grave. More than 13,000 officers and seamen of the Merchant Navy agreed to serve with the Royal Navy in the Second World War, serving mainly in auxiliary vessels such as armed merchant cruisers, subject to military discipline but still receiving civilian pay. The depot for registration and administration of the naval auxiliaries from the Merchant Navy was established at Liverpool. After the Second World War, the Imperial War Graves Commission (later the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) organised a competition for a memorial, with a budget of ¬£5,000, open to architects who had served in the armed forces. The winning design was created by architects Charles Frederick Blythin and Stanley Harold Smith, with sculpture by George Herbert Tyson Smith. It was unveiled by Admiral of the Fleet Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope on 12 November 1952. The memorial comprises a narrow cylindrical column of Portland stone topped by a glazed lantern, which has glass lenses with a reflective backing intended to resemble a lighthouse, which stands on a semicircular Portland stone platform surrounded by curved walls. The platform is reached by flight of six steps, and the walls support a pair of stone globes, one terrestrial and one celestial. The memorial bears =the inscription \\"These officers and men of the Merchant Navy died while serving with the Royal Navy and have no grave but the sea 1939‚Äì1945\\". The names of the dead are inscribed on 25 bronze plaques arranged around the curved Portland stone walls of the memorial. It became a Grade II listed building in 2010. Among several other memorials at Pier Head are memorials to seamen from Norway, Poland, China, the Netherlands and Belgium who served in the Second World War, and a memorial dedicated to the Merchant Navy unveiled in 1998. There is a proposal to erect a large Battle of the Atlantic memorial nearby. Merchant seamen lost at sea in the First and Second World Wars are also commemorated by the Merchant Navy Memorial at Tower Hill in London.

Dunham received his B.A. degree from Portland State College in 1962 and his PhD from the University of Southern California in 1966. He studied at USC with Dr. J.P. Guilford. In his doctorate, Dunham and Guilford worked with the concept of intelligence, and developing factor structures that compose this construct. Dunham accepted a position as a faculty member with University of Texas, Austin in Educational Psychology. At the University of Texas, Dunham ran a computer-assisted instruction laboratory and continued studying how we learn concepts. == Psychology lineage == Dunham was a student of J.P. Guilford, who received his doctorate from Cornell University in Psychology in 1927. Guilford was a descendant of Edward B. Titchener. Titchener received his doctorate from the University of Leipzig in 1892 in Psychology and studied under Wilhelm Wundt, the father of psychology. Wundt Received his medical degree from the University of Heidelberg in 1856. In his doctorate, Dunham worked closely with J.P. Guilford on developing the factor structure of intelligence. Guilford was known for his ‚ÄúGuilford Structure of Intellect‚Äù, where he presented more than 150 different intellectual abilities, along three main dimensions: (1) Operations, (2) Content, and (3) Products. However, Dunham found at least two distinct factors within Guilford‚Äôs factor structure Content domain: (1) Figural- Concrete, real world information, tangible objects‚Äîthings in the environment. It includes visual: information perceived through seeing; auditory: information perceived through hearing; and kinesthetic: information perceived through one's own physical actions. (2) Symbolic- Information perceived as symbols or signs that stand for something else, e.g., Arabic numerals, the letters of an alphabet, or musical and scientific notations. Beyond working with Guilford, Dunham was considered the pioneer in incorporating computers in education. He brought together government agencies, educational institutions, and computer companies to exchange information on the use of computers. == Summary of publications == #Guilford, Dunham, & Hoepfner (1967): Presents the importance of Intelligence factors (a) visual- figural (line-drawings); (b) symbolic (letters); and (c) semantic (meaningful words).

He is considered the \\"Father of Scottish country dancing.\\" ==Biography== Peacock was possibly born in York. He studied dancing under the celebrated George Desnoyer, who was later the dancing master at the court of King George III. In 1742, citizens of Aberdeen appealed to the town council \\"that the town was at great loss for want of a right dancing master to educate their children.\\" A few years later the town hired James Stuart of Montrose, Angus as the dancing master (an early term for dance teacher) but he was apparently found lacking; in 1746 the council advertised again for \\"a person of sober, discreet and moral character.\\" John Dawney, dancing master of Edinburgh, recommended Francis Peacock, also living in Edinburgh. On 14 February 1747, the town council appointed the 23-year-old Peacock as official and only dancing master of Aberdeen. He was paid seven shillings sterling per student per month, together with some money to organise the music. In Aberdeen, Peacock established the first school of dance as well as the Aberdeen Musical Society. The society was founded with the physician John Gregory, organist Andrew Tait, and music copyist David Young. For almost 60 years, Peacock acted as a director and occasional violinist for the society, with profits from private concerts going to charity. Peacock's teaching career in Aberdeen lasted five decades. Many of his students included the Scottish nobility; Peacock firmly believed that dancing was a vital activity for young people to learn grace and manners. He writes, > \\"I may here observe, that there cannot be a greater proof of the utility of > Dancing, than its being so universally adopted, as a material circumstance > in the education of the youth of both sexes, in every civilised country. Its > tendency to form their manners, and to render them agreeable, as well in > public as in private; the graceful and elegant ease which it gives to the > generality of those who practice it with attention, are apparent to everyone > of true discernment.\\" He is particularly known for his eight-volume treatise on dance, Sketches Relative to the History and Theory, but More Especially to the Practice of Dancing (1805). This was one of the early works on the history of dance. It was dedicated to Jane Gordon, Duchess of Gordon. He used the traditional Gaelic names for the dances but also employed the classical French ballet terms as well. He also painted portrait miniatures and composed music, including an anthem played during the coronation of George III in 1761. He played the violin with the Aberdeen Musical Society, which he co-founded with David Young, Andrew Tait and John Gregory. He published Fifty Favourite Airs for the Violin (1762). ==Personal life== On 15 February 1748, Peacock married Ellen (or Helen) Forbes (died 1804) at St Nicholas's Church in Aberdeen. They had five children: Elizabeth, Jannet, John, George, and Thomas. ==Legacy== Peacock was also a philanthropist; the proceeds of his 1805 Sketches, amounting to ¬£1,000, were donated to the Aberdeen Lunatic Asylum (now Royal Cornhill Hospital). He also left a considerable sum of money to charity in his will. Francis Peacock - commemorative plaque A commemorative plaque is located at his former dance school on Castle Street in Central Aberdeen.

Heard in the Supreme Court in 1976, the decision considered whether press statements by the Prime Minister Robert Muldoon had breached section 1 of the Bill of Rights 1688, \\"That the pretended power of suspending of laws, or the execution of laws, by regal authority, without consent of Parliament, is illegal\\".Bill of Rights 1688, section 1. ==Background== The Third Labour Government had passed the New Zealand Superannuation Act 1974 requiring employees and employers to make matching compulsory contributions to a superannuation fund from 1 April 1975. This was to be administered by the Superannuation Board.Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 616. As David Williams noted, \\"The National Party, then in opposition, used all possible parliamentary devices to oppose this legislation and promised to repeal it immediately the Party gained office again. The general election campaign in 1975 had featured an acrimonious debate over the merits of the rival Labour and National superannuation policies.\\" The National Party had suggested in its election campaign, and specifically in the Dancing Cossacks advertisement, that the superannuation scheme would have the effect of leading to Soviet-style communism. A general election was held on 29 November 1975, at which the Labour Party was voted out of government and on 12 December 1975 the Third National Government was formed with Robert Muldoon sworn in as Prime Minister.Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 616. On 15 December, the Prime Minister, who was also Minister of Finance, issued a press statement declaring, Robert Muldoon, pictured in 1969. On 23 December, Prime Minister Muldoon issued another press release, The plaintiff, Mr FitzGerald, had worked as a public servant since 3 June 1975 and he stated in his affidavit that he had since the beginning of his employment with the Crown, contributed at a rate of one percent of his earnings, amounting to $2.08 a fortnight. He further deposed that the Crown had been deducting this from his gross earnings and transferring this into the fund along with their contribution, until the pay period ending on 24 December 1975.Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 618. FitzGerald sued the Prime Minister, as first defendant, and named the chairman and eight other members of the Superannuation Board as second defendant, the Attorney-General (in respect of the Treasury and Department of Education) as third defendant and the Controller and Auditor-General as fourth defendant.Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 618. Wild CJ summarised FitzGerald's case as being that the Prime Minister had, in contravention of the Bill of Rights 1688, section 1, made an announcement that constituted exercising a pretended power to suspend a properly made law, the Superannuation Act 1974.Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 618. FitzGerald sought a declaration that the announcement and instructions issued by the Prime Minister on 15 December 1975 amounted to a breach of section 1 of the Bill of Rights 1688 and also injunctions requiring the withdrawal of the instruction and restraining the Prime Minister from further instructions to the Superannuation Board. A range of other declarations and injunctions was sought against the other defendants for their participation in the suspension of the superannuation scheme.Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 619. ==Evidence== In his judgment Wild CJ surveyed the evidence of four public officials: Sir Arnold Nordmeyer, Chairman of the Superannuation Board; a Mr Kelly, assistant commissioner of the State Services Commission; the chief accountant of the Inland Revenue Department; and the general manager of the Superannuation Corporation.Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 619. ==Judgment== Bill of Rights, 1688. Chief Justice Wild decided in favour of the plaintiff on one issue, that the Prime Minister's purported suspension of the operation of the New Zealand Superannuation Act 1975, \\"was illegal as being in breach of s 1 of the Bill of Rights, and that the plaintiff is entitled to a declaration to that effect\\".Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 623. Wild CJ also held that whether the meaning of \\"by regal authority\\" included the Prime Minister's statement was Wild CJ found against the plaintiff that the evidence disclosed that there had been no instructions by the Prime Minister to any members of the Superannuation Board, any government department or arm of state services.Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 622. Because there was a high probability that the New Zealand Superannuation Act 1974 would be repealed and the scheme dismantled in the months following the hearing, Wild CJ adjourned all other matters for six months, satisfied that, \\"In my opinion, the law and the authority of Parliament will be vindicated by the making of the declaration I have indicated\\".Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 623. ==References * Excerpt from a 2011 lecture by Mohsen al Attar at the University of Auckland. * Justice Stephen --- \\"Constitutional collision: Fitzgerald v Muldoon v Wild\\" [2014 OtaLawRw 3; (2014) 13 Otago LR 243] * Law NZ - Fitz v Muldoon - Branches of Govt Summary of essential NZ Public Law Case and related concepts Category:Constitutional case law Category:1976 in New Zealand law Category:1976 in case law Category:Constitution of New Zealand Category:High Court of New Zealand cases ","title":"Fitzgerald v Muldoon"},{"id":"46336567","text":"Emil Thoroddsen (June 16, 1898 - July 7, 1944) was an Icelandic composer, pianist, playwright, critic and translator.

The sources of English secular music are much more limited than for ecclesiastical music. Medieval musicians had a wide variety of instruments available to them. The Anglo-Saxon scop and gleeman were replaced in the thirteenth century by the minstrel. In the early Middle Ages, ecclesiastical music was dominated by monophonic plainchant, the separate development of British Christianity until the eighth century, led to the development of a distinct form of liturgical Celtic chant. This was superseded, from the eleventh century by Gregorian chant. England retained unique forms of music and of instrumentation, but English music was highly influenced by continental developments, while British composers made an important contribution to many of the major movements in early music in Europe, including the polyphony of the Ars Nova and laid some of the foundations of later national and international classical music. English musicians also developed some distinctive forms of music, including the Contenance Angloise, the rota, polyphonic votive antiphons and the carol and the ballad. The impact of humanism on music can be seen in England the late fifteenth century. Edward IV chartered and patronised the first guild of musicians in London in 1472, a pattern copied in other major towns cities as musicians formed guilds or waites, creating local monopolies with greater organisation, but arguably ending the role of the itinerant minstrel. There were increasing numbers of foreign musicians, particularly those from France and the Netherlands, at the court. The result was a very elaborate style which balanced the many parts of the setting and prefigured Renaissance developments elsewhere. ==Sources== The Minstrel's Gallery, Exeter Cathedral, shows angels with a variety of contemporary instruments Surviving sources indicate that there was a rich and varied musical soundscape in medieval England.R. McKitterick, C. T. Allmand, T. Reuter, D. Abulafia, P. Fouracre, J. Simon, C. Riley-Smith, M. Jones, eds, The New Cambridge Medieval History: C. 1415- C. 1500 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), , pp. 319‚Äì25. Historians usually distinguish between ecclesiastical music, designed for use in church, or in religious ceremonies, and secular music for use in places from royal and baronial courts, celebrations of some religious events, to public and private entertainments of the people. Because literacy, and musical notation in particular, were preserves of the clergy in this period, the survival of secular music is much more limited than for church music. Nevertheless, some were noted, often by clergymen who had an interest in secular music. ==Instruments and musicians== Medieval musicians had a wide variety of instruments available to them. These included the shawm, fiddles, rebec, crwth, portative organ, trumpet, timbrel, lute and bagpipe.E. Lee, Music of the People: A Study of Popular Music in Great Britain (London: Barrie & Jenkins, 1970), p. 10. In Anglo-Saxon England, the professional poet was known as a scop (\\"shaper\\" or \\"maker\\"). Often attached to a royal or noble court, he composed his own poems, and sang them accompanied by an instrument, usually a harp. Beneath the scop was the gleeman, who was usually itinerant, and performed the works of others.L. C. Lambdin and R. T. Lambdin, eds, Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature (London: Routledge, 2013), , p. 242. In the late thirteenth century, the term minstrel began to be used to designate a performer who earned their living with poetry and song. They often performed other entertainments, such as jesting and acrobatics.Ruth A Johnston, All Things Medieval: An Encyclopedia of the Medieval World, Volume 1 (ABC-CLIO, 2011), , pp. 495‚Äì500. ==Earliest music== One of two candidates for the earliest surviving copy of \\"C√¶dmon's Hymn\\" is found in \\"The Moore Bede\\" (c. 737) which is held by the Cambridge University Library. The Venerable Bede's story of the cattleman, and later ecclesiastical musician, C√¶dmon, indicates that at feasts in the early medieval period it was normal to pass around the harp and sing 'vain and idle songs'.R. I. Page, Life in Anglo-Saxon England (London: Batsford, 1970), pp. 159‚Äì60. The existence of an oral tradition of music is suggested by Aldhelm, who was of Bishop of Sherborne from 715, and who set religious lyrics to popular songs in order to spread the Christian message.E. Lee, Music of the People: A Study of Popular Music in Great Britain (London: Barrie & Jenkins, 1970), p. 5. Thanks to Bede, one of C√¶dmon's songs survive as \\"C√¶dmon's Hymn\\", but since this type of music was rarely notated, there is now little knowledge of its form or content.C. Parrish, The Notation of Medieval Music (Maesteg: Pendragon Press, 1978), . ==Church music== In the early Middle Ages, ecclesiastical music was dominated by monophonic plainchant. The separate development of British Christianity from the direct influence of Rome until the eighth century, with its flourishing monastic culture, led to the development of a distinct form of liturgical Celtic chant.D. O. Croinin, ed., A New History of Ireland, Vol. I: Prehistoric and Early Ireland (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), , p. 798. Although no notations of this music survive, later sources suggest distinctive melodic patterns. This was superseded, as elsewhere in Europe, from the eleventh century by Gregorian chant.D. Hiley, Western Plainchant: a Handbook (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995), , p. 483. The version of this chant linked to the liturgy as used in the Diocese of Salisbury, the Sarum Use, first recorded from the thirteenth century, became dominant in England. This Sarum Chant became the model for English composers until it was supplanted at the Reformation in the mid-sixteenth century, influencing settings for masses, hymns and Magnificats.E. Foley and M. P. Bangert, Worship Music: a Concise Dictionary (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 2000), , p. 273. Singing techniques called gymel, a technique of temporarily dividing up one voice part, usually an upper one, into two parts of equal range, but singing different music, were introduced in England in the thirteenth century. Church music was often accompanied by instruments such as the guitar, harp, pipes and organ.A. R. Myers, English Society in the Late Middle Ages, 1066‚Äì1307 (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 8th edn., 1978), , pp. 112‚Äì113. The earliest evidence of two handed, polyphonic organ music is in the Robertsbridge Codex, from around 1325.D. E. Bush and R. Kassel, eds, The Organ: An Encyclopedia (Psychology Press, 2006), , p. 328. ==Ars Nova== John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, a major patron of music In the fourteenth century, the English Franciscan friar Simon Tunsted (d. 1369), usually credited with the authorship of Quatuor Principalia Musicae: a treatise on musical composition, is believed to have been one of the theorists who influenced the 'Ars Nova', a movement which developed in France and then Italy, replacing the restrictive styles of Gregorian plainchant with complex polyphony.W. Lovelock, A Concise History of Music (New York NY: Frederick Ungar, 1953), p. 57. The tradition was well established in England by the fifteenth century and was widely used in religious, and what became, purely educational establishments, including Eton College, and the colleges that became the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. The motet 'Sub Arturo plebs' attributed to Johannes Alanus and dated to the mid or late fourteenth century, includes a list of Latinised names of musicians from the English court that shows the flourishing of court music, the importance of royal patronage in this era and the growing influence of the ars nova.M. Bent, ed., Two Fourteenth-Century Motets in Praise of Music (Lustleigh: Antico, 1986). Included in the list is J. de Alto Bosco, who has been identified with the composer and theorist John Hanboys, author of Summa super musicam continuam et discretam, a work that discusses the origins of musical notation and mensuration from the thirteenth century and proposed several new methods for recording music.P. M. Lefferts, ed., Regule, by Johannes Hanboys (Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1991), , pp. 30‚Äì1. ==Contenance Angloise== From the mid-fifteenth century there are relatively large numbers of works that have survived from English composers in documents such as the early fifteenth century Old Hall Manuscript. Probably the first, and one of the best represented is Leonel Power (c. 1380‚Äì1445), who was probably the choir master of Christ Church, Canterbury and enjoyed noble patronage from Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence and John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford (1389‚Äì1435). John Dunstaple (or Dunstable) was the most celebrated composer of the 'Contenance Angloise' (English manner), a distinctive style of polyphony that used full, rich harmonies based on the third and sixth, which was highly influential in the fashionable Burgundian court of Philip the Good.R. H. Fritze and W. B. Robison, Historical Dictionary of Late Medieval England, 1272‚Äì1485 (Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2002), , p. 363. Nearly all his manuscript music in England was lost during the Dissolution of the Monasteries (1536‚Äì40), but some of his works have been reconstructed from copies found in continental Europe, particularly in Italy. The existence of these copies is testament to his widespread fame within Europe. He may have been the first composer to provide liturgical music with an instrumental accompaniment.S. Sadie and A. Latham, The Cambridge Music Guide (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), , pp. 101‚Äì2. Royal interest in music is suggested by the works attributed to Roy Henry in the Old Hall Manuscript, suspected to be Henry IV or Henry V.N. Orme, From Childhood to Chivalry: The Education of the English Kings and Aristocracy, 1066‚Äì1530 (London: Taylor and Francis, 1984), , p. 169. This tradition was continued by figures such as Walter Frye (c. 1420‚Äì75), whose masses were recorded and highly influential in France and the Netherlands.J. Caldwell, The Oxford History of English Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), , pp. 151‚Äì2. Similarly, John Hothby (c. 1410‚Äì87), an English Carmelite monk, who travelled widely and, although leaving little composed music, wrote several theoretical treatises, including La Calliopea legale, and is credited with introducing innovations to the medieval pitch system.T. Dumitrescu, The Early Tudor Court and International Musical Relations (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), , pp. 63 and 197‚Äì9. ==Rotas== O Maria salvatoris, from the Eton Choirbook A rota is a form of round, known to have been used from the thirteenth century in England. The earliest surviving piece of composed music in the British Isles, and perhaps the oldest recorded folk song in Europe, is a rota: a setting of 'Sumer Is Icumen In' ('Summer is a-coming in'), from the mid-thirteenth century, possibly written by W. de Wycombe, precentor of the priory of Leominster in Herefordshire, and set for six parts.H. Morley and W. H. Griffin, English Writers: An Attempt Towards a History of English Literature vol. 10 (1887, BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2008), p. 227. Although few are recorded, the use of rotas seems to have been widespread in England and it has been suggested that the English talent for polyphony may have its origins in this form of music. ==Votive antiphons== Polyphonic votive antiphons emerged in England in the fourteenth century as a setting of a text honouring the Virgin Mary, but separate from the mass and office, often performed after compline. Towards the end of the fifteenth century they began to be written by English composers as expanded settings for as many as nine parts with increasing complexity and vocal range. The largest collection of such antiphons is in the late fifteenth century Eton choirbook.H. Benham, John Taverner: His Life and Music (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003), , pp. 48‚Äì9. ==Carols== The word carol is derived from the Old French word carole, a circle dance accompanied by singers (in turn derived from the Latin choraula). Carols were very popular as dance songs from the 1150s to the 1350s.W. J. Phillips, Carols; Their Origin, Music, and Connection with Mystery-Plays (Routledge, 1921, Read Books, 2008), , p. 24. Carols developed in the fourteenth century as a simple song, with a verse and refrain structure.J. J. Walsh, Were They Wise Men Or Kings?: The Book of Christmas Questions (Westminster: John Knox Press, 2001), , p. 60. Their use expanded as processional songs sung during festivals, particularly at Advent, Easter and Christmas, while others were written to accompany religious mystery plays (such as the Coventry Carol (written before 1534). Because the tradition of carols continued into the modern era, more is known of their structure and variety than most other secular forms of medieval music. ==Ballads== The east end of Worcester Cathedral, where Henry Abyngdon was Master of Music from 1465‚Äì83 The traditional, classical or popular ballad has been seen as beginning with the wandering minstrels of late medieval Europe. As a narrative song, their theme and function may originate from Scandinavian and Germanic traditions of storytelling that can be seen in poems such as Beowulf.J. E. Housman, British Popular Ballads (1952, London: Ayer Publishing, 1969), p. 15. The earliest example of a recognisable ballad in form in England is \\"Judas\\" in a thirteenth-century manuscript.A. N. Bold, The Ballad (Routledge, 1979), , p. 5. From the end of the fifteenth century there are printed ballads that suggest a rich tradition of popular music. A reference in William Langland's Piers Plowman indicates that ballads about Robin Hood were being sung from at least the late fourteenth century and the oldest detailed material is Wynkyn de Worde's collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford University Press, 2005), , p. 45. Early collections of English ballads were made by Samuel Pepys (1633‚Äì1703) and in the Roxburghe Ballads collected by Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer (1661‚Äì1724). Increasing numbers were collected from the eighteenth century, some of which may date back to the medieval era. ==Renaissance c. 1450‚Äìc. 1500== The impact of humanism on music can be seen in England the late fifteenth century under Edward IV (r. 1461‚Äì1483) and Henry VII (r. 1485‚Äì1509). Although the influence of English music on the continent declined from the mid-fifteenth century as the Burgundian School became the dominant force in the West, English music continued to flourish with the first composers being awarded doctorates at Oxford and Cambridge, including Thomas Santriste, who was provost of King's College Cambridge, and Henry Abyngdon, who was Master of Music at Worcester Cathedral and from 1465‚Äì83 Master of the King's Music.H. W. Hadow, English Music (Longmans, 1931, Read Books, 2006), , pp. 27‚Äì8. Edward IV chartered and patronised the first guild of musicians in London in 1472, a pattern copied in other major towns cities as musicians formed guilds or waites, creating local monopolies with greater organisation, but arguably ending the role of the itinerant minstrel.A. L. Beier, Masterless men: the vagrancy problem in England 1560‚Äì1640 (London: Routledge, 1985), , p. 98. There were increasing numbers of foreign musicians, particularly those from France and the Netherlands, at the court, becoming a majority of those known to have been employed by the death of Henry VII. His mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort, was the major sponsor of music during his reign, commissioning several settings for new liturgical feasts and ordinary of the mass.M. Williamson, 'Royal image-making and textual interplay in Gilbert Banaster's O Maria et Elizabeth, in I. Fenlon, ed., Early Music History: Studies in Medieval and Early Modern Music (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , p. 269. The result was a very elaborate style which balanced the many parts of the setting and prefigured Renaissance developments elsewhere.R. Bray, 'England i, 1485‚Äì1600' in J.

Kearney first arrived on the inter-county scene when he first linked up with the Cork senior football team. He made his senior debut during the 1920 championship. Kearney later became a regular member of the hurling team as well, and won one All-Ireland medal and one Munster medal in hurling, while he also won one Munster medal as a footballer. At club level Kearney was a three-time championship medallist with Collegians. He also won a championship medal with St. Finbarr's. Throughout his career Kearney made a combined total of 12 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1928 championships. ==Playing career== University During his medical studies at University College Cork, Kearney was an automatic inclusion for the Collegians hurling and football teams. In 1922 he was at left corner-forward as UCC faced arch rivals University College Dublin in the inter-varsities hurling decider. Goals proved decisive as Cork powered to a 6-1 to 3-2 victory, withy Kearney collecting a first Fitzgibbon Cup medal. Three years later UCC pulled off a remarkable double with Kearney playing a key role as a dual player. A 7-1 to 2-2 trouncing of University College Dublin secured a second Fitzgibbon Cup medal. Later that year Kearney won a first Sigerson Cup medal as Cork defeated University College Galway by 1-2 to 0-2. UCC retained their football title in 1926, with Kearney collecting a second Sigerson Cup medal following a 4-3 to 0-2 defeat of University College Dublin. Club Kearney first enjoyed success in the club championship as a member of the University College Cork senior football team. In 1920 he won his first championship medal as UCC defeated three-in-a-row hopefuls Cobh by 5-4 to 0-1. In 1926 Kearney was lining out with St. Finbarr's who qualified for the final of the hurling championship. Blackrock were the opponents, however, a narrow 6-2 to 5-4 victory gave him a championship medal in that code. The following year Kearney enjoyed further success with the UCC footballers. A 3-3 to 1-0 defeat of Macroom gave him a second championship medal. University College Cork retained their title in 1928. A 1-6 to 0-2 defeat of Duhallow United gave Kearney a third and final championship medal. Inter-county Kearney first played for Cork as a member of the senior football team. He made championship debut on 20 June 1920 in a 2-6 to 0-4 Munster semi-final defeat by Kerry. On 28 May 1922 Kearney made his first championship appearance with the Cork senior hurling team. His side faced a 5-2 to 1-2 defeat by Limerick in what was the delayed Munster final from the previous year. Kearney was a regular member of the senior hurling team by 1926. He won a Munster medal following a three-game saga with Tipperary, culminating in a 3-6 to 2-4 victory for Cork. On 24 October 1926 he lined out in his first senior All-Ireland decider, as Cork faced Kilkenny for the first time since 1912. At a snow-covered Croke Park, the first half was even enough with Cork holding an interval lead of one point, however, Kilkenny slumped in the second half, going down to a 4-6 to 2-0 defeat. The victory gave Kearney an All-Ireland medal. Two years later in 1928 Kearney was at full-forward on the Cork football team that faced Tipperary in the provincial decider. A hat- trick of goals from Kearney secured a 4-3 to 0-4 victory and a Munster medal. He had earlier claimed a second Munster hurling medal as a non-playing substitute following a 6-4 to 2-2 defeat of Clare in a replay. On 9 September 1928 Cork faced Galway in the All-Ireland decider. The Westerners, who got a bye into the final without lifting a hurley, were no match as a rout ensued. Cork triumphed by 6-12 to 1-0 with Kearney collecting a second All-Ireland medal as a substitute. ==Honours== Player ;University College Cork *Cork Senior Football Championship (3): 1920, 1927, 1928 *Sigerson Cup (2): 1925, 1926 *Fitzgibbon Cup (2): 1922, 1925 ;St. Finbarr's *Cork Senior Hurling Championship (1): 1926 ;Cork *All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (2): 1926, 1928 (sub) *Munster Senior Hurling Championship (2): 1926, 1928 (sub) *Munster Senior Football Championship (1): 1928 ==References== Category:1898 births Category:1952 deaths Category:St. Finbarr's hurlers Category:UCC hurlers Category:UCC Gaelic footballers Category:Cork inter-county hurlers Category:Cork inter-county Gaelic footballers Category:All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship winners ","title":"Joe Kearney"},{"id":"46336677","text":"The New People's Party formed a political alliance with the Civil Force in February 2014.

The Neoproterozoic is characterized by a large glaciation event, followed by the appearance of the first multicellular body plans before the Cambrian Explosion. Until the late 1950s, the Precambrian era was not believed to have hosted multicellular organisms. However, with radiometric dating techniques, it has been found that fossils initially found in the Ediacara Hills in Southern Australia date back to the late Precambrian era. These fossils are body impressions of organisms shaped like disks, fronds and some with ribbon patterns that were most likely tentacles. These are the earliest multicellular organisms in Earth's history, despite the fact that unicellularity had been around for a long time before that. The requirements for multicellularity were embedded in the genes of some of these cells, specifically choanoflagellates. These are thought to be the precursors for all animals. They are highly related to sponges (Porifera), which are the simplest multicellular animals. In order to understand the transition to multicellularity during the Precambrian, it is important to look at the requirements for multicellularity‚Äîboth biological and environmental. ==Precambrian era== The Precambrian era dates from the beginning of Earth's formation (4.6 billion years ago) to the beginning of the Cambrian Period, 542 million years ago. The Precambrian consists of the Hadean, Archaean and Proterozoic eons. Specifically, this article examines the Ediacaran, when the first multicellular bodies are believed to have arisen, as well as what caused the rise of multicellularity. This time period arose after the Snowball Earth of the mid Neoproterozoic. The \\"Snowball Earth\\" was a period of worldwide glaciation, which is believed to have served as a population bottleneck for the subsequent evolution of multicellular organisms. Precambrian bodies The Earth formed around 4.6 billion years ago, with unicellular life emerging somewhat later after the cessation of the Late Heavy Bombardment, a period of intense asteroid impacts possibly caused by migration of the gas giant planets to their current orbits, however multicellularity and bodies are a relatively recent event in Earth's history. Bodies first started appearing towards the end of the Precambrian Era, during the Ediacaran period. The fossils of the Ediacaran period were first found in Southern Australia in the Ediacara Hills, hence the name. However these fossils were initially thought to be part of the Cambrian and it wasn't until the late 1950s when Martin Glaessner identified the fossils as actually being from the Precambrian era. The fossils that were found date to about 600 million years ago and are found in a variety of morphologies. ==Fossils of the Ediacaran== For more information, see Ediacaran biota. The fossils found that date back to the Precambrian era lack distinct structures since there were no skeletal forms during this period. Skeletons did not arise until the Cambrian Period when oxygen levels increased. This is because skeletons require collagen, which uses Vitamin C as a cofactor, which requires oxygen. For more information on the rise of oxygen see the section on oxygen. The majority of fossils from this Era come from either Mistaken Point on the East Coast of Canada or the Ediacara Hills in Southern Australia. Most of the fossils are found as impressions of soft-bodied organisms in the shape of disks, ribbons or fronds. There are also trace fossils that provide evidence that some of these Precambrian organisms were most-likely worm-like creatures that were locomotive. Most of these fossils lack any recognizable heads, mouths or digestive organs, and are thought to have fed via absorptive mechanisms and symbiotic relationships with chemoautotrophs (Chemotroph), photoautotrophs (Phototroph) or osmoautotrophs. The ribbon-like fossils resemble tentacled organisms, and are thought to have fed by capturing prey. The frondose fossils resemble sea pens and other cnidarians. The trace fossils suggest that there were annelid type creatures, and the disk fossils resemble sponges. Despite these similarities, much of the identification is speculation since the fossils do not show very distinct structures. Other fossils do not resemble any known lineages. Many of the organisms, such as Charnia, found in Mistaken Point, were not like any organisms seen today. They had distinct bodies, however were lacking a head and digestive regions. Rather their body was organized in a very simple, fractal-like branching pattern. Every element of the body was finely branched and grew by repetitive branching. This allowed the organism to have a large surface area and maximize nutrient absorption without needing a mouth and digestive system. However, there was minimal genetic information and therefore did not have the requirements that would have allowed them to evolve more efficient feeding techniques. This means they were probably outcompeted by other organisms, and thus became extinct. The organisms found in the Ediacaran Hills in Southern Australia displayed either radially symmetric body plans or, one organism, Spriggina, displayed the first bilateral symmetry. The Ediacaran Hills are thought to have once had a shallow reef where more light could penetrate the bottom of the ocean floor. This allowed for more diversity of organisms. The organisms found here resemble relatives of the cnidarians, mollusks or annelids. Charnia Charnia fossil found from Mistaken Point, Newfoundland, Canada Charnia fossils were originally found in the Charnwood Forest in England, hence named Charnia. These fossils are from marine organisms that lived on the bottom of the ocean floor. The fossils have a fractal body plan and were frond shaped, meaning they resembled broad-leafed plants such as ferns. However they could not have been plants since they resided in the dark depths of the ocean floor. In Charnwood Forest, Charnia was found as an isolated species, however there were many more fossils found on the East Coast of Canada in Mistaken Point in Newfoundland. Charnia was attached to the bottom of the ocean floor, and was strongly current aligned. This is seen because there are disk-like shapes at the bottom of the Charnia fossil, which show where Charnia was tethered, and all the nearby fossils are facing the same direction. These fossils at Mistaken Point were preserved well under volcanic ash and layers of soft mud. It has been determined via radiometric dating of the fossils that Charnia must have lived around 565 million years ago. Dickinsonia Body impression of Dickinsonia organism from the Precambrian Era Dickinsonia fossils are another notable fossil from the Ediacaran period, found in Southern Australia and Russia. It remains unknown what type of organism Dickinsonia was; however, it has been considered a polychaete, turbellarian/annelid worm, jellyfish, polyp, protest, lichen or mushroom. They were preserved in quartz sandstones, and date back to around 550 million years ago. Dickinsonia were soft-bodied organisms, that show some evidence of very slow movement. There are faint, circular imprints in the rock which follow a path, and then following the same path there is a more definite circular imprint of the same size. This indicates that the organism probably moved slowly from one feeding area to the next and absorbed nutrients. It is speculated that the organism probably had very small appendages that allowed it to move much like starfish do today. Spriggina This is the body impression of Spriggina, which lived during the Precambrian Era. Spriggina fossils represent the first known organisms with a bilaterally symmetric body plan. They had a head, tail and almost identical halves. They probably had sensory organs in the head and digestive organs in the tail which would have allowed them to find food more efficiently. They were capable of locomotion, which gave them an advantage over other organisms from that era that were either tethered to the bottom of the ocean floor or moved very slowly. Spriggina was soft bodied, which leave the fossils as faint imprints. It is most likely related to annelids, however there is some speculation that it could be related to arthropods since it somewhat resembles trilobite fossils. Trace fossils The Ediacaran fossils of Southern Australia contain trace fossils, which indicate that there were motile benthic organisms. The organisms that produced the traces in the sediments were all worm-like sediment feeders or detritus feeders (Detritivore). There are a few trace fossils, which resemble arthropod trails. Evidence suggests that arthropod-like organisms existed during the Precambrian. This evidence is in the type of trails left behind; specifically one specimen that shows six pairs of symmetrically placed impressions, which resemble trilobite walking trails. ==Transition from unicellularity to multicellularity== For the majority of Earth‚Äôs history life has been unicellular. However, unicellular organisms had the ingredients in them for multicellularity to arise. Despite having the ingredients for multicellularity, organisms were restricted due to the lack of hospitable environmental conditions. The rise of oxygen (The Great Oxygenation Event) led organisms to be able to develop more complex body plans. In order for multicellularity to have occurred, organisms must have been capable of cellular communication, aggregation, and specialized functions. The transition to multicellularity that began the evolution of animals from protozoa is one of the most poorly understood of history‚Äôs life events. Understanding choanoflagellates and their relation to sponges is important when positing theories on the origins of multicellularity Choanoflagellates Choanoflagellates, also called \\"collar-flagellates\\" are unicellular protists that exist in both freshwaters and oceans. Choanoflagellates have a spherical (or ovoid) cell body and a flagellum that is surrounded by a collar composed of actin microvilli. The flagellum is used to facilitate movement and food intake. As the flagellum beats, it takes in water through the microvilli attached to the collar, which helps filter out unwanted bacteria and other tiny food particles. Choanoflagellates are composed of approximately 150 species and reproduce by simple division. Choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta (also known as Choanoflagellate Proterospongia) The choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta is a rare freshwater eukaryote consisting of a number of cells embedded in a jelly-like matrix. This organism demonstrates a very primitive level of cell differentiation and specialization. This is seen with flagellated cells and their collar structures that move the cell colony through the water, while the amoeboid cells on the inside serve to divide into new cells to assist in colony growth. Similar low level cellular differentiation and specification can also be seen in sponges. They also have collar cells (also called choanocytes due to their similarities to choanoflaggellates) and amoeboid cells arranged in a gelatinous matrix. Unlike choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta, sponges also have other cell-types that can perform different functions (see sponges). Also, the collar cells of sponges beat within canals in the sponge body, whereas Salpingoeca rosetta‚Äôs collar cells reside on the inside and it lacks internal canals. Despite these minor differences, there is strong evidence that Proterospongia and Metazoa are highly related. Choanoflagellate Perplexa These choanoflagellates are able to attach to one another via the pairing of collar microvilli. Choanoflagellate Codosiga Botrytis and Desmerella These choanoflagellates are capable of forming colonies via fine intercellular bridges that allow the individual cells to attach. These bridges resemble ring canals that link developing spermatogonia or oogonia in animals. Sponges (Porifera) Sponges are some of Earth‚Äôs oldest and most ubiquitous animals. The appearance of sponge spicule fossils date back to the Precambrian Era around 580 million years ago. An assemblage of these fossils were found in the Doushanto formation in Southern China. Some circular impressions from the Ediacaran Hills in Southern Australia are also reported to be sponges. They are one of the only lineages of metazoans from this era that continue to survive, and remain relatively unchanged. Sponges are such successful organisms due to their simple, yet effective morphology. They do not possess mouths or any digestive, nervous or circulatory systems. Instead they are filter feeders, which means that they obtain food through nutrients in the water. They have pores, called ostia, that water travels through to a chamber called the spongocoel, and exits through a chamber called the osculum. Through this water filtration system, they obtain nutrients that are needed for their survival. Specifically, they intracellularly digest bacteria, micro- algae or colloids. Sponge skeletons consist of either spongin or calcareous and siliceous spicules with some collagen molecules interspersed. The collagen holds the sponge cells together. Different lineages of sponges are distinguished based on the composition of their skeletons. The three main classes of sponges are Demospongiae, Hexactinellid, and Calcareous. Demonsponges are the most well-known type of sponge since they are used by humans. They are distinguished by a siliceous skeleton of two and four rayed spicules and contain the protein spongin. Hexactinellid are also called glass sponges, and are distinguished by a six-rayed glass skeleton. These sponges are also capable of carrying out action potentials. Calcareous sponges are characterized by a calcium carbonate skeleton and comprise less than 5% of sponges. Cells Sponges have around 6 different types of cells that can perform different functions. Sponges are a good model for studying the origin of multicellularity because the cells are capable of communicating with one another and re-aggregating. In an experiment conducted by Henry Van Peters Wilson in 1910, it was found that cells from dissociated sponges could send out signals and recognize each other to form a new individual. This suggests that the cells that compose sponges are capable of independent living, however once multicellularity was possible then aggregating together to form one organism was a more efficient way of living. The most notable cell types of sponges are the goblet-shaped cells called choanocytes, so named for their similarity to choanoflagellates. The similarities between these two cells types makes scientists believe that choanoflagellates are the sister taxa to metazoa. The flagella of these cells are what drive the water movement through the sponge body. The cell body of choanocytes is what is responsible for nutrient absorption. In some species these cells can develop into gametes. The Pinacocytes are the cells on the exterior of the sponge that line the cell body. They are tightly packed together and very thin. The mesenchyme lines the region between the pinacocytes and the choanocytes. They contain a matrix composed of proteins and spicules. Archaeocytes are special types of cells, in that they can transform into all of the other cell types. They will do what is needed in the sponge body, such as ingest and digest food, transport nutrients to other cells in the sponge body. These cells are also capable of developing into gametes in some sponge species. The sclerocytes are responsible for the secretion of spicules. In species of sponges that use spongin instead of calcaerous and silicaceous spicules, the sclerocytes are replaced by spongocytes, which secrete spongin skeletal fibres. The myocytes and porocytes are responsible for contraction of the sponge. These contractions are analogous to muscle contractions in other organisms, since sponges do not have muscles. They are responsible for regulating the water flow through the sponge. ==The formation of multicellularity== The formation of multicellularity was a pivotal point in the evolution of life on Earth. Shortly after multicellularity arose, there was an immense increase in the diversity of living organisms at the beginning of the Cambrian Era, called the Cambrian Explosion. Multicellularity is believed to have evolved multiple times on Earth because it was a beneficial life strategy for organisms. For multicellularity to occur, cells need to be capable of self-replication, cell- cell adhesion and cell-cell communication. There also must have been available oxygen and selective pressures in the environment. Theory of cellular division: S. Rosetta Work by Fairclough, Dayel and King suggests that S. Rosetta can exist in either single-cellular form or in colonies of 4-50 cells, which arrange themselves in tight knit packs of spheres. This was established by performing an experiment involving the introduction of prey bacterium Algoriphagus species to a sample of uni-celled S. Rosetta organism and monitored the activity for 12 hours. Results of this study demonstrated that cell colonies were formed through cell-division of the initial solitary S. Rosetta cell rather than by cell aggregation. Further studies to support the theory of cell-proliferation were done by introducing then removing the drug aphidicolin which serves to block cell-division. When the drug was introduced, cell division stopped and colony formation resulted through cell-cell aggregation. When the drug was removed, cell-division dominated once again. Building blocks for cell-adhesion By looking at the genome of the Choanoflagellate, \\"Monosiga brevicollis\\", scientists have inferred that choanoflagellates play a key role in the development of multicellularity. Nicole King has done work looking at the genome of Monisiga brevicollis, and has found key protein domains that are shared between metazoans and choanoflagellates. These domains play a role in cell signalling and adhesion processes in metazoans. The finding that choanoflagellates also have these genes is an incredible discovery because it was previously thought that only metazoans had genes responsible for cell-cell communication and aggregation. This suggests that these domains play a key role in the origins of multicellularity since it ties a unicellular organism (choanoflagellates) to multicellular organisms (metazoans). It shows that the components required for multicellularity were present in the common ancestor between metazoans and choanoflagellates. Cell signaling and cell communication Neither sponges nor the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens appear to be equipped with neuron synapses, however they both possess several factors related to the same synaptic function. Therefore, it is likely that central features involved in synaptic transmission arose early in metazoan evolution, most likely around the time that much of the life on Earth was transitioning to multicellularity. It was found that the Munc18/syntaxin 1 complex could be an important component for the production of the SNARE protein. The secretion of SNARE protein from synaptic vesicles is believed to be critical for neuronal communication. The Munc18/syntaxin 1 complex found in M. brevicollis is both structurally and functionally similar to the metazoan complex. This suggests that it constitutes an important step in the reaction pathway toward SNARE assembly. It is believed that the common ancestor of choanoflagellates and metazoans used this primordial secretion machinery as a precursor to synaptic communication. This mechanism would eventually be used for cell-cell communication in animals. Reasons for the development of multicellularity Despite the fact that prokaryotic cells contained the building blocks required for multicellularity to arise, this transition did not occur for around 1500 million years after the origins of the first eukaryotic cell. Scientists have proposed two major theories for the reason that multicellularity arose so late after the appearance of life on Earth. Predation theory for multicellularity This theory postulates that multicellularity arose as a means for prey to escape predation. Larger prey are less likely to be preyed upon, and larger predators are more likely to catch prey. Therefore it is likely that multicellularity arose when the first predators evolved. By assembling as a larger, multicelled organism, prey could escape the attempts of a predator. Therefore multicellularity was selectively favoured over unicellularity. This can be seen in a simple experiment conducted by Boraas et al. (1998). When a predatory protist, Ochromonas valencia, was introduced to a prey population of Chlorella vulgaris, it was seen that within less than 100 generations of the prey species a multicellular growth form of the alga became dominant. This is interesting because before the predator was introduced, the population of Chlorella vulgaris retained its unicellular growth form for thousands of generations. It is likely that it would have remained unicellular indefinitely if the selective pressure that was induced by the predators had not been introduced. After multiple generations with the predator, the algal species retained a growth form of 8-10 cells, which was large enough to avoid the predator, but small enough that each cell still had access to nutrients. This predator-prey relationship provides a likely reason for why it was beneficial for organisms to be multicellular. Rise in oxygen levels theory for multicellularity Despite the fact that organisms had the potential to become multicellular it is likely that it was not actually possible until the late Neoproterozoic. This is because multicellularity requires oxygen, and before the late Neoproterozoic there was very limited oxygen availability. After the melting of the ‚ÄúSnowball Earth‚Äù during the mid Neoproterozoic, nutrients that were trapped in the ice flooded the oceans. Surviving bacteria flourished due to the increased nutrient levels. Among these microbes were cyanobacteria and other oxygen producing bacteria, which led to the massive rise in oxygen levels. The increased oxygen availability allowed it to be used by cells in order to manufacture collagen. Collagen is the key component for cell aggregation, It is a rope-like molecule that ‚Äúties‚Äù cells together. Oxygen is required for collagen synthesis because ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) is essential for this process to occur. A key component in the ascorbic acid molecule is oxygen (chemical formula C6H8O6). Therefore, it is evident that the rise in oxygen is a crucial step to the rise of multicellularity since it is essential for the synthesis of collagen. ==Building blocks found in both sponges and humans== Collagen Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals and is an essential molecule in the formation of bones, skin and other connective tissue. Different types of collagen have been found in all multicellular organisms, including sponges. It has been found that sponges do have a gene sequence coding for collagen type IV which is a diagnostic feature of the basal lamina. It has also been found that 29 types of collagen have been found to exist in humans. This vast group can further be divided into several families according to their primary structures and supramolecular organization. Among the many types of collagens, only the fibrillar and the basement membrane (type IV) collagens have been found in the sponges and cnidarians, which are the two earliest branching metazoan lineages. Studies have focused on the origin of fibrillar collagen molecules. In Sponges, there exist three clades of fibrillar molecules, A, B and C. It is proposed that only the B clade fibrillar collagens preserved their characteristic modular structure from sponge to human. In mammals, the fibrillar collagens involved in the formation of cross-striated fibrils are types I‚ÄìIII, V, and XI. Type II and type XI collagens compose the fibrils present in cartilage. These can be distinguished from collagens located in non-cartilaginous tissues, which include type I, III, and V collagens. Protein Additional research on sponge proteins found that of 42 sponge proteins that were analysed, all of them had homologous proteins that are found in humans. An identity score of 53% was given to the similarity among sponge and human proteins, compared to a score of 42% when the same sequence was compared to that of C. elegans. ==References== Category:Body plans Category:Evolutionary biology Category:Evolution by phenotype ","title":"Precambrian body plans"},{"id":"46336739","text":"Joseph Alfred Roussel (January 12, 1921 - November 8, 2015) was a Canadian politician.

The film features Vineeth Sreenivasan, Dhyan Sreenivasan and Aju Varghese in the lead roles. Kunjiramayanam was released on 28 August 2015. ==Plot== Kunjiraman (Vineeth Sreenivasan), the nephew of \\"Well-done\\" Vasu (Mamukkoya), plans to marry Vasu's daughter Thankamani (Rimi Tomy). All plans are thwarted by Kunjiraman's dim-witted cousin brother Laalu (Dhyan Sreenivasan), who places an inappropriate cassette in Kunjiraman's VCR, and later blaming it on Kunjiraman. With this incident, both families swear to have their child married before the other. To avenge this, Kunjiraman goes to the Gulf to make money, meanwhile Laalu becomes an apprentice in Kuttan's (Aju Varghese) tailoring shop, where he looks up to Kuttan as his role model. On Kunjiraman's return, he plans to marry well and before Thankamani's wedding. His mother Sumathi (Seema G. Nair) fixes a marriage for him with Sajitha (Srinda Arhaan). On their engagement day, Sajitha makes Kunjiraman promise to stop all his drinking activities, and breaks a \\"Salsa\\" bottle and returns to the Gulf. After several failed attempts to bring Salsa into the village, its is realized that Desam is now cursed and nobody is successful in bringing a bottle of Salsa. Upon Kunjiraman's return, he becomes aware of the curse and publicly accepts the challenge to bring Salsa into Desam in front of Laalu and Vasu, as a way to obtain respect in front of his village. On the night before his wedding, he sets out to bring a bottle of Salsa, but ends up drunk and wakes up only the next noon, thereby cancelling the wedding. After this Kunjiraman leaves to Gulf and after a series of events, Vasu reaches the village and unknowingly takes the bottle of Salsa that Ratheesh (Hareesh Kanaran) had bought earlier, only to find the villagers rushing to him and thus Vasu obtaining the status of a local hero. But with this departure, another curse had befallen the land, the curse of failed marriages. Meanwhile Laalu is convinced by Kuttan that the local policeman's sister, Reshma (Sneha Unnikrishnan), has an eye for him. This makes Laalu very dreamy. But his dreams are shattered when Kunjiraman returns after a year and his mother fixes a marriage for him with Reshma. On hearing this Laalu secretly plots against Kunjiraman with Kuttan. They plan to lock the door of Reshma's room the night before the engagement in hopes of locking her in during the auspicious time, thereby calling off the engagement. But the drunk Kuttan ends up locking the door from inside and spending the night in her room. Fearing shame from the society and the greed of the people to have a wedding, Reshma weds Kuttan, leaving both Kunjiraman and Laalu broken-hearted. Kunjiraman departs back to the Gulf, but Kuttan tries to deviate Laalu from Reshma by convincing him that Paramu's (Indrans) daughter, Mallika (Arya (actress)), has an interest in him. Meanwhile Thankamani's wedding has been fixed and Kunjiraman's mother insists on him marrying Mallika on the same day and same temple, when he returns. Laalu upon hearing this tries to spoil the occasion the night before, once again with Kuttan, by doing the same \\"locking the door\\" plan. Upon which they discover Thankamani absconding (from her house to avoid the wedding) and they also learn that Kunjiraman never left and this was planned with Thankamani. All unite and they plan a way to prevent Thankamani's fianc√©e from reaching the temple. On the wedding day, the group tries to block the way to prevent the groom from reaching the temple, only to discover him as a person not to be messed with, Manoharan (Biju Menon). Manoharan agrees to this compromise and agrees to attend the wedding just for the sake of it. At the temple, Kunjiraman and Thankamani are married, without prior consent, but the occasion goes well. But Manoharan plays his own cards and does not let Laalu marry Mallika, instead he marries Mallika, claiming that he will not leave Desam empty-handed, leaving Laalu broken-hearted once again. It is later seen that Mallika has had several affairs and Manoharan is convinced that Desam is cursed and feels that he has received the biggest curse of Desam. ==Cast== * Vineeth Sreenivasan as Kunjiraman * Dhyan Sreenivasan as Laalu * Biju Menon as Manoharan (special appearance) * Aju Varghese as \\"Cutpiece\\" Kuttan * Neeraj Madhav as Kanjoottan * Arya Rohit as Mallika * Deepak Parambol as Sasi * Mamukkoya as \\"Well-done\\" Vasu * Rimi Tomy as Thankamani (special appearance) * Srinda Ashab as Sajitha * Sneha Unnikrishnan as Reshma * Seema G.

Born in Cork city, Egan initially played hurling for the local Blackpool club Glen Rovers. He arrived on the inter-county scene when he first linked up with the Cork junior team. He joined the senior panel during the 1926 championship. Egan won two All- Ireland Senior Hurling Championship medals and two Munster Senior Hurling Championship. At club level, Egan won several championship medals in the different grades with Glen Rovers and later Blackrock. He retired from inter- county hurling following the conclusion of the 1928 championship. ==Hurling career== Club In 1924 Egan was a key member of the Glen Rovers team that reached the final of the junior championship for the first time. Dohenys provided the opposition, however, the game was so one-sided in favour of \\"the Glen\\" that Doheny's conceded after fifty minutes. It was Egan's first championship medal. The following year Glen Rovers reached the final of the intermediate championship. A 7-2 to 2-3 defeat of Innicarra gave Egan a championship medal in that grade. Egan later played club hurling with Blackrock. Inter-county Egan first appeared for Cork as a member of the junior team in 1925. After playing no part in Cork's run to the All-Ireland decider, he was included at right corner-forward for the delayed decider against Dublin. A 5-6 to 1-0 victory gave Egan an All-Ireland Junior Hurling Championship medal. In 1926, in a season in which he captained his club's junior side, Egan was drafted onto the Cork senior panel. He was an unused substitute throughout the majority of the campaign, but collected a set of All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship and Munster Senior Hurling Championship medals following respective defeats of Tipperary and Kilkenny. Egan made his senior championship debut on 13 May 1928, in a 4-8 to 0-3 Munster semi-final defeat of Waterford. He was later dropped to the substitutes' bench, as Cork completed a clean sweep of Munster and All-Ireland titles once again. ==Personal life== Thomas John (Jack) Egan was born in Cork in 1904.

His father owned a small jewelry business in Buffalo. He began college at the University of Buffalo. At the age of 21 he transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, majoring in mathematics. He graduated in January 1963 \\"with great distinction\\". In the spring semester 1963, Weinberg continued at Berkeley as a graduate student in the mathematics department. He worked as a Teaching Assistant, Reprinted from the January 1965 issue of Campus CORElator. teaching undergraduates who were taking large-lecture math courses. Weinberg's first participation in a political organization occurred in 1963, by joining the Berkeley chapter of CORE (Congress of Racial Equality). Weinberg spent the summer of 1963 traveling in the South visiting civil rights groups. He returned to Berkeley and began his second semester of grad school in the fall of 1963 but then withdrew mid-semester to devote himself full-time to civil rights activities. He became the head of Campus CORE. Weinberg remained in the Bay Area throughout the summer of 1964.Some sources incorrectly state that Weinberg went to Mississippi in the summer of 1964 and took part in Freedom Summer. FSM activists Mario Savio and Malcolm Zaretsky did so, but Weinberg did not. ==Free Speech Movement== In the fall semester of 1964, Weinberg was engaged in student activism at the University of California, Berkeley. On Thursday October 1, 1964, Weinberg was sitting at the CORE table in Sproul Plaza. He refused to show his identification to the campus police and was arrested at noon for violating the University's new rules regarding student political activism. There was a spontaneous movement of students to surround the police car in which he was to be transported. They sat on the ground around the police car, preventing it from moving. Throughout the night and into the next day, students, including Mario Savio, gave speeches from atop the car calling for free speech on campus. Weinberg, too, addressed the crowd from the top of the police car. At one point, there may have been 3,000 students around the car. On the evening of October 2, 1964, approximately twenty-four hours later, representatives of political groups on campus signed an agreement with the administration regarding student free speech, which was dubbed the Pact of October 2.1990 documentary film, directed by Mark Kitchell. Excerpts can be viewed on YouTube. After being confined in the police car for 32 hours, Weinberg was then booked and freed as the agreement stipulated that the University would not press charges against him. But less than a week later, the Alameda County District Attorney did press charges against Weinberg. The first meeting of FSM (Free Speech Movement) took place on Saturday October 3, in Art Goldberg's apartment. The first order of business was to choose a name for the organization (the name \\"Free Speech Movement\\" did not yet exist). Several names were proposed‚ÄîStudents for Free Speech, United Free Speech Movement, University Rights Movement, Students for Civil Liberties. Weinberg suggested \\"Free Speech Movement\\" and that's the name that was adopted, by a margin of one vote. FSM leader Mario Savio later stated that Jack Weinberg was the FSM's key tactician. Historian W. J. Rorabaugh calls Weinberg \\"one of the most effective civil rights organizers\\" and \\"the strategist behind FSM\\". ==\\"Don't trust anyone over 30\\"== Weinberg is the person who coined the saying \\"Don't trust anyone over 30\\". The saying exists in several variants, such as \\"Never trust anybody over 30\\". Origination of the saying has been wrongly attributed to Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, the Beatles, and others. In November 1964, Weinberg was interviewed by a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle working on a story about the Free Speech Movement. Weinberg tells the story like this: > I was being interviewed by a newspaper reporter, and he was making me very > angry. It seemed to me his questions were implying that we were being > directed behind the scenes by Communists or some other sinister group. I > told him we had a saying in the movement that we don't trust anybody over > 30. It was a way of telling the guy to back off, that nobody was pulling our > strings. A text version of this article is also online. On November 15, 1964, the Chronicle printed the story, quoting Weinberg as saying \\"We have a saying in the movement that you can't trust anybody over 30.\\" A Chronicle columnist, Ralph J. Gleason, highlighted the saying in his column on November 18. The saying then went viral, becoming a favorite for reporters and columnists wishing to ridicule the young, the New Left, or the hippie/Yippie movement. That annoyed Weinberg, who has said > I've done some things in my life I think are very important, and my one > sentence in history turns out to be something I said off the top of my head > which became completely distorted and misunderstood. But I've become more > accepting of fate as I get older. ==After FSM== Weinberg was active in leadership of the Vietnam Day Committee (VDC), a coalition that organized rallies and marches opposing the Vietnam War. A text version of this article is also online. On Friday night, October 15, 1965, the VDC held an anti-war march that began at the UC Berkeley campus and was intended to end at the Oakland Army Terminal. The march left the UC campus at 7:52 p.m. after an all-day rally there. Marchers carried anti-U.S. foreign policy signs and chanted anti-war slogans. There were 10,000-14,000 people in the march. (For other formats of this document, see https://archive.org/details/appendixtojournax1967cali) At the head of the march was a banner carried by a line of marchers, then a sound truck containing VDC leaders including Jack Weinberg, Bettina Aptheker, Jerry Rubin, Stephen Smale, Steve Weissman, Frank Bardacke, and Robert Scheer. Also in the truck was the poet Allen Ginsberg chanting the Heart Sutra. However, the City of Oakland had refused to grant the march a permit, and so Oakland police blocked Telegraph Avenue at the Oakland border with a phalanx of some 375 policemen. When the march neared the border, it came to a halt while the leaders considered what to do. Weinberg and Bardacke got out of the truck, crossed the police line, and met with Oakland Police Chief Edward M. Toothman. Weinberg and Bardacke could not persuade Toothman to let the march proceed into Oakland. So they returned to the sound truck and told the other VDC leaders. A fierce debate ensued about what to do; they voted 5-4 to turn back into Berkeley. Weinberg joined the Independent Socialist Club in 1966 and helped organize it into a national movement‚Äîthe International Socialists‚Äîof which he was a national council member. Weinberg has said that the Stop the Draft Week protests of October 16‚Äì21, 1967, were > the first clear demonstration that the radical part of the Anti-Vietnam war > movement was coming up against its own limitations. It didn't really have > the weight in society to stop the war. I think that it was after that, that > the Berkeley radical scene became more and more cut off from reality. And > the question of moving American society, changing people really was getting > lost. Transcript of 1990 documentary film directed by Mark Kitchell. This > quote occurs at 69 minutes 56 seconds into the film. Weinberg moved to Los Angeles to work as labor correspondent for a radical weekly underground newspaper, the Los Angeles Free Press. Becoming involved in the formation of the Peace and Freedom Party of California, he organized the registration drive that collected enough signatures to get the party on the California ballot in the 1968 elections. Weinberg served as the California state chairperson of the Peace and Freedom Party from August 1968 until November 1968. In November 1968, Weinberg was the Peace and Freedom Party candidate for congress in California's 26th congressional district election (Los Angeles area); he received 3% of the vote. ==Work in labor movement== In following years, Weinberg was a union activist. In 1973, he was a participant in wildcat strikes at Chrysler plants in Detroit, Michigan, as a member of UAW (United Automobile Workers) Local 212. He wrote a book about those strikes. In 1975, Weinberg was the editor of Network, Voice of UAW Militants which was a new bimonthly magazine for members of the UAW labor union. He then moved to Gary, Indiana, where he became a steelworker and was involved in the United Steelworkers union. ==Work in environmental movement== In 1982, Weinberg led a coalition of environmentalists, unionists, and community members in defeating a proposal to construct a nuclear power plant in Indiana on Lake Michigan. He worked for Greenpeace from 1990 to 2000. He then began working for the Environmental Health Fund. Weinberg is a consultant to groups seeking to clean up environmental pollution. ==Personal life== He is married to Valerie Denney. Weinberg is a grandfather of three, and he has an adjunct faculty position in public health at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ==References(Article written by Weinberg and Gerson in September 1969 became a chapter in book that was published in 1972.)

DeWitt and became the 13th diocesan bishop until his retirement. ==Early life and education== Ogilby was born in Connecticut and received an undergraduate degree from Hamilton College. He then served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, mostly in the Pacific theater. After discharge, he attended Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, graduating in 1949. ==Career== Upon being ordained a deacon in 1949 and priest in 1950, Ogilby's ministry began at the Brent School in the Philippines, where he served as chaplain as well as teacher. Two years later, he was elected suffragan bishop, and was consecrated in 1953 by the Philippines' missionary bishop Norman S. Binsted and suffragan Robert F. Wilner, as well as by bishop Walter H. Gray of Connecticut. Rt.Rev. Ogilby became the territory's bishop in 1957, but resigned in 1967 to let Benito Cabanban (a Filipino whom he had helped consecrate as his suffragan in 1959) become the diocesan bishop. While bishop of the Philippines, Ogilby also served as secretary of the Council of the Anglican Church of Southeast Asia (1960 to 1968), founded Trinity College in Quezon City, Philippines, and held other regional posts. Upon returning to the mainland, Rt.Rev. Ogilby became a bishop in the Episcopal Diocese of South Dakota for three years, but again resigned to let a priest born in the diocese take that leadership position. He moved to Philadelphia to become coadjutor to bishop Robert L. DeWitt, and succeeded him as bishop. During Bishop Ogilby's first year, retired bishop DeWitt and others consecrated eleven women as priests, the Philadelphia 11, which caused significant controversy in Philadelphia and within the denomination. Ultimately, Rt.Rev. Ogilby became reconciled to the idea of women becoming priests. He ordained Philadelphia native Barbara C. Harris (who had participated in that service as an acolyte), as a deacon in 1979 and a priest in 1980, and later participated in her (again controversial) consecration as bishop suffragan in the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts whereby she became the first woman consecrated as a bishop in the Anglican Communion. The first parish in the diocese to call a woman as rector (Rev. Michaela Keener) also occurred during his episcopate (St. Giles parish in Upper Darby in 1986). ==Death and legacy== Bishop Ogilby's episcopate continued after his somewhat early retirement, despite ongoing health issues. He assisted in the dioceses of Western Michigan, Bethlehem (Pennsylvania), Maryland, and Washington (D.C.). He died of a heart condition in Spokane, Washington, where he had gone to assist in a consecration. He was survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter. ==References== Category:Episcopal bishops in Pennsylvania Category:20th-century Anglican bishops Category:1922 births Category:1990 deaths ","title":"Lyman Ogilby"},{"id":"46337131","text":"The Georgia Florida and Alabama (Railroad) Trail (GF&A;) is section of the proposed 52-mile rail-trail from Tallahassee to Carrabelle on the Gulf of Mexico.

Emerging colonies in Virginia, Carolina (later, North and South Carolina), and Georgia imported Native Americans and incorporated them into chattel slavery systems, where they intermixed with slaves of African descent, who would come to outnumber them. Their demand for slaves affected communities as far west as present-day Illinois and the Mississippi River and as far south as the Gulf Coast. The trade in enslaved Native Americans sent tens of thousands of them outside the region to New England and the Caribbean as a profitable export. Natives were sometimes used as labor on plantations or as servants to wealthy colonist families, other times they were used as interpreters for European traders. The policies on the treatment and slavery of Native Americans varied from colony to colony in the Southeast. The Native American slave trade in the southeast relied on Native Americans trapping and selling other Natives into slavery; this trade between the colonists and the Native Americans had a profound effect on the shaping and nature of slavery in the Southeast.Ethridge, Robbie Franklyn, and Sheri Marie Shuck-Hall. 2009. Mapping the Mississippian Shatter Zone: The Colonial Indian Slave Trade and Regional Instability in the American South. U of Nebraska Press. A number of Native societies, armed with European firearms, oriented themselves around waging war to capture slaves from other Native peoples, selling them into slavery. The slave trade and warfare that facilitated it drove many other Native societies to flee their homelands, breaking apart existing communities and eventually leading to a new map of peoples and ethnic groups in the region. == Structure of the trade == In many cases the colonists would trade with Native Americans; giving them goods and weapons, such as the flintlock musket, in exchange for beaver pelt and the capturing of other natives to be sold into slavery. One of the first groups to set up such agreements was the Westos, or Richehecrians, who originally came from the north into Virginia and are said to be descendants of the Erie. After an attempt to end the agreements the Savannah people filled the role previously held by the Westos; and eventually the role fell to the Yamasee and the Creek. The captured Native Americans were brought to the Carolina colony to be sold and were often then sold to the Caribbean, where they would be less likely to escape, or were sold to one of the other thirteen colonies. This trade of slaves was not a very self-sustaining venture. Either the native population was being wiped out and those who were not being killed or captured became the captors; and as the population of natives available for capture dwindled then the captors began to fall into debt with the colonists whom they were trading with. This debt and frustration that began the Yamasee War of 1715, which would ultimately be one of the factors that lead to the demise of the trade system in the Carolinas.Ramsey, William L. 2003. \\"'Something Cloudy in Their Looks': The Origins of the Yamasee War Reconsidered.\\" The Journal of American History 90 (1): 44‚Äì75. == Slavery in the Southeastern colonies == European colonists in the colonies of Virginia, Carolina, and Georgia imported enslaved indigenous peoples as workers during the 17th and early 18th centuries. The Carolina colony became a major exporter of enslaved Native Americans to other colonies, including those of New England and the Caribbean. The southern colonies were known for their use of slavery to keep their large plantation economy running. It is usually assumed that all of the slaves were from Africa, but Native Americans were also frequently enslaved, and in some cases were used more than African slaves. The Native American slave trade in the colonial Southeast was brought to its peak with the use of the European weapons as well as the trade by natives of natives in exchange for more ammunition for weapons as well as other European goods. However, the involvement of the Natives in the slavery of other Natives was not a model that would be able to sustain itself for a long time, and the depletion of 'resources'‚ÄîNative Americans in this sense being the resources‚Äîcoupled with Native American revolts including the Yamasee War of 1715 would effectively become one of the factors that led to Native Americans no longer being the primary race enslaved in the colonial southeast.Brown, Philip M. 1975. \\"Early Indian Trade in the Development of South Carolina: Politics, Economics, and Social Mobility during the Proprietary Period, 1670‚Äì1719.\\" The South Carolina Historical Magazine 76 (3): 118‚Äì28.  Slavery in the Carolinas  The trade between Carolina colonists and native peoples was the core feature of the Carolina Colony from its founding in 1670 to the early 1700s. European colonists offered weapons, alcohol, and manufactured goods in exchange for animal skins and Indian slaves. Charles Town (later Charleston, South Carolina) became a major port for exporting enslaved Indians. The profits from this trade system allowed for the Carolina colony to then set up its plantations which mainly produced rice and indigo, and bringing with it the African slaves who would then work the plantations. Peter H. Wood found that by 1708 South Carolina's population totaled 9,580, including 4,100 African slaves and 1,400 Native American slaves. African men composed 45% of the slave population while Native American women composed 15% of the population of adult slaves in colonial South Carolina. Moreover, the Native American female populations outnumbered the Native American male population, and the African male population greatly outnumbered the African female population. This imbalance encouraged unions between the two racial groups with many former slaves mentioning a notable Native American relative one or two generations before them. The unions also lead to an obvious but unknown number of mixed children of African and Indigenous bloodlines. By 1715 the Native American slave population in the Carolina colony was estimated at 1,850.Snyder (2010), \\"Indian Slave Trade\\" [Ch. 2], in Slavery, pp. 46‚Äì79. Prior to 1720, when it ended the Native American slave trade, Carolina exported as many or more Native American slaves than it imported Africans. This trade system involved the Westo tribe, who had previously come down from further north. The Westos were given goods from Europe in exchange for beaver and other animal pelt and capturing natives to be sold into slavery. Colonial traders encouraged their Indian trading partners to engage in warfare and accumulate captives; they lent their backing to the Stono War of 1674 and the Westo War of 1680. The Goose Creek Men, a small number of planters who moved from Barbados to the Carolina colony, benefited from this trade and offered large quantities of weapons to the Westo, Savannah, Yamasee, and Siouan-speaking \\"Settlement Indians\\" to facilitate it. Colonists and their Yamasee allies went to war with the Tuscarora in 1712, defeating them and capturing hundreds as slaves. In the first decade of the 18th century, French traders living with the Kaskaskia Illinois, and Miami peoples worked incited warfare to procure slaves for the Carolina market, as well as for sale in New France. Slavery, especially of Native Americans, was allowed in the legislative framework of the colony with the creation of \\"Slave Codes\\" soon after the creation of the colony. As slaves, the natives were expected to hunt while the black slaves worked the plantations. As trade with the Native Americans continued, so did the slavery of Native Americans; however, due to a growing trade monopoly in the colony, some of the colonists, such as Henry Woodward, were trying to limit the amount of trade done with the natives. However, Queen Anne's War (1702‚Äì1713) interrupted the building campaigns against trading and allowed for increased sales of slaves in Charleston. Escape was relatively easy for the Native Americans, as they knew the land well and often were not far from their own people. The slave owners' solution to the problem of escaped native slaves was to send them to work in the West Indies, or to another thirteenth colony where they would not be able to escape easily. However, the Yamasee War, which began in 1715, eventually ended the colony's purchase of Native Americans as slaves, making the colony more reliant upon the labor of black slaves.  Slavery in colonial Georgia  The colony of Georgia was established in 1732, and its founder James Oglethorpe ensured that slavery was prohibited in the colony. However, the 1735 law which prohibited slavery only disallowed the enslavement of Africans, and not Native Americans. Some of the first of the Native American slaves in Georgia were those brought down with the Musgrove family of South Carolina.Baine, Rodney M. 1995. \\"Indian Slavery in Colonial Georgia.\\" The Georgia Historical Quarterly 79 (2): 418‚Äì24. Historian Rodney Baine found that reports of purchases of Native American slaves continued in 1738, and that Indian slaves continued to work Georgia plantations in 1772.  Slavery in Florida  The Florida peninsula was under the control of the Spanish until the mid 1700s when it was briefly owned by the British, only to be returned to Spain a few years later. Prior to the British Florida interval, there was a period in the early 1700s during which Spanish Florida was a hotbed for the raiding natives from the northern Carolina and Georgia areas. Though they were left alone for the most part by one of the original raiding groups, the Westos‚Äîwho are said to be descendants of the Erie People, Spanish Florida was heavily targeted by the later raiding groups the Yamasee and Creek. These raids in which villages were destroyed and natives captured or killed drove the natives to the hands of the Spaniards, who protected them as best they could. However, the strength of the Spanish dwindled and as the raids continued, the Spanish and the natives were forced to retreat further down the peninsula. The raids were so frequent that there were barely any natives left to capture, and so the Yamasee and Creek began bringing fewer slaves to the Carolina colonies to continue the trade. The retreat of the Spaniards only ended when the Yamasee and Creek entered what would later be known as the Yamasee War with the Carolina Colony. ==See also== * Slavery in the colonial United States * Indentured servitude in the Americas ** Indentured servitude in Pennsylvania ** Indentured servitude in Virginia ==References== Category:History of the Southern United States Category:Spanish Florida Category:Pre-statehood history of Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Pre- statehood history of Alabama Category:Pre-statehood history of South Carolina Category:Native American history Category:Native American history of Florida Category:Native American history of Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Native American history of Alabama Category:Native American history of South Carolina Category:Slavery in the United States Category:Slavery of Native Americans ","title":"Indian slave trade in the American Southeast"},{"id":"46337151","text":"Margaret Elizabeth Letham (born 21 June 1956) is a female lawn and indoor bowler. ==Bowls career== Margaret Letham is from Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, in Scotland and started bowling at the age of 15 and has won medals at four World Outdoor Championships.

It is an active congregation with daily, Shabbat, and holy day services. B'nai Abraham is home to a Jewish Preschool, as well as Lubavitch of Center City. ==Russian Shul, 1874-1891== B'nai Abraham was established in 1874 as the \\"Russian shul\\". An 1881 almanac identifies the name as Beth Hamedrosh Hagadol B'nai Abraham Anshe Russe. Its congregants officially incorporated in 1882 as Chevra B‚Äônai Avrohom Mi Russe. The synagogue would continue to be known as B'nai Abraham Anshe Russa; Congregation B‚Äônai Abraham; the B‚Äônai Abraham Congregation; and later as Historic Congregation B‚Äônai Abraham. Rabbi Israel M. Sacks served as first official rabbi of the congregation as early as 1881. B'nai Abraham grew in the 1880s with increased immigration of Jews from Russia and Eastern Europe and their settlement in Philadelphia in the city's Jewish quarter. In 1885, B'nai Abraham purchased a building at 521 Lombard Street for $3,000 built in 1820 by the Wesley Church, an AME Zion congregation, who had broken away from Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church, 419 South Sixth Street. By 1885, Wesley Church's congregation had outgrown the building. The 1885 dedication of the synagogue building was attended by Marcus Jastrow, rabbi of the city's German congregation, and Sabato Morais, rabbi of the Spanish and Portuguese congregation. ==Rabbi Bernard Leventhal, 1891-1953== April 1910, The Philadelphia Record. Rabbi Eliazar Kleinberg, Chief Rabbi of Vilna, assumed the pulpit of the congregation in 1889 and served for two years before his passing. In September 1891, Rabbi Kleinberg was succeeded by his son-in-law, R. Bernard L. Levinthal. Rabbi Levinthal would serve as the congregation rabbi until his passing on September 23, 1952. B'nai Abraham had 225 members and 150 seat holders in 1900. In 1909, B'nai Abraham retained the services of contractor Samuel Lashner & Co. to construct a new building at a cost of $28,000. It was designed by architect Charles W. Bolton & Co. in the style of Byzantine Revival. Bolton and his firm had designed B'nai Reuben, built on South Sixth Street in 1905. They took as inspiration for B'nai Abraham's new building the Pike Street Synagogue (Congregation Sons of Israel Kalwarie) built in 1903 and 1904 at 13-15 Pike Street in Manhattan, and designed by the architect Alfred E. Badt. Demolition of the old building began on May 10, 1909 and the new building was dedicated April 1910. The building was struck by lightning in July 1926, igniting a fire that caused $75,000 in damages to the property. The synagogue then housed twenty three Torah scrolls all of which were rescued. ==B'nai Abraham, 1954-present== March 11, 2015 Rabbi H. Zvi Gottesman succeeded R. Levinthal on a part-time basis in 1954. Society Hill's Jewish population contracted in the 1960s and 1970s, and B'nai Abraham identified as a Conservative congregation by 1974. Rabbi Ezekiel Musleah (1927-2020), from Kolkata served as rabbi from 1979 until 1982. Rabbi Yochonon Goldman became the congregation's rabbi in 2000 and continues to serve in this capacity in 2019.

In 1900, during Harry Vardon's exhibition tour, Nicholls did what no other golfer in North America could accomplish‚Äîbeat Harry Vardon. Nicholls defeated the legendary British golfer in two separate matches in resounding fashion. ==Early life== Nicholls was born in Dover, Kent, England. He was the son of Frank Nicholls (1851‚Äì1930) and Lois Elizabeth Cordrey (1855‚Äì1935). Nicholls married Minnie Sharp on 16 May 1898 at St. George's Church in Deal, Kent, England. Prior to leaving England he worked at an athletic goods store in Liverpool and was almost a daily visitor to the Royal Liverpool Golf Club links at Hoylake, county of Cheshire. In his days at Hoylake he became good friends with fellow English golfers John Ball, Jr. ‚Äì the great amateur player ‚Äì and Herbert Tweedie who would later become a golf course architect. ==Golf career== Early golf career Nicholls, At the age of 17, Nicholls ‚Äì who was called \\"Ben\\" by those who knew him ‚Äì was hired to design a golf course in France and by 1899 was the head professional at the Philadelphia Country Club. On 13 July 1905 he played in the first professional golf tournament ever played on a public links golf course in the United States when he competed in an Open Tournament at the Van Cortlandt Park course. Nicholls and Willie Anderson finished joint second five shots behind Isaac Mackie. He worked at Whitemarsh Valley Country Club in 1912‚Äì13 and was at Wilmington Country Club with his younger brother Gilbert Nicholls in 1914. In 1915 he took a position at LuLu Country Club in Glenside, Pennsylvania, and worked there until late 1916. When he registered for the draft during World War I on 9 September 1918 he was working at the Charlotte Country Club in Charlotte, North Carolina. Golf course architecture Nicholls stated on 20 February 1916, \\"In the year 1894, at the age of 17, I was called to France to lay out the first golf course in Paris, which was but a miniature affair on an island situated in the Seine. In connection with this work I became acquainted with the Viscomte [Leon] de Janze, one of the oldest leaders of golf in the district of Paris and the man who is responsible for the excellent course at La Boulie ... as well as several others.\\" Viscomte Leon de Janze was the founder of the Societe de Sport de Puteaux in 1896. Nicholls would go on to build another course at Aix-les-Bains in the French eastern frontier. There, Nicholls said he met Monsier le Docteur Brachie, a leading physician and \\"multimillionaire of the place\\". Brachie said, \\"I want a golf course in Aix-les-Basin. Far up on the mountain side I have a piece of land. After breakfast we will take the mules and look over this property with a view to building a course there\\". Nicholls mentioned that difficulties were encountered in viewing the land due to the fact that it was heavily wooded. \\"I saw some beautiful olive and fig trees, but more important, I also saw 60 husky Italian laborers equipped and ready to work. After threading our way through this mountainous woodland and taking another look at the 60 huskies, I promised to give Monsier Le Docteur a golf course in six weeks\\", said Nicholls. Brachie retorted, \\"Nicholls, if you can do that the Bank of France is open to you. Moreover, I will have King Leopold of the Belgians and King George of Greece present for the grand opening\\". Building Spain's second golf course In Nicholls' memoirs, written in 1916, he stated that he built Spain's second golf course on the Island of Toxa, belonging to Spain and situated in the Bay of Arousa, some 35 miles from Vigo, which Nicholls added, \\"boasts the second finest harbor in the world. It is said that it is capable of accommodating the combined navies of the world. It was by royal command of his majesty King Alphonso that I undertook the work\\". Matches against Harry Vardon Nicholls compiled results in the U.S. Open that were superb. He was very consistent in his play from 1897 through 1907, finishing in the top 10 on six occasions. Nicholls had a respectable T10 finish in the 1909 Open Championship held 10‚Äì11 June at Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club in Deal, Kent, England. One major feather in the cap of Nicholls is that he was the only player to beat Harry Vardon, the famous British master golfer, on Vardon's 1900 exhibition tour to points across the U.S. and Canada. In fact, Nicholls beat Vardon twice. On 17 February 1900, at Ormond, Florida, Nicholls soundly defeated Vardon 5 and 4. His second victory over Vardon was on 13 October 1900 at Brae Burn Country Club, West Newton, Massachusetts, when he won 2 up in a 36-hole match. ==Family== His wife, Minnie Sharp Nicholls (born 1876), died in 1939. Nicholls had eight siblings: brothers Gilbert, William and Alfred, and sisters Florence, Anne, Clara, Ethel and Blanche. He had two children of his own, son Norman Bernard Nicholls (1909‚Äì1985) and daughter Doris Lillian Nicholls (1899‚Äì1990). His younger brother, Gilbert Nicholls, was also a very fine player. ==Death== Nicholls, Bernard Nicholls died at Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 3 November 1924 due to septic meningitis. Interment was at Northwood Cemetery. ==Results in major championships== { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\\" - eeeeee;\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tournament !1896 !1897 !1898 !1899 !1900 !1901 !1902 !1903 !1904 !1905 !1906 !1907 !1908 !1909 !1909 !1910 - align=leftU.S. Open ? style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T4 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T8 17 ? style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T5 28 19 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T4 T20 T11 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T8 ? ? ? ? - align=leftThe Open Championship T46 T35 DNP DNP DNP DNP DNP DNP DNP DNP DNP DNP DNP style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T10 WD CUT } Note: Nicholls never played in the Masters Tournament, founded in 1934, nor the PGA Championship.

It is published by Kodansha's Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine since April 2013, with its chapters compiled into 39 individual tank≈çbon volumes as of August 2020. In North America, Kodansha USA started to publish the manga in digital- only format in April 2017. An anime television series adaptation produced by MAPPA was broadcast from July to December 2016. As of January 2017, the manga had over 4.5 million copies in circulation. In 2016, the manga won the 40th Kodansha Manga Awards in the sh≈çnen category. ==Plot== Days follows the struggles of Tsukushi Tsukamoto, a shy, clumsy and bullied teenager about to start high school. He decides to get into Seiseki High School so he can be with his neighbour and childhood friend Sayuri Tachibana, who is one year his senior. Just as he is bullied after visiting Sayuri at her work, Tsukushi is saved by Jin Kazama, who scares away the bullies by attacking them with nunchucks, and declares himself to be a vagrant and lost in town. Jin then asks Tsukushi if he likes football and asks him to join him the same night for a futsal match as his team is one player short. Tsukushi surprises Jin by showing up after running almost ten miles under the heavy rain and without one shoe, after another run-in with his bullies. Short, young and clumsy, Tsukushi plays incredibly bad but keeps running throughout the whole match despite having injured his foot, showing such an effort that it motivates his other teammates. After a final sprint, Tsukushi manages to score the decisive goal, smashing his head against the pole by doing it. He finds out later that Jin will also be a freshman at Seiseki, and decides to join the football club to play with him, unknowing that the football club in Seiseki is nationwide famous and looked after by students from all the country. He manages to make it to the team despite being incredibly frail, weak and clumsy thanks to his continuous efforts and amazing perseverance, and further he shows incredible ability in motivating the rest of the team to work as hard as possible. ==Characters== Main characters ; : :He is a high school freshman who plays as forward for Seiseki High School. Although quite clumsy at the start, Tsukushi shows amazing perseverance and effort which allow him to become a fundamental part of the team. Tsukushi lost his dad as a child and lives with his mom, who is paralyzed and has to use a wheelchair. ; : :He is a freshman in Seiseki High School, like Tsukushi, and like him he also plays as a forward. Unlike Tsukushi, though, Jin is considered a genius footballer, tall, good-looking, eccentric, and incredibly popular and extroverted. He also appears aloof and somewhat unmotivated before meeting Tsukushi. Jin is fond of dressing up, and rarely follows the rules, which he can manage to do thanks to his genius. He is also a devoted fan of Bruce Lee. Whenever Tsukushi is in need of a handkerchief, Jin often gives him a pair of female panties to use. :Since his talent at football made him difficult to handle, his mom decided to enroll him in boarding school from a very young age. His talent also put him in conflict with his teammates, often, which eventually led to him quitting his middle school team and considering retiring from football. His random encounter with Tsukushi rekindles his passion for it, though. Jin starts as a forward, but as the story progresses he becomes more versatile and starts playing more as a midfielder. Seiseki High School Soccer club ; : :He is the star and captain of Seiseki's soccer team. Like Tsukushi, he started high school as a completely soccer novice and was a terrible player as a freshman but became an amazing player thanks to extraordinary effort. Now in his final year, he will be joining the Kashima professional football club after graduation. He isn't very bright, and has a terrible sense of direction, and is also fond of using neologisms to explain his goals and convey his meaning about plays to the exasperation of most of his team mates. Mizuki is also well known for being an extremely physical forward, which has earned him the nickname of \\"the monster\\" or \\"the beast.\\" He's also one of \\"Tokyo's big three,\\" the nickname that distinguishes the top players in the region. ; : :He is a second year student who plays as offensive midfielder. As the number 10 player Kimishita is the playmaker of Seiseki's team. He works in his parents's shop and is a great student. He's also a prodigy footballer, and was selected for Tokyo's city team during middle school. As the story progresses, Kimishita also specializes as a set piece kicker. He has a strong rivalry with fellow 2nd. year student ≈åshiba. He also shows a strong rivalry with fellow, rival playmakers Indou and Taira. ; : :He is a second year student who plays as forward. Typically he would be substituted by Tsukushi during the second half of games. A football prodigy who started playing as a toddler, he was previously famous for his lack of commitment, as he seemed to care only for scoring, leaving up the defense and tactical work to his teammates. Like others, Tsukamoto's amazing effort and perseverance leads him to change his style, becoming a much better team player and displaying much sacrifice for the team. Oshiba is one of the tallest players in all of Japan, and is the son of wealthy physicians. He's very arrogant and silly, often calling himself \\"Hero.\\" His lack of intelligence is similar to that of Mizuki's, and he's obsessed with becoming Seiseki's captain as soon as the latter one graduates. His older sister has a crush on Mizuki. ; : :He is a third year student, and the second captain of Seiseki's team. A defender, Usui is characterized by his tactical ability. Although Mizuki is the captain, the role is largely symbolic as it's Usui who really controls the movements of the team, hence most of his teammates call him \\"Sergeant Usui.\\" Although he's not in the top ten, rivals would often praise his defending skills. He's somewhat misanthropic and doesn't care much about others until he sees Mizuki's growth and dedication. He's also a very good cook. ; : :She is a classmate of Tsukushi and Jin. She is a haughty and popular student, egotistical at first and quite hard on Tsukushi. After receiving much criticism for the novels and short stories she wrote she decided to quit writing, so when she discovers Tsukushi's perseverance and effort in spite of the criticisms of many (including her) she softens up to him and decides to join the team as an assistant manager. As a manager she becomes incredibly passionate for football and learns about tactics and strategy. She also develops a friendship of sorts with Hoshina, the captain of Touin Academy. ; : :Another first year, Kurusu is a midfielder. Originally focused on fine football playing, he changes his style to a more physical once as a result of observing Tsukushi's sacrifice. He's been friend and teammate with Nitobe and Shiratori since elementary school, and together they're called the \\"1st Year Idiot Trio.\\" ; : :A first year, Nitobe is a center back. Playing a more physical defense style than Usui, out of the \\"1st Year Idiot Trio,\\" (Kurusu, Shiratori, and Nitobe) he's the one that plays the most often as a regular. He appeared to be envious of Tsukushi's progress in such short time as compared to the many years he has devoted to the game of football. ; : :The last member of the \\"1st Year Idiot Trio,\\" Shiratori is a forward and the only of the trio who doesn't play regularly, despite the fact that he seems to have good shooting accuracy. ; : :A 1st-year goalkeeper. Somewhat quiet, Inohara thinks of him as a prodigy goalkeeper. Others ; : :She is a childhood friend and neighbor of Tsukushi, whom she calls Tsuku- chan. A second-year student at Seiseki, she also works in a fast food restaurant. Rivals ; : :Indou is one of the main characters of Yasuda's previous manga \\"Furimukuna Kimi wa.\\" His duo with fellow genius soccer Narukami has made their school, Sakuragi High School, become a National stronghold. He's a genius playmaker who displays amazing field vision so that he can give precise assists. He has a strong rivalry with Seiseki's Mizuki, who like him is called one of \\"Tokyo's big three.\\" Just like Mizuki, Indou is also one of the \\"top-tens,\\" a nickname given to those High School students who have received an offer by a professional football team. Tsukushi meets Indou by coincidence in a train, and then Indou invites him to play a futsal game. Later, Seiseki plays against Sakuragi in the Tokyo qualifiers to the Summer Inter High School tournament. ; : :Narukami is the other main character in Yasuda's previous manga \\"Furimukuna Kimi wa.\\" His duo with fellow genius football Indou has made their school, Sakuragi Academy, become a National stronghold. A short and frail guy, who was unable to play soccer before high school due to his bronchial asthma, he turns into a different person while playing, to the point of becoming bullish and arrogant. He's a superb forward, incredibly fast and precise. Tsukushi has Narukami in great regard, due to his skill despite being as short and frail as he himself is. ; : :The captain of Touin Academy, Takumi is the younger of the three Hoshina brothers, who are nationwide famous, with the oldest being professional and the other one being the top scorer in the collegiate league. Takumi plays as a libero, and is also one of \\"Tokyo's big three.\\" Just like Mizuki and Indou, Hoshina is also one of the \\"Top ten,\\" and will play for a professional team as he graduates. Although a great dribbler, Hoshina generally sticks to solid defense and is depicted as a risk-averse and safe player, and in charge of coordinating his whole team. Seiseki plays Touin Academy in the finals of the Tokyo qualifiers to the Winter inter high school tournament. ; : :The captain of Seikan High School in Aomori, that Seiseki plays against during the summer camp. Just like Mizuki, Taira will be joining the Kashima professional football team after graduation. Taira is a playmaker with a strong physical ability, able to send powerful yet precise passes. His duo with Seikan's star rookie forward Himura allows Seikan to go to the Winter Nationals. ; : :Seikan High School's ace striker, Himura is a very fast forward, a skill that is taken advantage of by Taira. As a freshman, he shows a strong rivalry with Kazama over who's the best rookie player of the two. ; :The star forward and ace striker of Ichiboshi Academy, he's the only second. year student in the \\"top ten,\\" meaning he already has a professional team offer. A prodigy footballer, Aiba has been the top scorer in every single category he has played. An outstanding dribbler and all-around forward, he's nationwide famous, and the center piece in his school offensive football style. As part of the same generation, Kimishita and Oshiba both feel a strong sense of rivalry towards him. ; :The captain of Ryouzan High School, champions of the Summer Inter High Schools tournament. Another of the \\"top ten\\" players (of which his team has other two), Katou is boasted as the best high school defensive midfielder and likely the best player overall, which has granted him a seat in the National team of his category. He's well known for his stamina and his tireless leadership and grit, with rivals commenting on how his face would show up anywhere around the pitch, a result of his tireless energy and his superb understanding of plays, characteristics that other players see as well on Tsukushi, with Jin suggesting Tsukushi that Katou is the player that he should try and look after. ; :Ryouzan High School football team's number 10, and a key member of the National team of his category, Ikariya is a superb offensive midfielder, nicknamed \\"Japan's Treasure.\\" Ikariya is incredibly popular and is even sponsored for advertisement. A very versatile and highly technical player, Ikariya possesses amazing dribbling, ball control, incredible reaction times, and long distance shooting with his left foot, which is the reason for his other nickname, \\"The left of God.\\" He's the second of Ryouzan's \\"top ten\\" players. ; :Takagi is the third of Ryouzan High School's \\"top ten\\" players, the most of reserved of the three but arguably the most dangerous of them. Takagi is considered the best fullback in the history of Japanese High School football thanks to his strong physique, amazing speed and crossing ability. Since both Katou and Ikariya are often missing due to their playing for the National team, it's Takagi who is at the core of Ryouzan's team, and who gets the most respect from his fellow players. A country bumpkin, he often finds himself at odds with the celebrity of both Katou and Ikariya. ==Media== Manga Written and illustrated by Yasuda Tsuyoshi, Days began in Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine on April 24, 2013.

Induced hydraulic fracturing or hydrofracking, commonly known as fracking, is a technique used to release petroleum, natural gas (including shale gas, tight gas and coal seam gas), or other substances for extraction. Radionuclides are associated with hydraulic fracturing in two main ways. Injection of man-made radioactive tracers, along with the other substances in hydraulic-fracturing fluid, is often used to determine the injection profile and location of fractures created by hydraulic fracturing. In addition, hydraulic fracturing releases naturally occurring heavy metals and radioactive materials from shale deposits, and these substances return to the surface with flowback, also referred to as wastewater. ==Naturally occurring radionuclides== There are naturally occurring radioactive material (e.g., radium and radon) in shale deposits. Hydraulic fracturing can dislodge naturally occurring heavy metals and radioactive materials from shale deposits, and these substances return to the surface with flowback, also referred to as wastewater. These naturally occurring radionuclides are of more concern than some man-made radionuclides used in fracture monitoring because of their long half lives. Radium-226 is a product of Uranium-238 decay, and is the longest-lived isotope of radium with a half-life of 1601 years; next longest is Radium-228, a product of Thorium-232 breakdown, with a half-life of 5.75 years. Radon (Rn) is a naturally occurring product of the decay of uranium or thorium. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of 3.8 days. Strontium is also naturally occurring and may be dislodged by the process. ==Injected radionuclides== Injection of radioactive tracers, along with the other substances in hydraulic-fracturing fluid, is often used to determine the injection profile and location of fractures created by hydraulic fracturing. Patents describe in detail how several tracers are typically used in the same well. Wells are hydraulically fractured in different stages. Tracers with different half-lives are used for each stage. Their half-lives range from 40.2 hours (Lanthanum-140) to 28.90 years (Strontium-90). Amounts per injection of radionuclide are listed in the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) guidelines. The NRC guidelines also list a wide range or radioactive materials in solid, liquid and gaseous forms that are used as field flood or enhanced oil and gas recovery study applications tracers used in single and multiple wells. According to the NRC, some of the most commonly used include Antimony-124, Bromine-82, Iodine-125, Iodine-131, Iridium-192, and Scandium-46. A 2003 publication by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) provides a detailed description of tracer use, confirms the frequent use of most of the tracers above, and says that Manganese-56, Sodium-24, Technetium-m, Silver-m, Argon-41, and Xenon-133 are also used extensively because they are easily identified and measured. Other potentially suitable tracers are named in various patents. In terms of quantities used, the NRC gives the following examples: Iodine-131, gas form, 100 millicuries total, not to exceed 20 millicuries per injection; Iodine-131, liquid form, 50 millicuries total, not to exceed 10 millicuries per injection; Iridium-192, \\"Labeled\\" frac sand, 200 millicuries total, not to exceed 15 millicuries per injection; Silver-110m, liquid form, 200 millicuries total, not to exceed 20 millicuries per injection. Other gamma-emitting tracer isotopes used are Antimony-121, Antimony-122, Antimony-123, Antimony-125, Antimony-126, Antimony-127, Carbon-14, Chromium-51, Cobalt-57, Cobalt-58, Cobalt-60, Gold-198, Iodine-127, Iodine-128, Iodine-129, Iodine-130, Iron-59, Krypton-85, Lanthanum-140, Potassium-39 (activated to Potassium-40), Potassium-41 (activated to Potassium-42), Potassium-43, Rubidium-86, Scandium-45, Scandium-47, Scandium-48, Silver-110, Sodium-22, Strontium-85, Strontium-90, Tritium, Zinc-65, and Zirconium-95. ==Environmental impact== Concerns have been expressed that both naturally occurring radionuclides and radioactive tracers may return to the surface with flowback and during blow outs. Wastewater from the wells is released into rivers, injected into wells, and evaporated from ponds. The Times reported that studies by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and a confidential study by the drilling industry concluded that radioactivity in drilling waste cannot be fully diluted in rivers and other waterways. Recycling the wastewater has been proposed as a solution but has its limitations. The New York Times has reported on radium and gross alpha radiation levels in wastewater (also called flowback) from natural gas wells. It collected data from more than 200 natural gas wells in Pennsylvania. The New York Times has compiled a map of these wells and their wastewater contamination levels. Political, governmental, and industry pressures have prevented the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from studying risks associated with radionuclides or other chemicals in hydraulic fracturing fluids in wastewater, source water, and drinking water. The scope of the EPA Hydraulic Fracturing Draft Study Plan was narrowed to exclude them. ==Health impact== As radon decays, it produces radioactive decay products. If the contaminated dust of these \\"radon daughters\\" are inhaled, they can lodge in the lungs and increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Iodine in food is absorbed by the body and preferentially concentrated in the thyroid where it is needed for the functioning of that gland. When Iodine-131 is present in high levels in the environment from hydraulic fracturing flowback and blowouts, it can be absorbed through contaminated food and water, and will also accumulate in the thyroid. As it decays, it may cause damage to the thyroid. The primary risk from exposure to high levels of iodine-131 is the chance occurrence of radiogenic thyroid cancer in later life. Other risks include the possibility of non-cancerous growths and thyroiditis. The level of radiation in hydraulic fracturing wastewater has been measured to be as high as 18,035 pCi/L, thousands of times the maximum allowed by the federal standard for drinking water, and there are concerns about radiation exposure during spills and blowouts. Long term exposure to low level radiation is associated with stochastic health effects; the greater the exposure, the more likely the health effects are to occur. A group of doctors from the United States have called for a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing until health effects are more thoroughly studied. ==Regulation== The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and approved state agencies regulate the use of injected radionuclides in hydraulic fracturing in the United States. Federal and state regulators do not require sewage treatment plants that accept drilling waste to test for radioactivity. In Pennsylvania, where the hydraulic fracturing drilling boom began in 2008, most drinking-water intake plants downstream from those sewage treatment plants have not tested for radioactivity since before 2006. The EPA has asked the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to require community water systems in certain locations, and centralized wastewater treatment facilities to conduct testing for radionuclides. Safe drinking water standards have not yet been established to account for radioactivity levels of hydraulic fracturing waste water, and although water suppliers are required to inform citizens of radon and other radionuclides levels in their water, this doesn't always happen. Radioactive tracers are not yet listed on FracFocus,FracFocus a website indicating chemical composition of fracking fluid of individual wells, but federal and state nuclear regulatory agencies keep records of their use. ==References== Category:Radiation ","title":"Hydraulic fracturing and radionuclides"},{"id":"46337394","text":"Thomas Clarke JP (1846 ‚Äì 28 December 1922) was an Australian politician and businessman who served several terms as Mayor of Redfern. ==Early life== Clark was born to a Methodist family in 1846 in County Fermanagh, Ireland, and emigrated to the Colony of New South Wales in 1861. He commenced business as a commercial agent and produce merchant in Sydney and entered politics when he was elected as an Alderman on the first Broughton Vale Municipal Council on 19 June 1871. Clarke was first elected to serve on Redfern Municipal Council in February 1887 for Golden Grove Ward. He rose to become mayor on two occasions, from February 1890 to February 1891 and from October 1898 to February 1900. ==Later life and career== Clarke first stood for the NSW Parliament at the 1895 election as a Free Trade candidate for Darlington, but was unsuccessful. He was eventually elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Darlington in 1898 as a Free Trader, and sat after federation as a member of the Liberal Reform Party. However he was defeated at the following election in 1901. Clarke continued to serve on Redfern Council until his retirement in February 1906. For thirty-five years, Clarke operated as a commission agent on Sussex Street, Sydney, but retired owing to ill health a few years before his death. In 1902 The Catholic Press reported that Clarke had been elected a vice-president of the Orange Order in Sydney, noting: \\"Can any of our readers inform us whether this is the same Tom Clarke, potato-seller, of Sussex- street, whom many Catholics of Golden Grove helped to return to Parliament a few years ago? If so, what do his old Catholic supporters and fellow-aldermen think of the Christian gratitude of Alderman T. Clarke?.\\" He died at his residence, 'The Willows' (which he had owned since at least 1907 and after 1914 joint-owned with his brother Sydney), in Hazelbrook on 28 December 1922 aged 74, with his obituary noting that he \\"was a popular figure in Redfern, in the affairs of which he always took a deep and active interest.\\" Survived by his wife, Susanna Robinson (d. 1924), he was buried in the family plot at Lawson Cemetery alongside his son Sydney Charles Adam Clarke (1881‚Äì1922) who had predeceased him by two months. ==References== Category:1846 births Category:1922 deaths Category:Australian businesspeople Category:Australian Methodists Category:Irish emigrants to colonial Australia Category:Members of the Orange Order Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Free Trade Party politicians Category:Mayors of Redfern Category:New South Wales local government politicians ","title":"Thomas Clarke (Australian politician)"},{"id":"46337401","text":"thumb Maiken Baird is an American documentary film director and producer. Baird (along with co-director Michelle Major) directed the documentary film Venus and Serena and produced Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer. == Early life and career == Baird obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Columbia University in 1989 and a Master's Degree in International Relations and Political Science from Stanford University in 1992. Before her film career began, Baird worked at the United Nations, the European Union and the Royal Institute of International Affairs. Baird's first position working on documentary films was as a researcher at ABC News under Peter Jennings, where she first worked with her future co-director Michelle Majors. Baird later produced television documentaries for a variety of sources including New York Times Television, National Geographic Channel, A&E; and MTV. == Directing career == Baird met and became friends with Michelle Major while working together for ABC News. The pair became interested in directing a documentary about the Williams sisters in 2007 and began pitching the project. After what Baird says were \\"countless meetings and hundreds of emails\\" the sisters allowed Baird and Major access to film them throughout 2011. The pair went on to film over 400 hours of footage over the course of the year. In 2013 Baird and Major became the target of a lawsuit by the United States Tennis Association over their use of unauthorized footage in the film. While Baird and Majors initially sought and received an invitation from the USTA to film at the 2011 US Open, the organization later claimed the pair had violated a five-minute limit to the use of licensed footage and presented a view of professional tennis which was \\"not in the best interest of the sport.\\" Baird and Major attributed the lawsuit to their use of footage of Serena Williams' 2009 outburst at the US Open. The filmmakers believed the USTA worried the footage would cast the organisation in a bad light. In a letter co-written with Major, Baird appealed to the tennis community for support in challenging what she called an \\"attempt to censor filmmakers\\" by the USTA. Baird and Major reached a confidential settlement with the organization in 2013 which allowed Venus and Serena to be released unedited. == Producing career == In addition to her own works, Baird has produced documentaries created by other directors. In 2017 she executive produced the feature No Stone Unturned, which investigates the story of the 1994 Loughinisland massacrein Northern Ireland. She also executive produced Eli√°n, which focuses on Eli√°n Gonzales as a grown adult and the story that followed his removal from the US to Cuba. Additionally, she executive produced the documentary City of Ghosts, which tells the story of ISIS fighters in the city of Raqqa during the fall of the attempted caliphate. Baird was the executive producer of Icarus, which follows the story of Bryan Fogel as he investigates the world of doping and the ability for athletes to hide their use of pharmacological support. The film received the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2018. In 2018 Baird also produced the film Cradle of Champions, which follows the 2015 New York State Golden Gloves and its competitors within the context of post-industrial urban America. In 2018 Baird was an executive producer for the documentary film Divide and Conquer: The Story of Roger Ailes, and in 2019 she was an executive producer for the documentary film Mystify: Michael Hutchence. == Personal life == Baird lives in New York City with her husband and three children Brita, Euan, and Maia.

She started her music career, in 1988, with the release of He Loves Me by Sound of Gospel. She has released seven more albums, since her first release, with two more labels A&M; Records and Dorohn Records. Two albums have charted on the Billboard magazine charts, which have primarily come on the Gospel Albums chart. ==Early life== Smith was born Esther Jones on December 9, 1937 in Guntown, Mississippi, whose father abandoned the family because he was a womanizer, while her mother was a housekeeper to provide for Esther and two more siblings. At 13 years old, Smith's mother was nearly killed by a boyfriend, so they moved to Chicago, Illinois, where Smith got involved in the church. She left her mother's troubling home environment, and was raised by Mom and Dad Lockhart, which she became the lead singer of The Lockhart Singers. When she reached 18 years old, she became a missionary, and put her musical aspirations on hiatus for a while. ==Music career== Her recording music career started in 1988, with Sound of Gospel releasing, He Loves Me.

The book explores the re- emergence of public shaming as an Internet phenomenon, particularly on Twitter. As a state-sanctioned punishment, public shaming was popular in Colonial America. Between 1837 in the UK and 1839 in the US, it was phased out as a punishment, not due to the increasingly populous society, as was widely held, but instead in response to rising calls for compassion. In gathering material for his book, Ronson interviewed several individuals who were on the receiving end of concentrated Internet shaming, including Jonah Lehrer, Justine Sacco, and Lindsey Stone. He also interviewed controversial practitioners of 21st century public humiliation, including former Texas District Judge and current congressional representative Ted Poe, and several instigators of widespread public shamings. ==Content== In the introduction, Ronson relates a story of an automated parody Twitter handle, @jon_ronson (Ronson's twitter username is actually @jonronson). The account posts a smattering of food and party-related tweets, none of which are related to the content of the actual Jon Ronson's life. This leads to Ronson asking the bot's creators for its removal, as he believes it to be a spambot. The creators of the account call it an \\"infomorph\\", and decline Ronson's request, but eventually agree to meet in person with the author. Ronson then records the interaction and posts it on YouTube, and is surprised when the reaction is overwhelmingly in his favor. The creators of the spambot, in the wake of the public shame elicited by Ronson's video, finally agree to retire the counterfeit Twitter account. This experience leads Ronson to re-evaluate other public shamings he's participated in, and the effects these shaming events have on both the shamed and the shaming. He begins by interviewing prominent victims of public shaming on the Internet, and the instigators of these shaming events. Jonah Lehrer makes a speech to the Knight Foundation after admitting that his book Imagine was based on fabricated quotes. Lehrer's speech was livestreamed over the internet and discussed on Twitter so that both Lehrer and the audience could see in real time the (often harshly critical) reaction to the speech, which was perceived as obfuscatory. His first subject is Jonah Lehrer, disgraced popular science journalist for The New Yorker and author of the book Imagine: How Creativity Works. Ronson also interviews the journalist who exposed Lehrer's plagiarism and misuse of quotes‚ÄîMichael C. Moynihan. In the days preceding Lehrer's televised apology at a conference held by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, Ronson interviews the disgraced journalist while hiking through Runyon Canyon. The public humiliation inherent to Lehrer's apology speech is exacerbated by a large projector screen hung behind his speaking podium and a small television screen viewable to Lehrer, which both display a live Twitter feed of any individual tweeting with the hashtag \\"infoneeds\\". A small controversy brews as a result of Lehrer's speech's content, which some describe as arrogant and lacking sincerity. Ronson, who had recently interviewed Lehrer and was asked for thoughts on a draft, admits to having decided not to say to Lehrer before he made the speech that he found it unconvincing. Further social media upheaval occurs when it is discovered that the Knight Foundation paid Lehrer $20,000 for his apology speech. His next subject is Adria Richards, who publicised the faces of two tech developers at PyCon who were whispering sexual jokes to one another during a lecture on facilitating women's involvement in tech. One of the developers (named only as \\"Hank\\" in the book) publicly attributed his resultant dismissal from his job on Richards' publicizing his behavior, which he felt had been harmless. His account of events led to an online backlash against Richards that in turn led to Richards herself being let go from her job. Ronson reveals that at time of writing, both men had been able to find new positions in tech in the following months, whereas Richards remained unemployed and continued to face online threats and harassment in relation to the incident. Richards says she believes Hank is responsible for knowingly instigating her sustained harassment and continued unemployment, due to his publicly blaming her for his own firing, but Ronson ultimately suggests he feels Richards is primarily at fault. Other sections in the book include interviews and coverage of the Justine Sacco incident and a long section about how people can \\"hide\\" their negative Google Search results via legal and creative IT mechanics. ==Reception== Response to So You've Been Publicly Shamed has been mostly positive. As of August 2016, the book has an average score of 3.9/5 on Goodreads with almost 20,000 total ratings. Jennifer Latson of The Boston Globe remarked that \\"Ronson manages to be at once academic and entertaining.\\" Matthew Hutson from The Wall Street Journal stated that the book \\"raises interesting questions about righteousness, reputation and conformity\\" but lamented that Ronson's \\"thoughts remain disconnected musings rather than cohering as a calculus of public shaming's costs and benefits\\". ==See also== * \\"Hated in the Nation\\", a 2016 episode of the anthology series Black Mirror, was partly inspired by So You've Been Publicly Shamed. * Cancel culture ==References * Jon Ronson interviews the creators of the confederate twitter account. * Jon Ronson interviewed about the book on the podcast On the Media. * Category:2015 non- fiction books Category:Political books Category:Books about the Internet Category:Internet vigilantism Category:Books by Jon Ronson ","title":"So You've Been Publicly Shamed"},{"id":"46337472","text":"Transrating is the process by which video files and audio files are converted to a reduced bit rate while still maintaining the original media format.

He was born in Parramatta to general dealer James Ferris and Bridget Cogan. He ran a Catholic orphan school for some time before joining his brother in a real estate business around 1884. On 15 April 1885 he married Eleanor Alicia Jamieson, with whom he had four children. A Parramatta alderman, he was twice mayor. In 1898 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Protectionist member for Parramatta. The result was voided in October 1898 due to polling irregularities, but Ferris was re-elected at the by-election. He was defeated in 1901.

He has won the three richest shows in chuckwagon racing: the Calgary Stampede Rangeland Derby, Edmonton's Chuckwagon Derby, and the Ponoka Stampede. ==Career== Harden grew up southwest of Edmonton, Alberta in the farming community of Thorsby, Alberta. He started his chuckwagon racing career driving pony chuckwagons, and began driving thoroughbred wagons in 2000 on the World Professional Chuckwagon Association (WPCA) circuit and won WPCA Top Rookie Driver honors. He qualified for his first Calgary Stampede Rangeland Derby as a driver in 2001 and won the Orville Strandquist Award for top rookie driver. His first show championship win came in 2002 at one of chuckwagon racing's biggest events - the Ponoka Stampede. In 2006 he received the World Professional Chuckwagon Association's highest annual honor - the WPCA Chuckwagon Person of the Year. 2009 would be Harden's most successful year when he captured chuckwagon racing's two richest events when he won the Calgary Stampede Rangeland Derby and Edmonton's Chuckwagon Derby, becoming just the third driver to boast wins in both of Alberta's biggest cities in a single year. Chad was the first chuckwagon driver to win association and Calgary Stampede top rookie honors in a single year, the first driver to win the top rookie driver at the Calgary Stampede and go on to win the GMC Rangeland Derby Championship. He added the Bonnyville Chuckwagon Championship to his resume a year later in 2010. In addition to his success on the racetrack, two of Harden's horses have been honored with WPCA Equine Outfit of Excellence awards. On July 12, 2019, Chad Harden was involved in an incident at the Calgary Stampede chuckwagon races, along with racers Danny Ringuette and Evan Salmond, which resulted in the death of one of Salmond's horses. Harden received a preliminary fine of and a 30-second penalty. Upon further deliberation, the safety commission handling the investigation declared that Harden was at fault but that there was no deliberate intent to cause the incident. As a result of the investigation, Harden was disqualified from the 2019 Calgary Stampede races, leaving his barrel unoccupied on subsequent race nights. Fellow chuckwagon driver Corey Glenn stated that he saw the \\"corner get crowded and the wagons drift in\\" which caused \\"just a chain reaction of positioning\\" and did not believe it warranted a Stampede ban. Due to his disqualification, Harden will not be invited to return for future races at the Calgary Stampede; however, he is permitted to apply for reinstatement as early as September 1, 2019. ==Professional wins== Show wins - Driver (6) *2002 (1) Ponoka Stampede Champion *2009 (2) Calgary Stampede Rangeland Derby Champion Driver, Edmonton's Chuckwagon Derby *2010 (1) Bonnyville Chuckwagon Championship *2016 (1) Battle of the Rockies *2019 (1) Century Downs Racetrack and Casino Aggregate ==Awards== *WPCA Top Rookie Driver (2000) *Orville Strandquist Award (2001) *Chuckwagon Person of the Year (2006) *WPCA Equine Outfit of Excellence - \\"GRANVIEW\\" - Champion Outriding Horse (2009) *WPCA Equine Outfit of Excellence - \\"CRAFTY\\" - Champion Left Wheeler (2010) *Calgary Stampede Equine Outfit of Excellence - \\"WILD\\" - Champion Right Leader (2016) *Calgary Stampede Equine Outfit of Excellence - \\"ROBERT\\" - Champion Outriding Horse (2017) ==Personal life== Chad is a scout for the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League and was once the scout for the Kootenay Ice of the Western Hockey League.

Ataka opened its first US office in 1918 and had 39 overseas offices around the end of World War II in 1945. Like other Japanese trading companies, it embarked on a major overseas business expansion in the 1950s with new offices in the United States, Southeast Asia and South America. In the late 1950s it developed an iron mining operation in Malaya and a copper mining operation in Chile to meet Japanese consumption needs. Ataka suffered major losses from an oil development project in the United States around 1975, and underwent extensive business and personnel restructuring at the direction of its main lender, Sumitomo Bank. As a result of this restructuring, its profitable iron and steel trading operation merged into C. Itoh & Co. in 1977. Sumitomo lost nearly $1 billion in the Ataka restructuring, but claimed that a complete collapse of Ataka could have major repercussions on other Japanese trading companies and on the Japanese economy in general. The liquidation of Ataka, combined with the contemporaneous bailout of Mazda, had a major impact on Sumitomo's finances, driving it down from the most profitable bank in Japan to being only ninth-ranked. ==References== Category:Defunct companies of Japan Category:Trading companies of Japan Category:Itochu ","title":"Ataka &amp; Co."},{"id":"46337619","text":"Loretta Todd is a M√©tis Cree Canadian film director, producer, activist, storyteller, and writer.Silverman, Jason. \\"Uncommon Visions- The Films of Loretta Todd.\\" Senses of Cinema. October 2002. She belongs to what has been classified as the second wave of aboriginal Canadian film directors, and has been internationally recognized for her non-fiction work, which strives to express the lived experienced of aboriginal peoples and communities through their own voices.Library and Archives Canada. Celebrating Women's Achievements. September 2010. == Early life == Loretta was born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in the late 1950s. Todd's father, a member of both the M√©tis and Cree nations of Northern Alberta, held various jobs in order to support their eight children. Her mother was vibrant and loving. Loretta recalls a childhood filled with many family gatherings and various forms of artistic expression. Her experiences have also been shaped by her father's alcoholism and the poverty that their family experienced. Loretta left home at the age of twelve to set out on her own. She took on various jobs to support herself and became pregnant as a young teenager. She got in touch with her passions for writing and film-making while attending community college. In the late 1980s Todd's enrollment at Simon Fraser University's film school made her one of the first aboriginal woman to attend. For the first year she held a full-time job with the Canadian federal government while attending university, both her professional and student work centered around her passion for raising awareness about social inequalities that aboriginal communities face and social justice initiative that are aimed at improving the lived experiences for generations of aboriginal peoples to come.Dowell, Kristin L. \\"Sovereign Screen: Aboriginal Media on the Canadian West Coast.\\" University of Nebraska Press. 2013.

Murnau's 1922 horror classic Nosferatu at age seven, she said she \\"began to understand that filmmakers used the tools of storytellers, which appealed to my Cree love of craft.\\" The movies also offered Todd a sense of possibility and escape. She describes her childhood as filled with artmaking and storytelling, but marked by poverty and the alcoholism of her father (a subject she explored in her early short My Father's DTs). Todd left home at age 12 and during the next 10 years learned to support both herself and an infant daughter. At 18, Todd enrolled at a community college, where she quickly discovered her gifts as a writer, theorist and videomaker. Before she began her filmmaking career she worked for the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs as a researcher and writer for Youth, Health, and Social Development. Subsequent to that she worked as a program officer for the Employment and Immigration Commission and as a job re- entry coordinator for the Musqueam Indian Band. Her earliest films were My Dad's DTs, a 16 mm. experimental drama on adult children of alcoholics which she produced, wrote, and directed, Robes of Power,a video on ceremonial button robes, and a video installation entitled Red Road and Blue Neon. == Personal life == She is knowledgeable about her culture ‚Äì creating and producing an award-winning children‚Äôs series, Tansi! Nehiyawetan, that teaches kids to speak Cree, her father‚Äôs first language, as well as creating the first Cree language app, My Cree. One of her biggest influencers is Dr. Leroy Littlebear and his partner Amethyst Firstrider. == Career == Todd's film style actively challenges traditional documentary film form, since she recognizes how films she consumed while growing up, which were produced by the National Film Board of Canada, reproduced harmful racist stereotypes about aboriginal peoples. > \\"With the Canadian documentary I had grown up with, there was a lot of > stationary camera work, and as a Native person, I felt that the camera was > peering in at us- that the films offered a space that allowed people to > laugh at us.\\" \\"I would agree that the aesthetic definitely comes out of the > experience of being in the story. However, as much as I'm trying to find a > place to represent the story (the theme and the people who are a part of > that story), I'm at the same time very conscious of commenting on what that > story and their aesthetic mean to me. So I would have to say that I try to > find a place for my voice. That might make my documentary style not > different form anybody else's but definitely distinctly my own.\\" As she learned film theory and technique, her work became increasingly politically charged with an activist mindset. Todd engages with the film form in a way that allows her to bring light to problematic aspects of traditionally documentary style and the oppression that she has personally experienced and is part of the present reality for many aboriginal peoples within Canada. Todd's work seeks to shift the narrative about aboriginal peoples from a discourse of victim-hood and suffering, to resiliency and the ways in which individuals and communities are working to overcome the pain that is a result of systemic and continuous violence perpetrated against them. Todd is still actively involved with aboriginal activist work, even as her career has reached international acclaim she still directs minimal budget films for aboriginal groups. Todd has influenced the evolution of Vancouver as a hub of aboriginal film production. She has also served as a role model and mentor for other Canadian aboriginal women to join the industry. Her daughter Kamala Todd has chosen to pursue a career similar to her mother's, as a filmmaker, writer and activist. Todd is also a cultural scholar, writing scholarly articles and chapters for books, lecturing at educational institutions, contributing to art shows. While at Simon Fraser University in the late 1980s, Todd studied with theorist Kaja Silverman, experimental filmmaker Al Razutis and cinematographer John Houtman and soon began creating ambitious, formally innovative video installation works that reflected on her tribal identity and on the historical struggles of aboriginal peoples. One installation featured images projected onto Vancouver's Museum of Anthropology; with a long tracking shot, Todd set out to \\"liberate\\" sacred tribal objects entombed within. As a successful producer, she created Coyote‚Äôs Crazy Smart Science Show, a children's series about Indigenous science for the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, in Canada. As well, she created Fierce Girls, a web-series for tweens about Indigenous female superheroes who fight racism and confront homelessness and mental health issues. She is in post with her first feature film Monkey Beach, based on the novel by Eden Robinson. Loretta also recently launched the IM4 Lab, an Indigenous virtual reality Lab. Loretta says she wants to be aspirational for native youth. Within the native community and literature there are a lot of Indigenous futurisms, which is looking at the future through science, through science fiction, through literature and through art. However, often that world is very dystopic. She wants to empower them to have agency in their life to make change. That is the real basis for her work. == Themes == Social activism Racism Substance abuse Aboriginal activist work Social justice Storytelling Aboriginal narratives Feminism Indigenous women Indigenous superheros Cyberspace == Filmography == * Halfway House (1986), about a center for Native convicts released from prison. * Breaking Camp (1989) * Robes of Power (1989) * Blue Neon (1989) * The Storyteller in the City (1989) * My Dad's DTs (Unfinished narrative film) * Day Glo Wrestler (1990) * Eagle Run (1990) * The Healing Circle (1991) * Taking Care of Our Own (1991) * The Learning Path (1991) * Hands of History (1994) * Voice-Life (1995) * No More Secrets (1996) * Through the Lens: an Alternative Look at Filmmaking (1996) * Forgotten Warriors (1997) * Today is a Good Day (1999) * Kainayssini Imanistaisiwa: The People Go On (2003)Silverman, Jason. \\"Loretta Todd\\".

It merged with Taiyo Kobe Bank to form Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank (MTKB), which was renamed The Sakura Bank in April 1992. Sakura Bank is now part of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC). ==History== Historic Mitsui Bank/Teikoku Bank headquarters in Nihombashi, Tokyo The Mitsui family began banking operations in 1683, when the Tokugawa Shogunate granted Mitsui Takatoshi permission to act as a money changer. Mitsui Bank was established as a private company in July 1876, with capital of two million yen. It was one of the Japanese government's main banks for deposits and tax collections until the formation of the Bank of Japan in 1882. In ensuing decades, the Mitsui family took over numerous government industrial plants to form a major zaibatsu conglomerate, with the bank as one of its core businesses. Mitsui Bank reorganized as an unlimited partnership in 1893, and as a limited company (capital stock: ¬•20 million) in 1909. World War II World War II led Mitsui Bank to distance itself from the Mitsui zaibatsu beginning around 1937, as the bank's large balance of loans to munitions manufacturers made it vulnerable to failure should a recession occur after the war. The solution found by Mitsui's chairman was to merge the bank with the Dai-Ichi Bank, creating a much larger institution outside the Mitsui family's control. In April 1943, Mitsui Bank merged with Dai-Ichi to form Teikoku Bank (\\"Imperial Bank\\"). Teikoku almost immediately found itself short of funds, and for the remainder of the war, mainly provided short-term financing, with long- term financing for its munitions manufacturing customers mostly provided by the Industrial Bank of Japan. Dai-Ichi and Mitsui had very different corporate cultures which led to friction between the two; the two banks never completely integrated, and in October 1948, Dai-Ichi Bank separated from Teikoku Bank. Postwar era Former Mitsui Bank headquarters (1960-1990) in Yurakucho, Tokyo Teikoku Bank listed its shares on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges in May 1949 and changed its name back to Mitsui Bank in January 1954. Mitsui Bank merged with Toto Bank in April 1968. Around 1960, Mitsui Bank and its general trading company partner Mitsui & Co. formed a horizontal keiretsu alliance between other companies descended from the Mitsui conglomerate, including Toyota, Toshiba, Toyo Menka Kaisha, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, Showa Aircraft and Oji Paper. Mitsui established The Mitsui Bank of California in Los Angeles in 1974, and acquired Manufacturers Bank in 1981, merging the two later that year to form Mitsui Manufacturers Bank (renamed Manufacturers Bank in 1992). Mitsui Bank agreed to merge with Taiyo Kobe Bank in 1989. At the time (in the midst of the Japanese asset price bubble), the merger was to create the second largest bank in the world behind Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. While TKB had a strong base of individual and small business customers, Mitsui had a complementary base of larger institutional clients. The merger was aimed at leveraging these synergies, as well as providing stronger competition against European banks, which were expected to consolidate following a deregulation in 1992. ==References== Category:Defunct banks of Japan Category:Companies formerly listed on the London Stock Exchange Category:Companies formerly listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Category:Banks established in 1876 Category:Banks disestablished in 1990 Category:Japanese companies established in 1876 Category:Financial services companies based in Tokyo Category:Japanese companies disestablished in 1990 ","title":"Mitsui Bank"},{"id":"46337707","text":"The spider species Plebs eburnus is commonly referred to as the eastern grass orb-weaver or the eastern bush orb-weaver, and sometimes more simply as the bush orb-weaver. It is an orb-weaver spider from the family Araneidae endemic to Australia. It was previously classified as a member of the genus Araneus but has been reclassified in 2012 into a newly described genus Plebs. It is closely related to the Western Bush Orb-weaver, P. cyphoxis. It is a very common spider with distinctive white markings (although these marking can be quite variable), which give it the species name eburnus pertaining to ivory. It is found in scrub and tall grasses where the female constructs a vertical web usually no more than 2 metres from the ground, and stays there day and night. The web of some of these spiders has been seen to be decorated with nearly vertical stabilimentum (like a clockface at 5 minutes to 5 or its mirror image). The stabilimentum of P.cyphoxis is usually observed vertical (like a clockface at 6 o'clock). ==Distribution== Approximate range of P. eburnus created from field record locations in Joseph & Framenau 2012. P. eburnus can be found in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, Australian Capital Territory and South Australia. Some rare occurrences have been observed in Western Australia although this is not part of the typical range of this species. The ranges of this species and P. cyphoxis overlap in South Australia. ==Size and markings== On the underside of the abdomen, along with other members of the genus Plebs, there is a characteristic U-shaped white marking with two white spots either side of the spinnerets. The females, as with most spiders, are larger than the males and are around 8mm in length, compared to just 5mm in length for the males. ==References== Category:Araneidae Category:Spiders of Australia Category:Spiders described in 1886 ","title":"Plebs eburnus"},{"id":"46337709","text":"The sluice gates in the closed position The Delta Cross Channel is a facility in California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta that diverts water from the Sacramento River.

Sakura Bank is now part of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC). TKB was unique during its time in that it was a major commercial bank unaffiliated with a keiretsu group or a general trading company. ==History== The Bank of Kobe was established in Kobe in 1936 and became a major lender to the industrial sector in the Kobe region, as well as a major financier for the city of Kobe. It established several overseas offices in the 1950s and 1960s to support its municipal finance operations. Bank of Kobe merged with Taiyo Bank in 1973. Taiyo Bank was descended from Dai Nippon Mujin, a mutual savings and loan company established in 1940. It changed its name to Nippon Mujin in 1948 and to Nippon Sogo Bank in 1951 before adopting the Taiyo Bank name in 1968 in an attempt to project a more international image. The 1973 merger gave TKB the largest branch network of any Japanese bank. The bank grew consistently through the 1970s and 1980s and opened numerous overseas offices. TKB agreed to merge with Mitsui Bank in 1989. At the time (in the midst of the Japanese asset price bubble), the merger was to create the second largest bank in the world behind Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. While TKB had a strong base of individual and small business customers, Mitsui had a complementary base of larger institutional clients. The merger was aimed at leveraging these synergies, as well as providing stronger competition against European banks, which were expected to consolidate following a deregulation in 1992. ==References== Category:Defunct banks of Japan Category:Companies formerly listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Category:Banks disestablished in 1990 Category:Japanese companies disestablished in 1990 ","title":"Taiyo Kobe Bank"},{"id":"46337737","text":"Photographer, with Factory Butte in the background, 1996 Factory Butte is a summit in the Upper Blue Hills> in northern Wayne County, Utah, United States, about northwest of Hanksville and about east of Capitol Reef National Park boundary.

Provable fairness is a property that is impossible to achieve in a byzantine fault tolerant setting, and is best productized or integrated in hybrid blockchain and currency agnostic blockchains designed like Dragonchain's private-public architecture, in particular when scalability is required to process millions of transactions. Protocols tend to be blockchain agnostic, and in most cases can be added to protocols offering a set of standardized validators. In a provably fair gambling system, a player places bets on games offered by the service operator. The service operator will publish a method for verifying each transaction in the game. This is usually by using open source algorithms for random seed generation, hashing, and for the random number generator. Once a game has been played, the player can use these algorithms to test the game's response to his in-game decisions and evaluate the outcome by only using the published algorithms, the seeds, hashes, and the events which transpired during the game. In a contest system on hybrid blockchain Dragonchain, a future hash of Bitcoin and Ethereum that has not been created yet, combined with an algorithm anyone can execute themselves, a provably fair random selection and revealing occurs, which is near impossible to profitably manipulate, as it is backed by hundreds of millions of dollars worth of proof from decentralized blockchains that Interchain with Dragonchain. Other applications include fraud prevention and manipulation with predictable transactions on exchanges. The benefit of a provably fair system is that third-party verification and auditing is usually unnecessary. Results of bets for which the outcomes are mathematically predetermined are harder to scrutinize and thus the system can add a degree of trustworthiness to a gambling operation. It could also potentially expose the operator to hacking attempts if there are undisclosed security flaws in the open source software. ==References== Category:Gambling terminology Category:Online gambling Category:Blockchains ","title":"Provably fair algorithm"},{"id":"46338027","text":"Steele Butte is a summit in Garfield County, Utah, United States with an elevation of .

After the public listing of her company on the Shenzhen ChiNext market in March 2015, her net worth reached US$10 billion, making her the richest woman in China. In 2018, she was named the world's richest self-made woman, with a net worth of $9.8 billion. ==Early life== Zhou Qunfei was born in 1970 in Xiangxiang, Hunan province, China, the youngest of three children in a poor family. Before she was born, her father, a former soldier, became partially blinded and lost a finger in an industrial accident in the 1960s. A skilled craftsman, he supported the family by making bamboo baskets and chairs and repairing bicycles. Her mother died when she was five. As a child she helped her family raise animals for sustenance and small profit. Although she was the only one out of her siblings to attend secondary school and showed promise as a bright student, she dropped out at age 16 and moved in with her uncle's family to become a migrant worker in Shenzhen, the special economic zone in Guangdong province. While she briefly considered pursuing a government job for its stability, she discarded the idea as lacking a diploma would make it difficult to do so. In Shenzhen she deliberately chose to work for companies near Shenzhen University, so she could take part-time courses at the university. She studied many subjects and passed the examinations to be certified for accounting, computer operations, customs processing, and even became licensed for driving commercial vehicles. Her biggest regret is not having studied English. ==Career== Although she dreamed of being a fashion designer, Zhou found a job working for a small family-run firm making watch parts for about 180 yuan a month. Displeased with the working conditions, she decided to quit after three months and submitted a letter of resignation explaining her reasons, yet expressing gratitude for the working opportunity. The letter moved the factory chief to offer her a promotion instead. When the factory folded, she established her own company in 1993 at age 22, with her savings of HK$20,000 (~USD$3,000). It was her cousin who encouraged her to start on her own business, and the company began with her brother, sister, their spouses, and two cousins all working out of a three bedroom apartment. The company appealed to customers by promising higher- quality watch lenses. Here, Zhang took a hands on approach and involved herself in all parts of the company, including repairs and creating improved designs of factory machinery. In 2001, she caught her big break when her company won a profitable contract to make mobile phone screens for the Chinese electronics giant TCL Corporation. Zhou Qunfei has stated that over the years she has started a total of 11 companies. ==Lens Technology== Lens Technology in Liuyang, Hunan, China In 2003, while still producing watch faces, Zhou's company received a request from Motorola to develop glass screens for their Razr V3, during a period when the mobile phone industry was transitioning from plastic to glass display screens. Following this, Zhou Qunfei started touch- screen maker Lens Technology (named so that it would turn up to potential customers searching \\"lens\\" online) in 2003 and the company soon received orders from other mobile-phone makers such as HTC, Nokia, and Samsung Electronics. After producing the touch screens for Apple's iPhone during its 2007 market entry, Lens developed into the dominant player of the industry. Lens Technology now primarily supplies touch-screens to leading electronics makers such as Apple, Samsung, and Huawei, receiving nearly 75% of its revenue from Apple and Samsung. The Apple Watch uses her company's glass and sapphire crystal screens. As of 2017, the company employs about 90,000 people, was expected to churn out more than a billion glass screens, and has 32 different factory locations. On 18 March 2015, the 22nd anniversary of the founding of her first start-up, Lens Technology began trading on the ChiNext A-share market of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The company's stock price rose by the market's daily limit of 44% on the first day and 10% every subsequent day for 13 days in a row between 19 March and 2 April. This made Lens Technology China's largest technology IPO in the first quarter of 2015. ==Accomplishments== During Lens' 2015 IPO offering, Zhou's (who holds 87.9% of the shares, a $7.2 billion stake as of July 2015) net worth rose 452%, dethroning Chen Lihua as China's richest woman. She also holds the position of the world's richest self made woman, and is one of the richest women in the technology sector. Additionally, Zhou is on Forbes lists as #61 in 2016 Power Women, #205 in 2016 Billionaires (#9 out of Hong Kong billionaires), #18 in 2015 China Rich List, and #30 in 2015 Richest in Tech. Fortune ranked her #18 on their 2016 Most Powerful Women of Asia-Pacific list, and she is a newcomer to the list. Bloomberg has ranked her as #211 out of the world's billionaires. ==Personal life== Zhou Qunfei married her former factory boss, had a daughter, and divorced. Her daughter is currently studying overseas. In 2008, she married Zheng Junlong (), a longtime factory colleague who currently serves on the Lens board and has a 1.4% shareholding in the company. They have a seven- year-old son who lives at their Hong Kong family home. The family owns a $27 million estate in Hong Kong. Zhou has stated that although she considers work to be her hobby, she also enjoys mountain climbing and ping pong. Zhou Qunfei's rags-to-riches story has been hailed as an inspiration to the millions of migrant workers in China. In an interview with Gansu Television, she said the secret of her success was the desire to learn. ==References *Official website of Lens Technology *Hexun's reports on Zhou Qunfei Category:Businesspeople from Hunan Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese billionaires Category:Female billionaires Category:People from Xiangxiang Category:Chinese women company founders Category:Chinese computer businesspeople Category:21st-century Chinese businesswomen Category:Chinese technology company founders ","title":"Zhou Qunfei"},{"id":"46338203","text":"Camilla Lennarth (born 16 June 1988) is a Swedish professional golfer.

He was beatified on 17 September 2006 in Brescia. ==Biography== Mos√® Tovini was the eldest of eight children to Eugenio Tovini and Domenica Malaguzzi. His childhood education was spent in Breno and he would later move in with his uncle Giuseppe Antonio Tovini in Brescia at the age of nine in order to continue his studies. He had his First Communion on 14 November 1886 and felt a religious call to the priesthood at this time. His father opposed his desire to become a priest and enrolled him in high school in Bergamo where he was often bullied. He returned home and his father at last allowed him to follow his religious vocation. He moved back to his uncle and began his studies as a priest in Brescia. After the death of his uncle in 1897 he left his studies and enlisted in the Italian military where his personal piety had a profound effect on his fellow soldiers. He became a sergeant and was discharged from his duties on 31 October 1898. After this, he returned home and resumed his studies for the priesthood. This led to - at the age of 22 - his ordination on 9 June 1900. Tovini was sent to Rome to continue his studies and had degrees in mathematics, philosophy and theology by 1904. He returned to Brescia after this where he started teaching at the seminary, and later jointed the Congregation of Oblate Priests. Tovini later travelled to Rome, where he attained a degree in dogmatic theology. He received an exemption from the draft of World War I and he continued to teach in Brescia. He ministered to the sick during the Spanish flu epidemic and assisted veterans after the war who cut short their studies for the priesthood. He was also made the rector of the seminary in 1926, holding that post for the rest of his life. He continually emphasized a devotion to the Eucharist, the Blessed Virgin Mary and the pontiff as the pillars of a priestly life. ==Beatification== Tovini was praised for his holiness and it resulted in calls for his beatification. The formal introduction of his cause for sainthood came on 15 October 1981 and commenced on a diocesan level that spanned from 1981 to 1982. The Positio was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 1995. Pope John Paul II recognized that he had lived a life of heroic virtue and named him to be Venerable on 12 April 2003. The miracle required for his beatification was investigated on a local level before it was submitted to Rome. Pope Benedict XVI approved the miracle on 19 December 2005 and it led to the beatification on 17 September 2006. One final miracle is required for his canonization. ==References *Hagiography Circle *Saints SQPN Category:1877 births Category:1930 deaths Category:Italian beatified people Category:Beatifications by Pope Benedict XVI Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope John Paul II ","title":"Mos√® Tovini"},{"id":"46338448","text":"The Helsingborg Open was a women's professional golf tournament on the Ladies European Tour that took place in Sweden.

Another Billboard contributor, Matt Madved, also noted Guetta's influences, with Garrix \\"ditching harder-edged trappings of festival house for cheery guitar- backed verses and a softer melodic lead\\".

Built during the Great Depression for irrigation but also as an employment initiative, the water is used by farmers in the Ida Valley. ==Geography== The reservoir is located west of the Rough Ridge Range. Long Valley Creek feeds the reservoir, and the reservoir itself feeds the Pool Burn. The Pool Burn flows into the Ida Valley, combines with the Ida Burn, and breaks through the Raggedy Range as the Poolburn Gorge before flowing into the Manuherikia River. ==Access== There is access to Poolburn Reservoir from either Omakau in the Manuherikia Valley () or from Oturehua in the Ida Valley (). There is also access from Paerau over the Rock and Pillar Range (), but this is a dry- weather road only that can be negotiated by four-wheel drive only, and is not generally recommended. The high parts of the road are closed from early June to late September each year, and Poolburn Reservoir thus cannot be accessed by road during winter. The road from Paerau to the Ida Valley via Poolburn Reservoir is part of the Old Dunstan Road that gave gold diggers access to the gold fields during the early days of the Otago Gold Rush. The journey from Dunedin to the gold fields took five days. An alternative route to the gold fields starting in Palmerston was longer by but much easier to travel on, as it did cross any mountainous ranges or major rivers. This became the major wagon route and is today State Highway 85. With no major settlements along its way, much of the Old Dunstan Road was never fully formed, resulting in only seasonal access to Poolburn Reservoir. Since 2004, council staff fly in by helicopter to lock the mountainous roads each winter. ==History== A deputation went to see the Minister of Labour and Transport, Bill Veitch, in March 1929 with regards to a proposal for an irrigation dam for the benefit of Ida Valley farmers. The United Government approved the scheme by September of that year, partially as an employment initiative during the Great Depression, and charged the Department of Public Works with its construction and put ¬£71,823 into the 1930 budget. Preliminary work, including the construction of the access road from the Ida Valley, started in late 1929. The Minister of Public Works, William Taverner, reported in August 1930 that the excavation for the concrete arch dam had been filled to approximately ground level. Poolburn Reservoir was completed by late 1931. The reservoir is located on the Old Dunstan Road and the flooded area had five hotels. The concrete arch dam is about high and long at the dam's crest. Approximately of concrete were used to construct the dam. During construction, scaffolding collapsed resulting in seven men sustaining injuries, with two men initially in critical condition. In June 1931, one worker died from a fall at the site. Today, the dam is administered by the Ida Valley Irrigation Company. When full, the reservoir covers over . Poolburn Reservoir and Poolburn Dam are alternative names for the same body of water. ==Usage== Brown trout and rainbow trout were introduced into the reservoir, but only brown trout remain. The other aquatic species that can be caught is the New Zealand freshwater crayfish koura. Poolburn Reservoir was used to depict Rohan in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. There are many baches around the reservoir. An application to subdivide a land holding for housing was withdrawn just prior to the hearing, as the commissioner for the Central Otago District Council had recommended for consent to be refused. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Otago Category:Reservoirs in New Zealand Category:Lakes of Otago ","title":"Poolburn Reservoir"},{"id":"46338573","text":"The 2013 Northwest Missouri State Bearcats football team represented Northwest Missouri State University during the 2013 NCAA Division II football season.

He ministered in his hometown of Citt√† di Castello before Pope Pius X appointed him as the Bishop of Citt√† di Castello. Liviero was appointed after Giustino Sanchini, future bishop of Fano, declined this appointment in 1909. He received episcopal consecration on 6 March 1910 and his formal installation was on 27 June 1910. Liviero founded a school and libraries in his diocese and also established the La Voce del popolo magazine. After World War I he founded a hospice for war orphans and abandoned children.

In February 2013, the related company Uniregistrar Corporation became an ICANN-accredited registrar and launched under the licensed Uniregistry brand name in 2014. Uniregistry's acquisition by GoDaddy was announced in February 2020. ==History== Uniregistry Corporation was officially founded in 2012 by Frank Schilling, one of the largest private domain name portfolio owners in the world, and was registered in the Cayman Islands. However, the domain Uniregistry.com was registered six years earlier and the company filed an intent to use the name in the Cayman Islands in 2010. Trademark applications for the \\"Uniregistry\\" mark and its stylized \\"U\\" logo were filed in 2012. That year, Schilling invested $60 million and applied for 54 new top-level domains. Uniregistrar Corporation became an ICANN-accredited registrar in February 2013. In January 2014, Uniregistry Inc. became a subsidiary in Newport Beach, California to house a West Coast service and support team. The registrar began operating under the licensed Uniregistry brand name in 2014. Uniregistry's registry infrastructure was designed by Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) and Uniregistry subsequently purchased its infrastructure in 2013. Founder Frank Schilling In February 2014, the company launched its first two top-level domains, .sexy and .tattoo. That same month, Uniregistry reached a private agreement with Donuts whereby Uniregistry would own the extensions .audio and .juegos (\\"games\\", in Spanish) and Donuts would own .auction, .furniture, and .gratis. The two companies remain at odds over control of the top-level domain .shopping. Uniregistry won .click, .hosting, and .property in April 2014. The company launched the top-level domains .audio, .hiphop, and .juegos in September 2014. It acquired .flowers for an undisclosed amount that same month, beating out Donuts, Minds + Machines, and 1-800-Flowers. In November 2014, the registrar began accepting the cryptocurrency Topcoin to pay for domain name registrations, inbound transfers, and renewals across its extensions. The company released .click, .diet, .help, .hosting, and .property during the Thanksgiving holiday week in 2014. Uniregistry acquired .lol in January 2015, .mom in March, and .game in May 2015. Uniregistry launched .photo and .pics in April. In May 2015, the company and XYZ announced their joint operation of Cars Registry Limited, a company that would operate three top-level domains related to the automotive industry: .auto, .car, and .cars. Uniregistry had won .auto and .cars in 2014, while XYZ acquired .car from Google for an undisclosed amount in 2015. The company launched a new version of its registry website in August 2015. In September 2015, Uniregistry agreed to take over management of the extension .hiv and continue fundraising and raising awareness of HIV/AIDS. .hiv became the first open charitable top-level domain in 2014. Schilling has said of the extension: > By assuming the registry operations of .hiv, we are taking our core skills > and putting them at the service of one of the most urgent challenges of > humankind. The United Nations has reconfirmed the opportunities to end the > global AIDS epidemic within our lifetime. At Uniregistry, we want to be a > part of this ambitious endeavor.

NSN is a subsidiary of Uniregistry Corporation that sells the premium names in Uniregistry's top-level domains direct to consumers. It also sells the domain names it manages through the Uniregistry Market, which launched on June 16, 2015. The Uniregistry Market EPP extension is available to all Uniregistry-accredited registrars. As of September 24, 2014, more than 10,800 .blackfriday domains were registered, with 400 registered within the first day of general availability. NSN registered 10,000 .blackfriday domains in September 2014, along with 5,000 .hiphop domains. 500 .hiphop domains were registered prior to NSN's large purchase. 400 non-Uniregistry .christmas domains were registered on its first day of general availability. More than 10,000 .click domains were registered on the first day of general availability (outlets initially reported 3,800 registrations, but Schilling confirmed the higher figure). Uniregistry only held back single-character domain names. This strategy differs from the registry's previous launches in which Schilling's company registered thousands of domains. On April 15, 2014, the number of domains under Uniregistry's management increased by 50,735 after NSN registered large numbers of .gift, .link (19,945), .photo, .pics, .sexy and .tattoo domains. This increase caused the total number of generic top-level domains registered to pass the 500,000 threshold. More than 8,000 .photo and 4,000 .pics domains were registered by July 2014. As of April 2014, the extensions .link, .sexy, and .tattoo have been registered more than 20,000, 12,318, and 5,932 times, respectively, though these figures include Uniregistry's activated reserved domains. As of February 2015, .diet, .help, .hosting, and .property have been registered 14,596, 21,630, 11,609, and 38,464 times, respectively. The extensions were registered 787, 1,908, 1,197, and 1,490 times, respectively, on the first day of general availability; NSN later registered 13,268, 17,988, 9,329, and 35,991 domains, respectively. FTD purchased the domain Pro.flowers for $50,000 in 2015. ==Registrar services and tools== In 2015, the registrar surpassed 1.3 million domains under management. Bulk tools offered by the company include: \\"Domain Tracker\\" for monitoring domain expiration dates; two-step account verification for enhanced security; cloud storage for organizing domain attachments; and optional integration with DomainNameSales, which allows users to link their DNS and Uniregistry accounts.

It was designed in the 1810s chiefly by architect William Fuller Pocock, and the mid-rise, basemented houses fronting its two long sides, with slate mansard roofs are listed in the British protective and recognising scheme, and were built in the 1820s. The main stonemason employed was Lancelot Edward Wood after whom is named neighbouring street Lancelot Place (originally Petwin Place). ==Location== It is in the west of Knightbridge, north of Brompton Road, in Anglican terms it is in South Kensington but historically the parish near-equated to the detached part of St Margaret's Westminster, which explains the present borough.Parish maps by Grid Reference The Church of England. Accessed January 2020. The nearest public transit station is Knightsbridge tube station. ==History== The square was mainly detailed from 1810 by architect William Fuller Pocock and later, less so, by his son William Willmer Pocock.'Trevor Square Area: Development of the Estate', in Survey of London: Volume 45, Knightsbridge, ed. John Greenacombe (London, 2000), pp. 97-102 http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey- london/vol45/pp97-102 The blueprint was approved by fellow architect Philip Hardwick. Arthur Hill-Trevor, 3rd Viscount Dungannon agreed to demolish his Powis House in 1811 to make way for the new development. The first houses were completed in 1820; most of them were completed by 1827. In 1816, John Morison established the Trevor Chapel, later known as the Trevor Congregational Church on the corner of Lancelot Place. This closed in 1902 to be replaced by a Harrods showroom. By 1911, the minor, overarching legal interest (reversion) of the square's garden and any buildings enjoyed on long leases (by others) belonged to J. C. Humphreys. ==Layout and appearance== The square is open, at its north end, into a broad backstreet, Trevor Street, of similar house design and date, at an alike length as the square ending at a broad road then Hyde Park Barracks, London, which are set against Hyde Park. A corner house to an adjacent street, Trevor Place, Hill House reflects the Hill-Trevor land ownership before the square was built. On the south side a fractionally recessed block takes up a small tapering block of buildings (‚Ññs 17-18) indented by a rear parking access. The square has an outlying set of numbering to the west alongside this, a very large building known as ‚Ññs 19-22. The highest number is ‚Ññ 38, set across an access road on a north-west corner. The fronts of both very dominant (vast bulk of the rectangle) sides have with light-painted, quasi stone-clad in ashlar blocks (rusticated) lower floors and yellow- or brown- brick upper floors. Decoration is given by black railings, broad steps, arched doorways, panelled sash windows in recessed, quite heavy white frames, window boxes, and entrance-floor-matching under-painted balconies supporting small mediterranean-style trees, among other classically graceful features. The gardens (at centre) are a private, communal, planted contrast to the skirting, backstreet road. ==Listed buildings== All of the long sides (‚Ññs 1-16 and 23-38) are listed Grade II (that is, in the initial mainstream category) on the National Heritage List for England, giving statutory protection and recognition for architecture and/or age. ==References *Trevor Square at London Gardens Online Category:Knightsbridge Category:Squares in the City of Westminster Category:Communal gardens Category:Garden squares in London ","title":"Trevor Square"},{"id":"46338621","text":"MYX is the only music channel in the Philippines that shows different music videos, domestically and internationally.

The facility is owned and operated by Wolverine Human Services, and is a part of the Saginaw Intermediate School District. ==Services and programs== The Wolverine Secure Treatment Center is a secure residential behavior treatment program for males ages 12‚Äì21. Programming includes individual, group and family counseling, psychiatric and psychological services, sex offender treatment, substance abuse treatment, crisis intervention, life skills assessment, restorative justice techniques, and trauma informed services. Educational programming is provided by Wolverine Academy and includes high school completion, General Educational Development (GED), vocational education, and college classes provided by Delta College and Saginaw Valley State University. Participants in the reintegration program use an on-site apartment space to learn home skills, such as cooking and cleaning. Participants begin in the intake, orientation, and diagnostic unit. There, they are assessed and it is determined which specialized treatment program the participant will be placed in. ==Facility== The Wolverine Secure Treatment Center facility is nearly and is secured by a perimeter fence. An audio and video surveillance is operated by a master control office in the front of the facility, and allows the facility's security to operate secure doors. The facility comprises ten units which each house ten individuals, providing the facility with a capacity of 100 participants. Each unit includes one classroom. There is also a indoor multipurpose facility area that includes two basketball courts, boxing ring, ping-pong tables, and volleyball court. ==History== The Wolverine Secure Treatment Center opened in September 1997, becoming the first privately owned and operated secure detention facility for juvenile offenders in Michigan. As of 2009, the facility had served young people from 55 of Michigan's 83 counties. Until the end of the 2011‚Äì2012 school year, educational services were provided by the Buena Vista School District. In June 2012, the center ended its contract with the district. However, the district received $400,000 in the 2012‚Äì2013 school year for educating 90 students at Wolverine Center, despite its contract with the center having expired at the end of the 2011‚Äì2012 school year. On May 1, 2013, the Buena Vista School District announced that it would not receive state aid for April, May or June in order to repay the Wolverine Secure Treatment Center funding the district received after their contract with the center had expired. Starting in the 2012‚Äì2013 school year, the center became a charter school under Saginaw Valley State University. In 2015, the Tuscola Intermediate School District took over the school and is now called Wolverine Education Center. The school educates approximately 100 students at a time with small, personalized classroom format. ==References * Category:Private middle schools in Michigan Category:Private high schools in Michigan Category:Charter schools in Michigan Category:Schools in Saginaw County, Michigan Category:Saginaw Intermediate School District Category:Juvenile detention centers in the United States Category:1997 establishments in Michigan Category:Educational institutions established in 1997 ","title":"Wolverine Secure Treatment Center"},{"id":"46338670","text":"National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka(NCE) is one of the leading business chambers in Sri Lanka which exclusively serves Sri Lankan exporters. ==See also== * Ceylon Chamber of Commerce ==References * Official Website Category:Chambers of commerce Category:1986 establishments in Sri Lanka Category:Organisations based in Colombo Category:Organizations established in 1986 Category:Foreign trade of Sri Lanka Category:Trade associations based in Sri Lanka ","title":"National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka"},{"id":"46338708","text":"The Cornhusker States Games is the state games of Nebraska.

He has done pioneering work on prosthetics, especially on titanium devices. Al Muderis was born in Iraq and became a surgeon under the regime of Saddam Hussein. He was a medical student in Basra at the start of the Gulf War. As a junior surgeon, he fled from Iraq following an incident in which he refused to mutilate the ears of army deserters. He traveled through Indonesia and Malaysia and reached Australia where he was kept in at the Curtin Detention Centre. He was released after 10 months and carried on his career in medicine, eventually specialising in osseointegration surgery. Al Muderis wrote the book Walking Free on his experiences in Iraq and in the Australian immigration detention system, and on his career in Australia. He is a patron of the Asylum Seekers Centre, a not- for-profit that provides personal and practical support to people seeking asylum in Australia.https://asylumseekerscentre.org.au/about-us/patrons/ == Early life == Munjed Al Muderis was born under the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. His father was a former Supreme Court judge and had authority in the Marine Corps, while his uncle was a descendant of the second royal family and Prime Minister, back when Iraq was still a kingdom. His mother was a school principal who had been demoted for refusing to join the Baath Party. Al Muderis graduated from Baghdad College High School in 1991, where he was a classmate of Qusay Hussein. He went on to study medicine at various universities, including the Baghdad University from 1991 to 1997, graduating with a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery. At the beginning of the Gulf War he was a second year medical student in Basra. He fled the city in the early days of the war, returning later to see the aftermath of the Basra uprising. In 1999, he was forced to flee Iraq when he was working as a junior surgeon at Saddam Hussein Medical Centre in Baghdad. A busload of army draft evaders were brought into the hospital for the top of their ears to be amputated under Saddam Hussein's orders. The senior surgeon in the operating theatre refused the orders and was immediately interrogated and shot in front of several medical staff. Instead of complying with the orders, Al Muderis decided to flee. He escaped the operating theatre and hid in the female toilets for five hours. Shortly after, he fled to Jordan before the authorities caught up with him and moved on to Kuala Lumpur. From there, he took a people-smuggling route to Christmas Island, where he was sent to Curtin Detention Centre. He was detained there until his identity was verified, given the number 982. He was punished with solitary confinement and was repeatedly told to go back where he came from after fellow detainees who caused riots blamed him. In 10 months after being sent to the detention centre, he was granted refugee status and freed. Upon release, he only landed a job at Mildura Base Hospital as an emergency unit and orthopaedic resident after sending out more than 100 resumes. A year later, he moved to the Austin Hospital in Melbourne and travelled to many different countries, completing specialisation fellowships and attending short-term courses. == Osseointegration == Al Muderis developed the new generation of implant, osseointegration prosthetic limb (OPL), which addresses several issues previously faced by patients. This led Orthopedics This WeekOrthopedics This Week to praise Al Muderis's work as 'The Most Incredible Orthopedics You'll Ever Read About.' The Osseointegration Group of Australia Team (OGAP) is made up of specialists in various fields. Women's Weekly and NEWS rank Al Muderis as one of the world's top osseointegration surgeons. Traditional and rigid socket based technology is now replaced with a surgery that inserts a titanium implant into the bone. Osseoperception occurs as the prosthetic is anchored directly to the bone which would transmit sensory signals, resulting in patients recovering a certain level of feeling. The implant's surface is also made of highly porous titanium, providing the user with balance and allowing for ingrowth of bone. A dual adaptor is designed with a smooth surface to minimise friction and coated with titanium niobium for antibacterial purposes. The adaptor is fixed to a control device and is connected to the exterior of the prosthetic limb. Putting on and taking off the limb can be done in less than ten seconds. Osseointegration surgery aims to provide amputees with greater mobility and reduced discomfort. Al Muderis is spreading the word to make the technology available globally. Patients travel from around the world to see him for this groundbreaking surgery. == Career == Al Muderis was a first year resident at Saddam Hussein Medical Centre in Baghdad before he fled Iraq and his career was disrupted. In Australia, he first worked at Mildura Base Hospital as an emergency unit and orthopaedic resident. He moved to Melbourne four months later and worked at Austin Repatriation Hospital as a surgical registrar, followed by a year at Canberra Hospital. In 2004, he joined the Australian Orthopaedic Training Program. In 2008, he attained his surgical fellowship, FRACS (Orth). He completed the following post specialisation fellowships: *Fellowship in Lower Limb Arthroplasty at the Sydney Adventist and Baulkham Hills Hospitals, Australia *Fellowship in Hip and Knee Arthroplasty with Prof. Dr. Med Jorg Scholz at the Emil Von Behring Hospital, Germany *Trauma Fellowship with Prof. Dr. Med. Axel Ekkernkamp at the Unfallkrankenhaus Berlin, Germany *Robotic leg surgery post-specialisation training with Dr Horst Aschoff at Lubeck, Germany Al Muderis is a supervisor of the Australian Orthopaedic Trainee Registrar at the above-mentioned medical centres, and is a supervisor of overseas trained orthopaedic surgeons (Fellows) in hip and knee pathology. In 2010, Al Muderis commenced his private practice. He is an orthopaedic surgeon and treats his patients at Macquarie University, Bella Vista, Drummoyne and Sydney Adventist Hospital clinics. He is also appointed as an adjunct clinical associate professor in the School of Medicine, Sydney Campus at the University of Notre Dame Australia and a clinical lecturer at Macquarie University Hospital and the Australian School of Advanced Medicine. He also has appointments at the Sydney Adventist Hospital and Norwest Private Hospital. He is a fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and the Australian Orthopaedic Association. He is also the founder of the Osseointegration Group of Australia. As an Australian orthopaedic surgeon, he specialises in hip, knee, trauma and osseointegration surgery, focusing in hip arthroscopy, resurfacing, arthroplasty, knee arthroplasty and reconstruction of recurrent patellar dislocations. Al Muderis chaired the 2015 Osseointegration Conference and was a guest speaker at Australian Orthotic Prosthetist Association Meeting. Al Muderis has been recognised by Queen Elizabeth II for his work with British soldier Michael Swain. He was invited by Queen Elizabeth II to attend the ceremony in which Swain received his MBE medal. He also caught the attention of Prince Harry of Wales, who visited Al Muderis on 7 May 2015 to follow up on Al Muderis' work and meet some of the amputees he has helped, including a decorated British soldier who lost his legs in Afghanistan who was undergoing groundbreaking treatment to fit prosthetic legs at Macquarie University Hospital. Prince Harry was amazed by the work Al Muderis and his team are doing, and believes the life changing surgery is \\"the way forward for single amputees or double amputees above the knee\\". Prince Harry is keen to get Al Muderis to the UK for an extended period of time to make the procedure available to British ex-servicemen injured in combat. Al Muderis is hopeful that the popular royal's profile will give the procedure more exposure, and that as it becomes more well known this technology will become more available to the common day to day person. Al Muderis has connected prosthetic limbs to dozens of UK soldiers. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is spending ¬£2m on trials that will begin in 2016 and involve 20 amputees who will receive Dr Al Muderis' osseointegration procedure. Al Muderis has trained five British surgeons and together they will perform the surgeries and monitor those 20 cases for two years. A similar project is in the works for Canada and Houston, Texas. Al Muderis has presented and published numerous research reports on osseointegration surgery for amputees, how to measure growth rate in children, limited incision plating technique in management of clavicle fracture and describing new patterns of distal clavicle fractures dislocation. He has written two books about his life and experiences, the first in 2014, called Walking Free, and later in 2019 \\"Going Back\\" published by Allen and Unwin.

The movie is inspired by Basu Chatterjee's classic Shaukeen. ==Plot== Kay Raav Tumhi revolves around three friends in their 60s and a young couple. The theme and the plot of the story carries the main crux of its treatment. It depicts the way how the things can change when one unexpected turn comes in between events, and how fantasies and plans come to an end in a totally satirical form. It deals with saucy humor, and plots which change form according to the situation. The plot also shows how various literates of the society (landlord, captain, doctor) plan events according to their fun and need, and how they fall prey to their own planning. The humor involved also has various double meanings, saucy comments which are enjoyable only according to the situation. The treatment is simple yet the situation confuses the characters, who from within are somewhat unaware of what is actually in store for them, and are mentally prepared according to their smartly made small fun cum plan, the events that occur in the life of the protagonists, and that keeps them unaware of the reality. As they slowly come to know the reality, and how they fall prey to their own plan, they realize but laugh it off. They also pass somewhat weird comments at each other just to prove their own selves right, which in reality does not happen and they have to accept the fact that some one else can also be much more smarter than them in doing plannings and making them face the reality, where earlier they think that people around them are good but not the best, it then dawns upon them later that they are best than them too. The story finally shows the mental state of the smarties when their lie comes to an end and they are caught in a cat and mouse situation, where they feel awkward, funny, but great after all the ruckus comes to an end and the confusing situation that was seeming to them as difficult to handle, also takes a clear and a happy turn, and then they realize the value of some who are actually true but only to set a right track for people like them they timely turn their true self and not for any wrong intention, the satire of the whole story then takes a pleasing and a final turn. == Cast == * Yatin Karyekar * Satish Pulekar * Ravindra Mahajan * Niyati Joshi * Hemant Dhome ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack of Kaay Raav Tumhi was composed by Kanakraj. {  - !

Her film, a comedy about three senior citizens and their pursuit of a girl, has already released at various theatres across the state. Director Patil told Mirror, \\"We wanted to screen Kay Rao Tumhi at City Pride Kothrud, and have been pursuing this issue for two weeks. Authorities there refused to entertain our queries or give us any slots. Hence, I personally visited City Pride Kothrud to request them to screen my film, which is when the multiplex chain owner, Hrishikesh Chaphalkar, told me that the film is 'vulgar' and they don't wish to show it. The City Pride management is not a censor board ‚Äî they have no authority to rate a film. When I said this, the owner misbehaved with me and used abusive language.\\" However, Chaphalkar dismissed the claims, saying, \\"Our multiplex is known for promoting Marathi movies. We always encourage Marathi filmmakers. I was out of station and don't know who used abusive language.\\" Patil filed the complaint at Erandwane police station on Tuesday, and says she is going to send a letter to the state's Cultural Ministry, detailing how City Pride is discriminating against Marathi films. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government's decision to make it mandatory for state multiplexes to screen at least one Marathi film in primetime slots was announced by state culture minister Vinod Tawde, who disclosed on Tuesday, \\"We are in the process of enacting a law to make it mandatory for multiplexes to screen Marathi movies from 6-9 pm.\\" The decision was hailed by several filmmakers from the Marathi film fraternity, who agreed that they have been facing problems trying to avail of precious screening slots in prominent theatres ‚Äî at the same time, they back the City Pride multiplex chain, saying it is quite a hub for Marathi film screenings. Said filmmaker Shrirang Godbole, director of the Indian Magic Eye production house that recently released films like Chintoo, \\"We often face this problem. The state government's decision is a good one, and will definitely encourage filmmakers. I cannot comment about today's incident at City Pride ‚Äî personally, I have always had a very good experience with their multiplexes. Chaphalkar always supports Marathi films.\\" Added well-known actor-director Girish Kulkarni, who has been seen in hits like Deool, Valu and Gabhricha Paus, \\"Despite an overwhelming response from the public, several Marathi films have been relegated to the background when it comes to preferred screening time slots. A push from the government was necessary to tackle such discrimination. We welcome this decision. As for City Pride, it is a hub for Marathi films, and we have always received support from them. I think there must have been some sort of miscommunication in this case. I doubt Chaphalkar would use abusive language with a Marathi filmmaker.\\"http://www.punemirror.in/pune/civic/Marathi-film-but-no- screen/articleshow/46841885.cms Producer-director Mrunalinni Patil's Marathi film Kaay Raav Tumhi has become the first beneficiary of the state government's recent controversial move of ordering multiplexes to reserve the a dedicated slot for Marathi films. The rom-com, which was turned down by many chains and released only in single screens last week, is now playing at all the prominent screens in the city. While the jury is still out on whether the step is an unfair move, the audience will definitely get to see more Marathi titles in their favourite multiplex.http://www.mumbaimirror.com/entertainment/bollywood/Sample- this/articleshow/46869955.cms ==Production== Development Mrunalinni Patil‚Äôs Kaay Raav Tumhi will take you on a joyride with three veteran actors Ashok Kumar, Utpal Dutt and AK Hangal enjoyed in Basu Chatterjee‚Äôs classic Shaukeen. \\"Directors like Basu Chatterjee, Hrishikesh Mukherjee and their genre of cinema has had a great influence on my mind since I was a child. I wanted to share a fragment of their illustrious work with the Marathi audience and hence decided to make this film,\\" said Mrunali. She further added, \\"Kaay Raav Tumhi will not be exactly the same as Shaukeen but will be on similar lines. I will be incorporating a few changes in the script to make it suitable to the present times.\\" The details of the cast are not revealed yet and it will be interesting to see who will portray the fun characters in the Marathi outing. While RD Burman composed music for the original, popular music director Kanak Raj will compose the music for the movie‚Äôs Marathi version.http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/is-marathi-movie-kaay-raav- tumhi-inspired-by-basu-chatterjee-shaukeen/ == References == Category:2015 films Category:Indian films Category:Marathi-language films Category:Marathi remakes of Hindi films Category:2010s Marathi-language films ","title":"Kaay Raav Tumhi"},{"id":"46338798","text":"I Saw Ramallah is an Arabic language autobiographical book written by Palestinian writer and poet Mourid Barghouti.

Farfanes (sing. farfan) is the name given to a class of soldiers hailing mostly from the Christian Iberian kingdoms in the later Middle Ages fighting as mercenaries for the various Muslim dynasties of the Western Mediterranean.The Papacy and Christian Mercenaries of Thirteenth-Century North Africa, by Michael Lower; published in Speculum, Volume 89 / Issue 03 / July 2014, pp 601-631; doi: 10.1017/S0038713414000761; retrieved May 7, 2015 Farfanes fought following the European fashion, in dense formations of heavily armed men either on horseback or on foot under the command of a Christian European officer, the qadi. The phenomenon came to an end when the Christian mercenaries were repatriated in the 15th century. The patronym Farf√°n is still relatively common in 21st- century Spanish-speaking countries and may be linked to these families which came back from the Maghreb. ==Etymology== The origin of the word \\"farfan\\" is unclear, but it may be cognate with the Arabic word farkhan meaning bird. A hypothesis is that this word was commonly given to vagabonds in the Maghreb who were regarded as migratory like the birds. By extension, the word farkhan came to refer in the vernacular language to bastards, criminals, and outcasts. ==Origins== The use of foreign mercenaries was widespread in the medieval Mediterranean world and mercenary units were common in Muslim, Byzantine and papal armies. Muslim armies, in particular, relied regularly on non-Muslim or recently islamicized warriors such as sub-Saharian Africans or Turks. The existence of the farfanes is thus in no way exceptional. However, the actual origins of the farfan units remain undetermined. Three scenarios are usually mentioned by historians (which are not mutually exclusive). The farfans may be a simple continuation of the complex game of alliance that was common in 10th- century Iberia. Muslim leaders commonly used units lent to them by their Christian allies or formed their own units with individual exiled from Christian lands. This sort of agreements is well-known due to the fame of El Cid, but it seems to have been widespread in al-Andalus and it is possible that this habit simply passed on to the other side of the Mediterranean in the 12th century. According to another theory, the farfan units in North Africa were originally Christian slaves and prisoners of war held by the Almoravid dynasty after its successful offensives against the Christians in Iberia. Units made out entirely of slaves or of recently freed men were relatively common both in North Africa and in al-Andalus so this theory of the origin of the farfan fits in an observable pattern. The history of Reverter de La Guardia, a Catalan nobleman who had been captured by the Almoravid army on a Spanish battlefield in the 1120s is one of the earliest examples of a Christian mercenary fighting in North Africa and it would support this scenario. The third theory is related to the deportation in mass of the Mozarab Christian of al-Andalus to North Africa, in 1126, by the Almoravids. Once in the hostile Maghrebi environment, the Mozarabs would have had few other choices but to seek the support of the Almoravid power and to enter as soldiers in their armies. This alternative fits with the tribal designation of the farfans sometimes called Banu Farfan in the sources. ==Famous farfanes== *Pedro Ruiz de Azagra *Reverter de La Guardia *√Ålvaro N√∫√±ez de Lara *Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar, (El Cid) *Alonso P√©rez de Guzm√°n, el Bueno *Enrique de Castilla *Guillermo de Moncada *Raymundo de Garriga *Raymond du Busquet *Federico Lancia *Fadrique de Castilla *Guillermo-Raymundo de Moncada *Napoleon de Arag√≥n *Federico di Sicilia *Guglielmo Morchio *Guillermo Galcer√°n *Berenger de Cardona *Jaume Garics *Guerau de Queralt *Lodorico Alvares *Andreuccio Cibo *Guglielmo Cibo *Alvero Benisituf *Anton Navara ==References== Category:History of Al-Andalus Category:Medieval Morocco Category:Medieval Algeria Category:Ifriqiya Category:Military history of Spain Category:Military history of Portugal Category:Spanish mercenaries Category:Mercenary units and formations of the Middle Ages Category:Reconquista ","title":"Farfanes"},{"id":"46338945","text":"FOSCO International School (FIS) is an international school located in District 3 of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

The later versions of CICS offered many advantages over previous versions yet tens of thousands of application programs were effectively locked out of the new version unless they were prepared to operate two completely different versions of CICS on the same Operating Systems, creating both operational and maintenance problems. Two different, simultaneous, CICS Licenses were also required. ==History== When CICS was first released by IBM in the late 1960s, it used IBM Assembler macros to generate the API system calls to the CICS teleprocessing monitor kernel. This was also true even if programs were written in COBOL or PL/1. Ken Dakin an independent programmer and CEO of APT Ltd. in the U.K., realized that by creating a middleware product, the problem could be solved for almost all situations. Ken Dakin approached IBM to market his product but received no interest at the time, despite the fact that tens of thousands of their clients application programs would need to be converted or rewritten for the new versions of CICS, costing many millions of dollars. ==Macro level emulation== Command-CICS intercepted macro level applications via a Link-edited (static) \\"stub\\" positioned ahead of the Load module (MVS) or Phase (DOS/VSE). On gaining control from the CICS Program Control Program (PCP), a \\"pseudo macro level\\" environment was established consisting of a pointer to a (unique) pseudo \\"Common System Area\\" (CSA), a pointer to a Transaction Control Area plus Transaction Work Area (TCA+TWA) and a pseudo Terminal Control Terminal Entry (TCTTE) and other artifacts of a macro level environment. Before passing control directly to the original program entry point, Command-CICS set up the actual general purpose registers, R13 and R12 to point to the pseudo control blocks. The CSA was the principal control block holding pointers to the CICS kernel programs (File Control Program, Storage Control Program etc.) in a real macro level CICS environment. The Command-CICS CSA had alternative pointers to Command-CICS entry points instead. It was possible to use CEDF to debug the application program calls when Command-CICS was used. ==Macro interface== The application program proceeded to execute normal machine code instructions right up to its first macro level API call, thus adding zero overhead to the program until that point. As soon as the API call left the application program, Command-CICS code would gain control and replace the original linkage with its own, equivalent, Command-level call. In original earlier command level CICS versions (that supported both Macro and Command level programs), the CICS \\"Exec Interface Program\\" (DFHEIP) converted the Command level call to an 'actual macro level call. This would add a very small additional overhead only during CICS calls. Later versions of CICS, however, executed the CICS API directly, imposing no additional \\"backward compatibility\\" overhead. ==Marketing== Command-CICS was initially sold by APT Ltd in the U.K. and APT International in mainland Europe and the rest of the world. At the present time CommandCICS is being offered by Advanced Software Products Group, Inc. of Naples, Florida, United States ==Competition== CICS/COMET for z/OS - a similar product from UNICOM Systems Inc. Adds some overhead (because of the requirement to dynamically add a stub). ==References * IBM webpage Command/CICS with link to UNICOM webpage * ASPG webpage *IBM CICS official website CICS official website Category:IBM mainframe software Category:System software Category:Virtualization software ","title":"Command CICS"},{"id":"46339045","text":"Punya Prasun Bajpai is an Indian journalist.

In July 2018, the channel elicited criticism from the government for its story about a video interaction on June 20, 2018, between Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi and beneficiaries of various government programmes. A participant from Chhattisgarh, Chandramani Kaushik, told Modi on the show that her income had doubled after she switched from cultivating paddy to growing custard apples. Two weeks later, based on reports from ABP News journalists who later visited Kaushik to verify the claim, Masterstroke revealed that she had been tutored by BJP officials to make false claims. Following this, ABP News' satellite link started misbehaving during the airing of Bajpai's show. In an article written by Bajpai for The Wire, he claims that some advertisers, including Patanjali, withdrew their advertisements from the channel. Under this pressure, Bajpai was forced to resign from the channel. In March, 2014 in a leaked video of interview with Arvind Kejriwal, Punya Prasun Bajpai was seen getting instructions from Arvind Kejriwal on promoting his interview by comparing his resignation to the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh and dropping a certain portion of interview on privatization of industries which would portray him anti-middle class. Later, when the interview was telecasted it was found that Punya Prasun Bajpai had actually complied to the instructions and raised questions on his journalistic integrity and ethics. This controversy was called \\"media fixing\\" at that time. == See also == * Shamsher Singh * Arnab Goswami * Sudhir Chaudhary ==References * prasunbajpai.itzmyblog.com * * Category:Living people Category:Indian male television journalists Category:India Today Group Category:Indian bloggers Category:1963 births Category:Male bloggers ","title":"Punya Prasun Bajpai"},{"id":"46339062","text":"Ward No. 29, Kolkata Municipal Corporation is an administrative division of Kolkata Municipal Corporation in Borough No. 3, covering parts of Narkeldanga neighbourhood in North Kolkata, in the Indian state of West Bengal. ==History== Attempts were made to establish a municipal corporation at Kolkata from the middle of the 19th century. The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) ‚Äì 1. Shyampukur, 2.

In the Tamarite de Litera sector, where the 3rd Mixed Brigade was sent in March 1938, many of its members lost their lives. Map of Spain after the Francoist victory in Aragon. The 3rd Mixed Brigade became one of the units locked in Catalonia and isolated from the remaining Republican territory. The 3rd Mixed Brigade (), was one of the earliest mixed brigades of the Spanish Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War. It was formed in the fall of 1936 with battalions of the Carabineros corps and saw major action right away in the Defence of Madrid. This brigade also included female combatants ‚Äîsuch as Sergeant \\"La Chata\\"‚Äî and would take part in most of the major battles of the Spanish Civil War, except in the Battle of Jarama.

It began front line combat while still not fully formed, with a total of about 2,500 men. The same day of its baptism of fire the brigade was able to repel a rebel faction attack at Retamares. After a week more troops were added to the brigade, until reaching a total of 3,225. While at the Cantonment zone the brigade staged a counterattack that was a failure. On 26 November 1936 the Third Mixed Brigade was sent to the Ciudad Universitaria frontline. and on 29 November it was able to repel an attack in the Pozuelo sector, where it suffered numerous casualties, including its commander Jos√© Mar√≠a Gal√°n, who was wounded in the combats and had to be replaced by Carabineros Captain Emeterio Jarillo Orgaz, who had been Lieutenant at the 6th Comandancia in Alicante Province at the time of the 1936 coup of the pro- Fascist generals. The much-battered brigade was then removed from the front line of the battlefield in order to be rebuilt, following which it was sent to the Andalusian front. On 26 December it arrived to And√∫jar, where it took positions in the Madrid - C√°diz highway. However, the situation at the Madrid Front was so critical that the brigade was recalled to Madrid on 3 January 1937. The brigade arrived to the Madrid rearguard on 7 January and was kept back in reserve until 11 January when it was sent to the V√©rtice Cumbre on the road to Villanuesa del Pardillo. From there it launched an unsuccessful attack in Las Rozas. On 23 March Cavalry Captain Joaqu√≠n de Zulueta Isasi assumed command of the Third Mixed Brigade and the unit was made part of the 10th Division which was led by the brigade's former commander Jos√© Mar√≠a Gal√°n. The 10th Division belonged to the V Army Corps of the Central Army (Ej√©rcito del Centro) Since it was committed to the Madrid Front, the 3rd Mixed Brigade did not take part in the Battle of Jarama, but it fought at the Battle of Guadalajara in the Pico del Cuervo sector in May 1937 and in June 1937 it was dispatched to La Granja, the scenario of one of the battles of the Segovia Offensive. Prior to being sent the brigade was concentrated at Fuencarral and Militia Major Antonio P√©rez Quijano became the new commander, replacing Captain Zulueta. The brigade took part in this battle in support of the 69th Mixed Brigade in its effort to capture the Alto del Le√≥n on 30 Mayo and the Cabeza Grande Hill on 2 June. Finally, on 4 June the 3rd Mixed Brigade was withdrawn to Fuencarral. Later battles and demise of the brigade Almost without time to rest, the 3rd Mixed Brigade was ordered to get ready for the Battle of Brunete. Initially it left to become part of the reserve, but it soon saw itself involved in severe vanguard combats. On 10 July it occupied the V√©rtice Mocha position, only to lose it soon thereafter. The following day the unit attacked Villafranca del Castillo, but with lack of thrust, so the brigade held to its positions until 20 July when the attack went badly and one of its battalions unjustifiably lost crucial positions in hills 660 and 640 to the enemy. Owing to this failure Major P√©rez Quijano was removed from his post and replaced by Carabineros Commander Agust√≠n Colomina Solera. On 24 July the 3rd Mixed Brigade retreated to the right bank of the Aulencia River. On 4 August 1937 the brigade was moved again to the Andalusian Front, becoming part of the 34th Division of the XVIII Army Corps of the Southern Army (Ej√©rcito del Sur) and Commander Colomina was replaced by Carabineros Commander Antonio Mart√≠nez Rabad√°n. When the Aragon Offensive was underway and going badly for the loyalist armies, the 3rd Mixed Brigade was urgently dispatched to Aragon around mid March 1938 as a reserve for the Ebro Army (Ej√©rcito del Ebro). However, in the face of the magnitude of the Francoist operation and the general crumbling of the front, the 3rd Mixed Brigade was then urgently sent eastward to a front line position, being made part of the X Army Corps of the Eastern Army (Ej√©rcito del Este). Its mission was to defend the sector between Tamarite de Litera and Vi√±aza Hill (V√©rtice Vi√±aza), but it was not able to bear the Francoist onslaught and the brigade suffered a great loss of lives during the last-ditch withdrawal. By 6 April the rebel victory in Aragon had cut the territory of the Spanish Republic in two and the survivors of the much depleted 3rd Mixed Brigade were evacuated for a rest to the Coastal Defence in Catalonia. Then the unit went back inland to Bellv√≠s where they camped for a time in order for the brigade to be rebuilt. The Republican high command assigned the reassembled mixed brigade to the 56th Division of the XII Army Corps, under the Group of Eastern Region Armies. Infantry Commander Hernando Li√±√°n Casta√±os, a former Alf√©rez that had lived in retirement, replaced Carabineros Commander Mart√≠nez Rabad√°n as leader of the unit. In the Battle of the Ebro the 3rd Mixed Brigade was cut to pieces while attempting to cross the Ebro River near Amposta on 25 July. Thus the again much damaged brigade had to be removed from the front line and deployed in peripheral operations undertaken to relieve the Ebro Front. These included trying to establish a bridgehead in Vilanova de la Barca in August. At the onset of the overpowering Catalonia Offensive, the brigade was in the Ser√≤s bridgehead sector. Unable to resist against the crushing rebel pressure it began a withdrawal from Torres de Segre to Torrebesses. Then the 3rd Mixed Brigade steadily retreated towards the international border in the north amidst the general debacle of the Republican military units in Catalonia. After crossing into France the 3rd Mixed Brigade's members were disarmed and interned in concentration camps by the French authorities and the unit became extinguished. The brigade's last leader had been Carabineros Commander Jos√© Vila Cuenca and its last report had been written in January 1939. Post-Civil War The Second World War began just a few months after the end of the Spanish conflict, where the Francoist forces aligned with the Axis Powers had been victorious. However, from the concentration camps in France, such as Argel√®s-sur-Mer and Le Barcar√®s some former members of the 3rd Mixed Brigade managed to reach the French Resistance in order to continue the combat against Nazi Germany. Among the former Third Mixed Brigade members that could not escape the French camps, some ended up in the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. == Commanders == All commanders of the Third Mixed Brigade had been officers of the Carabineros corps, except for Joaqu√≠n de Zulueta, Antonio P√©rez and Hernando Li√±√°n. *Commanders in Chief ** Jos√© Mar√≠a Gal√°n ** Emeterio Jarillo Orgaz ** Joaqu√≠n de Zulueta Isasi ** Antonio P√©rez Quijano ** Agust√≠n Colomina Solera ** Antonio Mart√≠nez Rabad√°n ** Hernando Li√±√°n Casta√±os ** Jos√© Vila Cuenca ==See also== *Carabineros *Si me quieres escribir *Songs of the Spanish Civil War ==References *Las Brigadas Mixtas - Carlos Engels (Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas... - 1.999) *Las Primeras Brigadas Mixtas - El Gran Capit√°n *Contra el Imperio Nazi *F√©lix Santos, Espa√±oles en la liberaci√≥n de Francia: 1939-1945 Category:Military units and formations established in 1936 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1939 Category:Mixed Brigades (Spain) Category:Carabineros ","title":"3rd Mixed Brigade"},{"id":"46339077","text":"Yuraq Urqu (Quechua yuraq white, urqu mountain, \\"white mountain\\", also spelled Yuracc Orcco) is a mountain in the Andes of Peru.

During the Nazi period he was detained by the state: by the end of the war he and disappeared. In the continuing absence of information on what had happened to him, 1959 it was deemed for the administrative convenience of government authorities that he had died, officially on 31 December 1945. ==Life== B√∂schen trained to follow his father into the building trade and in 1906 joined the Building Workers' League of the Free Trade Unions. He also joined the left-wing SPD party. War broke out in 1914 and in 1917 the SPD split in two, primarily over the issue of continuing support for the war. B√∂schen went with the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD / Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands). The political left in Germany continued to fracture during the revolutionary year that followed military defeat. In October 1920 B√∂schen was a USPD delegate at the Danzig meeting which resulted in his party's left wing majority merging itself into the German Communist Party (KPD). He then relocated to the Rhineland, where he worked as an official of the Metal Workers' Union. Between 1921 and 1926 he was a membership of the KPD (party) leadership team in the Solingen subdistrict. From 1921 till 1923 he was also an elected member of the party national committee. In 1926 he became party secretary for trades union matters in the Lower Rhine region. In 1928 regional elections he was elected a member of the Prussian regional legislative assembly (Landtag), representing the D√ºsseldorf-East electoral district. In 1929 he took charge of party organisation in the Lower Rhine district. He took part as a delegate in the 1929 Communist Party Conference. As the economic and political situation in Germany deteriorated, in 1930 he gave up his regional job in charge of party organisation. Instead, in 1931, he became the Policy Head of the Unity Association of Building Workers in the Revolutionary Trades Union Opposition movement. January 1933 saw the beginning of Germany's twelve Nazi years. A priority for the new government was the rapid establishment in Germany of one- party government, and the new Chancellor had, in opposition, been particularly vitriolic about the Communist Party. B√∂schen was one of many German communists to find themselves arrested. He was given a 33-month prison sentence, following which he would be held for a longer period in concentration camps. War returned in 1939 and he was conscripted into Organisation Todt. By May 1945, when the war formally ended, Heinrich B√∂schen had disappeared. In 1959 he was officially declared dead, deemed for official purposes to have died on 31 December 1945. ==References== Category:Social Democratic Party of Germany politicians Category:Independent Social Democratic Party politicians Category:Communist Party of Germany politicians Category:German trade unionists Category:People of the Weimar Republic Category:Prisoners of Nazi concentration camps Category:1887 births Category:1945 deaths Category:20th- century deaths Category:Year of death uncertain ","title":"Heinrich B√∂schen"},{"id":"46339166","text":"Thumbida Mane () is a 1995 Indian Kannada romantic drama - action film directed by S.

Maxwele first gained prominence in 2010 after his wrongful arrest and interrogation for allegedly giving an obscene hand gesture to President Jacob Zuma's presidential motorcade convoy in Cape Town city traffic. ==Early years== Maxwele spent most of his early years in a village in the Eastern Cape region of South Africa. His mother was a domestic worker and his father was a miner. Two years after South Africa's first democratic elections in 1994 he moved to the Cape Town township of Delft where he spent time volunteering for an HIV awareness campaign in nearby Khayelitsha. He gained a scholarship to study Political Science at the University of Cape Town. == Presidential hand gesture == On 10 February 2010 Maxwele was arrested and detained in Cape Town by members of the president's bodyguard for allegedly giving the finger to the South African presidential motorcade. Following on this incident, the FW de Klerk Foundation's Centre for Constitutional Rights lodged a complaint with the South African Human Rights Commission, arguing that members of the Presidential Special Protection Unit violated Maxwele's human rights as enshrined in the South African Constitution. Following an investigation, the Commission found that the following among Maxwele's rights had been violated during his wrongful arrest: Human Dignity (Section 10); Freedom and Security of the Person (Section 12); Privacy (Section 14); Freedom of Expression and peaceful/unarmed demonstration (Sections 16 & 17); Political Choice (Section 19) and the Rights of Detained Persons (Section 35). == Rhodes Must Fall & #FeesMustFall== In March 2015 Maxwele ignited a vigorous national debate about post-apartheid racial transformation by hurling human excrement at a prominent statue of Cecil John Rhodes on the University of Cape Town's Rondebosch campus, a result of which some media started referring to Maxwele as 'poo- flinger'. He was subsequently an active member of the Rhodes Must Fall protest movement, before being suspended by the University after alleged abuse of a UCT staff member. In October 2015, Maxwele was involved in a nationwide protest against rising costs of attending university otherwise known as the #FeesMustFall movement, during which he was arrested outside Parliament. The case is to be heard in February 2016. In April 2016, Maxwele was again involved in violent protests during an illegal #FeesMustFall protest taking place at the University of the Witwatersrand. During the protest, a lecture hall at the University was set on fire. Maxwele was photographed allegedly sexually assaulting a female protester by violently grabbing her breast, after a scuffle broke out due to the presence of a group of self labeled feminists and \\"queer persons\\". ==Alleged death threats against and physical intimidation of female lecturer== On 7 May 2015, Chumani Maxwele was given a provisional suspension order because UCT authorities \\"considered his continued presence on the campus as being a threat to the maintenance of good order.\\" The suspension related to an incident which is alleged to have occurred on 1 May 2015. According to a statement issued by UCT, \\"Maxwele insisted on being allowed into the Mathematics building after being informed that as it was a public holiday, all lecture theatres and classrooms were locked.\\" Once inside the building, and after ascertaining that the said rooms were in fact locked, he is alleged to have shouted, screamed and sworn aggressively at a female lecturer and two other witnesses to the incident and to have banged on her door after she locked herself in her office. Maxwele allegedly gained entry to her office where he pushed her and proceeded to bang on her desk whilst shouting and screaming at her. It is alleged that Maxwele shouted that the lecturer was \\"a white woman who takes all the rights of the black students,\\" that \\"the statue fell, now it's time for all whites to go,\\" that he was \\"not interested in the opinion of whites and that they should be killed\\" and that \\"we must not listen to whites, we do not need their apologies, they have to be removed from UCT and have to be killed.\\" Upon appeal by Maxwele, UCT varied the suspension to allow him to attend classes and use the library. Maxwele successfully challenged his suspension in the Western Cape High Court on the grounds that the presence of the deputy registrar of academic administration, Karen van Heerden, at his suspension hearing tainted the hearing with bias. UCT spokesperson Patricia Lucas said while the university would abide by the court‚Äôs findings, its decision did not interfere with UCT‚Äôs disciplinary process and that disciplinary action in connection with the incident on 1 May 2015 would go ahead. Maxwele had previously failed to attend a disciplinary hearing scheduled for 4 and 5 June 2015 after submitting a medical certificate indicating that he was unwell. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:1985 births Category:South African activists Category:University of Cape Town alumni Category:People from Mthatha ","title":"Chumani Maxwele"},{"id":"46339202","text":"Women's World Tag Team Championship refers to a Professional wrestling championship for tag teams consisting of two female wrestlers.

Longhin held various roles of leadership within his order following his ordination such as acting as a teacher in Udine and acting as the Provincial Minister for his order. He became close friends with the Patriarch of Venice Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto. The latter became Pope Pius X in 1903 who made his old friend Longhin the new head for the vacant Treviso episcopal see. The bishop became noted for his devotion to pastoral reform initiatives that sought to strengthen the spiritual formation for seminarians and ongoing formation for the diocesan priests. He likewise undertook three separate pastoral visits because he wanted to meet all his parishioners in each parish encompassing the diocese. He was active in organizing and collaborating in relief initiatives during World War I and was even awarded the Cross of Merit for his activism. His death prompted widespread calls for the beatification cause to be initialized. This cause materialized in 1964 and resulted in the declaration that the late bishop was Venerable in 1998 after Pope John Paul II confirmed his heroic virtue. John Paul II later beatified Longhin in 2002 in Saint Peter's Square after the 1964 cure of a man with peritonitis was approved as a miraculous intervention from Longhin. ==Life== Education and priesthood Giacinto Bonaventura Longhin was born on 22 November 1863 in Padua as the sole child to the poor farmers Matteo Longhin and Giudetta Marin. His baptism was celebrated on 23 November and he was baptized as \\"Giacinto Bonaventura\\". In his childhood he felt drawn to the priesthood and he entered the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin despite the protests of his father. His father worked alone on the farm and did not wish to be deprived of his son in such arduous work. He assumed the religious name \\"Andrea di Campodarsego\\" on 27 August 1879 after vesting in the habit in Bassano del Grappa in Vicenza (beginning his novitiate period). He studied in both Padua (humanistic studies) and Venice (theological studies) and made his solemn religious profession on 4 October 1883. He was ordained to the priesthood in Venice on 19 June 1886. Longhin taught at an institute that his order managed in Udine and was the director for the order's teachers (1889‚Äì91) and then made the director of theological studies in Venice (1891-1902). He also served as the Provincial Minister for his order in Venice from 18 April 1902 onwards (until 1904) where he came to the attention of the Cardinal Patriarch of Venice Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto who would become Pope Pius X in 1903. Sarto often had Longhin preach in Venice to the masses and the two became close friends during this period; it also pleased Longhin that his friend Sarto had been elected as pope. Episcopate Pius X appointed Longhin as the Bishop of Treviso in 1904 and he received his episcopal consecration in Rome (the pope wanted it to be held in Rome) on 17 April 1904 in the church of Trinit√† dei Monti. His installation in his new see was held on 6 August with reform as his sole concern; he issued two pastoral letters prior to his installation outlining his reform program. He travelled often to each parish in order to become close with his people while he set about reforming the seminaries to improve spiritual formation while seeking to encourage vocations. He also promoted retreats for spiritual renewal and encouraged the diocesan priests to support the idea. Longhin also became a close friend to Saint Leopold Mandic during his episcopate. His first pastoral visit began in 1905 and concluded in 1910. He held two more pastoral visits in 1912 and in 1926. Pope Pius X often lauded Longhin's work in Treviso and once hailed him as a \\"gifted bishop\\" and \\"a man who would leave an indelible mark of apostolic zeal on the diocese\\" that remained dear to the pope's heart. Throughout the raging European conflict he remained in his diocese to minister to refugees as well as to the wounded and to the poor. He also restored parishes that had been ruined and was even awarded the Cross of Merit for his good deeds. It was in that war that he helped to organize and run relief efforts for people. He and other priests were convicted of defeatism and imprisoned for a brief period since he chose no side in the conflict. He was released not long after and continued the relief efforts. Following the war he worked with social movements and was made as the apostolic visitor to Padua in 1923 at the direction of Pope Pius XI. He was also made the apostolic administrator for the vacant Udine see until the pope could appoint a new prelate to head that see. The pope saw fit to elevate Longhin \\"ad personam\\" as an archbishop in 1928 but did not elevate his see as an archbishopric. He continued to hold his post in Treviso and remained there until his death. Pius XI in October 1923 acknowledged the \\"great services\\" the bishop rendered for the flock and said that \\"he has worked so much for the Church\\" through his apostolic zeal. In 1929 the Cardinal Patriarch of Venice Pietro La Fontaine wrote that Longhin exemplified \\"the Good Shepherd in the Gospel\\" who remained \\"true to the original\\". Longhin supported the rights of workers and railed against worker exploitation as a sinful act. He likewise - in April 1914 - declared to be sacred \\"the right of workmen to organize themselves ... in unions for their own economic and moral upgrading\\". He encouraged religious orders to operate within his diocese and welcomed orders such as the Carmelites and the Salesians of Don Bosco as well as others such as the Passionists. In 1920 he supported the Christian union movement known as \\"Leghe Bianche\\" and came to oppose Fascism after Benito Mussolini secured power in late 1922 after his march on Rome. Longhin later presided over two catechetical congresses in his diocese in 1922 and 1932. Declining health and death In 1932 he began to demonstrate the first signs of arteriosclerosis. He had been in Salzano at the end of a pastoral visitation for a Confirmation Mass on 3 October 1935 when he lost his sight. He was hospitalized at once in Treviso and was found to have had deficient cerebral circulation which had resulted in the loss of his sight. He celebrated his last Mass on 14 February 1936. Longhin died on 26 June 1936 after eighteen hours of agonizing pain. His funeral was held on 30 June with a large crowd amassing to farewell him; Longhin's remains were interred in the Treviso Cathedral later on 5 November 1936. His remains were inspected on 12‚Äì22 November 1984 and were found \\"entire with tender parts and a large part mummified\\". ==Beatification== The beatification process opened in Treviso on 21 April 1964 and later concluded its investigation on 26 June 1967 while another process had been undertaken in Udine from 1964 until 1965. Theologians assessed his individual writings to ensure such writings adhered to doctrine and confirmed them on 17 December 1971 as having contained no doctrinal errors. The introduction to the cause came on 15 December 1981 and an apostolic process for further investigation was later held from 18 June 1982 until 26 June 1985. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated these previous processes in Rome on 13 June 1986 and received the Positio for additional assessment in 1993. Theologians assessed the dossier and approved it in their meeting on 19 December 1997 while the cardinals and bishops comprising the C.C.S. likewise assented to the cause on 6 October 1998. Longhin was declared to be Venerable on the following 21 December after Pope John Paul II confirmed that the late bishop had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. Longhin's beatification depended upon a miracle (more often than not a healing) that science or medicine failed to explain. The miracle that led to Longhin's beatification was the 1964 cure of Dino Stella from diffuse peritonitis. The miracle was first investigated in the Italian diocese that it originated in prior to evidence being submitted to the C.C.S. who validated the investigation on 24 January 1997. But further investigations into the miracle could not take place until Longhin had been named as Venerable. Once that happened a medical panel of experts (some non-Catholic) approved that the healing had no scientific explanation in their meeting on 12 November 2001 (a previous meeting on 15 June 2000 proved inconclusive and warranted a second meeting). Theologians approved it later on 15 February 2002 after determining the miracle occurred due to petitions made for Longhin's intercession; the C.C.S. members confirmed the findings of both committees later that 16 April. John Paul II - a week later on 23 April - confirmed this miracle as such and beatified Longhin in Saint Peter's Square later that 20 October. The current postulator for this cause is the Capuchin friar Carlo Calloni. ==References * Hagiography Circle * Catholic Online * Santi e Beati * Saints SQPN * Catholic Hierarchy Category:1863 births Category:1936 deaths Category:20th-century Italian people Category:20th- century Roman Catholic bishops Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II Category:Bishops of Treviso Category:Capuchin bishops Category:Franciscan beatified people Category:Italian beatified people Category:Italian Franciscans Category:Italian titular archbishops Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope John Paul II ","title":"Giacinto Longhin"},{"id":"46339422","text":"The Universal Cook is an English cookery book written in 1773 by John Townshend.

The Warriors are the only good organised team Enschede had in years. After beating the Lelystad Lizards in the friendship bowl and the Zaandam Giants in the Runners-up Bowl the Enschede Warriors had the opportunity to play in the highest Dutch league. Most players didn't or couldn't play at such level and the warriors chose to stay in the 2nd league. Many players went to play for other team in the next season. Frank Versteeg (RB, The Hague Raiders), Job Posthumus (OL, Amsterdam Crusaders) and Onno Hinrichs (LB, Utrecht Vikings) went playing in the Dutch highest league. The Warriors stopped in 1993 because of mismanagement and a lack of players. During active years the Enschede Warriors were being coached by several coaches as Robert Poindexter. Under Coach Poindexter the Warriors had an undefeated season in 1988.  Enschede Broncos  In 2003 a new team was founded in Enschede, the Enschede Broncos. They started playing their first season of competitive matches in 2011. In 2012, the Broncos acquired their own home field, including goalposts. Their home field is part of the sports complex Wethouder Horstman Sportpark in Enschede, which is shared with a rugby club and two soccer clubs. On March 3rd, 2013 the Broncos celebrated their 10-year anniversary. They played a home game against the Eindhoven Raptors, which they won. In that 2013 season, they went on to obtain a spot in the 3rd Division finals. They lost against the undefeated Rotterdam Trojans. Two years later, in 2015, they reached the 1st Division finals under rookie HC Joeri Constandse. However they lost, again, from an undefeated team; the Groningen Giants. Due to a lack of players, the Broncos weren‚Äôt able to play the 2018 season. In 2019 they made a comeback under head coach Dennis van Beek with a team full of rookies and some of the players from the old team. == Current roster == {  +Staff !Name !Function - Dennis van Beek Head Coach / Defensive Coordinator - Tom Wolterink Offensive Coordinator - Bennie van Limbeek RB / DB Coach - Hendrik Schneider Linemen Coach - Jaimy Tahapary Team manager } {  +Player !Name !Position - Alfred SImon RB / LB - Bernd Lok OL / DL - Bert Hoven OL / DL - Bjorn Roozeboom OL / DL - Bjorn ten Hoopen OL / DL - Camilio Delfgaauw OL / DL - Coen Hartjes RB / WR - Daniek Nijboer RB / LB - Elco Veldhof OL / DL - Hilko Looten OL / DL - Holger Huijsman LB - Jason Dikken RB / WR - Jesper Jeeninga DB - Koen Bakema OL / DL - Kristan Bouwman RB / LB - Luise Warnke DB - Marc Scoop WR - Max Boerkamp DL - Niek Kamphuis OL / DL - Robin Heyt DB - Samuel Sapulette DB - Stefan Drenth OL / DL - Sven Mollinga LB / DB - Thomas Meurs OL / DL - Tim de Haas K / P - Tom Wolterink QB - Vincent Smit WR - Wilbert Poppink DB / WR - Wouter Moes OL / DL - Xavier Iyke RB / DB } Category:American football teams in the Netherlands Category:2003 establishments in the Netherlands Category:American football teams established in 2003 ","title":"Enschede Broncos"},{"id":"46339424","text":"Technician using ASTM Smoke Spot Pump to evaluate emissions from an experimental wood stove Diagram of ASTM Smoke Spot Pump, from the original specification document. An ASTM Smoke Pump, or 'spot pump', is an instrument for evaluating the dark particle concentration of a smoke. It is very widely used (2014) by heating engineers to assess emissions, most commonly from fuel- burning appliances such as a wood stoves or oil boilers. It consists of a cylinder of precise size down which a close-fitting piston is pulled, sucking a sample of the smoke through a small nozzle against a filter paper (equivalent to Whatman No2 paper) so that a 'spot' is formed on the paper, the darkness of which can be compared with a standard chart to indicate the concentration of smoke. Measurements made using the ASTM Smoke Pump form part of statutory requirements in the USA, Germany. Unlike other smoke measurement methods, the ASTM Pump provides a permanent record and sample of the smoke. Because its use takes only a few seconds, it can provide a series of smoke samples over time, allowing boilers etc. to be evaluated over a complete burning cycle and graphic data to be collected. Because the system depends on comparison rather than an evaluation of the spot colour density, and because many successive samples can be taken, it is considered highly reliable. The ASTM Standard reports that; \\"The difference between test results obtained by the same operator with the same apparatus under constant operating conditions on identical test material would, in the long run, in the normal and correct operation of the test method, exceed one-half of a smoke spot number for only one case in twenty.\\" ==Standard== The device is defined by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) in their Standard D2156 \\"Standard Test Method for Smoke Density in Flue Gases\\", first published in 1965, revised several times, most recently in 2013. ==Calibration== The instrument provides the technician with a dark spot on a filter paper strip which is then compared with a standard darkness chart, commonly numbered 0 to 10, 0 being entirely white and 10 being entirely black. The darkness can be related to the likely concentration of dark smoke particles in the flue gas by an empirical non- linear formula based on the OECD Document 'Methods of Measuring Air Pollution' Sd = (154 \\\\times(Ob^{2.8}))+3.6 Where: Sd = Actual smoke density on paper, in microgrammes (mcg) per square cm.

The method uses preferential ballots and returns so-called maximal lotteries, i.e., probability distributions over the alternatives that are weakly preferred to any other probability distribution. Maximal lotteries satisfy the Condorcet criterion, the Smith criterion, reversal symmetry, polynomial runtime, and probabilistic versions of reinforcement,F. Brandl, F. Brandt, and H. G. Seedig. Consistent probabilistic social choice. Econometrica. 84(5), pages 1839-1880, 2016. participation,F. Brandl, F. Brandt, and J. Hofbauer. Welfare Maximization Entices Participation. Games and Economic Behavior. 14, pages 308-314, 2019. and independence of clones. Maximal lotteries are equivalent to mixed maximin strategies (or Nash equilibria) of the symmetric zero-sum game given by the pairwise majority margins. As such, they have a natural interpretation in terms of electoral competition between two political parties.Laslier, J.-F. Interpretation of electoral mixed strategies Social Choice and Welfare 17: pages 283‚Äì292, 2000. Moreover, they can be computed using linear programming. The voting system that returns all maximal lotteries is axiomatically characterized as the only one satisfying probabilistic versions of population-consistency (a weakening of reinforcement) and composition-consistency (a strengthening of independence of clones). A social welfare function that top-ranks maximal lotteries is characterized using Arrow's independence of irrelevant alternatives and Pareto efficiency.F. Brandl and F. Brandt. Arrovian Aggregation of Convex Preferences. Econometrica. Forthcoming. Maximal lotteries satisfy a strong notion of Pareto efficiency and a weak notion of strategyproofness.H. Aziz, F. Brandt, and M Brill. On the Tradeoff between Economic Efficiency and Strategyproofness. Games and Economic Behavior. 110, pages 1-18, 2018. In contrast to random dictatorship, maximal lotteries do not satisfy the standard notion of strategyproofness. Also, maximal lotteries are not monotonic in probabilities, i.e., it is possible that the probability of an alternative decreases when this alternative is ranked up. However, the probability of the alternative will remain positive.Laslier, J.-F. Tournament solutions and majority voting Springer-Verlag, 1997.

Michalska- Smith and Stefano Allesina. Higher-order interactions stabilize dynamics in competitive network models Nature 548: 210-214, 2017. == Collective preferences over lotteries == The input to this voting system consists of the agents' ordinal preferences over outcomes (not lotteries over outcomes), but a relation on the set of lotteries is constructed in the following way: if p and q are different lotteries over outcomes, p\\\\succ q if the expected value of the margin of victory of an outcome selected with distribution p in a head-to-head vote against an outcome selected with distribution q is positive. While this relation is not necessarily transitive, it does always contain at least one maximal element. It is possible that several such maximal lotteries exist, but unicity can be proven in the case where the margins between any pair of alternatives is always an odd number.Gilbert Laffond, Jean-Fran√ßois Laslier and Michel Le Breton A theorem on two‚Äìplayer symmetric zero‚Äìsum games Journal of Economic Theory 72: 426‚Äì431, 1997. This is the case for instance if there is an odd number of voters who all hold strict preferences over the alternatives. Following the same argument, unicity holds for the original \\"bipartisan set\\" that is defined as the support of the maximal lottery of a tournament game. == Example == Suppose there are five voters who have the following preferences over three alternatives: * 2 voters: a\\\\succ b\\\\succ c * 2 voters: b\\\\succ c\\\\succ a * 1 voter: c\\\\succ a\\\\succ b The pairwise preferences of the voters can be represented in the following skew-symmetric matrix, where the entry for row x and column y denotes the number of voters who prefer x to y minus the number of voters who prefer y to x. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\begin{matrix} & & a\\\\quad & b\\\\quad & c\\\\quad \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{matrix} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\begin{matrix} a\\\\\\\\\\\\ b\\\\\\\\\\\\ c\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{matrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & -1\\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 0 & 3\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & -3 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\end{matrix} This matrix can be interpreted as a zero-sum game and admits a unique Nash equilibrium (or minimax strategy) p where p(a)=3/5, p(b)=1/5, p(c)=1/5. By definition, this is also the unique maximal lottery of the preference profile above. The example was carefully chosen not to have a Condorcet winner. Many preference profiles admit a Condorcet winner, in which case the unique maximal lottery will assign probability 1 to the Condorcet winner. == References  External links == *voting.ml (website for computing maximal lotteries) *Pnyx - Practical Preference Aggregation (voting tool that, among other methods, offers maximal lotteries) * votation.ovh (French website for computing maximal lotteries) Category:Preferential electoral systems ","title":"Maximal lotteries"},{"id":"46339463","text":"The R type carriages were a series of locomotive-hauled carriages proposed to be built for the Victorian country rail network in the early and mid 1980s. Early plans indicated a build of at least six four-carriage sets for high speed services on the Albury, Bairnsdale, Mildura and Swan Hill lines. ==Background== Alan Reiher, the newly minted Chairman of the Victorian Railways Board, had in mind the Spanish Talgo cars, which featured a very low centre of gravity. In April 1982, Les Rolls, a former chief mechanical engineer of the Victorian Railways, and John Hearsch, the then-current Group Manager for Country Passenger Services, travelled overseas to investigate trends and developments in high speed passenger rail services. The international tour looked at the Talgo vehicles, as well as the British Rail Mark 3 coaches and the French SNCF Corail cars, which all had features of interest. The Spanish and French cars were both significantly outside the Victorian loading gauge, and they could not easily be reduced in size. The British coaches were very close to local requirements, requiring relatively simple changes to the coupler heights, replacement of the outward-opening doors and a better air conditioning system to suit Australian climate conditions. However, British Rail advised that they could not begin construction of the Victorian cars for a few years due to a backlog of existing orders. ==Design== Due to the projected delay, in early 1983 Comeng's plant in Dandenong was awarded a contract from VicRail to develop concepts for the proposed country carriages. Reiher's preference for a low centre of gravity inspired the use of a lower carriage profile overall. To allow for this, the air conditioning units were to be mounted under the floor, with cooled air pumped up through body side pillars and entering the carriage saloon through vents above the carriage racks. To ensure the minimum possible weight the cars were to be constructed with low-grade 3CR12 stainless steel, which used chromium in place of nickel and molybdenum, and is created with very fine particles making for better welding properties. Comeng had no experience with 3CR12, so experiments were undertaken to develop acceptable methods of spot and arc welding, as well as finding a suitable painting method. The steel panels were going to be rolled by Lysaghts. Also to save weight, the cars were to use head end power in lieu of fitting underfloor diesel alternator sets or belt-driven generators, as had been applied to earlier vehicles. Early artwork for the cars reflected the low-slung body, mostly unpainted stainless steel with orange bands on the roof and below platform level, and doors in all four corners. Later artwork by Comeng's artist Phil Belbin, essentially reflected a repainted XPT carriage - with a full height body, a single vestibule with access doors at one end of each carriage, and ten windows per side. A full-size mockup of a section of the carriage design was constructed at Newport Workshops, to show the concept to VicRail staff, unions and politicians; along with a 1:20 scale model measuring 1.2m over ends. ==Bogies== Comeng suggested CT22 bogies, which were under trial in preparation for the New South Wales XPT train then under development. VicRail had planned to use Socimi bogies imported from Italy. Eventually, a set of bogies were built under license by Vickers-Ruwolt Ltd. In 1986 three pairs of Socimi bogies were imported from Italy and fitted under carriage set LH33. Locomotive A85 was temporarily regeared to operate at 160 km/h, and trials were conducted on the Western Line towards Adelaide, using the 27 kilometre section of straight track through Wal Wal, between Glenorchy and Lubeck. The train was stabled at Horsham each night during the speed trials, which were not publicly announced. ==Internal arrangement== The sets were planned as four carriages; one first class with a guard's compartment, one restaurant car with a buffet at one end and a disabled toilet at the other, and two economy sitting cars. The first class carriage was planned to feature rotating and reclining seats in a 2+2 format, with fold-down meal tables fitted on the rear of each seat for use by the following passengers; this arrangement is very similar to that employed on the ACN and ACZ carriages. The capacity might have been around 56 passengers, though some of those may have been reserved for staff. The buffet module for the restaurant carriage may have inspired later designs for the BRN cars. The economy carriages, and the sitting area of the restaurant car, were to be organised with sets of four fixed seats and a table either side of the central aisle. Based on early sketches of the carriages showing the window arrangements, the capacity of the economy cars would likely have been around 72 passengers each; and around 56 seats for the restaurant carriage. ==Intent to build== By the time the New Deal of 1981 was announced, the intent to purchase N Set carriages had been inflated to eighteen 3-carriage sets each in the ACN-BN-BN configuration for the Geelong, Ballarat and other commuter runs. The same project involved the purchase of 10 N class engines, conversion or upgrading of 39 pre-existing locomotives of the B and T classes, 14 railcars of the DERM and DRC types, 79 passenger cars of the Harris, E, S and Z types, and around seventy freight wagons for parcels traffic. The N Class locomotives were going to be rostered with R type sets on the long-distance regional services and the Overland service to Adelaide, while the A Class locomotives (ex B Class) were going to run intracity services with the N type carriages, and the P class locomotives (ex T class) were going to operate the shortest runs. As the project evolved through 1982, the requirements changed; more new locomotives were ordered and the railcars were mostly left alone, on account of patronage spikes rendering their capacity insufficient. In lieu, the decision was made to convert a further 18 Harris type carriages for commuter traffic, and the N sets were changed from that to longer distance services with an onboard buffet, by retrofitting onboard buffet units to the then-under-construction BN cars, and shuffling the sets around. In response, VicRail planned to purchase a separate fleet of ACR-BRR-BR-BR carriages for the regional network, to supplement and eventually replace the eldest of the S type carriages (dating back to 1937-1940) then being organised into ACZ-BRS-BS-BZ sets. At the time, nearly half of Victoria's steel airconditioned carriages were in use on the standard gauge route from Melbourne to Sydney, providing sitting capacity on trains like the Spirit of Progress and later the Melbourne/Sydney expresses; as a result, only 15 Z-type and 16 S-type sitting carriages were available for service on the rest of the Victorian network (along with 12 non-sitting or partial-sitting carriages), supplemented by the surviving airconditioned wooden carriages. The design process lasted for about eighteen months, and was nearly complete when the plan was cancelled in mid-1984. ==Plans held back== The New Deal was a near-complete rebuild of the entire Victorian country rail network, and by mid-1984 the bill was starting to add up. Eventually the Treasury department stepped in, and the R type carriages were cut from the plans as surplus. To compensate the second half of the N type order was adjusted with buffet cars in lieu of economy sitting cars, and the sets were reorganised so that they could provide for the demands of both medium- and long-distance runs. In addition, the older S compartment and Z saloon cars were refurbished and formed into longer distance sets. There was also an expectation that the New South Wales XPT fleet would eventually replace the named trains between Melbourne and Sydney, both providing more S and Z cars for intrastate services, and rendering the R type cars less useful. ==Brief revival== Around 1988, Melbourne submitted a bid for the 1996 Olympics, and V/Line planned to add to their existing country rail fleet to allow for the increased patronage. This was around the same time that locomotive A66 was repainted from its 1988 Bi-centennial livery to its 1996 Olympics variant of the then-standard V/Line orange with grey, and A85 was used in high speed trials. As the Olympic bid was not successful the R car project fell back off the radar. ==Plans cancelled== The design of the R cars was undertaken by Commonwealth Engineering. The State Transport Authority, later known as the Public Transport Corporation, ended up purchasing the complete set of construction drawings, and attempts were made over about a ten-year period to obtain funding for construction, but with the loss of the Olympics bid, the economic downturn in the early 1990s and the later delivery of the Sprinter fleet, the drawings ended up unused. The Socimi bogies were removed from set LH33 and were last sighted at Newport Workshops. ==Epilogue== In the first half of the 1990s the Victorian Government paid for an extension to New South Wales's XPT order; and when the Melbourne/Sydney express was replaced with the Sydney-Albury XPT service extended to Melbourne, V/Line was able to recall its S and Z type carriages from the standard gauge services. Additionally, a downturn in patronage on The Vinelander service allowed conversion of two of its sleeping cars, 15 and 16, to BS218 and BS219 respectively. This freed a total of fifteen sitting carriages for intrastate services, including three quickly converted to ACZ composite sitting and conductor. ==References== * Category:Victorian Railways carriages ","title":"VicRail R type carriage"},{"id":"46339465","text":"Yoon Jun-sung (; born 28 September 1989) is a South Korean footballer who plays as a defender for Nakhon Ratchasima. ==Career== Yoon was selected by Pohang Steelers in 2012 K League draft.

Kilkenny retained their title beating Galway by 1-22 to 1-18. The win was the 36th All-Ireland title for Kilkenny and the 11th under Brian Cody. The final was shown live in Ireland on RT√â One as part of The Sunday Game live programme, presented by Michael Lyster from Croke Park, with studio analysis from Cyril Farrell, Henry Shefflin and Anthony Daly. Match commentary was provided by Ger Canning with analysis by Michael Duignan. The game was also shown live on Sky Sports, presented by Rachel Wyse and Brian Carney with studio analysis from J. J. Delaney, Ollie Canning and Jamesie O'Connor. The match was the third most- watched event on Irish television in 2015, with an average audience of 739,600. For the first time since 2011, the final did not go into a replay. ==Background== This was the 41st championship meeting between the two sides, with Kilkenny dominating the series with 29 victories. Galway had beaten Kilkenny on 9 occasions while there have been two drawn games. In their most recent meeting Kilkenny defeated Galway by 1-25 to 2-15 in the 2015 Leinster final on 5 July. The two sides had previously played six times in All-Ireland finals, with Kilkenny once again dominating by winning four of the previous deciders (1975, 1979, 1993, 2012). Galway's lone All-Ireland defeat of Kilkenny came in 1987, while there has been one drawn decider. Kilkenny were hoping to retain their All-Ireland crown and claim an 8th All-Ireland title in ten years. Victory would also ensure an 11th All-Ireland title under the management of Brian Cody and a 36th All-Ireland title over all. Galway were hoping to win their first All-Ireland title since 1988. Kilkenny were favorites to win the match, priced at 1/2 with Paddy Power, with Galway priced at 2/1 and the draw at 9/1. If the match was a draw it would be the fourth year in a row that the match would have finished in a draw. ==Route to the final== Kilkenny Galway ==Pre-match== Jubilee team The Cork All-Ireland-winning team of 1990, who won the title following a 5-15 to 2-21 defeat of Galway, were the jubilee team that were presented to the crowd before the final. Ticketing With a stadium capacity of 82,300, the 32 individual county boards received 60,000 tickets. Schools and third level colleges got 2,500 tickets, while season ticket holders were entitled to 5,500 tickets. 1,000 tickets were given to overseas clubs. The Camogie, Ladies' Football, Handball and Rounders Associations were each allocated about 200 tickets, as were the jubilee teams and mini-7s which played at half-time. Galway's ticket allocation was expected to be around 7,000 as the county was contesting both the senior and minor All-Ireland finals. 5,000 tickets went to Kilkenny as it is a smaller county with fewer clubs, while another 1,000 will be given to clubs in Tipperary due to their participation in the All-Ireland minor final. The tickets that were allocated to the participating counties were divided among the clubs. Senior hurling clubs got the biggest allocation while intermediate and junior clubs also got a smaller share. Football clubs received a lower percentage. The allocation was based on the number of members and the number of teams in each club. The match was shown live on a big screen at Eyre Square in Galway. Related events The 2015 All-Ireland Minor Hurling Final between Galway and Tipperary was played as a curtain-raiser to the senior final. Galway won the game on a 4-13 to 1-16 scoreline. ==Match Summary== Officials On 24 August 2015 the officials were chosen for the final by the GAA, led by Wexford referee James Owens. His umpires on the day were James Dunbar, John Clarke, David Owens (Askamore) and Ian Plunkett (Marshalstown). Tipperary‚Äôs Johnny Ryan was the standby referee. The other linesman was James McGrath (Westmeath) and the sideline official was Owen Elliott (Antrim). Owens has also refereed the 2007 All-Ireland minor final, the 2008 All-Ireland under-21 final and the 2015 All-Ireland club final. Team news Both Kilkenny and Galway named unchanged sides for final. Jackie Tyrrell and Richie Power both returned to the Kilkenny squad after recovering from injury. Summary Joe Canning got the first score of the game from a close-range free after two minutes. Johnny Coen blocked a goal- bound shot from Walter Walsh after four minutes with the scores level at two points each. In the fourteenth minute with Galway leading by two points, Walter Walsh burst in from the right and hand passed to TJ Reid who shot low into the back of the net to put Kilkeeny into a one-point lead. After twenty three minutes, Joe Canning pointed another free to put Galway back in front by one. Jason Flynn then pointed a free from long range to increase the lead to two points a minute later. Jason Flynn got his third point of the game in the twenty eighth minute to put four between the sides. With a minute to half time, a dangerous high foul by Johnny Coen on Colin Fennelly earned him a yellow card when most people including all members of the Sunday Game panel expected a red card. Half-time score was Kilkenny 1-8 Galway 0-14. The first score of the second half came after four minutes with Conor Fogarty scoring from a free. TJ Reid then scored with another free and then a sixty five to level the scores. David Collins then got a point to put Galway back in front before Richie Hogan again got the equalizer. After forty nine minutes, Conor Whelan with the help of HawkEye put just one point between the sides with a shot from a very tight angle on the right. With six minutes to go Colin Fennelly pointed after Joe Canning had earlier missed from a free to put Kilkenny four points in front. Conor Whelan missed a goal chance for Galway with four minutes to go when his weak shot went low passed the left post. Colin Fennelly then got a second point to put five between them with two minutes to go. Two quick points from Michael Fennelly and Walter Walsh put seven between them before Joe Canning scored a goal with a low shot to the net from a free for the final score of the game. The final score is Kilkenny 1-22 Galway 1-18. ==Match Details== { width=92%  -   } { width=\\"75%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\"KILKENNY: - !width=25 - 1  Eoin Murphy   - 2  Paul Murphy   - 3  Joey Holden (Captain)  - 4  Shane Prendergast   - 5  P√°draig Walsh   - 6  Kieran Joyce   - 7  Cillian Buckley   - 8  Michael Fennelly   - 9  Conor Fogarty   - 10  Colin Fennelly   - 11  Richie Hogan   - 12  T.

We went in at half-time three points down and that‚Äôs not a bad position to be in and I thought the second-half response from our players was magnificent. I thought the relentless spirit, attitude and hurling that they showed was top class and it was a hard fought victory, there‚Äôs no doubt about that. ‚Äú Colin Fennelly revealed that a half- time speech from Jackie Tyrrell provided Kilkenny with the inspiration they needed in the second-half, saying \\"‚ÄúJackie Tyrrell at half-time, the speech he made was absolutely amazing, Jackie may have only one or two years left maybe and young lads hearing that coming on, it‚Äôs amazing. His speech at half-time was absolutely unbelievable, He spoke. Richie Power spoke and Michael Fennelly spoke and they‚Äôre probably the three senior lads of the team and whatever they said went through to us and we came out in the second-half and did the business.\\" Galway manager Anthony Cunningham speaking to RT√â Sport after the game said \\"Unfortunately we came out second-best there in the second-half, having had a nice lead there at half-time, Congratulations to Kilkenny, they were the better team there in the second-half. We just had a few unforced errors there really; we only returned 1-4 in the second-half, But no fault to any of our players. They gave it some, some effort, it was some battle there. A few unforced errors there in the second-half, maybe a couple of decisions went against us at the start of the second-half. Kilkenny, with all their experience and their guile and their craft, a tremendous team, they punished us.\\" Nicky English writing in the Irish Times was impressed by how Kilkenny performed in the second-half saying \\"Whatever Cody said at half- time worked because Kilkenny came out a different team. They‚Äôd reorganised themselves and they came back out and dictated the pace from the word go. They closed the gap straight away and got into the lead and were well on top in all areas. They closed down the space that Galway had been able to create in the full-forward line and Galway were reduced to scraps.\\" Cyril Farrell writing in the Irish Independent called it a tough defeat for Galway to take especially after a great first half in which they took the game to Kilkenny saying \\"Unfortunately for Galway, Cody's team got the upper hand in those vital early stages of the second half and drove on to dominate the match. The problem was they were up against a team managed by the greatest hurling manager in the game's history and we knew that Kilkenny would come out with all guns blazing in the first ten to 15 minutes of the second half.\\" Highlights of the final were shown on The Sunday Game programme which aired at 9:30pm that night on RT√â Two and was presented by Des Cahill with analysis from Donal √ìg Cusack, Liam Sheedy, and Ger Loughnane. On the man of the match award shortlist were Michael Fennelly, T. J.

Leinster Champions Dublin and Munster Champions Kerry competed for the Sam Maguire Cup. Dublin won the game on a 0‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì9 scoreline to claim their third title in five years and 25th title overall. With over one million viewers, the match was the most-watched show on Irish television at that point in 2015. An average of 875,300 people watched the game, with a peak figure of 1.08 million as the match reached its climax. ==Paths to the final== Dublin opened their campaign by defeating Longford by 4‚Äì25 to 0‚Äì10 at Croke Park on 31 May. They then defeated Kildare by 5‚Äì18 to 0‚Äì14 and returned to the Leinster football final. In the Leinster final they defeated Westmeath on a 2‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì6 to claim their tenth Leinster title in 11 years. In the All- Ireland quarter final, Dublin defeated Fermanagh 2‚Äì23 to 2‚Äì15 to advance to a semi-final meeting with Mayo. The semi-final finished up in a draw, 2‚Äì12 to Dublin, 1‚Äì15 to Mayo with a replay taking place the week after. Dublin won the replay on a 3‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì14 scoreline with three goals in the final fifteen minutes after trailing by four points. Kerry started the Munster Championship by defeating Tipperary by 2‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì8 in Semple Stadium in the semi-final on 14 June.

In the All-Ireland quarter-final on 2 August, Kerry defeated Kildare by 7‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì10. In the All-Ireland Semi-final, Tyrone were defeated by 0‚Äì18 to 1‚Äì11. ==History== This was the 13th time Kerry and Dublin had met in an All-Ireland football final and the first since 2011, when Stephen Cluxton converted a late free-kick to win it for Dublin. Kerry had won eight of the previous meetings, and Dublin had won four. Kerry entered the game as the most successful Gaelic football team in the history of the competition, having previously won 37 and taken part in 57 All Ireland Football finals since the competition's inception in 1887. Dublin were the second most successful team, having won 24 and taken part in 37 finals prior to this match. The first senior final meeting between Dublin and Kerry was in 1892. Dublin defeated Kerry in the 1923 final but would not do so again until the 1976 final. The 1970s was a particularly important time in the history of the rivalry between the sides due to the regularity with which the teams encountered one another. ==Build-up== Tickets and match odds Demand for tickets for the final was extremely high. There was no general sale, with all tickets being distributed via the county boards and clubs. A pair of tickets for the match was sold on eBay for ‚Ç¨2,020. The GAA warned that the holders of any tickets that becomes known to them as having been bought on the black market could be denied entry to the match. Dublin were priced at odds of 10/11 to win the match, with Kerry at 6/5 and the draw at 15/2 at Paddy Power bookmakers. Minor final Kerry played Tipperary in the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship final which took place before the senior final. Kerry won the game on a 4‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì6 scoreline to retain the title. Jubilee team The Cork All-Ireland-winning team of 1990, who won the title following a 0‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì9 defeat of Meath, were the jubilee team that were presented to the crowd before the final. Team selection Dublin's Cian O'Sullivan was a doubt for Dublin after picking up a hamstring injury in the dying seconds of the semi-final replay victory over Mayo. Jim Gavin named an unchanged team for the final on 18 September with Cian O‚ÄôSullivan having recovered from his injury. Jack McCaffrey would later reveal that he had contracted food poisoning \\"in around the Thursday\\" before the game, which left him unable to complete it. \\"I couldn't keep any food or water down so I got a drip to stay hydrated. But that was actually great at the time because it completely distracted from the build-up to a final ... all you were worried about is, 'Am I going to be okay?' You're no thinking about the occasion itself. And then thankfully I pulled through and performed okay for the 50 minutes that I lasted\\". The Kerry team was named on 17 September, with three changes made by manager Eamonn Fitzmaurice. Captain Kieran Donaghy, Marc √≥ S√© and Paul Murphy were not named in the starting fifteen, with the latter two recovering from recent injuries. Paul Geaney, Aidan O'Mahony and Fionn Fitzgerald came into the team. The omission of Marc √ì S√© meant Kerry started (and, in the end, completed) an All-Ireland final without a member of the √ì S√© family for the first time in 43 years, since the 1972 All-Ireland final. Officials On 8 September, David Coldrick of Meath was named as the referee for the final. It was his third time to referee an All-Ireland senior final, having previously officiated over the 2007 decider between Cork and Kerry and the 2010 final between Cork and Down. ==Match== Summary After fifteen seconds of the game, Dublin's Brian Fenton got the opening point of the game, playing into the canal end of the stadium. Dean Rock missed a goal scoring chance after four minutes when his low shot after a pass from Denis Bastick was saved by Brendan Kealy. After eight minutes the score was two points each with James O'Donoghue getting Kerry's opening score. O'Donoghue got his second after seventeen minutes to put Kerry one point ahead. Steven Cluxton scored from a free after twenty one minutes to put Dublin one point ahead on 0‚Äì4 to 0‚Äì3 scoreline. Paul Geaney made the score 0‚Äì4 to 0‚Äì4 five minutes later before Bernard Brogan again put Dublin back in front with a point a minute later.

On the man of the match award shortlist were Brian Fenton, Rory O'Carroll and Philly McMahon, with Fenton winning the award which was presented by GAA president Aogan O' Fearghail at the Gibson hotel in Dublin. Dublin manager Jim Gavin speaking after the match was happy with the overall performance of the team saying \\"It was our structure in our defence that won it for us in the end. We were very compact and very composed on the ball against massive threats all around, they came close to poaching one or two goals towards the end. We knew we had to maintain our structure throughout the game and I felt we did that and that‚Äôs why we got over the line. I'd say our shot-to-score ratio might have been a little bit ahead of theirs and opportunities that came our way we seemed to take. We created a few chances that we didn‚Äôt take but we‚Äôd always encourage our boys to go for it and great to see the likes of Brian Fenton back himself deep in the second half. He was very unlucky (with an effort that struck the post) but that‚Äôs what we‚Äôd always encourage.‚Äù Kerry manager Eamonn Fitzmaurice speaking to RT√â Sport after the match said that he was disappointed with the below-par performance of his team saying \\"We didn‚Äôt perform, we didn‚Äôt play as well as we can play, I think you have to give a lot of credit to Dublin as well. They played very well, they outworked us, they played the game at their terms. They managed to really tackle us high up the pitch, really slow us down and at the same time get bodies back. So as I said, you have to give them credit but under performed as well.\\" Former Dublin footballer Ciar√°n Whelan, writing in the Herald, felt the 2015 Dublin team was probably the best to pull on the jersey saying: \\"I think it is fair to day at this point that this team is probably the greatest team ever to put on the Dublin jersey and the sacrifices that they have made is finally being rewarded on the top stage. It is a truly remarkable achievement to win so many Leinster, All-Ireland and National league wins and we should savour every moment as these periods of success have been few and far between over the past thirty years.\\" Jim McGuinness, writing in the Irish Times, felt that the weather completely dominated the game and that Alan Brogan's introduction was critical saying \\"There were 29 turnovers in the first half alone and they were caused by the rain as much as by player error. What he (Alan Brogan) did for his point is well worth any young player studying. If you watch it back, he was making decisions during that entire run up the pitch as he carried the ball. Even though the ball never left his hands it is clear he is thinking: will I give it here or not? Give it now or not? He kept taking the right option the whole way up the pitch ‚Äì in a crunch moment of the All- Ireland final when Dublin had what was still a precarious lead on a day of treacherous weather. And eventually, he took the perfect decision in kicking the ball over the bar. He also won a break down at the far end when Rory O‚ÄôCarroll broke a ball away from Kieran Donaghy. So he was involved in a couple of big moments. He showed great patience all season in terms of using whatever game time he was given and it was a classy performance here.\\" Trophy presentation Dublin captain Stephen Cluxton accepted the Sam Maguire Cup from GAA president Aog√°n √ì Feargha√≠l in the Hogan Stand.

He was also the founder of the Eucharistic Missionaries of Nazareth and also established both the Disciples of Saint John and the Children of Reparation. He was known for his strong devotion to the Eucharist and became known as the \\"Bishop of the Tabernacle\\" due to this devotion; he made it an objective of his to spread devotion to the Eucharist and encouraged frequent reception of it. The sainthood cause for the late bishop opened in 1981 and he became titled as a Servant of God while Pope John Paul II named him as Venerable on 6 April 1998 upon the confirmation that he exercised heroic virtue in his life. John Paul II also beatified the late bishop on 29 April 2001. Pope Francis canonized him as a saint on 16 October 2016. He is the patron of all his religious orders and of the Diocese of Palencia where he served as a bishop. ==Life== Manuel Gonz√°lez Garc√≠a was born to Mart√≠n Gonz√°lez Lara and Antonia Garc√≠a on 25 February 1877 in Seville and had four brothers. Out of the five (including him) he was the fourth born to his parents. In his childhood he joined a church choir and, prior to the age of ten, served as part of the choir in the Cathedral of Seville. Following the realization of his religious vocation during his late childhood, he enlisted in the seminary of Seville at the age of twelve in September 1889 for studies for the priesthood. It was there that he wrote: \\"If I would be born a thousand times; a thousand times I would be a priest\\". He excelled in all his studies and was held in high regard by his teachers. He earned his doctorates in both theology and canon law. He also travelled to Rome to commemorate a jubilee of Pope Leo XIII. He received the subdiaconate in 1900 and also received the diaconate that same year. He was ordained to the priesthood on 21 September 1901 by the Archbishop of Seville Marcelo Spinola y Maestre - future cardinal and Blessed - in the chapel of the episcopal palace of Seville. While a seminarian, Garc√≠a worked at Spinola's newspaper, El Correo de Andaluc√≠a. He celebrated his first Mass on 29 September 1901 in the Church of the Holy Trinity. It was during his first Mass that he entrusted himself to the intercession of Mary, Help of Christians. In 1902, Bishop Spinola sent him to preach a mission in one of the parishes, and Garcia found the church to be unclean and abandoned. He knelt before the tabernacle and decided then and there to dedicate himself to Eucharistic works in praise of Jesus Christ. One of his first positions as a new priest was to act as the chaplain of the nursing home of the Sisters of the Poor of Seville. On 1 March 1902 he was appointed as the parish priest of San Pedro de Huelva and took office there on 9 March, a week later. In Huelva he paid careful attention to the disadvantaged people and promoted schools devoted to assisting them and bringing to them teachings pertaining to the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ. In addition he was also concerned with the working class and helped to provide food for the children whose parents worked as miners; he did this even more so than usual during the winter of the 1913 strike the workers participated in. Garc√≠a, on 4 March 1910, first established the Disciples of Saint John, who were to be devoted to the Eucharist and to Saint John; the order soon spread outside of Spain, across Europe. He travelled to Rome in late 1912 and on 28 November had a private audience with Pope Pius X, who demonstrated a keen interest in his work and his devotion to the Eucharist. Pope Benedict XV appointed him to be the Auxiliary Bishop of Malaga and the Titular Bishop of Olympus on 6 December 1915. This led to his episcopal consecration on 16 January 1916. He was appointed as the Bishop of M√°laga in 1920 and held the post until Pope Pius XI appointed him as the Bishop of Palencia in 1935. He received the gratitude and the affection of all, including King Alfonso XIII, who stated in a telegram: \\"I greet with affection and reverently kiss his pastoral ring\\". He founded the Eucharistic Missionaries of Nazareth while in Palencia and went on to also found the Children of Reparation, as well as the Disciples of Saint John. On 11 May 1936, the episcopal palace of Malaga caught on fire and the fire saw the destruction of art and archival materials, and Garcia came into the palace through the backdoor to see the arsonists who lit the fire. Tomb in Palencia. Garc√≠a fell ill in 1939 during a visit to Zaragoza which saw him transferred to Madrid for treatment. He died in 1940 in a clinic and was buried in the Cathedral of Palencia, where he requested to be buried so that he could be close to the tabernacle. His wish was: \\"I ask to be buried next to a tabernacle, so that my bones, after death, as my tongue and my pen in life, are saying to those who pass: there is Jesus! There it is! Do not leave him abandoned!\\" ==Sainthood== First process and Venerable The process of beatification started on 31 July 1981 in Spain to gather documentation needed for the cause and the commencement of the cause allowed for him to receive the posthumous title Servant of God. This also saw two processes open in Palencia; the first opened on 2 May 1952. One in Malaga was held in 1979 and another in Palencia from 1981 until a year later. The compiled dossier known as the Positio documented his life of heroic virtue and was sent to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 1991. This led to Pope John Paul II proclaiming him to be Venerable on 6 April 1998 on the account of such virtue. Beatification After an independent tribunal investigated a miracle attributed to him it was validated in 1998 and received papal approval; the pope signed a decree recognizing a miracle attributed to him on 29 December 1999, leading to his beatification on 29 April 2001. The miracle took place in Palencia in December 1953 and was the healing of tuberculosis of Sara Ruiz Ortega, then eighteen. Canonization Miracle The second miracle attributed to him was the healing of Mar√≠a del Carmen Feij√≥o Varela. The healing took place in October 2008 when she was diagnosed with an extreme medical illness that progressed into an aggressive cancer which reduced Varela to a weak condition. She requested the last rites but the priest could not make it to her in time and so sent a relic of the late bishop. Less than a week after while retaining the relic, doctors were amazed to see that the cancer had disappeared in full despite a wide range of tests. The medical report declared that \\"there has been a spontaneous regression\\" of the ailment. Process Another miracle was alleged to have been attributed to his intercession and the process that investigated it was validated on 21 October 2011. That process spanned from 7 October 2009 until 31 May 2010. The medical board that advises the Congregation approved the findings of the investigation on 29 October 2015 and the theologians later approved it two less than two months later on 15 December 2015. It then went to the Congregation itself and was approved on 1 March 2016; it went to the pope for approval on 3 March 2016 - and was affirmative - and it allowed for his canonization to take place though a date for the sanctification had to be formalized at a gathering of cardinals held on 20 June.

Kiss died 13 August 1882. Two days later, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Kiss had died in Ventnor on the previous Sunday.

A number were used by the Bolivian Air Force. ==Design and development== Rather little information has survived on the C.97. Although it looked very similar to the Caudron C.59 and used the same engine, it is not on a list of eight other Caudron designs which shared the latter's airframe. The C.97 was a two bay biplane without stagger and with pairs of parallel interplane struts and cabane struts. Its fabric covered, unequal span wings were rectangular in plan apart from a large central cut-out over the fuselage to improve upward vision from the rear cockpit. Ailerons were fitted to the upper wing. Its fuselage was flat sided. An upright, water-cooled Hispano- Suiza 8Ab V-8 engine, a relatively high compression engine developed during World War I as aircraft flew to higher altitudes and so able to cope with the high Andean airfields of Bolivia, sat high in the nose with the fuselage underside curving upwards under it and with a flat fronted, angled cowling above the propeller shaft. Two different radiators were used, one of the cylindrical Lamblin type mounted below the fuselage and the other a shallow but wide rectangular one on the underside. The forward open cockpit was close behind the engine and under the wing, with the instructor's position slightly behind the trailing edge. At the rear the fin was triangular and broad, with a straight edged rudder that reached down to the keel. Since the tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage, the elevators had a large cut-out for rudder movement. The C.97 had a fixed tail skid undercarriage with its mainwheels on a single axle sprung from V-form struts to the lower fuselage longerons. The first flight was probably made in early 1924 as the prototype was registered F-AGBH in April that year. The first Bolivian Air Force machine was delivered on 1 August 1925. The number purchased is not known; L'A√©ronautique in 1927 mentions just one but Flight in 1928 says \\"a number\\". One C.97 was used from mid-1926 by the French-South American Company, based in Buenos Aires in Argentina. The privately owned F-AGBH flew in France until 1926, taking part in competitions like the 1924 Concours Aviation de Tourisme de l'A√©ro-Club de France (aviation touring competition of the French A√©ro-Club). It was next owned by the Compagnie Fran√ßaise d'Aviation until about 1930, when it was exported to Argentina. ==Operators== ;: * Bolivian Air Force ==SpecificationsReferences== C.097 Category:1920s French military trainer aircraft Category:Biplanes Category:Aircraft first flown in 1924 ","title":"Caudron C.97"},{"id":"46339738","text":"Utukuru is a village in Guntur district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

The amount totalled 54 batteries. Under South African control, they were renamed Hilda. The Hilda system was issued to the 250 Air Defence Artillery Group of the South African Air Force, which equipped its 121 and 123 Squadrons with them.

The Launcher loaded three missiles at a go. A five-man complement, a generator and spare missiles were issued to each complement. The launcher and director was deployed by setting up the jacks and were connected to each other via cable link. The operator would launch a missile and guide it along a line of site to an approaching enemy aircraft by a joystick, issuing a radio command.

The artist credit on the album cover is extended to read 'Marc Almond with Alexei Fedorov featuring The Rossia Orchestra Ensemble'. The album was released by Strike Force Entertainment, part of Cherry Red Records, on 6 October 2009. ==Background== Orpheus in Exile is an album of cover versions of songs originally recorded by Vadim Kozin, an artist Almond had already covered two songs by on his 2003 album Heart on Snow. According to an article in Russian magazine New Style the album was self-financed by Almond and recorded in Russia using Russian musicians. Like Heart on Snow, this album is in the Russian traditional music and Russian romance style. The first edition of the album came in a digipak in a card slip sleeve and included an essay by Almond giving extensive background information to Kozin's life. ==Critical reception== Orpheus in Exile was well received by critics overall. John Tatlock of The Quietus calls the album \\"a respectful tribute and joyous celebration rather than an overly reverent imitation\\" as well as \\"a career highlight and a unique window on a marginalised and hidden history\\". Thom Jureck of AllMusic compares \\"the way that Almond resurrects and delivers Kozin's music\\" to \\"the stuff of poetry itself\\" before summarising that the album \\"reflects and invokes the deeper emotions these songs convey in anyone open-minded enough to give them a sincere listen\\". The Daily Express is also positive, calling Almond's approach to \\"these luscious tales of love, loss and bitter fate\\" as \\"masterful\\" in a review by Robert Spellman. The Record Collector review recognises that Almond makes some tough career choices that are sometimes \\"hard to get over\\" but feels that the listener will \\"thoroughly enjoy Almond's heartfelt homage to the late Russian singer Kozin\\", adding that \\"the arrangements and instrumentation are breathtaking at every step\\". The Scotsman review adds a slight reservation to an otherwise positive review, stating that the album is \\"hugely enjoyable, if predictable to anyone already familiar with Almond's chanson repertoire\\". ==Track listing== # \\"Boulevards of Magadan\\" (Vadim Kozin, P Nefedov) ‚Äì 3:26 # \\"Forgotten Tango\\" (Kozin, S Strizhov) ‚Äì 2:43 # \\"My Fire\\" (F Sadovsky, Yakov Polonsky) ‚Äì 3:11 # \\"I Love So Much to Look in Your Eyes\\" (Kozin, unknown) ‚Äì 2:24 # \\"Friendship\\" (V Sodorov, A Shmulyan) ‚Äì 3:34 # \\"Pearly Night\\" (Nikolai Shishkin) ‚Äì 2:51 # \\"Brave Boy\\" (Kozin, Iosif Utkin) ‚Äì 3:07 # \\"Day and Night\\" (Kozin, Rudyard Kipling, N Braun) ‚Äì 2:48 # \\"A Skein of White Cranes\\" (Kozin) ‚Äì 2:47 # \\"Beggar\\" (Alexander Alyabyev, Pierre-Jean de B√©ranger, Dmitri Lensky) ‚Äì 3:20 # \\"When Youth Becomes a Memory\\" (Kozin, Aleksey Fatyanov) ‚Äì 3:27 # \\"Autumn\\" (Kozin, Elizaveta Belogorskaya) ‚Äì 3:13 # \\"Letter from Magadan\\" (Kozin, Nefedov) ‚Äì 3:52 ==Personnel== *Marc Almond ‚Äì vocals *Anatole Sobolev ‚Äì conductor *Orchestra Rossia ‚Äì orchestra *Evgeny Kudryashov (from band Disen Gage) ‚Äì drums, percussion *Timur Pirogov ‚Äì bass, double bass *Igor Uporov ‚Äì rhythm guitar, solo guitar *Sergei Bagin (from band Disen Gage) ‚Äì rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar *Oleg Smirnov (from band Exit Project ‚Äì acoustic guitar *Alexei Fedorov v rhythm guitar, backing vocals *Anatoly Ponomarev ‚Äì bayan *Lyudmila Karpoushkina ‚Äì violins *Dmitri Sadkov ‚Äì grand piano, keyboard instrument *Oleg Anurin (from band Batisfera) ‚Äì grand piano, keyboards, clarinet *Varvara Kalganova ‚Äì grand piano *Katia Strelnitski ‚Äì translations of lyrics from the Russian ==References== Category:2009 albums Category:Covers albums Category:Marc Almond albums Category:Cherry Red Records albums ","title":"Orpheus in Exile"},{"id":"46339833","text":"John \\"Johnny\\" Kenneally (18 June 1898 - 19 January 1957) was an Irish hurler who played as a full-forward for the Cork senior team. Born in Cork, Kenneally first arrived on the inter-county scene when he first linked up with the Cork minor team. He made his senior debut during the 1929 championship. Kenneally later became a regular member of the starting fifteen, and won one All-Ireland medals and two Munster medals on the field of play. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Kenneally won one Railway Cup medal. At club level he was a two-time championship medallist with St. Finbarr's. His brother, Miah Kenneally, also played for Cork while his sister, Mary Kenneally, was an All-Ireland medallist with the Cork senior camogie team. Throughout his career Kenneally made nine championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1937 championship. ==Hurling career== Club In 1932 Kenneally was captain of the St. Finbarr's senior hurling team reached the championship decider. Carrigtwohill provided the opposition, however, the Barr's played with a strong wind in the first half and were 2-1 ahead before Carrig's first score. St. Finbarr's built up a considerable lead at the interval and got another soft goal in the opening minutes of the second half, to lead by fourteen points. For the rest of the match though Carrig fought back. In spite of this, a narrow 5-3 to 4-4 score line secured the title for St. Finbarr's and a first championship medal for Kenneally. Both Kenneally's side and Carrigtwohill met in the county final again in 1933. An exciting game produced a draw. The replay saw St. Finbarr's make no mistake. After taking an early lead they powered to a 6-6 to 5-0 victory. It was Kenneally's second championship medal as captain. Inter-county Kenneally first played for Cork as a member of the minor team in 1928. He won a Munster medal during that campaign as Cork defeated Waterford by 3-4 to 3-2. As the All-Ireland series was delayed by a year, Kenneally was withdrawn from the minor team by the senior selectors. On 11 August 1929 Kenneally made his senior championship debut. The 4-6 to 2-3 defeat of Waterford gave him a Munster medal. On 1 September 1929 Cork faced Galway in the All-Ireland final for the second successive year. Little had changed in a year as Cork were on the top of their game again. A rout ensued as \\"the Rebels\\" and Kenneally, who came on as a sub, claimed the All-Ireland title following a 4-9 to 1-3 victory. Kenneally was confined to the substitutes' bench for much of the 1931 championship campaign. He won a second Munster medal that year following a 5-4 to 1-2 defeat of Waterford in a replay. Kenneally later collected a second All-Ireland medal as a substitute as Cork secured the title following a three-game saga with Kilkenny. Inter- provincial Kenneally was selected for duty with Munster in the inter- provincial championship in 1934. Reigning champions Leinster were the opponents and a high-scoring game developed. A 6-3 to 3-2 2 victory gave Kenneally a Railway Cup medal. ==Death== On 19 January 1957, Kenneally died from lung cancer aged 58. ==Honours== ;St. Finbarr's *Cork Senior Hurling Championship (2): 1932 (c), 1933 (c) ;Cork *All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (2): 1929, 1931 (sub) *Munster Senior Hurling Championship (2): 1929, 1931 *Munster Minor Hurling Championship (1): 1928 ;Munster *Railway Cup (1): 1934 ==References== Category:1898 births Category:1957 deaths Category:St. Finbarr's hurlers Category:Cork inter-county hurlers Category:Munster inter-provincial hurlers Category:All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship winners ","title":"Johnny Kenneally"},{"id":"46339875","text":"Locusta migratoria manilensis, commonly known as the Oriental migratory locust, is a subspecies of the migratory locust (L. migratoria) in the family Acrididae. It is sufficiently different in size and structure from the African migratory locust to be considered a distinct subspecies of the migratory locust. It is found in southeastern Asia and is an important agricultural pest in the region. It is normally a solitary insect but when conditions are suitable, it enters into a gregarious phase when the young form into bands which move together and the adults into swarms. Although outbreaks may have recently been fewer in number and size because of changes in agricultural practices and better locust detection, the insects remain active as crop pests and the potential for outbreaks is still present. ==Description== The Oriental migratory locust is slightly smaller than the African migratory locust. It can exist in two phases, solitary and gregarious. The solitary adults are either green or brown, but as the insects become more crowded together, then brown individuals predominate. The nymphs or hoppers are greyish-brown when they first hatch but their colour changes to either green or brown as they grow, with brown being more common in dry conditions. When their densities increase and they begin to form hopper bands, the colour becomes orangeish-brown or reddish-brown, with black markings. ==Distribution== The Oriental migratory locust is found in southeastern Asia. Outbreaks have occurred in western Malaysia, Sabah, eastern China and the Philippines. Plagues of swarming locusts have occurred in these areas and as far away as Thailand, Malaysia, Java, Sulawesi and the southern tip of Japan. ==Life cycle== The adult female Oriental migratory locust deposits a number of egg pods in the ground over the course of a few weeks. The sites selected include soft soils such as volcanic ash, alluvial soils and sand. Each pod contains between fifteen and a hundred eggs and most females lay from two to seven pods during the breeding season. The eggs hatch 10 to 24 days later and the nymphs develop through 5 or 6 instars, taking between 26 and 61 days to fully develop. Females do not lay eggs when the temperature is below , and above this temperature, development times reduces as the temperature rises until is reached, after which no further reduction takes place. Locusts change their behaviour and are attracted to each other when there are large numbers in close proximity. This behaviour starts when the nymphs are quite small and form a band that move together as a cohesive unit. The band of hoppers can travel a distance of up to per day, mostly moving downhill, stopping sporadically to feed and bask in the sun. When the insects are fully developed and have wings, they stay together as a swarm. Solitary adults usually fly by night but gregarious ones fly by day. The new adults mature and become sexually active in three or four weeks. There may be up to five generations per year in the Philippines, but in the cooler parts of China, there may be just one or two. ==Outbreaks== Outbreaks tend to originate in two types of habitat; soft flood plains periodically inundated by floodwater and forest clearings. In the latter case, the land is cleared for growing crops but when the soil is exhausted it is abandoned and cultivation moves elsewhere. The grasses and weeds that grow in the clearing provide food for locust nymphs and cultivated areas nearby provide soft soil for mass egg deposition. A serious outbreak of the Oriental migratory locust occurred in Indonesia in 1997-1998. It was first observed in the provinces of Lampung, South Sumatra and Bengkulu in 1997 and then seemed to disappear. It reappeared early in 1998 and intensified, with nearly 20,000 hectares of rice and 15,000 hectares of maize being affected. It may have been triggered by the drought conditions of 1997. Outbreaks in China historically occurred about every ten years, usually after dry summers were succeeded by warm winters. The swarms were mostly restricted by the surrounding uplands to the river valleys. Low-lying land that floods intermittently in the delta areas of the Yellow River has been identified as outbreak centres. During the period 2002 to 2006, outbreaks of hopper bands in this locality were biologically controlled with the fungal pathogen Metarhizium acridum by ground and aerial applications, giving a kill rate greater than 90%. In the Philippines, there were four major plagues in the first half of the twentieth century. They seem to have originated in southern Mindanao around Sarangani Bay. They tended to follow periods of below average rainfall. Since about 1960, the Oriental migratory locust has been less of a problem in the Philippines, probably because cultivation practices have changed and there is less untended grassland where populations can build up undetected. An outbreak in southern Japan was discovered on an uninhabited island in 1986. A wildfire had restricted the area available to the locusts for feeding and later provided ideal conditions for egg deposition. Hopper bands with a density of 1000 insects per square metre roamed around and swarms of adults occurred over the whole island; the outbreak was brought under control later in the year by spraying. ==References== Category:Locusts Category:Orthoptera of Asia Category:Insects described in 1835 ","title":"Locusta migratoria manilensis"},{"id":"46339882","text":"Mukhtiar Chadha is a Punjabi romantic comedy film starring Diljit Dosanjh and Oshin Brar.

The regiment was created by the conversion of the 10th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment. The regiment served in North-west Europe from June 1944 to May 1945. ==Origin== The regiment was formed by converting the 10th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment, a war service battalion raised in July 1940 serving with the 201st Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), along with the 9th Hampshires. The regiment was commanded by Lt. Col. A.R.W.S. Koe. In common with all other infantry battalions that were transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps, the personnel would have still continued to wear their Hampshire Regiment cap badges on the black beret of the Royal Armoured Corps. The regiment named their tanks after famous past battles fought by the Hampshire Regiment, the CO's tank being named \\"Minden\\". ==Service== The regiment, equipped with Churchill tanks, was assigned to the 34th Army Tank Brigade (34th Tank Brigade from June 1942) in December 1941. Serving alongside 147 RAC was the North Irish Horse and 153 RAC. In June 1942, the brigade became part of the 1st Mixed Infantry Division as part of an experiment with 'Mixed Divisions', of one armoured and two infantry brigades. In September, it was transferred to the 43rd Mixed Infantry Division, training in infantry-tank co-operation. However, in September 1943, the brigade became an independent brigade after the experiment with 'Mixed Divisions' was abandoned. In late June 1944, 147 RAC was sent, with the rest of the brigade, overseas to France as part of the invasion of Normandy and fought in the Normandy Campaign in particular during Operation Greenline, part of the Second Battle of the Odon launched in mid- July. During the battle, 147 RAC suffered 47 casualties between 15‚Äì18 July. The regiment continued to serve with the brigade in Normandy until the breakout and later in the Siege of Le Havre (Operation Astonia), the Battle of the Reichswald (Operation Veritable, where the regiment suffered very heavy casualties and could only muster two weak squadrons) in February 1945, and the crossing of the River Rhine (Operation Plunder), when the Allies invaded Germany in March 1945. After Victory in Europe Day, on 8 May 1945, the regiment and brigade began preparing for service in the South-East Asian theatre. These preparations were halted as a result of the Japanese surrender. ==References== Category:Regiments of the Royal Armoured Corps Category:Royal Hampshire Regiment Category:Military units and formations in Hampshire ","title":"147th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps"},{"id":"46340095","text":"Gypospirifer is an extinct genus of articulate brachiopod fossils belonging to the family Trigonotretidae.

During the rule of the Visconti in the 14th century, a larger church was constructed in the Lombard Gothic style. In the 16th century it was rebuilt, and at this time semi-circular arches replaced the earlier pointed arches.

After that, he played the mute father of the lead in Escalofr√≠o (Shiver), directed by Isidro Ortiz and produced by Guillermo del Toro. In 2009, Stamm played a Nazi officer on the run in Tornarem (transl.‚ÄúWe'll be back‚Äù), by Mireia Ros. He later appeared in the feature films Mr. Nice, directed by Bernard Rose and starring Rhys Ifans; Fuga de cerebros 2 (‚ÄúBrain loss, 2‚Äù), by Carlos Ther√≥n, and later on Sonata Para Violoncelo (Sonata for Celo), by Anna M. Bofarull. He did the voice-over for three supporting roles for the Spanish synchronization of Ron Howard's Angels & Demons, starring Tom Hanks, giving his characters German or Italian accents when speaking Spanish. He appeared over several episodes, of Spanish TV series including El Barco (‚ÄúThe Boat‚Äù; Antena3), La Rep√∫blica 2 (‚ÄúThe Republic, 2, TVE), Gran Hotel (\\"Grand Hotel\\", Antena3), and The Avatars on the Disney Channel. The more than 50 short films and web series in which Stamm starred or co-starred included Desenterrados (Engl. Title Unearthed), a three times Los Angeles Web Festival 2012 awarded web series by Xavi Cort√©s, the short films La rosa del desierto (‚ÄúDesert Rose‚Äù), by Emilio Alonso, and Carne de gaviota (‚ÄúSeagull meat‚Äù), by Felipe Espinosa, as well as the award-winning The Crononaut, by D√©sir√©e Haupt, and Errarte en la sombra (\\"Erring you in the shadow\\"), the short films La calle es mia (‚ÄúThis street is mine‚Äù), by Javi Gonzalez, for which Stamm was nominated for Best Actor at the Godar√≠n Awards, and If My Father Knew, filmed by Stamm, for which he was nominated Best Actor in a Monologue, at the TESPO Awards 2009. In 2013 Stamm played the role of Frank, a man between two women, whose fear of being left alone had driven him to inflict blindness upon himself, in Impar (‚ÄúUneven‚Äù), by Sergio Domingez. El Balcon de la Espera premiered in ‚ÄúThe Little Secret Films‚Äù in 2015. In 2014, Stamm was hired by Artistic Metropol to portray Ted, the vampire hunter and leading character of Victor Matellano's 2015 film Vampyres, a re-make of the 1970s cult film Vampyres, with English actress Caroline Munro. In the comedy Rey gitano (‚ÄúGipsy King‚Äù), by Goya Award-winning Juanma Bajo Ulloa, he played the German minister advisor L. Br√ºcken; in the home eviction drama Cerca de tu casa (\\"Near your home\\"), directed by Eduard Cort√©s, he played the rich home owner G√ºnther, and in the comedy Perdiendo el Norte (‚ÄúLosing the North‚Äù, which in Spanish also means 'losing one's mind'), by Nacho G. Velilla, about two unemployed Spanish friends, an economist and a scientist, who try their luck in Germany, he played an investigator who puts his language skills on the stand. Also that year, he appeared on the Spanish television series Cu√©ntame c√≥mo pas√≥ (‚ÄúTell me how it happened‚Äù; TVE), in its 16th season, as Manuel, as well as in the series Sin identidad(‚ÄúWithout Identity‚Äù; Antena3). == References == Category:German male film actors Category:German male television actors Category:German emigrants to Spain Category:Heidelberg University alumni Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Expatriate actors in Spain Category:German expatriates in Spain Category:Male actors of German descent ","title":"Christian Stamm"},{"id":"46340291","text":"Battle for Donetsk is a topical video game by the independent Belgian game development company LuGus Studios. The game aims to raise awareness of the conflict between the Donetsk People's Republic and the Ukrainian government forces. The game can be played in-browser with the Unity webplayer plugin or on Android devices. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses either the Donetsk People's Republic, a separatist group in eastern Ukraine, or the Ukrainian government forces to fight a battle against the other party. However, the game cannot be won in a traditional way. At the end of each battle the player, regardless of their performance, is shown a \\"you lost\\" screen displaying the number of civilian casualties caused by their actions. To win the game, the player has to take no action for 60 seconds. Battle for Donetsk was developed over a period of three weeks and was self-financed by LuGus Studios. The game was simultaneously released on 15 March 2015 on the Google Play Storehttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lugus.battlefordonetsk&hl;=nl and on the game's website.http://www.battlefordonetsk.com/game/BattleForDonetsk.html ==Reception== The game has been widely noticed by the press, chiefly in the Ukrainian and Russian media. Two weeks after release, the Android version of the game had been downloaded more than 50,000 times. While the Play Store ratings show mostly positive reactions, some users question the intentions of the developer. LuGus Studios has stated it does not wish to take a political stance and does not condone violence and conflict. ==ReferencesPopular Science: http://www.popsci.com/fight-ukraine-war-your- browser * Deutsche Welle: http://dw.de/p/1ExsT * Het Belang Van Limburg: http://m.hbvl.be/cnt/dmf20150330_01605199/genks-oorlogsspel-hype-in-oekraine- en-rusland Category:2015 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Browser games Category:Platform games Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Video games set in Ukraine Category:Video games developed in Belgium ","title":"Battle for Donetsk"},{"id":"46340372","text":"Brian Jagde is an American operatic tenor.

Consequences of the restriction include fines for unauthorized surveys, lack of geotagging information on many cameras when the GPS chip detects a location within China, incorrect alignment of street maps with satellite maps in various applications, and seeming unlawfulness of crowdsourced mapping efforts such as OpenStreetMap. == Legislation == According to articles 7, 26, 40 and 42 of the Surveying and Mapping Law of the People's Republic of China, private surveying and mapping activities have been illegal in mainland China since 2002. The law prohibits Fines range from 10,000 to 500,000 CNY ($ ‚Äì $ USD). Foreign individuals or organizations that wish to conduct surveying must form a Chinese-foreign joint venture. Between 2006 and 2011, the authorities pursued nearly 40 illegal cases of mapping and surveying. The media has reported on other cases of unlawful surveys: * March 7, 2007 - Japanese and Korean scholars fined; joint-venture Weihai hired foreign surveyors without approval from the government * March 25, 2008 - China's State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping cracks down on some of the 10,000 websites that publish maps in China, most without authorization. * January 6, 2009 - Chinese authorities fine UK students for ‚Äúillegal map-making activities‚Äù. * 2010 - Chinese authorities to crack down on the unregistered or illegal among 42,000 online map providers, targeting incorrect information and leaks of sensitive information involving state secrets. New standards require all Internet map providers to keep servers storing map data inside China. * March 14, 2014 - Coca-Cola is accused of illegal mapping. As a consequence, major digital camera manufacturers including Panasonic, Leica, FujiFilm, Nikon and Samsung restrict location information within China. OpenStreetMap, the crowdsourced project to assemble a map of the world, advises that \\"private surveying and mapping activities are illegal in China\\". == Coordinate systems == JavaScript implementation of coordinate \\"processing\\" methods used in China Chinese regulations mandate that approved map service providers in China use a specific coordinate system, called GCJ-02. Baidu Maps uses yet another coordinate system - BD-09, which seems to be based on GCJ-02.  GCJ-02  GCJ-02 (colloquially Mars Coordinates, officially ) is a geodetic datum formulated by the Chinese State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping (), and based on WGS-84. It uses an obfuscation algorithm which adds apparently random offsets to both the latitude and longitude, with the alleged goal of improving national security. There is a license fee associated with using this mandatory algorithm in China. A marker with GCJ-02 coordinates will be displayed at the correct location on a GCJ-02 map. However, the offsets can result in a 100 - 700 meter error from the actual location if a WGS-84 marker (such as a GPS location) is placed on a GCJ-02 map, or vice versa. The Google.com street map is offset by 50‚Äì500 meters from its satellite imagery, while the Google.cn map is not. Yahoo! Maps also displays the street map without major errors when compared to the satellite imagery. MapQuest overlays OpenStreetMap data perfectly as well. Despite the secrecy surrounding the GCJ-02 obfuscation, several open-source projects exist that provide conversions between GCJ-02 and WGS-84, for languages including C#, C, Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, R, and Ruby. They appear to be based on leaked code for the WGS to GCJ part. Other solutions to the conversion involve interpolating coordinates based on regression from a data set of Google China and satellite imagery coordinates. An attempt by Wu Yongzheng using fast Fourier transform analysis gave a result much like the leaked code. From the leaked code, GCJ-02 uses parameters from the SK-42 reference system. The parameters were used to calculate lengths of one degree of latitude and longitude, so that offsets in meters previously calculated can be converted to degrees for the WGS-84 input coordinates.  BD-09  BD-09 is a geographic coordinate system used by Baidu Maps, adding further obfuscation to GCJ-02 \\"to better protect users' privacy\\". Baidu provides an API call to convert from Google or GPS (WGS-84), GCJ-02, BD-09, or coordinates into Baidu or GCJ-02 coordinates. As required by local law, there is no API to convert into WGS-84, but open source implementations in R and various other languages exist.  Reverse transformation  GCJ-02 appears to use multiple high-frequency noises of the form 20n \\\\sin{}(180 k \\\\times lat_{rad}), effectively generating a transcendental equation and thus eliminating analytical solutions. However, the open-source \\"reverse\\" transformations make use of the properties of GCJ-02 that the transformed coordinates are not too far from WGS-84 and are mostly monotonic related to corresponding WGS-84 coordinates: from typing import Callable # Represent coordinates with complex numbers for simplicity coords = complex # Coords-to- coords function C2C = Callable coords], coords] def rev_transform_rough(bad: coords, worsen: C2C) -> coords: \\"\\"\\"Roughly reverse the \`\`worsen\`\` transformation. Since \`\`bad = worsen(good)\`\` is close to \`\`good\`\`, \`\`worsen(bad) - bad\`\` can be used to approximate \`\`bad - good\`\`. First seen in eviltransform. \\"\\"\\" return bad - (worsen(bad) - bad) def rev_transform(bad: coords, worsen: C2C) -> coords: \\"\\"\\"More precisely reverse the \`\`worsen\`\` transformation. Similar to \`\`rev_transform_rough\`\`, \`\`worsen(a) - worsen(b)\`\` can be used to approximate \`\`a - b\`\`. First seen in geoChina/R/cst.R (caijun 2014). Iteration-only version (without rough initialization) has been known since fengzee-me/ChinaMapShift (November 2013). \\"\\"\\" eps = 1e-6 wgs = rev_transform_rough(bad, worsen) improvement = 99 + 99j # dummy value while abs(improvement) > eps: improvement = worsen(wgs) - bad wgs = wgs - improvement return wgs The rough method is reported to give some 1~2 meter accuracy for wgs2gcj, while the exact (fixed point iteration) method is able to get \\"centimeter accuracy\\" in two calls to the forward function. Since the two properties ensure some basic functionality of the coordinate system, it is unlikely that the methods will change with new coordinate systems. The BD-to- GCJ code works in a manner much like the rough method, except that it removes the explicitly-applied constant shift of ~20 seconds of arc on both coordinates first and works in polar coordinates like the forward function does. The establishment of working conversion methods both ways largely renders obsolete datasets for deviations mentioned below. == GPS shift problem == Google Maps displays satellite imagery using the WGS-84 coordinate system, and street maps using the GCJ-02 datum The China GPS shift (or offset) problem is a class of issues stemming from the difference between the GCJ-02 and WGS-84 datums. Global Positioning System coordinates are expressed using the WGS-84 standard and when plotted on street maps of China that follow the GCJ-02 coordinates, they appear off by a large (often over 500 meters) and variable amount. Authorized providers of location-based services and digital maps (such as AutoNavi or NavInfo) must purchase a \\"shift correction\\" algorithm that enables plotting GPS locations correctly on the map. Satellite imagery and user-contributed street map data sets, such as those from OpenStreetMap also display correctly because they have been collected using GPS devices (albeit technically illegally - see Legislation). Some map providers, such as Here, choose to also offset their satellite imagery layer to match the GCJ-02 street map. Google has worked with Chinese location-based service provider AutoNavi since 2006 to source its maps in China. google.cn/maps (formerly Google Ditu) uses the GCJ-02 system for both its street maps and satellite imagery. However, the WGS-84 positions reported by a browser are depicted at the wrong positions. On the contrary, google.com/maps also uses GCJ-02 data for the street map, but does not shift the satellite imagery layer, which continues to use WGS-84 coordinates, with the benefit that WGS-84 positions can still be overlaid correctly on the satellite image (but not the street map). Google Earth also uses WGS-84 to display the satellite imagery. Overlaying GPS tracks on Google.com Maps and any street maps sourced from Google.com via its API, will lead to a similar display offset problem, because GPS tracks use WGS-84, and Google.com maps use GCJ-02. The issue has been reported numerous times on the Google Product Forums since 2009, with 3rd party applications emerging to fix it. Data sets with offsets for large lists of Chinese cities existed for sale. The problem was observed as early as 2008, and the causes were unclear, with (misguided) speculation that imported GPS chips were tampered with code that caused incorrect reporting of coordinates.  Hong Kong and Macau  Under One Country Two Systems, legislation in mainland China does not apply in Hong Kong and Macau SARs and there are no similar restrictions in the SARs. Therefore, the GPS shift problem does not apply. However, at the border between the SARs and mainland China, the data shown by online maps are broken where the shifted data and correct data overlap. This poses problems to users travelling across the border, especially visitors not aware of the issue. ==See also== *Geographic information systems in China ==Notes References == Category:Censorship in China Category:Internet censorship in China Category:Web mapping Category:Geographic data and information ","title":"Restrictions on geographic data in China"},{"id":"46340420","text":"The 2015‚Äì16 season was Manchester United's 24th season in the Premier League, and their 41st consecutive season in the top flight of English football. Along with the Premier League, the club also competed in the FA Cup, Football League Cup and UEFA Champions League. Following a third-place finish in their UEFA Champions League group, the club was entered into the last 32 stage of the UEFA Europa League, in which they beat Midtjylland of Denmark, before losing to rivals Liverpool in the round of 16. Manchester United won their 12th FA Cup with a 2‚Äì1 win over Crystal Palace in the final at Wembley Stadium. ==Pre- season and friendlies== Manchester United announced a shortened pre-season tour of the United States on 28 April 2015. The first match against Mexican side Club Am√©rica was played on 17 July at CenturyLink Field in Seattle, and was followed, four days later, by a game against Major League Soccer's San Jose Earthquakes at the Earthquakes' home ground, Avaya Stadium in San Jose. It was originally scheduled to be played at California Memorial Stadium in Berkeley, but it was moved to reduce the amount of travelling the team would have to do. Four days later, Manchester United faced European champions Barcelona at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, before completing the campaign at Chicago's Soldier Field with a game against Paris Saint-Germain. {  - !Date !Opponents !H / A !Result F‚ÄìA !Scorers !Attendance - bgcolor=#ddffdd 17 July 2015 Club Am√©rica N 1‚Äì0 Schneiderlin 5' 46,857 - bgcolor=#ddffdd 21 July 2015 San Jose Earthquakes A 3‚Äì1 Mata 32', Depay 36', A.

Manchester United began their campaign with a 1‚Äì0 win at home to Tottenham Hotspur on 8 August, with an own goal from Kyle Walker proving the difference between the two teams. United then went top of the League for the first time since August 2013 with another 1‚Äì0 win over Aston Villa at Villa Park the following Friday; Adnan Januzaj's goal in the 29th minute was his first since April 2014. The game had moved to Friday for policing reasons due to an English Defence League march in nearby Walsall the following day, a decision which also gave United an extra day to prepare for their UEFA Champions League play-off against Club Brugge. United kept a third clean sheet in a row at home to Newcastle United on 22 August, but the forwards were unable to find the net and the match finished as a goalless draw. In the final fixture before the first international break, United conceded their first goals of the season as they lost 2‚Äì0 to Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium. After going ahead early in the second half through Juan Mata, they conceded twice in five minutes just after the hour mark, first to a header from Andr√© Ayew, who then provided the assist for Baf√©timbi Gomis. September Following the international break, Manchester United returned to action with a home match against Liverpool. The first half was goalless, but goals from Daley Blind and Ander Herrera gave them the lead going into the last ten minutes. Christian Benteke then pulled one back for Liverpool with a bicycle kick before deadline day signing Anthony Martial scored a debut goal to seal a 3‚Äì1 win. Martial continued his scoring when United won 3‚Äì2 away to Southampton. Graziano Pell√® first gave Southampton the lead before Martial scored a brace; the first goal before halftime and the second goal after. United also added a third goal from Juan Mata before Pell√® could score his second and the final goal of the match. On 26 September, United went on top of the league for the first time in over two years after beating Sunderland at home. Memphis Depay opened the scoring in first half stoppage time and Wayne Rooney scored 40 seconds into the second half ‚Äì ending his longest barren spell in the Premier League after not scoring in 11 matches ‚Äì before Juan Mata scored the final goal in the last minute of regular time to secure a 3‚Äì0 win. October In their next match, 4 October, the last match before a new international break, United suffered a 3‚Äì0 defeat against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium, which was their worst defeat against the Gunners in the league for 17 years. Arsenal drew first blood through an Alexis S√°nchez goal in the sixth minute before Mesut √ñzil added to the score barely 74 seconds later. S√°nchez completed his brace in the 19th minute to condemn United to their second loss in the League this season, which made United drop to third in the league standings, behind Arsenal on goal difference. After the international break, United travelled to Goodison Park to play Everton. After having lost 3‚Äì0 at the stadium the previous season, they won by the same scoreline after two early goals from Morgan Schneiderlin, Ander Herrera and a goal in the 62nd minute from United captain and former Everton player Wayne Rooney. Their next match was the Manchester derby against Manchester City at Old Trafford. The match ended goalless, for the first time since 2010. Their next game, against Crystal Palace ended goalless as well, meaning United were down to fourth place at the end of the month. November United's first match of November saw them beat West Bromwich Albion 2‚Äì0 at Old Trafford. Jesse Lingard scored his first goal for the club seven minutes into the second half. In the first minute of stoppage time, West Brom went down to ten men after Gareth McAuley was sent off following a foul on Anthony Martial, which gave United a penalty, which Juan Mata took to seal the win for United. After another international break, United faced Watford at Vicarage Road for the first time since 2006. Memphis Depay opened the scoring in the 11th minute after he volleyed a cross from Ander Herrera. Watford equalised late on through a Troy Deeney penalty, but then he put it into his own goal in stoppage time to give United back‚Äìto‚Äìback victories. On the following Saturday, they travelled to the King Power Stadium to play Leicester City. Jamie Vardy opened the scoring in the 24th minute, scoring in his 11th consecutive game. Bastian Schweinsteiger levelled the match before half‚Äìtime, and no goals were scored in the second half, meaning both sides shared the points. December The club's first match of December was a goalless draw against West Ham United at Old Trafford. On 12 December, United travelled to Dean Court to face AFC Bournemouth, who were new to the Premier League. They fell behind after two minutes when Junior Stanislas struck the first goal from a corner. Marouane Fellaini levelled 22 minutes later, but Bournemouth hit back after Joshua King headed home the winner in the 54th minute. They then suffered a second loss in a row, this time at home to another newly promoted side, this time it was Norwich City. Cameron Jerome headed in the opener seven minutes before half‚Äìtime, then Alexander Tettey put the visitors 2‚Äì0 up in the 54th minute. Martial pulled one back but it was not enough, and it meant United were out of the top four (and, like in the 2013‚Äì14 season, when David Moyes was manager) they stayed out for the remainder of the season. On Boxing Day, United travelled to the Britannia Stadium to face Stoke City. Yet again, it was another defeat, this time it was 2‚Äì0, meaning that United lost three matches in a row like what happened in May the previous season. Their final game of 2015 was a goalless draw at home to struggling and defending champions Chelsea. This meant United ended 2015 in sixth position after a run of six league games without a win, their worst run of results since January 1990. January United started 2016 with a home game against Swansea, and gained revenge on the Swans for their three‚Äìstraight defeats by winning 2‚Äì1. It was United's first win since the away match against Watford in November. Anthony Martial headed in the opener two minutes into the second half. Gylfi Sigur√∞sson levelled in the 70th minute, but seven minutes later, Wayne Rooney flicked home the winner. Their next match saw them travel to St James' Park to play Newcastle. Rooney scored a penalty in the ninth minute before Jesse Lingard added his name to the scoresheet 29 minutes later. Georgino Wijnaldum pulled one back for Newcastle before half‚Äìtime, then in the second half, Newcastle scored a penalty courtesy of Aleksandar Mitroviƒá in the 67th minute. Twelve minutes later, Rooney pulled one back for United, but Paul Dummett equalised in the 90th minute, ending the match 3‚Äì3. United returned to winning ways in their next match, defeating arch-rivals Liverpool 1-0, courtesy of a late Wayne Rooney strike. However United struggled initially to build on this victory, losing their next match at home to Southampton, with Charlie Austin scoring a late winner. United were subsequently booed off at full time by their fans. This result left United five points off of the top four at the end of the month. February United kick-started February in scintillating form, defeating Stoke City 3‚Äì0 at Old Trafford. Jesse Lingard, Antony Martial and Wayne Rooney supplied the goals. In the next game, United secured a strong point against Chelsea, drawing 1-1. Jesse Lingard opened the scoring on the hour mark, before a defensive lapse allowed Diego Costa to rescue a point for Chelsea in the closing stages of the match. One week later, United suffered a surprise defeat to relegation-contenders Sunderland, going down 2‚Äì0. Anthony Martial cancelled out an early Wahbi Khazri opener, before a De Gea own goal provided Sunderland with the three points. An injury-hit United however rallied in their next match, gaining a surprise (given the circumstances) victory over Arsenal at Old Trafford, winning 3‚Äì2. This game was noticeable for the emergence of Marcus Rashford, who scored a brace on his Premier League debut. Danny Welbeck and Mesut √ñzil both scored for Arsenal, yet Rashford's brace and a deflected Ander Herrera effort secured the win for United. March United won their opening fixture in March, defeating a stubborn Watford side 1-0, with Juan Mata securing the three points with an 83rd minute free-kick. However, in the next fixture, United lost 1-0 to West Bromwich Albion. Juan Mata was sent off in the first half, with United struggling with the man disadvantage. This was West Bromwich Albion's first home victory over United in 32 years. United's next match was away to rivals Manchester City. Both sides were embroiled in a battle for a place in the Champions League. United won the derby, with Marcus Rashford continuing his meteoric rise by scoring the winner. Rashford became the youngest scorer in the history of the Manchester derby after his goal. The win kept the top-four hopes of United alive. Manager Louis Van Gaal also attracted praise for placing his faith in his young squad. This faith reaped dividends as United marched on. April United maintained momentum by beating Everton 1-0 at the start of April. Anthony Martial continued his fine season by scoring a second-half winner. This win left United just one point behind fourth-placed Manchester City. Yet United were unable to capitalise on their recent gains, losing 3‚Äì0 to Tottenham in the next game. This meant United fell further behind City. Yet United returned to winning ways in their next match ‚Äì defeating Aston Villa 1‚Äì0. Once again, Marcus Rashford scored the winner. United rounded off April with a 2‚Äì0 win over Crystal Palace. A Damien Delaney own goal was followed up by a Matteo Darmian effort to keep United in the top-four race. May United began the final month of the season with a 1‚Äì1 home draw against eventual champions Leicester. Antony Martial gave United an early lead, yet Wes Morgan equalised. Despite dominating possession, United were unable to force a winner. United kept their Champions League hopes alive with a 1-0 away victory over Norwich City. Juan Mata scored the winner. After Manchester City slipped up, United knew two wins from their final two games would secure a top-four finish. However United failed to capitalise on this opportunity, losing 3‚Äì2 at West Ham, a club that also had an outside chance of claiming a top-four finish. This was the final game at the Boleyn Ground. United led the match 2‚Äì1 courtesy of an Anthony Martial double, yet West Ham produced a late fightback, which appeared to doom any chance of a top-four finish for United. United required Manchester City to lose to Swansea to stand any reasonable chance of a top-four finish. United had a home fixture with Bournemouth to end the campaign. However, while both games were due to kick-off at the same time on 15 May, a 'suspect package' was found at Old Trafford, leading to a full stadium evacuation. The match was eventually postponed amid safety fears. The incident was subsequently revealed to be a hoax, being labelled a 'fiasco'. This bizarre set of circumstances deprived United of a chance to apply pressure on City. City drew at Swansea, all but securing Champions League football. United's match against Bournemouth was re-arranged for midweek. United brought the curtain down on the campaign in style, winning 3‚Äì1. Wayne Rooney, Marcus Rashford and Ashley Young scored the goals. After 38 games, United secured a haul of 66 points, good for fifth position. This finish secured Europa League football for the 2016‚Äì17 season. {  - !Date !Opponents !H / A !Result F‚ÄìA !Scorers !Attendance !League position - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 8 August 2015 Tottenham Hotspur H 1‚Äì0 Walker 22' (o.g.) 75,261 4th - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 14 August 2015 Aston Villa A 1‚Äì0 Januzaj 29' 42,200 1st - bgcolor=\\"#ffffdd\\" 22 August 2015 Newcastle United H 0‚Äì0  75,354 2nd - bgcolor=\\"#ffdddd\\" 30 August 2015 Swansea City A 0‚Äì2  20,828 5th - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 12 September 2015 Liverpool H 3‚Äì1 Blind 49', Herrera 70' (pen.), Martial 86' 75,347 2nd - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 20 September 2015 Southampton A 3‚Äì2 Martial (2) 34', 50', Mata 68' 31,588 2nd - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 26 September 2015 Sunderland H 3‚Äì0 Depay 45+4', Rooney 46', Mata 90' 75,328 1st - bgcolor=\\"#ffdddd\\" 4 October 2015 Arsenal A 0‚Äì3  60,084 3rd - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 17 October 2015 Everton A 3‚Äì0 Schneiderlin 18', Herrera 22', Rooney 62' 39,553 2nd - bgcolor=\\"#ffffdd\\" 25 October 2015 Manchester City H 0‚Äì0  75,329 4th - bgcolor=\\"#ffffdd\\" 31 October 2015 Crystal Palace A 0‚Äì0  24,854 4th - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 7 November 2015 West Bromwich Albion H 2‚Äì0 Lingard 52', Mata 90+1' (pen.) 75,410 4th - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 21 November 2015 Watford A 2‚Äì1 Depay 11', Deeney 90' (o.g.) 20,702 2nd - bgcolor=\\"#ffffdd\\" 28 November 2015 Leicester City A 1‚Äì1 Schweinsteiger 45' 32,115 3rd - bgcolor=\\"#ffffdd\\" 5 December 2015 West Ham United H 0‚Äì0  75,350 4th - bgcolor=\\"#ffdddd\\" 12 December 2015 AFC Bournemouth A 0‚Äì2  11,334 4th - bgcolor=\\"#ffdddd\\" 19 December 2015 Norwich City H 0‚Äì2  75,320 5th - bgcolor=\\"#ffdddd\\" 26 December 2015 Stoke City A 0‚Äì2  27,426 6th - bgcolor=\\"#ffffdd\\" 28 December 2015 Chelsea H 0‚Äì0  75,275 6th - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 2 January 2016 Swansea City H 2‚Äì1 Martial 47', Rooney 77' 75,415 5th - bgcolor=\\"#ffffdd\\" 12 January 2016 Newcastle United A 3‚Äì3 Rooney (2) 9' (pen.), 79', Lingard 38' 49,673 6th - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 17 January 2016 Liverpool A 1‚Äì0 Rooney 78' 43,865 5th - bgcolor=\\"#ffdddd\\" 23 January 2016 Southampton H 0‚Äì1  75,408 5th - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 2 February 2016 Stoke City H 3‚Äì0 Lingard 14', Martial 23', Rooney 53' 75,234 5th - bgcolor=\\"#ffffdd\\" 7 February 2016 Chelsea A 1‚Äì1 Lingard 61' 41,434 5th - bgcolor=\\"#ffdddd\\" 13 February 2016 Sunderland A 0‚Äì2  41,687 5th - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 28 February 2016 Arsenal H 3‚Äì2 Rashford (2) 29', 32', Herrera 65' 75,329 5th - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 2 March 2016 Watford H 1‚Äì0 Mata 83' 75,282 5th - bgcolor=\\"#ffdddd\\" 6 March 2016 West Bromwich Albion A 0‚Äì1  24,878 6th - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 20 March 2016 Manchester City A 1‚Äì0 Rashford 16' 54,557 6th - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 3 April 2016 Everton H 1‚Äì0 Martial 54' 75,341 5th - bgcolor=\\"#ffdddd\\" 10 April 2016 Tottenham Hotspur A 0‚Äì3  35,761 5th - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 16 April 2016 Aston Villa H 1‚Äì0 Rashford 32' 75,411 5th - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 20 April 2016 Crystal Palace H 2‚Äì0 Delaney 4' (o.g.), Darmian 55' 75,277 5th - bgcolor=\\"#ffffdd\\" 1 May 2016 Leicester City H 1‚Äì1 Martial 8' 75,275 5th - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 7 May 2016 Norwich City A 1‚Äì0 Mata 72' 27,132 5th - bgcolor=\\"#ffdddd\\" 10 May 2016 West Ham United A 0‚Äì3  34,602 5th - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 17 May 2016 AFC Bournemouth H 3‚Äì1 Rooney 43', Rashford 74', Young 87' 74,363 5th } ==FA Cup== United entered the FA Cup in the third round together with the other Premier League clubs, as well as those from the Championship. The draw was made on 7 December 2015, which saw United drawn at home to Sheffield United from League One. United got their first shot on target through substitute Memphis Depay, who was fouled in second half stoppage time by Dean Hammond for a penalty kick, from which Wayne Rooney scored the only goal with United's only other shot on target. Manager Louis van Gaal was under pressure for Manchester United's poor form prior to the match, and the victory was compared to one in the same competition in 1990, in which a goal by Mark Robins reportedly saved the career of Alex Ferguson. Twenty days later in the next round, United travelled to Pride Park to play Derby County, situated in the play-off places in the Championship. Rooney scored the first goal from outside the penalty area, but George Thorne soon equalised. In the second half, further United goals by Daley Blind and Juan Mata relieved Van Gaal of further pressure; it was the first time in 15 games that the team won by a margin of more than one goal. On 22 February, United played the fifth round away at League One strugglers Shrewsbury Town. Chris Smalling opened the scoring, and Mata doubled the advantage in first-half added time. Jesse Lingard confirmed a 3‚Äì0 win with about half an hour left to play; in the closing stages United had to play with only 10 men when Will Keane was injured and no substitutes remained. United hosted their sixth-round match against top-flight opponents West Ham United on 13 March. The visitors took the lead via a free-kick from Dimitri Payet, and only seven minutes remained when the hosts equalised with Anthony Martial's close-range finish. A month later, the game went to a replay, the final FA Cup match at the Boleyn Ground. A curled effort from Marcus Rashford gave Manchester United a lead in the second half, and the lead was doubled by Marouane Fellaini. West Ham halved the deficit late on after James Tomkins' header passed into David de Gea's net, and they threatened an equaliser but could not achieve it. On 23 April, Manchester United travelled to Wembley to play Everton in the semi-finals. Martial assisted Fellaini to open the scoring against his former team, giving a half- time lead. After the break, a penalty was given when Timothy Fosu-Mensah fouled Ross Barkley, but De Gea saved the spot-kick after Romelu Lukaku took it. Everton brought on Gerard Deulofeu whose cross was put into United's net via a Chris Smalling own goal to level the scores. In added time, Ander Herrera set up Martial for the winner. United's opponents for the final were Crystal Palace, in a repeat of the 1990 showpiece which United won after a replay. Palace took the lead in the 78th minute through Jason Puncheon but Juan Mata equalised three minutes later, taking the match into extra time. Chris Smalling became the fourth player Cup Final history to be sent off, for a second bookable offence just before the end of the first period of extra time. With 10 minutes to go, Jesse Lingard scored the winner for United with a right-foot volley, winning the Cup for a record-equalling twelfth time. {  - !Date !Round !Opponents !H / A !Result F‚ÄìA !Scorers !Attendance - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 9 January 2016 Round 3 Sheffield United H 1‚Äì0 Rooney 90+3' (pen.) 74,284 - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 29 January 2016 Round 4 Derby County A 3‚Äì1 Rooney 16', Blind 65', Mata 83' 31,134 - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 22 February 2016 Round 5 Shrewsbury Town A 3‚Äì0 Smalling 37', Mata 45'+2, Lingard 61' 9,370 - bgcolor=\\"#ffffdd\\" 13 March 2016 Round 6 West Ham United H 1‚Äì1 Martial 83' 74,298 - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 13 April 2016 Round 6 Replay West Ham United A 2‚Äì1 Rashford 54', Fellaini 67' 33,505 - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 23 April 2016 Semi-final Everton N 2‚Äì1 Fellaini 34', Martial 90+3' 86,064 - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 21 May 2016 Final Crystal Palace N 2‚Äì1 Mata 81', Lingard 110' 88,610 } ==League Cup== As one of eight English clubs who qualified for European competition in the 2014‚Äì15 season, United received a bye to the Third Round of the League Cup. The draw for the Third Round took place on 25 August and paired United with Championship side Ipswich Town. United won the game with Ipswich 3‚Äì0, with goals from Rooney, a direct free kick by Academy product Andreas Pereira, and the final goal from in-form substitute Martial. The draw for the fourth round was held on 23 September 2015. United were drawn at home to Middlesbrough from the Championship. United lost 3‚Äì1 on penalties after a goalless draw after extra time. {  - !Date !Round !Opponents !H / A !Result F‚ÄìA !Scorers !Attendance - bgcolor=#ddffdd 23 September 2015 Round 3 Ipswich Town H 3‚Äì0 Rooney 23', A.

They were seeded in the 'League Route' for the draw, which took place in Nyon on 7 August 2015. United were drawn in a two-legged tie against Belgian Pro League runners-up Club Brugge, which they won 7‚Äì1 on aggregate, ensuring their place in the group stage after a one-season absence. {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" - !Date !Round !Opponents !H / A !Result F‚ÄìA !Scorers !Attendance - bgcolor=#ddffdd 18 August 2015 Play-off round First leg Club Brugge H 3‚Äì1 Depay (2) 13', 43', Fellaini 90+4' 75,312 - bgcolor=#ddffdd 26 August 2015 Play-off round Second leg Club Brugge A 4‚Äì0 Rooney (3) 20', 49', 57', Herrera 63' 28,733 } Group stage CSKA Moscow. The group stage draw was made on 27 August 2015 in Monaco. Manchester United were drawn into Group B with Dutch champions PSV, the runners-up from Russia and Germany, CSKA Moscow and VfL Wolfsburg. Manchester United had been drawn in the same group as CSKA Moscow and Wolfsburg in 2009‚Äì10, while they had met PSV in the first group stage of the 2000‚Äì01 competition. United suffered a shock defeat to PSV in the first game as the hosts came from behind to win 2‚Äì1, after Depay scored the opener following his brace against Club Brugge in the play-offs. H√©ctor Moreno levelled the game at half-time, and Luciano Narsingh sealed the game in the 56th minute. In the 24th minute, United's in-form left-back Luke Shaw suffered a broken leg in a challenge with Moreno, keeping him out for six months. {  - !Date !Opponents !H / A !Result F‚ÄìA !Scorers !Attendance !Group position - bgcolor=\\"#ffdddd\\" 15 September 2015 PSV A 1‚Äì2 Depay 41' 35,292 3rd - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 30 September 2015 VfL Wolfsburg H 2‚Äì1 Mata 34' (pen.), Smalling 52' 74,811 2nd - bgcolor=\\"#ffffdd\\" 21 October 2015 CSKA Moscow A 1‚Äì1 Martial 65' 18,156 2nd - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 3 November 2015 CSKA Moscow H 1‚Äì0 Rooney 79' 75,165 1st - bgcolor=\\"#ffffdd\\" 25 November 2015 PSV H 0‚Äì0  75,321 2nd - bgcolor=\\"#ffdddd\\" 8 December 2015 VfL Wolfsburg A 2‚Äì3 Martial 10', Guilavogui 82' (o.g.) 26,400 3rd } ==UEFA Europa League== As one of the best four third-placed finishers in the Champions League group stage, United were seeded for the Europa League round of 32 draw, along with the group stage winners.

It was built in the period between 1893 and 1897 to a design by Nikolai Belelyubsky. The location of the bridge was selected by Nikolai Garin- Mikhailovsky. It is believed that the decision to start the bridge construction near the village of Krivoschekovo () was the moment of foundation for the city of Novosibirsk. == Selecting a place to cross the Ob River == The choice of where to construct the future bridge proved to be a major challenge. In accordance with the original draft, the railway line was expected to be laid through the town of Tomsk, which required a bridge across the Ob River about 55 km west of Tomsk, at a place where the Ob river overflowed its banks in spring. It was not proper for construction and required selection of a new location. This work is generally understood to be done by Nikolai Garin- Mikhailovsky (known not only as a railway engineer, but also as a writer). He proposed the only narrow site with rocky outcrops on the surface. The site, about 200 km southwest of Tomsk at what is now Novosibirsk, was just beyond the north end to the Salair Ridge, which might explain the rocks. At the end of August 1891, a plenary meeting of three major imperial officials took place in the Big Krivoschekovo village. Participants included Head of Department for construction of railways Konstantin Mikhailovsky, State Counsellor Vladimir Berezin (future contractor), as well as Commander of exploration group Vikenti-Ignatsy Royetski. They examined hydrographic data submitted by Royetski on the spot and made the final decision to recommend a line to cross the river Ob on the local cattle wade. That‚Äôs how they selected the construction site for the first railway bridge across the Ob River. == Construction and initial design == The design was made by Prof. Nikolai Belelyubsky, an outstanding Russian civil engineer and well-known scientist in the fields of structural mechanics and engineering, who developed the projects for a great variety of bridges in Imperial Russia. The superstructure system was composed of nine spans equal in length that rested on masonry piers made of local granite. 109-meter (358-ft) long spans consisted of bowstring-arch through trusses with double lattice girders. Due to its high stability, double-lattice design decreased the length of panels and made the bridge's parts easier. The presence of a support column in trusses allowed a simple design of cradles and baseframes, as well facilitated the design of connections between bearing floor beams and trusses. Furthermore, Beleloubski made improvements in the bridge structure by proposing the device of 'free carriageway', which later came to be called \\"the Russian support method\\". Steelwork elements amounting to 4423 tons were manufactured at the famous Votkinsk ironworks in Udmurtia under the supervision of contractor General V.I. Berezin. The height above low water-mark was . The bridge was under construction for 4 years, and the expense of its erection was about 2 million rubles. In 1896, load tests were carried out on the bridge, during which 4 steam engines crossed over it. On 31 March 1897, the bridge was opened for traffic. All stages of construction were managed by the engineer G.M.Budagov. He remembered with gratitude the time of his cooperation with Nikolai Garin- Mikhailovsky during construction of this railway section, bridge and station. He said: \\"The activities of our witty, talented person and excellent comrade Nikolai G.Garin-Mikhailovsky made all internal life of the builders and their work some especially colourful and pleasant.\\" == Development and operation == The appearance of the bridge in 2003 In the 1930s, the old bridge lost its value and started to be used, as a rule, for passenger trains only. This was because the construction of a new double track railroad bridge (dubbed the Komsomolsky bridge) was finished, and a new cargo line around Novosibirsk's center was launched. In April 1984, the installation of the second main spans was finished. The work train N429 of the West-Siberian Railway erected new spans consisted of 15.7 thousand metal elements amounting to 4.5 thousand tons. Construction of new spans began in 1974. For this purpose, approaches were made of 78 thousand cubic metres of soil; these were covered by a road leading to the left-bank abutment for ensuring access of metal, concrete and other building materials to the site of work. To determine the adequacy of the existing piers, a group of experts from Leningrad drilled the piers' bodies and the rocks upon which they had rested. It was considered feasible to install new span structures on the old piers. The Ministry of Railways of the USSR made the decision to erect new spans with subsequent dismantling of the old structures, because their load-carrying capacity didn't meet modern requirements anymore. A draft of the new bridge was developed by the Moscow Institute of Civil Engineers (). After the commissioning of Novosibirsk hydroelectric power plant, spring ice drifts ended around the city, and so the function of cutwaters (starlings) was no longer relevant. The bridge builders erected (spliced) seven ferroconcrete supports into the foundations of the former cutwaters and constructed two new abutments. The installation of 100 metres long trusses between the piers was carried out by the balanced cantilever method ‚Äî from pier to pier ‚Äî with the use of cranes passing through the top and inside of the trusses. In 1991, train traffic was halted on the old bridge and its dismantling began in 2000.–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω–∞—è > –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∞ > –•—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–∫–∏: 1981‚Äî2000 ‚Äî –ú—É–∑–µ–π –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∞ –ù–æ–≤–æ—Å–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫–∞ The new spans were assembled with the use of high-strength bolts, which allowed to quickly install the new spans without scaffolding or any floating means. The estimated cost of the project was 8 million Russian rubles. The new bridge's spans were stronger and larger, but not as attractive as the old ones, which had well served for almost a century on the great Siberian Railway. By now, all spans of the old bridge have been removed and the bridge reverted to single track operation. However, the old piers and abutments still exist, that allows the bridge to be widened to double-track, if necessary. Besides, one of the old spans has been kept as a museum piece on the riverside promenade of the city. ==See also== *Nikolai Belelyubsky *Ufa Rail Bridge *Trans-Siberian Railway ==References== Notes   Sources  * –ë–∞–ª–∞–Ω–¥–∏–Ω –°.–ù. –ñ–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–∂–Ω—ã–π –º–æ—Å—Ç —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –û–±—å(–Ω–µ–¥–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–Ω–∞—è —Å—Å—ã–ª–∫–∞) // –ù–æ–≤–æ—Å–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –≥—Ä–∞–¥–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ 1893-1945 –≥–≥. - –ù–æ–≤–æ—Å–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫: –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ-—Å–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫–æ–µ –∫–Ω–∏–∂–Ω–æ–µ –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ, 1978. - 136 —Å. * –ë–∞–ª–∞–Ω–¥–∏–Ω –°.–ù. –ù–æ–≤–æ—Å–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –≥—Ä–∞–¥–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ 1945-1985 –≥–≥. - –ù–æ–≤–æ—Å–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫: –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ-—Å–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫–æ–µ –∫–Ω–∏–∂–Ω–æ–µ –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ, 1986. - 160 —Å. * –í–ª–∞—Å–æ–≤ –ì.–ú. –ü–µ—Ä–≤—ã–π –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–∂–Ω—ã–π –º–æ—Å—Ç —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –û–±—å (–ò–∑—ã—Å–∫–∞–Ω–∏—è, –ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ, —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ). - –ù–æ–≤–æ—Å–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫: –ò–∑–¥-–≤–æ –°–ì–£–ü–°–∞ (–ù–ò–ò–ñ–¢–∞). - 36 —Å. * –ù–µ–≤–∑–≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω –ò.–í. –ê—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç—É—Ä–∞ –ù–æ–≤–æ—Å–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫–∞. - –ù–æ–≤–æ—Å–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫: –°–û –†–ê–ù, 2005. - –°. 20-21. - 204 —Å. - . == External links == *The first railroad bridge over the River Ob' *The Trans Siberian railway bridge over the Ob river at Novosibirsk, Siberia, Russia *Stock Photo - the Trans Siberian railway bridge over the Ob river at Novosibirsk, Siberia, Russia Category:Buildings and structures in Novosibirsk Oblast Category:Buildings and structures in Siberia Category:Railway bridges in Russia Category:Bridges over the Ob River R Category:Truss bridges Category:1893 establishments Category:Rail transport stubs ","title":"Novosibirsk Rail Bridge"},{"id":"46340701","text":"Zions Hill, also known as the Ralph Owen Brewster House, and now the Brewster Inn, is a historic house at 37 Zions Hill in Dexter, Maine. The house is a 1930s updating of an 1870s structure to a design by John Calvin Stevens and John Howard Stevens, who also designed the landscaping of the property. This renovation was done for Ralph Owen Brewster, a prominent Maine politician who served as Governor of Maine and for two terms in the United States Senate, and created one of the major Colonial Revival showcases of interior Maine. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. ==Description and history== Zions Hill is set prominently on the north side of the same-named road, on the fringe of Dexter's central village. The main house is set at the southeast corner of the landscaped property, with a semicircular drive in front. The house is a rambling wood-frame structure with a central mass that is a two-story L shape with a hip roof. In front of this block's two-bay facade is a deep porte-cochere that extends over the drive. A single- story sun-room occupies the crook of the L, extending further west than the rear leg of the L, where a long veranda extends to the rear. A two-story wing extends to the east, with a single-story conservatory area in front, and a garage and servant's quarters behind. The interior of the house has restrained woodwork reminiscent of the Federal period, and has retained original wallpaper, light fixtures, and draperies. The structure of the main portion of the house was built in the 1870s by William E. Brewster, and it is in that house tha Ralph Owen Brewster grew up. Brewster, educated at Bowdoin College, entered politics in the 1910s, serving in the state legislature before winning two terms as Governor of Maine 1924-29. In 1929 he purchased his father's house, and in 1934 retained the noted Portland firm of John Calvin Stevens and his son John Howard Stevens to significantly expand the house into a property suitable for a prominent politician. Brewster served three terms in the United States House of Representatives (1935‚Äì41) and then two terms in the Senate (1941‚Äì53). The house designed by the Stevenses, although essentially Colonial Revival in style, had to abandon the symmetry typical of that style to accommodate both the asymmetry of the original house, and the needs of the Brewsters for public spaces in which to conduct political business. The Stevenses were also responsible for designing the landscaping of the property, much of which has apparently been preserved despite conversion of the property to a bed and breakfast. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Penobscot County, Maine ==References *Brewster Inn web site Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Maine Category:1870s establishments in Maine Category:Houses in Penobscot County, Maine Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Penobscot County, Maine ","title":"Zions Hill"},{"id":"46340723","text":"The 2014 Four Nations Tournament (Torneio Quatro Na√ß√µes) in Portuguese, was the first edition of the Four Nations Tournament held in S√£o Bernardo do Campo, Brazil between 30 October ‚Äì1 November as a Men's friendly handball tournament organised by the Brazilian Handball Confederation. ==Results== {   center;\\" - !width=\\"180\\"Team !width=\\"30\\"Pld !width=\\"30\\"W !width=\\"30\\"D !width=\\"30\\"L !width=\\"30\\"GF !width=\\"30\\"GA !width=\\"30\\"GD !width=\\"30\\"Pts -  align=\\"left\\"  3  3  0  0  77  71  +6  6 -  align=\\"left\\"  3  2  0  1  71  70  +1  4 -  align=\\"left\\"  3  1  0  2  72  64  +8  2 -  align=\\"left\\"  3  0  0  3  68  83  ‚Äì15  0 } ==Round robin== \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- ==Final standing== {class= center;\\" - !Rank !!width=180Team - File:Gold medal icon.svg align=left - File:Silver medal icon.svg align=left - File:Bronze medal icon.svg align=left - 4 align=left - } ==References *Tournament page on CBHb official web site Category:Four Nations Tournament (handball) Category:2014 in handball Category:2014 in Brazilian sport Four ","title":"2014 Four Nations Tournament"},{"id":"46340737","text":"Edward Francis Sinnott (1864-1936) was a merchant and politician in Newfoundland.

The son of John Sinnott, he was born in Placentia and was educated there and at St. Patrick's Hall in St. John's. He worked in the grocery, wine and spirits business in St. John's and then, in 1884, set up his own business selling wine and spirits. During World War I, when the sale of alcohol was prohibited, he went into the grocery business with a Mr. Clancy. He was also a director of the British Clothing Company. He was first elected to the Newfoundland assembly in 1919 and was re-elected two more times. From 1928 to 1934, Sinnott was a member of the Legislative Council of Newfoundland. He represented the Newfoundland assembly in the 1926 visit to Australia by the Empire parliamentary delegation. Sinnott was married twice: first to Elizabeth Tobin in 1889 and then to Laura Hartigan in 1923. He was a member of the St. John's Benevolent Irish Society. In 1877, Sinnott, never having built anything previously, constructed a whaleboat, the Placentia, for the Royal St. John's Regatta on Quidi Vidi Lake. With a crew of six fishermen from Placentia and Sinnott as coxswain, the Placentia took first place. The men had carried the boat on their shoulders along the 145 km (90 mile) trail from Placentia to St. John's, leaving on Saturday night and arriving on the Wednesday morning before the regatta.

The first part of the act codifies into Scots law the right to universal access to land in Scotland. The act specifically establishes a right to be on land for recreational, educational and certain other purposes and a right to cross land. The rights exist only if they are exercised responsibly, as specified in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code. Access rights apply to any non-motorised activities, including walking, cycling, horse-riding and wild camping. They also allow access on inland water for canoeing, rowing, sailing and swimming. The second part of the act establishes the community right to buy, allowing communities with populations of up to 10,000 to register an interest in land, entitling them to first right of refusal should the owner put the land up for sale or intend to transfer ownership, provided a representative community body can be formed to carry out the purchase. Finally, the third part establish the crofting community right to buy which allows crofting communities to purchase crofts and associated land from existing landowners. It differs from the community right to buy in that it can be exercised at any time, regardless of whether the land has been put on the market, allowing crofting communities to purchase land even in the absence of a willing seller. ==See also== * Land reform in Scotland * Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015 * Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016 ==References * Category:Acts of the Scottish Parliament 2003 Category:Land reform in Scotland Category:Scottish culture Category:Outdoor recreation in Scotland Category:Scottish coast and countryside Category:Crofting ","title":"Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003"},{"id":"46340808","text":"St Michael‚Äôs Church, Stanton by Bridge is a Grade I listed parish church in the Church of England in Stanton by Bridge, Derbyshire.The Buildings of England.

This solutions works as a substitution for the classic wooden boxes. The main difference in comparison to the wooden boxes is the possibility to collapse them when they are not in use. As such factors are highly important in professional logistics this solution has gained growing popularity worldwide in the past 20 years, with approximately 20,000,000 new collars manufactured each year worldwide. Each of the pallet collars is stacked on one another in order to form a box type of packing, but because of the convenient design they provide several important benefits that have high value in the storage and transportation industry. Pallet collar == Overview == To provide better transportation opportunities for more types of products, pallet collars were introduced to the market and followed the increased use of classic wooden pallets as a result of the growing popularity of containerised transportation on sea and land. == Design == A single pallet collar consists of four or six wooden boards (plastic boards are also used) and four or six metallic hinges that are used to hold the boards together. These hinges allow every pallet collar to collapse in order to save space, which is one of the most important factors in successful logistics. Pallet collars work together with classic and different types of pallets. == Benefits of pallet collars == Pallet collar dividers When quality pallet collars are used in the right way it is possible to optimise space in both warehouses and when they are transported. They provide fast and easy handling and assembling. Also, the access to the goods that are stored is ensured to be faster and easier. When pallet collars are not used and there are no products in this packaging it is possible to collapse them. In comparison to wooden boxes, these save up to more than 80% of space. Different types of products can be stored on pallets without the pallet collars, but they are still used in order to ensure safe multi-level both shelf and non-shelf storage which ensures warehouse optimisation. Using pallet collars make it possible to store more types of products on pallets which would usually be stored in classic wooden boxes. For example, different friable products can be stored when a customised pallet is used. == Pallet collars construction == The simple, flexible construction is what allows pallet collars to stand out from other storage and transportation solutions. It also ensures the usage of pallet collars that differ in heights and sizes in order to adjust the needed capacity of every individual packaging.  Standardisation  Standard pallet collars are manufactured in four heights: 100, 200, 300 and 400 mm. By using the needed heights and combining them together it is possible to closely match every single package to particular products. Three standard sizes are manufactured: 600x800, 800x1200 and 1000x1200 mm. These standard sizes complement the majority of most commonly used standard pallets.  Customisation  In order to provide quality working conditions and efficiency it is possible to manufacture any custom height and size, which can provide precise packaging for any type of products. Hinges can be customised too in order to provide better working conditions. For example, one side of the collar may open as a door, to provide easy access to stored goods.  Materials  Standard pallet collars are manufactured from plywood, which provides the necessary quality. OSB or plastic pallet collars are also often used. Each of the materials has advantages and disadvantages.  Avoiding risks  In order to form the needed packaging from pallet collars, only collars from one manufacturer should be stacked on one another. While the majority of manufacturers use standard sizes, minor differences can occur due to the technology used in manufacturing. Such differences can cause significant safety issues. == Creative uses == Used pallet collars are becoming popular for a variety of uses, following the popularization of pallets for many creative uses. One of the most immediate and obvious uses for pallet collars are as instant garden beds. The gardener can stack the pallet collars as high as needed and fill with soil. They can be stacked and filled as steps and retaining walls. Pallet collars are an inexpensive material for a variety of uses. == See also == * Palletizer * ISPM 15, regulation of wood packaging material in international trade ==References== *European Pallet Association *Kronus, wooden packaging manufacturer Category:Freight transport Category:Packaging ","title":"Pallet collar"},{"id":"46340896","text":"Family Values is the debut studio album by South African rapper, actor, writer, composer and record producer Riky Rick.

It contains two known species: Galeamopus hayi, known from the Late Jurassic lower Morrison Formation (Kimmeridgian age, about 155 million years ago) of Wyoming, United States, and Galeamopus pabsti, known from the Late Jurassic fossils from Wyoming and Colorado. The type species is known from one of the most well preserved diplodocid fossils, a nearly complete skeleton with associated skull. ==History== The skull of the holotype specimen of Galeamopus pabsti, SMA 00011, nicknamed \\"Max\\" Galeamopus was first known from a partial skeleton discovered by fossil hunter William H. Utterback in 1902 near Sheridan, Wyoming, in the Red Fork Powder River Quarry A. In 1906, the skeleton was referred to Diplodocus by William Jacob Holland when he described its braincase. The specimen was classified by Holland as a new species of Diplodocus, Diplodocus hayi, in 1924. The specific name honoured Oliver Perry Hay.Holland WJ. The skull of Diplodocus. Memoirs of the Carnegie Museum IX; 379‚Äì403 (1924). In 2015, it was renamed as the separate genus Galeamopus by Emanuel Tschopp, Oct√°vio Mateus and Roger Benson. The generic name is derived from Latin galeam, the accusative of galea, \\"helmet\\", and opus, \\"need\\". The combination is intended as a translation of Wil-helm, literally \\"want helmet\\", in reference to the first name of both Utterback and Holland. The name is at the same time an allusion to the fact that the brittle braincase of the type specimen is in need of a helmet. The genoholotype is HMNS 175 (previously CM 662), the original skeleton. It was found in layer of the lower Morrison Formation dating from the Kimmeridgian. This specimen is also the holotype of Galeamopus hayi, the combinatio nova of the type species D. hayi. Several other specimens were referred to the genus Galeamopus but not to Galeamopus hayi. These included specimen AMNH 969, a nearly complete skull discovered in 1903 at the Bone Cabin Quarry by Peter Kaisen; and specimen USNM 2673, a partial skull excavated in 1884 by Marshall P. Felch at Garden Park in Colorado. SMA 0011, a skeleton nicknamed \\"Max\\" and found in June 1995 at the Howe-Stephens Quarry, was considered sufficiently different from the others to consider naming a separate species for it. In 2017, the \\"Max\\" specimen was made the type specimen of a second Galeamopus species, G. pabsti, by Tschopp and Mateus. It was named after the Swiss paleontologist Dr. Ben Pabst, who discovered the specimen and helped mount the skeleton at Sauriermuseum Aathal. ==Description== G. pabsti skeleton in Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal The 2015 study established seven distinguishing traits of the genus as such. These were autapomorphies, unique derived characters. On the back of the skull, the paroccipital process is curved in side view. The teeth have paired wear facets. The first neck vertebra, the atlas, has a neural spine with processes pointing to the front and the inside, which are separate from the rear wing of the spine. This rear wing shows a continuous transverse width over most of its length. The neural arch of the atlas has on each side of its base a small triangular spur. The second neck vertebra, the axis, has a neural spine with a knob-shaped bump on the front end of the ridge on its front side. With the middle and rear neck vertebrae, the ridge between the rear joint processes, the postzygapophyses, does not extend beyond the rear edge of the neural arch. Restoration of the head of G. pabsti The study also determined six autapomorphies of the type species Galeamopus hayi alone. The part of the parietal bone forming the edge between the rear skull and the skull roof is low, with a height less than that of the foramen magnum. The appending basipterygoid processes at the underside of the braincase strongly diverge at an angle of more than 60¬∞. The ulna of the lower arm is long, with a minimum length equalling 76% of the humerus, upper arm bone, length. The surface on the radius contacting the ulna is limited in size and relatively smooth. The joint surface at the underside of the radius is bevelled relative to the shaft, at an angle of about 15¬∞. The outer edge of the top surface of the shinbone forms a pinched process, behind the cnemial crest at the front. Hypothetical life restoration of G. hayi Combined, there are thirteen autapomorphies present in Galeamopus, exactly the minimum the study used as a criterion to distinguish separate genera. ==Relationships== G. hayi skull (specimen AMNH 969) The cladogram below shows one hypothesis on the relationships of Galeampous to other diplodocids, as found by the analysis of Tschopp & Mateus (2017). ==See also== *2017 in archosaur paleontology ==References== Category:Late Jurassic dinosaurs of North America Category:Diplodocids Category:Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation Category:Fossil taxa described in 2015 Category:Taxa named by Oct√°vio Mateus Category:Paleontology in Wyoming ","title":"Galeamopus"},{"id":"46340972","text":"Niall McCabe (born 6 October 1990) is an Irish footballer who plays as a Midfielder for Louisville City FC. ==Early life== Personal McCabe was born in Ringsend, Dublin.

He was a businessman, lawyer and philanthropist who grew up in Sterling, Massachusetts and later Worcester, Massachusetts. His name is associated with gifts he gave to the Town of Sterling and Harvard University; the Conant Public Library in Sterling, Massachusetts as a memorial for his daughter Elizabeth and Harvard's Conant Hall. He was a member of the famous Harvard Class of '29. ==Early life== He was the son of Jacob Conant and Relief Burpee Conant, daughter of Moses Burpee and Elizabeth Kendall Burpee.History of Worcester and Its People, Nutt, P560 Father, Jacob was a businessman, farmer and Justice of the Peace representing Sterling, Massachusetts. Jacob provided Edwin with all the advantages of his wealth and stature. Edwin lost his mother December 26, 1814 when he was four-years old. He lost his sister Elizabeth in 1816 when he was six. Conant attended public school in Sterling, Massachusetts until he was 12 and transferred to Leicester Academy in preparation for college. ==Harvard University== In 1826, at the age of 16 he entered Harvard and graduated among the top of his class in 1829. He was one of the \\"Class of 1829\\", made famous by Oliver Wendell Holmes. During Commencement exercises at Harvard in 1829 he participated in a conference on \\"Natural, Civil, Ecclesiastical, and Literary History, considered in relation to the Tendency of each to improve and elevate the Intellectual Faculty\\". ==Teaching in Sterling== Conant taught in Sterling, Massachusetts at the Chocksett Hill School for two winter sessions Conant Public Library, Sterling, Massachusetts, Conant Journals during his tenure at Harvard and was asked to address the graduating class on February 24, 1829 at the close of winter studies. He referred to himself as \\"Old Master\\" in his written address. At the age of 19, he wrote: \\"This place has been to you the scene of many wayward frolic, of many a childish gam bob. You have here laughed and sported together year after year, caring only for the present, thoughtful of tomorrow and seemingly unconscious that you are never to be troubled with my cares beyond those of the present hour. I knew no other condition, I doubted not that the world was all friendly. But when I was torn from the companions of my childhood, and removed to a distance from kindred and home, and placed among strangers, I found, to my sad disappointment, that I was of little consequence to the world around me, and that none but myself cared for my comfort and welfare. Then it was that I learned to value the joys, and thousand social endearments of home. Then it was, that I learned duly to estimate the consolation which springs from the mature sympathy of school-fellows. Then, and not till then, did I know what it was to want a friend to smooth down the bed of sickness‚Ä¶ For it is a law of nature, that we know not the worth of our enjoyments, until the time arrives when they are to be interrupted. Then, and not till then, do we feel the wants of them‚Ä¶ I want you to reflect upon the many happy hours you have here enjoyed, that you may, in after years, when surrounded, perhaps with disease, and danger, and death, receive comfort and consolation by the retrospection. It will be so delightful, yet so deeply affecting, when old age is upon you, to tell over the scenes and the frolics of your school-boy days! I have been acquainted with many village schools, but none did I ever witness so much mutual good will, so great manifestations of true and sincere friendship, as I have witnessed in this. You have always seemed to me, to constitute one great Family; and I have often thought you are indeed a band of Brothers and Sisters! For my own part, having spent two winters with you, I am, and shall always be ready to bear testimony to your depth of sympathy and kindly feeling as friends, and your faithfulness and diligence as scholars. During the last winter, my attention was so strongly attracted by these qualities, and by the kindness with which I was uniformly treated, that I formed an attachment to you, which not ever time, but death alone can sever‚Ä¶ And am I no more to have my ears greeted with the endearing title of Master? - a title which has always suggested to my mind, so many pleasing emotions! ‚Ä¶ Be assured, I shall not forget you.\\" Conant Public Library, Sterling, Massachusetts, Conant Journals, Hand written letter February 24, 1829 ==Law School== After being graduated from Harvard,Harvard University Library, Cambridge, MA Conant studied law with Rejoice Newton (1782-1868) and William Lincoln (1801-1843), author of History of Worcester, Massachusetts From Its Earliest Settlement to September 1836 and at the Harvard Law School in Cambridge. ==Independence Day Oration== On Independence Day, July 4, 1832, at the 51st anniversary of the Town of Sterling, Edwin addressed the Towns-people with an oration. He spoke:‚Äú...In the upright and honest discharge of public and private duty within our narrow spheres of action, let us do what we can to avert it. And if the cloud which some have been farsighted, or imaginative enough to believe is gathering over our heads, shall indeed burst in wrath upon us, let us not, like recreant sons of worthier sires, shrink from any exertion which liberty and country may demand at our hands. But may heaven grant, that that demand may never be made, that successive years may but harden and cement the temple which has been reared to freedom, that here the dominion of error may be constantly narrowed and the empire of light and truth extended, that the fair model we hold up for the world to admire and imitate may ever be kept in the freshness of original beauty, that so the consummation of mans highest earthly reign of equal laws and the rightful elevation of moral excellence.‚Äù Conant Public Library, Sterling, Massachusetts, Conant Journals ==Attorney== He returned to reside in Sterling briefly on September 19, 1832, and opened his law office.Worcester Spy, October 3, 1832 He was also appointed to the Division of the Militia of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as Quarter Master by Levi Lincoln, the Governor of Massachusetts, an involvement he would honor for many years. During this period, his Father Jacob was serving in various official posts in Sterling government, which he did the last thirty years of his life. In 1833, Edwin Conant was promoted to Major with the Division of the Militia of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by Governor Levi Lincoln. Edwin took little time to establish himself in the Town and County and moved his residence and practice to Worcester in 1833. He purchased the estate of his former friend and Sterling resident, Isaac Goodwin, on Lincoln Street and later moved to a mansion at the corner of Harvard and State Street. After his death, the mansion was donated to the Natural History Society in 1891 (The Natural History Society changed its name to the Worcester Science Museum in 1960 and eventually the EcoTarium in 1998).Will of Edwin Conant, Reported by Worcester Spy, March 7, 1891 He was asked in November 1835 to deliver the dedicatory address for the dedication of the Town Hall (1835 Town Hall) which had just been completed.The Historical Evolution of the Sterling 1835 Town Hall, September 2014, now part of the Sterling Center Historic District In 1842, as part of a Board of Trustees, Edwin was appointed to the Board of the Worcester State Lunatic Hospital by Governor John Davis. The hospital was 10 years old.American Antiquarian Society, Worcester, MA; The Edwin Conant Papers ==Marriage and family== Maria Estabrook (daughter of Joseph and Ruth Estabrook of Royalston, became Edwin's first wife in 1833. They had two children, Elizabeth Ann Conant in 1835 and Helen Maria Conant in 1837. On December 24, 1837, his youngest daughter Helen died 7 months after she was born. Edwin's Father Jacob, then Treasurer for the Town of Sterling, also died in 1837. Maria, Edwin's wife, was the next to perish. She died at the age of 35 on August 22, 1848, two days after Edwin's 38th Birthday. Edwin married again on January 29, 1850. His second wife, Elizabeth S. Wheeler was the daughter of a Unitarian Reverend Joseph Wheeler Jr. of Harvard. They were married for 29 years losing her in 1879. After his second wife died, Edwin was left with only one immediate family member, his daughter Elizabeth Ann. She took over the caring of the household and lived with her father all of her life. ==Elizabeth Ann Conant== Elizabeth Ann Conant died on December 4, 1883 at the age of 48. Worcester Spy reported ‚ÄúA light has gone out in many hearts with the death of Miss Conant, and some of us, even outside her home, cannot but feel that life is less worth living in her absence‚Ä¶ In her was found a rare union of common and uncommon sense, of judgment in practical affairs, and thoughtful interest in the intellectual and spiritual questions which concern us all most deeply, of constant, untiring devotion to home duties, and earnest activity in helping the needy abroad, of a warm heart and quick sympathies, with a clear, penetrating, and cultivated intellect. To all these were added vivacity and courage, with a vein of fun also, which made her society a delight.‚Äù ==Conant Public Library== After Elizabeth's death, Edwin Conant donated a 100-acre parcel of land he owned in Holden to the inhabitants of Sterling, the proceeds of which were to be used to begin erecting a memorial building in his daughter's name. When all was said and done, Edwin donated more than $6,000 to construct the Conant Public Library. The memorial address, by E. H. Hall ends with; ‚ÄúWhy may we not hope that her pure presence will always be felt within the walls which to-day we dedicate, and touch with finer influence all that goes forth from them on errands of enlightenment and cheer?‚ÄùSterling Historical Society, Inc., Memorial Address Pamphlet There are numerous letters of sympathy in Edwin Conant's files. Received between Elizabeth's death in 1883 and the dedication of the Library in 1886. Pictures of Elizabeth along with the Memorial booklet were mailed to friends of Conant. These letters were treasured to the end of his life.American Antiquarian Society, Worcester, MA; The Edwin Conant Papers After 1883, Edwin Conant was ill for many years. The death of his daughter, the last member of his immediate family did much to bring about his decline in health. He continued to live in his mansion on State Street in Worcester. At his side all these later years was his nurse, Henry K. Cady, who was also at his side at his funeral. Edwin Conant died on March 2, 1891. He had been the oldest living member of the Worcester County Bar. His modest funeral was attended by noted Worcester businessman and politicians as well as a contingency from Sterling including Osgood, Bartlett, Heywood, Kendall, Fitch, Wilder, Brown and Houghton (the Sterling attendees were 1/2 hour late due to a train delay). At a special session of the superior court of Worcester, in his memory, Attorney H.E. Hill, Col. Williams and A.P. Rugg held a memorial service. Judge Emory Aldrich said, ‚ÄúHe was a man of rare qualities of mind‚Ä¶ There is no man in the city that I know who is possessed of so many noble qualities and of so much wealth, who was little known in the community at large, as was Mr. Conant. He was highly spoken of by his neighbor. I regarded my acquaintance with him as an honor‚Ä¶ His rare intelligence, cultivated mind and dignified manner marked him. He was one of the most self-contained men I ever met.‚Äù The retelling of his time with us would not be complete without the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes who wrote ‚ÄúA Story of Twenty Nine‚Äù.

He moved to Yucat√°n, Mexico and later lived in Veracruz and Mexico City. He compiled the first dictionary of terms that were specifically \\"Mexican Spanish\\". Ramos returned to Cuba after it gained independence from Spain. He taught briefly and then served as President of the Teacher Examination Board. He published many textbooks and educational articles. ==Biography== F√©lix Ramos y Duarte was born in 1848 in San Jos√© de los Ramos, Matanzas Province, Cuba. Ramos was attending the Teachers Normal School in Cuba when he was accused of conspiracy and fled to Mexico. Exile in Mexico Arriving in Yucat√°n in 1868, he was one of the first arrivals from Cuba at the beginning of the Ten Years' War. Ramos began working as a primary school teacher in Yucat√°n and was one of the Cuban intellectuals who tutored Rita Cetina Guti√©rrez. Ramos' first employment was as a teacher of religion at the School of San Idelfonso but he began teaching as the Chair of line drawing at the State Literary Institute the following year. In 1879, he obtained his diploma for primary and higher education from the Normal School attached to the Institute. In addition to teaching, Ramos published articles in educational journals including La Escuela Primaria (The Elementary School), El Pensamiento (Thinking), El Eco del Comercio (The Echo of Commerce), La Revista de M√©rida (The Magazine of M√©rida), as well as textbooks. In 1875, his mathematics textbook received official recognition as a text for schools and was reprinted into four editions. In 1879, a textbook he created on line drawing was also selected as an official text for Yucat√°n schools. Ramos moved to Veracruz in 1881 and taught industrial design at the adult night school. In 1885 he worked at the Model School of Orizaba with German and Swiss teachers and earned the title Professor of Theoretical and Practical Education under the objective educational system on 20 July 1886. Ramos taught and published articles in Veracruz until he became ill and was forced to quit his job and move to Mexico City in 1888. Recovered from his illness, in 1889, Ramos taught for three and a half years as Professor of literature, national history and Castilian grammar at the Presbyterian Theological Seminary and simultaneously worked as a Professor at the American Presbyterian School and the Methodist Normal School Daughters of Juarez. He continued with the Methodist School until 1894 and with the American Presbyterian school until 1896. During this time frame, in 1895 Ramos published several more educational books, including the first Dictionary of Mexican Spanish (Diccionario de mejicanismos. Colecci√≥n de locuciones i frases viciosas con sus correspondientes cr√≠ticas i correcciones fundadas en autoridades de la lengua; m√°ximas, refranes, provincialismos i retoques populares de todos los estados de la Rep√∫blica Mejicana), which examined idioms, phrases, maxims and dialectic usages that were different from standard Castilian in an attempt to improve the use of the Spanish language in Mexico. In 1897, he published a treatise on teaching Castilian Spanish which was accepted as a textbook and in 1899 a collection of Mexican curiosities that was encyclopedic in nature. Return to Cuba On 20 September 1899, Ramos returned to Cuba and began working at a secondary school in the village of G√ºines. In March, 1900, he began serving as principal of the schools of San Lazaro and San Leopoldo in Havana. Over the summer break, in June, 1900, he and a group of teachers traveled to the US to study English at Harvard, but returning to Cuba after the course, Ramos found that he had been laid off. Juan Miguel Dihigo Mestre intervened on his behalf and was able to help Ramos secure a position as president of the board for teacher's examiners in Havana, for the years 1901‚Äì1903. Ramos continued publishing in Mexico while living in Cuba, but many of his works remain unpublished or are irretrievably lost. His masterwork, a Yucayo dictionary with 6,000 lexical items, handpainted watercolors, and broad historical, archaeological and geographical information of the origins of language in Cuba was completed in 1919 in Cuba, but not printed and may have been lost. Ramos died in Havana in 1924. ==Selected works== *Tratado de educaci√≥n c√≠vica. Unpublished manuscript.

Located at the junction of Maine State Route 172 and Old County Road, the district includes the town's 1793 meeting house, which still serves as town hall, the c. 1795 Daniel Merrill House, built for the town's first minister, the 1821 town pound, and its first cemetery. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. ==Description and history== The town of Sedgwick was first settled by white settlers in the 1760s, and was incorporated in 1789. In 1791 the town voted to raise funds for the construction of a meeting house and a house for a minister. The meeting house, which was originally used for both religious and civic purposes, was built in 1793, and altered 1849 to reflect its conversion to exclusively civic purposes. Across the main road (now Route 172) to the west they built the ministerial residence, first occupied by Rev. Daniel Merrill. Part of the land granted to Rev. Merrill was taken for use as the community's first burial ground in 1798. Part of the town common, which was laid out in front of the meeting house, was taken in 1821 for the construction of a stone animal pound, whose walls are still partially standing. This complex was located at the geographic center of Sedgwick, which initially included all of Brooklin to the east and part of Brooksville to the west; these two communities were separated from Sedgwick before 1849, and the town's economic activities were focused on coastal villages. The meeting house continues to serve municipal functions, and the Merrill House is now owned by the local historical society and is open as a museum, along with an old schoolhouse that was rebuilt on the property. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hancock County, Maine ==References== Category:Greek Revival architecture in Maine Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1793 Category:Historic districts in Hancock County, Maine Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hancock County, Maine ","title":"Sedgwick Historic District"},{"id":"46341139","text":"Canting arms of Arundell: Sable, six martlets argent (hirondelle (French), martlet) Sir John Arundell VII (1421‚Äì1473) of Lanherne in the parish of St Mawgan in Pydar, Cornwall, was Sheriff of Cornwall and Admiral of Cornwall, and served as a general for King Henry VI in his French wars, but was attainted in 1483.

He landed in Queensland in March 1880 and began work as a joiner for Fairlie & Sons and within two years had formed an Eight Hour Association and participated in a campaign to remove black labour from the sugar industry. Leaving Fairlie & Sons in 1890, he set about forming the General Labourers' Union, which was later absorbed into the Australian Workers' Union and as Secretary of the Wide Bay and Burnett Branch of the Australian Labor Federation, he helped organize support for the shearers in the 1891 strike. In 1892, Demaine represented the Maryborough Workers' Political Organization at the first Labor-in-Politics convention before being elected to the central political executive in 1892‚Äì94. Along with Charles McGhie, he founded the weekly newspaper Alert which he edited until his death. In 1901 he once again attended the Labor-in-Politics convention and until 1938, every convention thereafter. Elected president of the central political executive in 1916, he held the role unopposed for the next 22 years. ==Political career== When the Labour Party starting forming governments in Queensland, it found much of its legislation being blocked by a hostile Council, where members had been appointed for life by successive conservative governments. After a failed referendum in May 1917, Premier Ryan tried a new tactic, and later that year advised the Governor, Sir Hamilton John Goold- Adams, to appoint thirteen new members whose allegiance lay with Labour to the Council.Goold-Adams, Sir Hamilton John (1858‚Äì1920) ‚Äì Australian Dictionary of Biography.

When James Stopford, the member for the state seat of Maryborough died in November 1936, Demaine, as the Labor candidate, easily won the resultant by-election held on 27 February 1937, becoming the oldest person to enter Queensland Parliament. He held the seat for just over a year before deciding not to stand at the 1938 state election. ==Personal life== At Bradford on 10 January 1880, Demaine married Mary Susannah Preston and together had nine children.

He moved to the latter side in 1963, and coach Lajos Czeizler displayed him in the right-back position until he injured his knee, needing an operation. Luciano was again bothered by physical problems upon his return, now in the ankle, only returning to full fitness in the 1966‚Äì67 season. ==Death== On 5 December 1966, Benfica's new hydro massage bath short-circuited with seven players inside, Luciano being the only one immersed.

It is about 45 km long. The canal consists of six lakes and five self-service locks. The canal connects two biggest lakes in Central Finland, Lake P√§ij√§nne and Lake Keitele, thus forming a water route of altogether ca. 400 km from the City of Lahti in the southern end to the municipality of Pielavesi in the North. ==History== The canal was first proposed at the end of the 19th Century. Concrete plans were made in 1962 and again in 1981. Finally the canal was built in 1990-1993 as part of the Finnish-Soviet trade. The Soviet Union owed Finland and paid its debt by building the locks. The project cost 245M Finnish marks. Originally the canal was intended for the benefit of the wood industry in the region. However, the timber rafting ended in 2002. Since then the canal has been used by private and cruise boats only. ==Tourism== There are several companies offering canal and lake cruises in the area, and in some areas there are boat and canoe rentals available. Good navigation skill is required as the waters in Central Finland are rocky. At Vaajakoski Lock there is a restaurant, an art gallery and a swimming beach. At Kuusa Lock there is also accommodation and a theatre. Near the Kapeenkoski Lock are fireplaces, lean-tos and hiking paths in the Kapeenniemi recreational area. The Paatela Lock: has a cafe and cruises. ==Locks== 200px The locks on the canal are designed to accept vessels of a maximum draw of 2.4m, a maximum length of 110m and a maximunm width of 11.8m. The locks are self-service locks, and are open from May to September (part-time or by order in October). They can also be controlled remotely. Locks from south to north: *Vaajakoski: length 250m, height difference 2,50-2.65m, mast height 5.5m *Kuhankoski: length 750m, height difference 4-4.10m, mast height 3.5m *Kuusa: length 350m, height difference 3.90-4.10m, mast height 3.5m *Kapeenkoski: length 300m, height difference 2.70-3m, mast height 3.5m *Paatela: length 500 m, height difference 7.40-7.85m, mast height 3.5m ==See also== *Article in the Finnish Wikipedia ==References * Myllykyl√§ Turkka: Suomen kanavien historia.

The act outlawed all conventicles, or religious meetings of any kind, outside of the Lutheran Church of Sweden, with the exception of the family prayer or worship. The purpose was to prevent freedom of religion and protect religious unity, as such unity was regarded as important to maintain the control of the Crown over the public through the Church. The law only applied to Swedish citizens, while the religious freedom of foreigners was protected by the Tolerance Act . ==History== The law was initiated in 1726 to prevent the popularity of pietism, which was spreading rapidly in Sweden in the first half of the 18th century, and used, among others, against early proponents such as Thomas Leopold, Johan Stendahl, and Peter Spaak.https://sok.riksarkivet.se/Sbl/Mobil/Artikel/18505 During the 19th century, the Conventicle Act was used as a tool against the spread of the free churches. This law was one reason for emigration from Sweden to the USA in the 1840s and 1850s. During the 19th century, the law had become controversial and was constantly debated in parliament. It was finally abolished in 1858. The new law stipulated that conventicles were not to take place in parallel with the services of the Lutheran Church without prior dispensation. This condition was abolished in 1868 and replaced with the condition that such gatherings were not to take place in the close surroundings of a Lutheran church. The Conventicle Act was also in effect in Finland, until 1809 the Eastern part of Sweden. The Russian Grand Duchy of Finland kept her laws from the Swedish time until changed by the Diet, which abolished the Conventicle Act from 1 July 1870. ==NotesReferences== * Fr√§ngsmyr, Tore (2004).

It operates for the relief of sickness and injury, with a specialist paramedic in critical care and a critical care doctor, providing response by helicopter or car between the hours of 7:00 am and 1:00 am, 365 days a year. The service covers Bristol, North Somerset, Bath and North East Somerset, South Gloucestershire, Gloucestershire, and surrounding areas. ==History== GWAAC was created in 2008. At launch, it operated a Eurocopter EC135, but as flying hours increased the funding was not available, so the charity moved to a MBB Bo 105 helicopter. In 2012, the charity started a campaign to raise the money needed to return to the EC135. The goal was reached in 2014, and in October the EC135 (registered G-GWAA) arrived at the base in Bristol Filton Airport. The EC135 had a 40% increase in cabin volume, allowing the team to offer better inflight treatment. It had an extra seat, allowing medics to be trained on-board or a child patient to be airlifted with a parent. It can also land on elevated hospital helipads, and allows side loading. On 1 August 2017, GWAAC upgraded to an EC135 T2+ model, registration G-GWAC, leased from Babcock Mission Critical Services Onshore, which has more advanced features and a longer range. In 2012, it was announced that Filton airfield, where GWAAC and the National Police Air Service (NPAS) had been based, was to close. Their landlord, BAE Systems, agreed to find a new site and construct an airbase for the services. A site was identified in South Gloucestershire, close to the Almondsbury Interchange, approximately north of the Filton base. Planning permission was granted in August 2016. Work started at the site in late 2017, with both services moving to the new base in October 2018. In July 2018, GWAAC launched a public appeal to raise funds to buy the new airbase from BAE Systems, following it being put up for sale during its construction. GWAAC raised ¬£1.3million towards the purchase, which completed in December 2018. NPAS remain on site as tenants of GWAAC. In September 2019, the new airbase was officially opened by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester. ==Operations== The charity serves a population of 2.1 million. It has received grants in the past from the national government, but does not receive operational funding from the government or National Lottery, and is normally funded by public donations. In 2018, the charity spent ¬£2.1million operating its helicopter and critical care cars. Within four minutes of an emergency call being received the helicopter can be in the air, and it can be anywhere within the region it covers in 20minutes. GWAAC also operates critical care cars, used at night or when the helicopter is not feasible ‚Äì for example due to the location of the patient, or the helicopter being at another job, or otherwise unavailable. The helicopter does not fly during the hours of darkness. The specialist critical care team consists of a paramedic and doctor, who provide a remote emergency department to the patient. The crew carry blood and fresh frozen plasma to help treat patients who have suffered major trauma to stabilise them for transport, usually to a Major Trauma Centre, for adults or children. This has been found to result in significantly improved patient outcomes. Local blood bike charity Freewheelers EVS assists NHS Blood and Transplant with the logistics of keeping the helicopter supplied with blood and plasma. In 2018, GWAAC were called to 1,887 incidents, their busiest year since the service started in 2008. During the COVID-19 pandemic the service responded to COVID-19 cases, and crew members joined a team carrying out inter-hospital transfers for COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care. ==See also== *Air ambulances in the United Kingdom == References * The Association of Air Ambulances Category:Air ambulance services in England Category:2008 establishments in England Category:Healthcare in Bristol Category:Health in Somerset Category:Health in Gloucestershire ","title":"Great Western Air Ambulance Charity"},{"id":"46341631","text":"The State Highway 96 Bridge is a modern steel girder bridge with a concrete deck, carrying Arkansas Highway 96 across Vache Grass Creek east of Greenwood, Arkansas.

It follows a rolling release development model. The desktop environments are MATE and KDE, and the default display manager is LightDM. The system is certified to run on devices which have a minimum of 256MB of RAM, and it is suitable for both 32-bit (i386) and 64-bit (amd64) processor architectures. Moreover, the project is available for ARMv7 (armhf) architectures. In June 2017, the Parrot Team announced they were considering to change from Debian to Devuan, mainly because of problems with systemd. As of January 21st, 2019, the Parrot team has begun to phase out the development of their 32-bit (i386) ISO. ==Editions== Parrot has multiple editions that are based upon Debian, with various desktop environments available.  Parrot Security  Parrot is intended to provide a suite of penetration testing tools to be used for attack mitigation, security research, forensics, and vulnerability assessment. It is designed for penetration testing, vulnerability assessment and mitigation, computer forensics and anonymous web browsing. Parrot Home Parrot Home is the base edition of Parrot designed for daily use, and it targets regular users who need a \\"lightweight\\" system on their laptops or workstations. Allegedly, the distribution is useful for daily work. Parrot Home also includes programs to chat privately with people, encrypt documents, or browse the internet anonymously. The system can also be used as a starting point to build a customized pentesting platform. Parrot ARM Parrot ARM is a lightweight Parrot release for embedded systems. It is currently available for Raspberry Pi devices. == Parrot OS Tools == There are multiple Tools in Parrot OS which are specially designed for Security Researchers and are related to penetration testing. A few of them are listed below, more can be found on the official website.  Tor  Tor, also known as The Onion Router, is a distributed network that anonymizes Internet browsing. It is designed in a way that the IP Address of the client using Tor is hidden from the server that the client is visiting. Also, the data and other details are hidden from the client‚Äôs Internet Service Provider (ISP). Tor network uses hops to encrypt the data between the client and the server. Tor network and Tor browser are pre- installed and configured in Parrot OS.  Onion Share  Onion Share is an open-source utility that can be used to share files of any size over the Tor network securely and anonymously. Onion Share then generates a long random URL that can be used by the recipient to download the file over the TOR network using TOR browser.  AnonSurf  Anonsurf is a utility that makes the operating system communication go over Tor or other anonymizing networks.

He was beheaded at the Brandenburg-G√∂rden Prison after campaigning against the war, which ended in defeat for Germany some six months later. ==Life== As early as 1917 Leo Drabent was painting anti-war slogans on walls and fences in his hometown. 1917 as also the year in which he completed his traineeship as a fitter and, on reaching his eighteenth birthday, was drafted into the army. He was sent to the front, almost immediately badly wounded, and sent home. By this time he had also been part of a successful campaign to reduce from five to four years the training period for industrial apprenticeships in parts the metal based industrial sector. He joined the Communist Party in 1923 and later became the party's policy head for the Bremen sub-district. In 1929 he undertook a training at the \\"Rosa Luxembourg National Party School\\" (‚ÄûReichsparteischule Rosa Luxemburg‚Äú) at Fichtenau, after which he took an responsibility for Marxist training (\\"...f√ºr die marxistischen Schulungen\\") in the Communist Party's North West region. Also in 1929 he became Party Agitation and Propaganda Secretary for the Wasserkante district and a member of the Hannover provincial legislative assembly (\\"...des Hannoverschen Provinziallandtages\\"). In January 1933 the NSDAP (Nazi Party) took power. A priority for the new government was the rapid establishment in Germany of one-party government, and the new Chancellor had, in opposition, been particularly vitriolic about the Communist Party. Leo Drabent had incurred the wrath of many Nazis during their time in opposition by attending Nazi Party meetings and speaking out against their anti-worker policies. It was reported that 200 members of the Nazi Party quasi-military wing were mandated to find and arrest Leo Drabent. The arrest took place in May 1933. He spent the next few months in concentration camps at Brandenburg and Oranienburg, and also at the latter's sub-camp at Gut Elisenau (near Bernau) where he was tortured and badly mistreated. On his release he went to work at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen. He was rearrested in July 1936 and after a lengthy period of pre-detention sentenced, in November 1937, to three years in prison. The pretrial detention counted towards his prison term and he was released in July or August 1939. On his release he worked in a Bremen boat repair yard and resumed his (since 1933 illegal) work for the Communist Party. As war returned, he established a resistance network together with Hans Neumann and Gustav B√∂hrnsen later became a mayor of Bremen, of three and five person groups, and connected with the Hamburg based B√§stlein-Jacob-Abshagen Group. On 29 March 1943 Hans Neumann, Leo Drabant, his wife along with eight other resistance members were arrested by the Gestapo. On 13 October 1944 the special People's Court sentenced them all to death because they had \\"attempted to destroy the resistance of the German people with Communist Propaganda\\" ( ‚Äûdie Widerstandskraft des deutschen Volkes durch kommunistische Propaganda zu zersetzen gesucht‚Äú).

Little is known of the first building, which was probably a wooden structure, and was replaced with a more substantial stone building in the early 13th century, which was given to the Diocese of Ely in 1225-1228 by Absolom, the then rector. During the 16th century the church was a centre of Reformation preaching, with William Perkins serving as \\"lecturer\\" from 1585 until his death in 1602,Ferguson, Sinclair (1996), \\"Foreword\\", The Art of Prophesying, Banner of Truth Trust, Edinburgh. . when he was succeeded by Paul Baynes and Ralph Cudworth. By 1650 the medieval church building was in a poor state, and it was suggested that the parish be merged with that of Holy Trinity; it was however rebuilt largely at the expense of Christopher Rose (twice Mayor of Cambridge, in 1637 and 1654). Thomas Tenison, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1694, was curate of St Andrew's from 1662, where he set an example by his devoted attention to sufferers of the plague. Temple Chevallier, the theologian and astronomer, was curate and then vicar from 1822 until 1835. To accommodate a growing congregation, the church was entirely rebuilt in 1842-3 in a 15th-century East Anglian style by the architect Ambrose Poynter.Bradley, Simon. \\"Poynter, Ambrose\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (online ed.). Oxford University Press. It was rebuilt with a nave of five bays with side aisles and a west tower of four stages; the south porch and vestries were added later in the 19th-century. It does however retain elements of the earlier structure including early 12th-century double capitals in the heating chamber and some wall memorials, notably that of Captain James Cook. The Cook Memorial The Cook Memorial The church building contains a number of memorial tablets, most notably one of the explorer Captain James Cook and family. The memorial records Captain Cook, his wife Elizabeth, and their six children. Elizabeth died in 1835, aged 93, and was predeceased by all of her children; she is buried in the church alongside two of her sons, James and Hugh. She left a bequest to pay the minister, support five poor aged women of the parish and to maintain the monument. The 'Charity of Mrs Elizabeth Cook' is still registered. Recent history St Andrew's was declared redundant in 1984History of St Andrew the Great as the parish population had dwindled. However, the congregation of the nearby Holy Sepulchre Church ('the Round Church'), was looking for a new home as growth of the congregation had led them to run out of space. They raised the money to renovate St Andrew's, installing a new gallery, baptistry and rooms, and moved there in 1994. The parish associated with the church is now called Holy Sepulchre with All Saints. The Round Church is still used occasionally and is leased to Christian Heritage for exhibition and training courses. The church has been involved in three church 'grafting' schemes, to All Saints', Little Shelford (1997), Christ Church Cambridge (2004) and St Matthew's, Cambridge (2008). In each case a minister on the staff moved with a substantial number in the congregation to join the existing congregation in those places.Ash, Christopher, Davis, Mary and White, Bob (2012). \\"Persistently Preaching Christ\\", p. 123.

The Tolerance Act was introduced in line with the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment. There was also an economic motivation, namely, that religious toleration would make it easier for foreigners to work in Sweden. By the Act, all Christian immigrants were granted full freedom of religion and it also guaranteed their right to bring up their children in their faith. This act was followed in 1782 by the Judereglementet (The Jew's Law), which guaranteed freedom of religion specifically for Jewish immigrants. This legislation was a step toward full freedom of religion in Sweden. However, it only applied to immigrants and foreigners, while the Lutheran Swedish citizens were still restricted in their practice of religion by the konventikelplakatet. The Tolerance Act was replaced by the Dissenter Acts from 1860 and 1873, which made it legal for a Swedish citizen to leave the established Lutheran church and join another officially recognised denomination, but conversion to one of the so-called foreign religious communities was still hedged about by strong restrictions. The final act was the law of 1951, which allowed for complete freedom of conscience by allowing citizens to renounce or abandon one religious confession without replacing it with another, thereby formally also derestricting atheism. ==References== * Nordisk familjebok, 1904‚Äì1926.

Opened in 1938 as a commercial airport serving Derby, it was superseded by East Midlands Airport in the 1960s but continued as an airfield until 1990. The site is now occupied by a Toyota car factory. ==History== The airport was created at the suggestion of Captain Roy Harben DFC who persuaded the Air Ministry that a flying school was required. Harben was a veteran of the Royal Flying CorpsDerby Aviation Ltd, PictureThePast, retrieved 8 April 2015 and he was an expert at teaching people to fly.The Complete Flying course by Harben et al, Journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society, Volume 45, Part 2, page 127, retrieved 8 April 2015. The airport served the nearby town (now city) of Derby and was initially owned by Derby Corporation, who acquired the Burnaston House estate for ¬£21,500 in 1936. The airport was opened for training flights in 1938, with the official opening performed by the Secretary of State for Air, Kingsley Wood, in June 1939. Plans to develop the airport for commercial flights were interrupted by the Second World War, during which Burnaston was used by the Royal Air Force (RAF). In the postwar era Derby Aviation (later Derby Airways) began operating a number of scheduled services from Derby, the first route being to Jersey in 1953. During this time, Burnaston House served as the airport's terminal building. Commercial flights ceased in the 1960s when services were transferred to the newly opened East Midlands Airport nearby. The airfield continued to be used by flying clubs until being closed altogether in March 1990 to make way for the construction of a Toyota car plant. Upon the airport's closure, the Jones family established a new 3-runway grass airfield nearby. ==See also== *Derby Airfield *Tatenhill Airfield ==References== Category:Airports in the East Midlands Category:Defunct airports in England Category:1938 establishments in England Category:1990 disestablishments in England Category:History of Derby Category:Airports in Derbyshire Category:Airports established in 1938 Category:Airports disestablished in 1990 ","title":"Derby Airport (England)"},{"id":"46342136","text":"Larry Jackson (born September 28, 1990) is an American soccer player who currently plays for Oakland Roots SC in the National Independent Soccer Association. ==Career== College and Amateur Jackson played college soccer at Santa Clara University between 2009 and 2012.

UR was formed in 2013 through the merger of previously independent public institutions of higher education, the largest of which was the National University of Rwanda. The university's head office is in Kigali. The university is composed of six independent, self-governing colleges. ==History== Initial work to establish the institution was undertaken by Professor Paul Davenport, a member of Paul Kagame's Presidential Advisory Council, who now acts as chair of the university's board of governors. The University of Rwanda was established in September 2013 by a law that repealed the laws establishing the National University of Rwanda and the country's other public higher education institutes, creating the UR in their place. Law number 71/2013 transferred the contracts, activities, assets, liabilities and denominations of seven institutions to the UR: the National University of Rwanda (UNR); the Kigali Institute of Science and Technology (KIST); the Kigali Institute of Education (KIE; Ishuri Rikuru Nderabarezi rya Kigali/Institut Sup√©rieur P√©dagogique de Kigali); the Higher Institute of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (Institut Sup√©rieur d‚ÄôAgriculture et d‚ÄôElevage, ISAE/Ishuri Rikuru ry‚ÄôUbuhinzi n‚ÄôUbworozi); the School of Finance and Banking (SFB, Ishuri Rikuru ritanga inyigisho mu byerekeye Imari n‚ÄôAmabanki/√âcole des Finances et des Banques); the Higher Institute of Umutara Polytechnic (UP; Ishuri rikuru \\"Umutara Polytechnic\\"/Institut Sup√©rieur d‚ÄôUmutara Polytechnique); and the Kigali Health Institute (KHI; Ishuri Rikuru ry‚ÄôUbuzima ry‚Äô i Kigali/Institut Sup√©rieur de Sant√© de Kigali). At the time of its creation, education officials reported that they \\"hoped that the university will improve the quality of education and effectively respond to current national and global needs\\". Eugene Kwibuka of the Rwandan newspaper The New Times reports that many of the university's senior managers are well- established scholars with records of improving the performance of their previous institutions, but that many of them \\"are also well known elite Rwandans or dedicated friends of Rwanda and advisors to President Kagame who have recently contributed to the development of the education sector in Rwanda or have recently been involved with designing the newly created University of Rwanda\\". A key challenge facing the university is argued to be a lack of qualified lecturers. A 2015 article published in the Annals of Global Health, for example, notes that in the School of Public Health, part of the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, a barrier to the university merger's goal of improving the quality of higher education teaching and research in Rwanda is \\"limited skilled academic staff\\". The School employs six PhD-level and six master's-level faculty, as well as five research assistants. Moreover, it delivers a large number of degree programmes and has a \\"disproportionate student-supervisor ratio\\" of 15 students per PhD-holding faculty member. The university leadership plans to increase the proportion of academic staff holding doctoral degrees from 20 per cent to 60 per cent by 2024. In February 2019, it was announced that the university would start offering a master's degree in Kinyarwanda. ==Organisation and administration== The head office is, along with the College of Business and Economics, in Gikondo Mburabuturo. It is organised into six subject-based colleges: *College of Arts and Social Sciences (CASS, Koleji yigisha iby‚ÄôIndimi n‚ÄôUbumenyi bw‚ÄôImibereho y‚ÄòAbaturage/Coll√®ge des Lettres et Sciences Sociales) *College of Agriculture, Animal Sciences and Veterinary Medicine (CAVM, Koleji y‚ÄôUbuhinzi, Ubumenyi n‚Äòubuvuzi bw‚ÄòAmatungo/Coll√®ge d‚ÄôAgriculture, des Sciences Animales et M√©decine V√©t√©rinaire) *College of Business and Economics (CBE, Koleji yigisha iby‚ÄôUbucuruzi n‚ÄôUbukungu/Coll√®ge des Affaires et de l‚ÄôEconomie) *College of Education (CE, Koleji Nderabarezi/Coll√®ge de l‚ÄôEducation). *College of Medicine and Health Sciences (CMHS; Koleji y‚ÄôUbuvuzi n‚ÄôUbuzima/Coll√®ge des Sciences de M√©decine et de Sant√©) *College of Science and Technology (CST, Koleji y‚ÄòUbumenyi n‚ÄòIkoranabuhanga/Coll√®ge des Sciences et Technologies).

His predecessor was Northern Irish botanist Professor James McWha. The chancellor is Dr Mike O'Neal, former president of Oklahoma Christian University. ==Academic profile== , the university had 30,445 students, of whom 28,875 were undergraduates and 1,570 postgraduates. 99.4 per cent of UR students are Rwandan nationals. It employs 1,450 academics and 816 support and administrative staff. UR participates in a number of international collaborations. In February 2015, the University of Rwanda and Michigan State University launched a joint MSc degree programme in agribusiness, assisted by United States Agency for International Development funding. The programme aims to help Rwandan women establish themselves in agribusiness. The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency is funding research capacity development in Rwanda through the university. ==Noted people== Agnes Binagwaho, Rwanda's health minister, became the first person to be awarded a PhD by the new University of Rwanda in August 2014. Binagwaho, whose research concerned children's health rights in the context of HIV/AIDS, started her PhD in 2008, prior to the university merger. ==References * Category:2013 establishments in Rwanda Category:Educational institutions established in 2013 Category:Universities in Rwanda ","title":"University of Rwanda"},{"id":"46342254","text":"Derby Airport may refer to: * Derby Airport (Australia), airport located at Derby, Western Australia * Derby Airport (England), former airport which was located at Burnaston, Derbyshire ==See also== * Derby Airfield, airfield located at Egginton, Derbyshire, England ","title":"Derby Airport"},{"id":"46342258","text":"The Darrieus‚ÄìLandau instability is an intrinsic flame instability that occurs in premixed flames due to the thermal expansion of the gas produced by the combustion process. It was predicted independently by Georges Jean Marie Darrieus and Lev Landau. The instability analysis behind the Darrieus‚ÄìLandau instability considers a planar, premixed flame front subjected to very small perturbations. It is useful to think of this arrangement as one in which the unperturbed flame is stationary, with the reactants (fuel and oxidizer) directed towards the flame and perpendicular to it with a velocity u1, and the burnt gases leaving the flame also in a perpendicular way but with velocity u2. The analysis assumes that the flow is an incompressible flow, and that the perturbations are governed by the linearized Euler equations and, thus, are inviscid. With these considerations, the main result of this analysis is that, if the density of the burnt gases is less than that of the reactants, which is the case in practice due to the thermal expansion of the gas produced by the combustion process, the flame front is unstable to perturbations of any wavelength. Another result is that the rate of growth of the perturbations is inversely proportional to their wavelength; thus small flame wrinkles (but larger than the characteristic flame thickness) grow faster than larger ones. In practice, however, diffusive and buoyancy effects that are not taken into account by the analysis of Darrieus and Landau may have a stabilizing effect.Markstein, G. H. Non-steady flame Propagation,(1964). P22, Pergarmon, New York. Amable Li√±√°n and Forman A. Williams quote in their bookLi√±√°n, A., & Williams, F. A. (1993).

Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 331, 439-443. that it was indeed courageous of Darrius (1938) and Landau (1944) to publish - in the face of laboratory evidence of the existence of stable planar laminar flames - analyses showing the instability of a plane flame sheet to disturbances of all wavenumbers. ==Dispersion relation== If the disturbances to the steady planar flame sheet are of the form e^{i\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\bot+\\\\omega t}, where \\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\bot is the transverse coordinate system perpendicular to the steady flame sheet, t is the time, \\\\mathbf{k} is the wavevector of the disturbance and \\\\omega is the temporal growth rate of the disturbance. Then the dispersion relation is given byWilliams, F. A. (2018). Combustion theory. CRC Press. page 353 :\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{S_L k} = \\\\frac{R}{1+R}\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{1+ \\\\frac{R^2-1}{R}}-1\\\\right) where S_L is the laminar burning velocity (or, the flow velocity far upstream of the flame in a frame that is fixed to the flame), k=\\\\mathbf{k} and R=\\\\rho_u/\\\\rho_b is the ratio of unburnt to burnt gas density. Since R>1 always in combustion due to the thermal expansion by heat release, the growth rate \\\\omega>0 is also always positive for all wavenumbers. The whole analysis becomes invalid when the wavelength becomes comparable to the flame thickness, i.e., k^{-1}\\\\sim l_F=\\\\alpha/S_L, where \\\\alpha is the thermal diffusivity. If the buoyancy forces are taken into account for vertically propagating planar flames so that the gravity vector with magnitude g points from the unburnt side to burnt gas side, the dispersion relation becomes :\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{S_L k} = \\\\frac{R}{1+R}\\\\left[\\\\sqrt{1+ \\\\left(\\\\frac{R^2-1}{R}\\\\right)\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{g}{S_L^2 k R}\\\\right)}-1\\\\right] This implies that gravity introduces stability when k^{-1}>l_b=S_L^2R/g. The range of instability region due to the density jump across the flame becomes l_F. If l_b, then there is no hydrodynamic instability. ==References== Category:Fluid dynamics Category:Combustion Category:Fluid dynamic instability ","title":"Darrieus‚ÄìLandau instability"},{"id":"46342268","text":"Stefan Defregger (born January 31, 1993) is a former American soccer player. ==Career== College and Amateur Defregger played college soccer at Dartmouth College between 2011 and 2014.http://www.dartmouthsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=11600&ATCLID;=205156574 Professional Defregger signed with USL side Wilmington Hammerheads on March 24, 2015.http://www.wilmingtonhammerheads.com/hammerheads-sign-stefan- defregger/ He made his professional debut on March 28, 2015 as a 75th-minute substitute during a 2-2 draw against Richmond Kickers.https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/03/29/united-states/mls- reserve-league/wilmington-hammerheads/richmond-kickers/2001156/ == References  * Dartmouth profile Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:People from Gilford, New Hampshire Category:American soccer players Category:Dartmouth Big Green men's soccer players Category:Wilmington Hammerheads FC players Category:Rochester Rhinos players Category:USL Championship players Category:Soccer players from New Hampshire Category:Association football midfielders ","title":"Stefan Defregger"},{"id":"46342272","text":"Hubwoo is a publicly traded company founded in 1999 by SAP and private French Investors that specializes as a cloud-based spend management and business process automation solutions provider based on SAP technologies.

Fields specializes in ceramics, non-functional earthenware, and ribbonwork. Museums that have collected Fields' work include the Heard Museum in McKinney, Texas, the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the Museum of Art and Design in New York City, the Museum of the American Indian at the Smithsonian Institution, and Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. Her work has been included in exhibitions such as Atlatl's Who Stole the Tepee at the National Museum of the American Indian, Legacy of the Generations: American Indian Women Potters at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Fluent Generations: The Art of Anita, Tom and Yatika Fields at the Sam Noble Museum, and Hearts of Our People: Native Women Artists, a traveling 2019-2020 exhibition at Minneapolis Institute of Art, Minneapolis, MN, Frist Art Museum, Nashville, TN, Renwick Gallery, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C., and Philbrook Museum of Art, Tulsa, OK. In 2019, Fields participated in an exhibition project called \\"Voices from the Drum\\" where 19 drums were dispersed to accomplished Osage artists. Each artist created a design to be displayed on the drum. The drums, having significance in Osage culture, were created by hand by Rock Pipestem. Fields is working at the Tulsa Artist Fellowship in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and is involved in a 3 year term on the Osage Election Board as an Alternate Member. ==Early life== Anita Luttrell was born in Hominy, Oklahoma, on the Osage Nation. She is enrolled in the Osage and is a descendant of the Muscogee Creek. She grew up on her grandfather's allotment until she was around eight years old, when her family moved to Colorado. Fields lived in Colorado until she was 18 years old. Her father was a guide, outfitter, and a welder who supported the family. Fields' grandmother on her mother's side was a seamstress, and taught Fields how to sew when she was a young girl. Fields enjoyed making clothes for her favorite doll and relished in these artistic outlets from an early age. While in third grade in Colorado, Fields was taught how to make a fresco and a collage. Her teacher at the time was passionate about the arts and influenced Fields' own love for art that would develop through time. ==Education== After graduating from Wheat Ridge High School, Fields attended the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA) in Santa Fe, New Mexico from 1972 to 1974. She originally went there to paint, but was exposed to many different media such as video and multi-media, clay, and sculpture, which expanded her focus. Fields met her husband, Tom Fields (Muscogee Creek/Cherokee), in Colorado over a holiday. Fields left the institute to raise a family with Tom. Before having children, Fields took classes at community centers and museums, such as the Osage Nation Museum. During this time Fields learned Osage finger weaving and ribbonwork. The Oklahoma Department of Career and Technical Education hired Tom, so the couple moved to Stillwater, Oklahoma. Fields later enrolled at Oklahoma State University and graduated with a bachelor's degree in fine arts. It was after completing her BFA that she made the commitment to become a full time clay artist. ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm able to use clay, and the earth, I have this really strong feeling of how the earth holds the memory of the people who were there,‚Äù she said. == Artwork == Starting out, Fields began making non- functional sculptures, such as little figurines. Fields made an entire series of little clay boxes with smaller clay figures inside of them. During this period, Fields developed a lot of her work through the process of terra sigillata. Anita's work is usually fired in an electric kiln and finished by a postsmoking process with sawdust, straw, or leaves. She often adorns nonsmoked sculptures with tiny raku ware additions, such as elk teeth. While many of her works are figurative, the figures represent the spirituality and do not depict anyone in particular. Fields explains, \\"I want to show the spirituality of us as women, how we fit into family, how we remain strong yet filled with love, and how we overcome all difficulties.\\" Clothing is a prominent inspiration in Field's clay work. For her, clothing is a symbol of transformation and heritage. Some of her pieces are dresses, standing independent, or of female figures wearing dresses. In line with this theme, Fields created a series of clay parfleches. She was especially interested in the metaphor these parfleches provided of the culture of the times and was fascinated by what we make to take care of ourselves. Other examples of her work include masks, platters, buckskin dresses, and abstracted figurative work. Her depiction of domestic motifs is intended to honor all women. After witnessing the graffiti work of her son, Fields was inspired to start incorporating distorted messages on her work. For example, in her work \\"Finding Our Way to the Earth\\" she includes her grandmother‚Äôs handwriting as background images. She said her grandmother kept detailed notes on calendars and stenographer notebooks. ‚ÄúMy grandmother had really beautiful handwriting,‚Äù she said. == Exhibitions == Fields' work has been displayed in many museums. A sample of these include: * Heard Museum * National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum * Museum of Art and Design * Smithsonian Institution National Museum of the American Indian * National Museum of Women in the Arts * Sam Noble Museum, Fluent Generations: The Art of Anita, Tom, & Yatika Fields *Minneapolis Institute of Art, Minneapolis, MN *Frist Art Museum, Nashville, TN *Renwick Gallery, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C. *Philbrook Museum of Art, Tulsa, OK. *Hearts of our People: Native Women Artists, (2019), Minneapolis Institute of Art, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. == Criticism and press == Most recently, Fields was interviewed and received a spread in the February/March 2019 issue of American Craft Magazine.

During World War I he served as head of the Kriegsrohstoffabteilung (War Raw Materials Department ‚Äì KRA) of the Prussian Ministry of War created by Walther Rathenau. After the German revolution of 1918, Koeth was in charge of economic demobilisation as a member of the first democratically elected government under Philipp Scheidemann. He again served briefly as a minister of the Weimar Republic under Gustav Stresemann in 1923. ==Early life== Joseph Koeth was born on 7 July 1870 in Lohr a. Main, Lower Franconia, then a part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. His father, Joseph (1829-1913) was a lawyer. His mother, Susanne (1845- 1903), came from a farming family. He was married to Helene (1874-1958), n√©e Fenkohl from Eastern Prussia (a sister of , a painter). They had one son, who was killed in war. ==Military career== After serving for eleven years in the Bavarian Army, Koeth joined the Prussian Army in January 1900 as a Premier-Lieutenant. He had attended the War Academy at Munich for three years (1895‚Äì98) but was not awarded the full qualification to join the general staff, despite excellent performance. He then served for nine years as a chief of battery in the 4th Badische Feldartillerie-Regiment Nummer 66 and in the training regiment Feldartillerie-Schie√üschule at J√ºterbog (after 1904). After August 1909, Koeth worked at the Prussian Ministry of War (Feldartillerie-Abteilung, A 4). In March 1912, he was promoted to Major. After the start of World War I, Koeth briefly served as Abteilungskommandeur (Battle of the Marne, static battles in the Champagne). However, in early October 1914 he returned to department A4 in the Ministry. In late February 1915, after working as an acting head of department, he succeeded Walter Rathenau as head of the Kriegsrohstoff- Abteilung (KRA, commodity department), without having had any prior experience in this field. His task was to provide war production with the required raw materials. He succeeded in this work through a system of Planned economy, systematic recycling of used materials and by accessing new sources of commodities. The work of his office (employing around 2,500 people at the end of the war) was highly regarded and brought him the recognition of the military command, industrialists and trade unions. However, in 1916/17 there were sharp differences with general Wilhelm Groener, head of the Kriegsamt, in connection with the Hindenburg Programme and the '. The cooperation with Groener's successor, Heinrich Scheuch, went more smoothly. In March 1917, Koeth was promoted to Oberstleutnant and Abteilungschef (head of department). ==Demobilisation and political career== On 11 November 1918, Koeth left active service with the rank of Oberst (colonel). Both industrialist and trade union organisations had already lobbied chancellor Max von Baden to put him in charge of demobilisation. Under the Council of the People's Deputies, Koeth became Staatssekret√§r (de facto minister) of the ' (office for demobilisation), a position created for him. When the cabinet of Philipp Scheidemann took office in February 1919, he became Reichsminister f√ºr wirtschaftliche Demobilmachung (Minister for Demobilisation) until the Ministry was dissolved on 30 April 1919. His difficult task was to move the German war economy to a peace footing against a backdrop of revolutionary conditions and with responsibilities and power structures still in flux. The economic depression with rising unemployment and the devaluation of the currency caused by the post-war slump presented important obstacles on the way towards an industrial structure geared to the new requirements of peace-time Germany. Although Koeth extensively intervened in the economy, he opposed socialisation of the factors of production as demanded by the left wing of the revolution. There was considerable overlap between Koeth's portfolio and the Ministries of Finance, Economic Affairs and Labour, resulting in conflicts with Eugen Schiffer, Rudolf Wissell and Gustav Bauer. Koeth also was the founding president of the German War Graves Commission in 1919 (until 1923). In March 1920, he took on the honorary chairmanship of the Gesch√§ftsstelle f√ºr industrielle Abr√ºstung (Geifa) of the Reichsverband der deutschen Industrie/Sonderausschu√ü f√ºr industrielle Abr√ºstung (industrialists' organisation). In October and November 1923, Koeth was Minister of Economic Affairs in the second cabinet of Gustav Stresemann. It was so short-lived, though, that he was unable to make a major contribution to policy - although during his period in office the Papiermark was replaced with the Rentenmark, which laid the foundation for the stabilisation of the currency and the end of hyperinflation. ==Further career== He was a member of the supervisory boards of several large and mid-sized companies and, until February 1930, chairman of the Deutsche Weltwirtschaftliche Gesellschaft. He also advised the Reichswehr at times. Koeth spent his final years in complete retirement. He died on 22 May 1936 in Berlin. ==Works== * Rohstoffbewirtschaftung, in: Handbuch der Politik II, 1920, pp. 224‚Äì35. * Die wirtschaftliche Demobilmachung, Ihre Aufgaben und ihre Organe, in: Handbuch der Politik IV, 1921, pp. 163‚Äì68. == Honours== * Honorary doctorate (Dr.-Ing. h.c.), Technische Hochschule Dresden ==References * Joseph Koeth at the files of the Reichskanzlei * Press articles on Koeth at the digitalised archives of HWWA and IFW Category:1870 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Military personnel of Bavaria Category:German military personnel of World War I Category:People of the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919 Category:Prussian Army personnel ","title":"Joseph Koeth"},{"id":"46342475","text":"Mar√≠a Teresa Tula (born 23 April 1951) is a Salvadoran political writer and activist associated with the group COMADRES. This group supports those who have been subjected to forced disappearance or political assassination in El Salvador. ==Life== Tula was born in Izalco on 23 April 1951. She was brought up by her grandmother and attended school for less than two years before she had her first child at fifteen whilst she was living with her brothers, sisters and step-siblings. She met Jos√© Rafael Canales Guevara who was a blacksmith when she was sixteen. Guevara was arrested for organising workers against their employers. Tula joined the group called COMADRES which created protests against the government. Comadres had been set up with the support of Archbishop Romero and it was a support group for the relatives of those who were forcibly disappeared or killed. Romero was himself killed in 1980 as was Tula's husband. Tula's husband's body was found with a bullet wound to his head two days after people, who said they were the police, took him away to help with a robbery enquiry. Tula's husband was said to have been a witness to the crime. Friends said that she should not reclaim her husband's body but Tula defied their advice. 1980 was the year that the government and the opposition became entrenched. The political and military opposition were subject to the death squads who killed 1000 people per month. After the death of her husband, Tula worked full-time for COMADRES, who themselves became a target. Some of her fellow activists were captured and killed, but COMADRES did not shy away from controversy and their workers visited dumps to photograph bodies so that families would know the fate of the \\"disappeared\\". Tula was given a specific warning of her own fate by an escaped prisoner of the government. Tula left for Mexico with her four children in 1982 where she continued her activism in Mexico City. Tula's resolution was strengthened in 1984 when her organisation was given the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights Award. This award is given to those who show courage and have made a significant contribution to human rights in their country. Up to 1985 she toured Canada and Europe talking to feminists and others about the cause. She visited at least eight countries and during this journey she realised how the ideas of feminism could be used in her country. Tula was tortured and raped after she returned to her home country in 1986.Maria Reresa Tula, Dictionary of Women Worldwide, 2007, retrieved 7 April 2015 She had returned to work for COMADRES and she was released after four months due to international pressure which highlighted her mistreatment. In 1987 she arrived in the United States where she was again subject to politics. She applied for political asylum but this took seven years to achieve. The American government was supporting the government in El Salvador and although she had the personal support of dozens of senators she found herself accused of being a terrorist. In 1994 she achieved asylum and Tula wrote Hear my testimony which documented her life and her views. The following year she moved to Minneapolis where she found a job in an electronics company. Since the mid 1990s she has worked for a twinning organisation, called COCODA, that pairs up communities in El Salvador with partner communities in the United States.

In April 2015, an oil spill caused a massive explosion and fire, which burnt for 4 days and led to the evacuation of 30,000 residents. After a 3 year repair, Dragon Aromatics was reorganised and renamed Fuhaichuang, 90% owned by the Chinese government via Fuhua Gulei Petrochemical Co Ltd, and 10% by Dragon Aromatics, Taiwan‚Äôs Xianglu Group. ==Location== The Dragon Aromatics petrochemical plant is located in the port of Gulei, Zhangpu County, which is in the southernmost Fujian province; , the company name contains Zhangzhou, the main city of the prefecture. Gulei lies within Dongshan Bay, on a peninsula formed by the Zhang River estuary at the Taiwan Strait of the Pacific ocean. Gulei peninsula was once famous for carrot production, and the area used in flower and fruit production. ==Chemical operations== The plant makes paraxylene (PX), a feedstock in the production of polyester chips and fiber. It uses a production process called ParamaX, licensed by a French company named Axens, seated in Rueil-Malmaison, which occurs in two main stages: In a 4-million-tons per year (tpy) condensate distillation unit (often referred to as condensate splitter), natural-gas condensate, referred to as condensate, is processed to light naphtha and heavy naphtha and naphtha hydrotreating for purification. The PX facility was originally designed to turn heavy naphta feedstock into PX by \\"aromizing\\" or mixed aromatics production, paraxylene purification, C8 aromatics isomerization (xylenes and ethylbenzene) and aromatics transalkylation. The one million tonnes a year of light naphtha were supposed to be marketed to Chinese plants making ethylene. The original plan of using heavy naphta as feedstock was later modified to add a condensate splitter. Besides PX, the PX facility creates other aromatics components (over 1.0 tpy per 2007 plan): It produces orthoxylene (160,000 tons per year (tpy) per 2007 plan), needed to make plasticizers and resins in paints, coating and auto parts industries. The plant also produces benzene (228,000 tpy per 2007 plan), \\"the starting block of a large set of polymeric materials such as nylon fibers, polystyrene for plastic packaging, polycarbonates for impact-resistant glass substitutes and compact disks\\". As of 2015, the plant included two PX production lines and a benzene unit, each with a capacity to produce 800,000 tpy of paraxylene per unit (and 1.6 million tpy total) and 240,000 tpy of benzene ,which was twice the PX (800,000 tpy) and about 5% more of the benzene (228,000 tpy) that had been planned in 2007. By the end of April 2015, the plant was to increase condensate splitting to 5.5 million tonnes a year (137,000 barrels per day). ==History== Dragon Aromatics is a subsidiary of the Taiwanese Xianglu Dragon Group, owned by Taiwanese expatriate tycoon Chen Yu-hao. In 2004, Dragon Aromatics was based in Xiamen province, and received a license to build a petrochemical complex producing PX there. This was surprising given that \\"Chen's other plants in Xiamen had already been cited for repeated emissions infractions\\". In March 2007, Zhao Yufen, a chemistry professor at Xiamen University had collected 105 signatures by members of the China's \\"top political advisory body\\" opposing the project and, in June, thousands of Xiamen residents protested, forcing local officials to drop the plan\\". After this \\"rare mass protest\\", the parent company Xianglu moved the project to Zhangzhou. The company initially intended to build in Dongshan County, \\"but large protests, in which some people were detained, prompted the site to be changed to Gulei. In January 2009, the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection permitted construction of a petrochemical plant in Zhangzhou and Gulei, to produce p-xylene and a nearby Xianglu company factory to transform p-xylene into polyethylene terephthalate. By the end of 2009, there were 16 PX producers by 13 companies, nearly doubling capacity over the next years, with the petrochemical department at China International Engineering Consulting Corp predicting that China needed \\"to build at least 10 new PX facilities each with a capacity to produce 800,000 tons of the chemical a year over the next decade\\". The plant was expected to begin production in mid 2012, but \\"was delayed by slower-than-expected construction and problems in gaining environmental clearance\\". Other sources reported that the Ministry of Environmental Protection opposed the project in October 2012, because no environmental assessment had been done,and fined it 200,000 yuan in January 2013 for starting construction prior to an approval. In May 2013, it had requested that the National Development and Reform Commission, in charge of economic planning, stop the project. Until the plant opened in 2013, China had imported 53% of its paraxylene. On July 30, 2013, before its start up, a \\"small blast\\" occurred at the Gulei plant, when its 3.2-million-tpy hydrocracker unit was tested and a hydrogen pipeline leaked. This incident delayed start-up by one week. No casualties or toxic leaks were reported at that time. On April 3, 2015, one day after the news of a breakthrough in the Comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear program, Reuters reported that Iran was to supply China more condensate under a new contract, specifically mentioning Dragon Aromatics. 2015 fire On 6 April 2015, a chemical fire at a pumping station for condensate storage in Zhangzhou caused an explosion and injured 6 people, before 430 fire fighters were reported to have put it out. The South China Morning Post wrote that an oil spill had caused the fire burning in three massive storage tanks, injured 14 people, six of them severely enough to go to hospital, four of them were firefighters. It reported that, on April 7, 350 police and more than 600 firefighters were at the scene, and that more than 400 soldiers were deployed, forcing evacuations of residents within a vicinity of 18 km. Officials had said that fires had been put out at 4:40pm, yet 3 hours later the fire restarted. BBC reported on 8 April 2015, citing Xinhua News Agency, that \\"foam sprayed by firefighters to cover the residue was becoming unstable due to the heat and was disintegrating, and was being shifted by strong winds\\". One of the tanks of about 1,500 tonnes of liquid hydrocarbon reignited and exploded. More than 14,000 residents were evacuated. On April 8, the Los Angeles Times called the massive fire an \\"inferno\\", and that chemical defense corps members of the army fought amongst the firefighters. It quoted Wen Yunchao, who participated in the Xiamen protests, but has been staying the U.S., as saying \\"This is a sad situation for the residents in Zhangzhou\\". Ma Tianjie from Greenpeace East Asia said that there were no reports of leakage into groundwater, that the 16 PX plants had a production capacity of 10 million tons per year and that Dragon Aromatics was only 8% of China‚Äôs PX production. Lin Boqiang, a US- trained energy economist at Xiamen University and director of the Energy Economics Research Center, said \\"that the amount of punishment that can be issued [for environmental protection enforcement] is ...too low,‚Äù. On April 9, 2015 news spread that the fire had been put out. About 29,096 people had been evacuated per Xinhua, as some 10,500 people had moved to new homes by the end of 2014, but \\"more than 400 people were still living in the area\\", according to the director of the management committee of Gulei economic development zone. Plastic News, an industry communication by Crain Communications, Inc. claimed, \\"The facility was not in production but rather at the end of a three week maintenance service project when the incident happened.\\" Indeed, on 20 March 2015, another industry website, ICIS Pricing (Independent Chemical Information Service) by Reed Business Information had reported that \\"China‚Äôs Dragon Aromatics has shut its paraxlyene (PX) facility in Zhangzhou earlier in the week for a scheduled maintenance.\\" Local news coverage of the incident by Dongnan Zaobao (Southeast Morning News) was censored, while \\"China Central Television carried footage of the fire, with flames shooting into the air, but provided few details\\". According to the Fujian occupational safety agency, the fire was caused by \\"flaws in production procedures\\". By April 7, 2015 the price of paraxylene and benzene in Asia had increased by 5%. In the days after the fire, the ministry of environmental protection released draft regulation, allowing representatives of environmental organizations to \\"scrutinise\\" the ministry's performance and assisting public-interest groups in lawsuits they may file. 2018 As of 2018, the plant was reorganised and renamed Fuhaichuang, 90% owned by the Chinese government via Fuhua Gulei Petrochemical Co Ltd and 10% by Dragon Aromatics, Taiwan‚Äôs Xianglu Group. After a 3-year shutdown, the repaired plant was to restart operations by June or July 2018 with a splitter enlarged to 110,000 bpd. ==See also== *polyester resin ==References * Category:Petrochemical companies Category:Industrial fires and explosions in China Category:Companies based in Fujian Category:2013 establishments in China Category:2013 disasters in China ","title":"Dragon Aromatics"},{"id":"46342606","text":"Katch It With Khanyi was a South African television talk show produced by Endemol Africa and hosted by Khanyi Mbau where she interviewed South African celebrities, including politicians, footballers and artists.

In 2013 she became the first person to cycle to the South Pole from the edge of the continent. Leijerstam started her expedition on the Ross Ice Shelf at the edge of the Antarctic continent, and cycled for 10 to 17 hours each day with no rest days, and the total distance cycled was . Leijerstam's cycle was a three wheeled design, and she reached the pole faster than any previous skiing expedition. == Early life == In June 1978, Leijerstam was born in Aberdare, Wales, United Kingdom, to Adrianne and Anders Leijerstam. == Education == Leijerstam studied mathematics at Plymouth University. == Career == Leijerstam was a consultant for Siemens, BAE Systems and Ford. She worked in Germany and Sweden for several years, before moving back to Wales where she now lives with her partner, Wayne Edy, founder of the running shoe manufacturer Inov-8.  Sports  During her time at Plymouth University, Leijerstam used the sports facilities of the University Officers Training Corps, a youth organisation of the British Army, and became an enthusiastic outdoor athlete. Over the years, she learned outdoor, water and winter sports, including long-distance running (single and double marathon, ultramarathon) mountaineering, hiking and trekking, skiing, cycling, multisport, canoeing, sailing and rally racing. Leijerstam has taken part in competitions all over the world. Her successes include Canoe Marathon Devizes to Westminster International (2014), multi-sport adventure race Patagonian Expedition Race (2013), Surf Ski Race Rhoose Ski Race (2012), Triathlon Ironman UK (2010), Rally Car Racing Land Rover G4 Challenge (2009), Multisport Race Three Peaks Yacht Race (2008) and Turas World Adventure Race (2008). In 2007, Leijerstam became the first Welsh woman to complete in the Marathon des Sables where she ran six marathons in seven days, battling extreme high temperatures. In 2012, she became the first woman to complete the Siberian Black Ice Race, cycling across Lake Baikal, the longest and deepest frozen freshwater lake in the world.  White Ice Cycle  Maria Leijerstam at the geographical South Pole At the end of 2013, Leijerstam gained a Guinness World Record in an expedition known as the White Ice Cycle, becoming the first person in the world to reach the South Pole by cycling. She also holds the record for the fastest trip from the edge of the Antarctic continent to the South Pole using purely muscle strength. Leijerstam completed the almost- route from the Ross Ice Shelf on the edge of the Antarctic to the South Pole in just over 10 days. During the trip, she followed the South Pole Traverse, which led her on a steep climb through the Transantarctic Mountains, over the high Leverett Glacier and above the Antarctic plateau. Whilst riding, she fought against extreme cold, strong winds and snow drifts on the track. A custom-built recumbent trike called the Polar Cycle, made by Inspired Cycle Engineering (ICE), helped Leijerstam secure her record. Her rivals (Juan Men√©ndez Granados and Daniel Burton) rode standard upright bikes and took almost 4 weeks longer than Leijerstam to reach the summit. The wide balloon tires and a modified gear shift allowed Leijerstam to pass through snowdrifts and climb steep inclines. In April 2016, Leijerstam ran a marathon at the floating airbase from the North Pole before cycling the rest of the way.  Burn Series  Leijerstam runs a multi-sport company, Burn Series. The adventure racing events held across South Wales are both a challenge and for fun, with the Mini Burn, a shorter and more diverse ‚Äòtriathlon‚Äô, aimed towards families. The events consist of running, mountain biking, kayaking and orienteering. The Mini Burn is the only adventure race in the UK where both parents and children can compete together. == See also == * Roald Amundsen * List of Antarctic cycling expeditions ==References External links == * Maria Leijerstam at BBC.com * Maria Leijerstam at guinnessworldrecords.com Category:Living people Category:Welsh polar explorers Category:People from Aberdare Category:1978 births Category:Alumni_of_the_University_of_Plymouth ","title":"Maria Leijerstam"},{"id":"46342674","text":"Plac Grunwaldzki may refer to: * Plac Grunwaldzki in Szczecin * Plac Grunwaldzki in Warszawa * Plac Grunwaldzki in Wroc≈Çaw ","title":"Plac Grunwaldzki"},{"id":"46342678","text":"Shake Shake Go is a British indie folk band based in London, England.

The law is designed specifically to make acts of cyberbullying and online harassment a criminal offence. ==Overview== The Act abolished the common law tort of harassment, replaced by its statutory provisions. It also replaced sections 13A to 13D of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, and expanded the scope to cover acts conducted online and increased the penalties to include imprisonment sentences. The Act is intended to cover both intentional and unintentional harassment, and has extra- territorial jurisdiction for certain offences which include online acts by the defendant if the complainant was in Singapore at the time of the offence and the defendant knew or should have known of that fact. The new law is also to be accessible for the public than previously: for instance, provisions are now made for alleged complainants to apply a protection order against an accused, and in more extreme cases a separate expedited protection order can be applied for and issued immediately. In addition, anyone who abuses public servant and public service worker, including service staff from the public transport service, can be prosecuted under this Act and the maximum penalty of jail for up to a year and/or a fine. Generally, for uncomplicated and minor cases private in nature, the offences may be compoundable by the alleged complainant for an out-of-court settlement, but subject to the consent of the DPP. For civil law and relational cases, they may be referred for mediation at the State Courts Centre for Dispute Resolution (SCCDR), including Magistrate's Complaints or applications under the Protection from Harassment Act. Mediation is a way of resolving a dispute without going for a trial in court. It is known as an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) method. == Amendments in 2019 == In 2019, the Parliament seek to amend the Act to tackle offences such as doxxing. The original 2014 Act would kick in only if the communications to be ‚Äúthreatening, abusive or insulting‚Äù. Doxxing would not apply as it would only be considered as an act of divulging personal information. Additionally, the amendment simplified the process for victims to by setting up a specialised court within the State Courts of Singapore. The amendment also introduced a mechanism for individuals and entities to seek correction orders to counter fake news about them. Whilst there are similarities between this amendment and the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), POFMA can only be invoked by ministers of Singapore and it will take a longer time for individuals and entities to successfully apply for a correction order. ==Cases== The Ministry of Manpower, National Trades Union Congress and Singapore National Employers Federation are at present the primary institutions in deterring workplace harassment. In August 2015, a former Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) senior officer was charged in court under a POHA complaint filed by a woman complainant. The maximum penalty for the offence is up to a S$5,000 fine and 12 months' jail. In December 2016, fortunately, the defendant engaged a defence counsel and managed to compound the court charge by making an open court apology and a monetary compensation to the alleged complainant as a composition. The alleged complainant was agreeable to the composition after the consequences of accepting and rejecting the offer of composition were thoroughly explained to her. Having considered the facts and in the light of further developments arising after he was first charged, the deputy public prosecutor has consented to composition. Hence, he was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal by the court judge. In May 2015, the Ministry of Defence obtained a protection order against The Online Citizen. It was later, after legal arguments made by lawyers Choo Zhengxi and Eugene Thuraisingam, overturned by the Court of Appeal in January 2017, which ruled in a 2-1 judgement that the Government of Singapore is ineligible as a 'person' to apply for a protection order against any individual. In July 2019, a senior policeman was interdicted from service, charged in court and fined for harassment to a female colleague. Thereafter, a Singapore Police Force (SPF) spokesperson said that its officers are not only expected to uphold the law but maintain the highest standards of conduct and integrity. He added that SPF deals severely with officers who break the law, including charging them in court. Moreover, SPF has since commenced disciplinary proceedings against him after the court verdict. In 2019, a few people were charged in court for using foul language to vehemently abuse public servants and public service workers. As at March 2019, there were more than 500 Protection Order applications made since Nov 2014. In December 2019, a freelance actress-model Melissa Faith Yeo was charged and fined under POHA for abusive language and hurling vulgarities towards public servants. In March 2020, 5 men were charged in court for abusing public servants. ==See also== * Protection from Harassment Act 1997, United Kingdom ==Reference list *Protection from Harassment Act 2014 (No. 17 of 2014) - Singapore Statutes Online Category:2014 in law Category:2014 in Singapore Category:Singaporean criminal law Category:Singaporean legislation Category:Harassment ","title":"Protection from Harassment Act (Singapore)"},{"id":"46342733","text":"Group H of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification tournament was one of the 13 groups to decide the teams which qualify for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations finals tournament.

(1886-1972), Minnesota Museum of Art, 1972 in downtown Saint Paul, Minnesota. He designed homes, country estates, timber-frame cabins, and public spaces, until his death at age 85. ‚ÄúHe consistently drew from the vernacular forms that connected him to his clients‚Äô tastes,‚ÄùDale Mulfinger, ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Architecture of Edwin Lundie,‚Äô‚Äô Saint Paul: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 1995. favoring the historical architectural precedents of Norman, Tudor, early Scandinavian, and American colonial. In 1922, he became a member of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), and in 1948, he became Fellow, FAIA, ‚Äúfor his contribution to the advancement of the profession because of his achievement in design.‚Äù ‚ÄúLundie belongs to a generation who came to the profession with a background in the grand manner of the Beaux-Arts but went on to pursue a career devoted to the domestic work ‚Äì a regionalist in the best sense of the word with work connecting to Scandinavian sources that no doubt resonated with many of his clients because of their ancestry but also seemed admirably suited to the lake country of northern Minnesota.‚Äù Robert A. M. Stern, Architect, New York, February 2018 ==Life and work== Edwin H. Lundie was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and at the age of thirteen, he moved with his parents to Salem, South Dakota. Then, just out of high school, in 1904, he departed for Saint Paul, Minnesota, where he began his career in architecture as an apprentice in the Saint Paul firm of Cass Gilbert (1858-1934) with Mr. Gilbert's colleague Thomas Holyoke (1866-1925), from 1904 through 1911. When Mr. Gilbert moved entirely to his office in New York, Edwin Lundie continued as a draftsman for Thomas Holyoke, and at the same time he studied drawing at the Saint Paul School of Art.‚Äô‚ÄôIn Conversation with Mr. Lundie,‚Äô‚Äô Northwest Architect (May‚ÄìJune, 1969). With the encouragement of Mr. Holyoke, in 1911, Edwin Lundie joined the staff of the firm of the French-trained Emmanuel Masqueray (1861-1917) as draftsman, with affiliation in the Atelier Masqueray, in Saint Paul, influenced through the American Society of Beaux-Arts Architecture. For the next several years Edwin Lundie assimilated into Masqueray‚Äôs office, and was steeped in the rigors of an enormous workload of complex and grand-scale architectural commissions, while readily absorbing the principles of architectural design.Peter J. O'Toole, \\"Edwin H. Lundie - Five Decades - A Journey of Art & Architecture,‚Äô‚Äô Saint Paul: Artist Book Press, 2016. Lundie became a lead draftsman remaining with Emmanuel Masqueray until the latter‚Äôs unexpected death in 1917. At this time, Edwin Lundie, with two of his fellow draftsmen, Frederick Slifer (1885-1948) and Frank Abrahamson (1885-1972), from the office of Monsieur Masqueray, formed a temporary partnership to divide and complete several of Masqueray‚Äôs remaining commissions. Lundie was individually responsible for overseeing the implementation and completion of Masqueray‚Äôs designs for the Cathedral of Saint Joseph in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and the Chapel of Saint Thomas Aquinas, at the University of St. Thomas, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. This same year, in 1917, Edwin H. Lundie opened his own office in Saint Paul‚Äôs Endicott building, where he had been employed for the prior thirteen years, and where he would remain in private practice as an architect for the next five decades specializing in domestic architecture varying in scale from cottages to country estates. ‚ÄúLundie did not call on the repertoire of the more lavish Renaissance and Beaux-Arts forms that distinguished the careers of his previous employers. Instead, he took his classical training and inherent art talent in a different direction, favoring smaller, less formal designs on a more intimate scale. Lundie‚Äôs architecture was defined by the use of traditional materials, processes, and the talents of a variety of artisans.‚ÄùPeter J. O'Toole, ‚Äò‚ÄôEdwin H. Lundie ~ Companion ~ The Office of an Architect,‚Äô‚Äô Saint Paul: Artist Book Press, 2018. While his architect peers were favoring modern or contemporary design commissions, ‚Äú[Lundie] created a paradigm for an intimate cultural connectedness so often missing in the modernist, somewhat elitist proposition of service. That model would give greater importance to the transformation of convention, type, style, and image and put diminished importance on invention.‚ÄùDale Mulfinger, ‚Äò‚ÄôEdwin Lundie,‚Äô‚Äô Architecture Minnesota (November-December, 1992). Edwin Lundie‚Äôs approach to design was to convey the spirit of not only what was necessary to execute the authenticity of his creations, but also to exemplify the charm of engagement of human craftsmanship. He always wished to attract clients who represented what he called ‚Äúan aristocracy of good taste,‚Äù and he chose his clients, whether for big projects or small, who he thought had an awareness and appreciation for fine things, who ‚Äúwant fine things done for them within what they can afford to do.‚Äù ‚ÄúA man of modesty, he struggled with the problem of how much the architect should lead. Ultimately, he thought of his clients first and served them well. His reassuring structures are models of his perfectionist bent, as well as expressions of his eye for beautiful materials: brick, stone, timber, wrought iron. He spent many hours with clients to realize their personal wishes, and then he would supervise the workmen closely to exact the best standards of craftsmanship from them. He had all the gifts, not the least of which was a lack of egotism, to make people‚Äôs dream houses come true.‚Äù Deanna Marohn Bendix, ‚Äò‚ÄôEd Lundie,‚Äô‚Äô Architecture Minnesota (July-August, 1983). ‚ÄúHe communicated his vision with clients and was inspired to express his ideas through presentation drawings and design. He was a true artist of the architectural perspective rendering genre, always paying meticulous attention to the chronological architectural period, studying and refining the details, and applying great sensitivity to the picturesque context of each client architectural situation.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe sustained a high level of humanness in his type and method. Through paradigm shifts in technology, new types and new methods come and go; a sense of humanity often escapes, but architecture is enhanced when it is sustained. Through finesse his designs extended toward what his clients found aesthetically pleasing and comfortable: a delivery of his integration of art and architecture.‚ÄùPeter J. O'Toole, ‚Äò‚ÄôEdwin H. Lundie ~ Companion ~ The Office of an Architect,‚Äô‚Äô Saint Paul: Artist Book Press, 2018. ‚ÄúIn sharp contrast to the Modernists who were getting much of the attention during the height of his career, Lundie gravitated toward the classical. His work was inspired both by...the French Beaux-Arts movement and the practicality of the Colonial Revivalists: homes with even proportions, shutters and a cottage style that evoked a feeling of rural England or the French countryside. Lundie‚Äôs trademark became taking basic elements of the home and turning them into discrete works of art.‚ÄùJackie Crosby, Streetscapes: Edwin Lundie filled his houses with hand-designed touches Minneapolis Star and Tribune, March 8, 2015 ‚ÄúEdwin Lundie designed houses that evoke a sense of the old way of building, elemental and beyond the whims of style. Whereas most Period Revival architects approached their work as a kind of theater, for Lundie it seems to have been more: a genuine effort to find meaning in the forms and techniques of the past.‚Äù Larry Millett, AIA Guide to the Twin Cities (St. Paul: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 2007), 557. ==Personal life== Edwin Hugh Lundie's parents were Samuel F. and Emma Lenora (Hitchcock) Lundie.

It uses an array of LIDARs (scanning laser beams) to gather this information about size and distance, using an optical concept called coherence (wherein waves of the same frequency align perfectly.) NCIs can capture 3D images of objects with sufficient accuracy to permit the creation of high resolution replicas using 3D printing technology. The detection of both intensity and relative delay enables applications such as high-resolution 3D reflective and transmissive imaging as well as index contrast imaging. == Prototype == An NCI using a 4√ó4 pixel grid of 16 grating couplers operates based on a modified time-domain Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) ranging scheme, where concurrent time-domain measurements of both period and the zero-crossing time of each electrical output of the nanophotonic chip allows the NCI to overcome the resolution limits of frequency domain detection. Each pixel on the chip is an independent interferometer that detects the phase and frequency of the signal in addition to the intensity.

August 4, 1964 is an oratorio for mezzo-soprano, soprano, tenor, baritone, choir, and orchestra written by the American composer Steven Stucky with a libretto by Gene Scheer. It was commissioned by the Dallas Symphony Orchestra in honor of the centennial of the birth of 36th U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. The piece premiered September 18, 2008 at the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas, with conductor Jaap van Zweden leading mezzo- soprano Kelley O'Connor, soprano Laquita Mitchell, baritone Robert Orth, tenor Vale Rideout, the Dallas Symphony Chorus, and the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. The work specifically follows the events of August 4, 1964 during Johnson's presidency, including the Gulf of Tonkin incident and the discovered bodies of three murdered civil rights workers in Neshoba County, Mississippi.Stucky, Steven (September 2008). August 4, 1964 (world premiere). Retrieved April 7, 2015. The piece was nominated for the 2013 Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition. ==Composition== Librettist Gene Scheer based the text of August 4, 1964 on various diaries, letters, news reports, and other historical documents regarding the day's events. The work explores its narrative from two perspectives: those of the grieving mothers of James Chaney and Andrew Goodman, and those of Johnson and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara in the Oval Office. On the inspiration for the work, Stucky recalled: The piece is scored for choir, orchestra, and four vocal soloists cast in historic roles: *Mrs. Goodman, mezzo-soprano *Mrs. Chaney, soprano *President Lyndon B. Johnson, baritone *Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, tenor Structure A performance of August 4, 1964 lasts approximately 70 minutes. The work is composed in twelve movements: #The Saddest Moment #Historians #Oval Office 1 #I Wish to Be a Part of that Fight #The Secret Heart of America #Oval Office 2 #Elegy #Letter from Mississippi #Oval Office 3 #August Fourth #Had We Known #What is Precious is Never to Forget ==Reception== Reviewing world premiere of August 4, 1964, James R. Oestreich of The New York Times praised the piece as \\"a complex tribute to a complex man with a deeply divided legacy\\" and added, \\"Mr. Scheer created a tapestry of overlapping streams of consciousness, and Mr. Stucky responded with a varied, colorful and mercurial score.\\" Alex Ross of The New Yorker said of the work, \\"In Stucky‚Äôs piece, formidable vocal and instrumental resources are marshalled to evoke, in a virtuosically eclectic style, the passions and flaws of a monumental figure.\\" Paul Kirby of Theater Jones further elaborated: Scott Cantrell of The Dallas Morning News was notably more critical. Despite calling Stucky \\"a master of orchestral writing,\\" Cantrell ultimately described the vocal writing as \\"serviceable, but often stilted\\" and said of the work, \\"It‚Äôs a strange pi√®ce d‚Äôoccasion, and too expensive with the demanding solo and chorus parts to attract many other performances. The money and efforts might have gone to something promising more of an afterlife.\\" ==References== Category:Compositions by Steven Stucky Category:2008 compositions Category:Oratorios Category:21st-century classical music Category:Music commissioned by the Dallas Symphony Orchestra ","title":"August 4, 1964"},{"id":"46342843","text":"Adolf Ruthardt Adolf Ruthardt (9 February 1849 ‚Äì 12 September 1934) was a German piano teacher, composer and music editor.

Redman, USN (Ret) is a retired naval officer and U.S. Navy SEAL. He is the founder and spokesperson of the nonprofit organization Wounded Wear and the author of the memoir The Trident: The Forging and Reforging of a Navy SEAL Officer. ==Early life and education== Redman was born in southern central Ohio. He grew up in North Carolina, Florida, Virginia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Redman comes from a military family. His paternal grandfather flew B-24 Liberator bombers for the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II and was highly decorated. His great uncle was shot down in the Pacific during the early years of World War II. Redman's sister is a United States Air Force officer and his brother is a Marine. His father was an Army Airborne instructor, airborne rigger, and jumpmaster during the Vietnam War. From an early age, Redman knew he wanted to serve. He attended Lumberton High School in North Carolina. Redman graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Science degree in business management and honors in business administration from Old Dominion University. ==Career== Military On September 11, 1992, at the age of seventeen, Redman enlisted in the United States Navy. His first two years in the Navy were spent working as an Intelligence Specialist working for the Navy and Naval Special Warfare. In 1996, Redman graduated BUD/S class 202 in December of 1995 and earned his SEAL Trident. Redman then took part in several counter-narcotics missions in Colombia and Peru. By 2000, he had risen to the rank of Petty Officer First Class. In December 2000, he was an instructor for SEAL Team's Basic Land Warfare block of training. For a year and a half, he taught Marksmanship, Reconnaissance, Surveillance operations, and Advanced Communications. Shortly after, Redman was selected as one of the 50 enlisted personnel in the Navy to participate in the Seaman to Admiral program, which would put him on the \\"officer track.\\" In May 2004, he was commissioned a Naval Special Warfare Officer. Redman was transferred from SEAL Team 4 to SEAL Team 10. The next year he was deployed to Afghanistan then Iraq. In 2006, he graduated from the U.S. Army Ranger School. The next year, Redman was deployed to Fallujah, Iraq. After 21 years in the US Navy, Redman retired in 2013. Fallujah, Iraq On September 13, 2007, during a special operations mission, Redman was struck by machine gun fire. It first hit him in the left elbow, then in the right side of his face, entering his jaw and exiting through his nose. At the time he was acting as the Assault Force Commander. Their mission was to capture a \\"high-value Al-Qaeda operative.\\" In all, Redman was shot seven times to the face and arms. Recovery LT Redman arrived at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland on September 16, 2007. As of 2012, he had undergone 37 surgeries, and required 1,200 stitches, 200 staples, 15 skin grafts, and one tracheotomy. Redman lost his sense of smell and has a limited range of motion in his left arm. While Redman was recovering, he hung up a sign on his hospital door. He said, \\"the sign came about because a few people came into my room with sorrow for the wounds I received and I pledged shortly after I was wounded not to feel sorry for myself, so I wasn't going to allow anyone else to feel sorry for me.\\" The bright orange sign read: > Attention to all who enter here. If you are coming into this room with > sorrow or to feel sorry for my wounds, go elsewhere. The wounds I received I > got in a job I love, doing it for people I love, supporting the freedom of a > country I deeply love. I am incredibly tough and will make a full recovery. > What is full? That is the absolute utmost physically my body has the ability > to recover. Then I will push that about 20 percent further through sheer > mental tenacity. This room you are about to enter is a room of fun, > optimism, and intense rapid regrowth. If you are not prepared for that, go > elsewhere. It was signed, \\"The Management.\\" The sign attracted then-President George W. Bush, and Redman had the chance to meet him in the Oval Office. The sign hangs at the wounded ward of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Activism Jason (pictured far left) Redman founded the non-profit organization Wounded Wear while he was recovering. Because of his scars, he was always being asked if he was wounded in a car accident or motorcycle crash. Redman was never asked if he was hurt in combat, and that made him \\"bitter.\\" After a culmination of questions, he decided to design a t-shirt that read, \\"Stop staring. I got shot by a machine gun. It would have killed you.\\" On the back of the t-shirt was the American flag. After getting positive feedback from strangers, Redman realized that other wounded soldiers must be feeling the same way. Wounded Wear was founded in 2009. The organization donates clothing kits to warriors hurt in combat and to families of fallen soldiers. The kit contains clothing like jacket, workout gear, and t-shirts. They also alter clothing for soldiers injured in combat to accommodate their medical devices. Everything is done free of charge. As of 2014, Wounded Wear has donated 2,000 kits. In March 2015, Redman announced plans to hire a professional to take over his role, but Redman will remain the spokesperson. Redman also travels the country as a motivational speaker. He has spoken to the Marriott Corporation, the NFL Cincinnati Bengals, and the U.S. Men's 2010 Olympic Hockey Team. He is the head of staffing at Blue Star Veterans Network, where his job is to hire and employ wounded warriors and service disabled veterans. Redman is the founder of the private company, SOF Spoken. Author Redman started writing his memoir, The Trident: The Forging and Reforging of a Navy SEAL Leader, while he was in recovery. It was co-authored with John Bruning. ==Awards== While he was recovering at Bethseda Naval Hospital, Redman was honored with the Purple Heart. He has also earned the Bronze Star Medal with Valor, Navy Commendation Medal, Joint Service Achievement Medal, Navy Achievement Medal (five awards), and Combat Action Ribbon (2 awards). In November 2009, Redman was awarded the Alumni Service Award from his alma mater, Old Dominion University. In 2010, he was given the Hope and Courage award.

His works are in the collections of Tretyakov Gallery, Russian Museum, Pushkin Museum, Museum Ludwig (Germany), various museums and galleries in Russia, private collections of George Costakis (Greece), Cristina Barbano and Alberto Sandretti (Italy), Arina Kovner (Switzerland), Michael Alshibai and Vladimir Semenov (Moscow) and other private collections in Russia and abroad. ==Biography== Boris Kocheishvili began his career as an artist starting back in the 1960s. Over the years Kocheishvili has explored different artistic techniques, experimenting with the potential of various media, attaining great expressiveness, often leading in completely new artistic territory. In the 1960s, after graduating from Moscow Art College ‚ÄúMemory of the 1905 Revolution‚Äù, Boris Kocheishvili worked for several years at the Nivinsky Etching Studio. He showed in a 1963 Moscow exhibition of prints at the Pushkin Museum along with Illarion Golitsyn and Oleg Kudryashov. Kocheishvili later experimented with Indian ink and chalk on paper to create several hundred pieces in which he explored abstract qualities of the contrast of black and white in innovative ways. In his art images of women, architectural fantasies, flowers, and a variety of other subjects fill a boldly charged, rhythmically patterned graphic space. Seeking to decipher the basic structure of the image, Kocheishvili has made many stylistic discoveries. In the body of his work, subjects flow from piece to piece, creating an interwoven universe of rhythms and patterns. At the end of the 1960s Boris Kocheishvili turned to painting with oil. Working on a larger scale, using techniques discovered over years of experimentation with India ink he created refined, almost monochrome works. His oil paintings retain the subtlety and graphic impact of his earlier works. In the 1980s Kocheishvili produced an extensive series of pastels that are distinguished by elegant color and a precision of hard edged line using a ‚Äúdry fresco‚Äù technique. In the 1990s, the artist moved to relief sculpture, developing an individual approach to the venerable tradition. Using plaster and papier-m√¢ch√©, he created vivid all white compositions that seen in bright light produce a lively play of dancing shadows. The art critic Valerii Turchin said, ‚ÄúIn the reliefs of Boris Kocheishvili, as in his prints, we see the birth of form/shape itself. His works achieve a unique aesthetic level.‚Äù[–í–∞–ª–µ—Ä–∏–π –¢—É—Ä—á–∏–Ω. ¬´–ü—Ä–µ–¥—á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ –Ω–æ–≤–æ–π —Ä–µ–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏¬ª. –í—Å—Ç—É–ø–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–∞—è —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å—è –∫ –∫–∞—Ç–∞–ª–æ–≥—É –ö–æ—á–µ–π—à–≤–∏–ª–∏, –∏–∑–¥–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–º—É –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª–æ–º \\"–ù–∞—à–µ –ù–∞—Å–ª–µ–¥–∏–µ\\". –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞. 2009.] A series of black-and-gold works, crafted in black fiberboard from which mysterious shadows and golden figures emerge, also belong to this period. Beginning in 2000, the artist started working more and more with color. He has said that only after he turned 60 did he become seriously interested into wet paint. Boris Kocheishvili paints with acrylics as if they were watercolors, only sometimes turning to impasto painting oil techniques. In the winter of 2009 the artist once again returned to the technique of reliefs ‚Äì ‚Äúpainting with plaster‚Äù, which reflects his involvement with artistic illusionism. Using only his metal tool and a palette knife oil painting technique, the artist is able to create elegant figures, objects, forms. Painted in a copper or gold tone, his works come out looking like cast figures, at the same time acquiring an unexpectedly light, porous texture. ‚ÄúThis artist has a special place in the checkered painting that is contemporary art‚Äù Valerii Turchin tells us, ‚ÄúEvery creation of Boris Kocheishvili presents at the very least if not the idea of cosmic creation then the objective meaning of reality. It seems that many of his pieces have ordinary themes such as rafters, lapta players (Russian ball game) and tea parties. Many of his works give an impression of an absolute peace and a perfect harmony. But I think this peace is not stable; it is the calm before the storm. The mood, rhythm, and structure of the compositions make you expect something else. All is calm, safe; the world so delicate and fragile, but a feeling of subconscious anxiety makes one worry that it can all come crashing down. The world of his creation evokes the desire to keep it protected.‚Äù For more than five decades Boris Kocheishvili has created a large oeuvre, many of his works are in the holdings of Russian and foreign museums, as well as in many private collections. For more than twenty years Boris Kocheishvili has resided and worked in a small wing on one of Arbat‚Äôs many side streets. In his studio there are many works that have never been seen by the public. ==Solo exhibitions== * 1991 Gallery \\"Today,\\" Moscow * 1995 CHA Exhibition, Moscow * 1999 Exhibition of graphics \\"Coast,\\" Gallery \\"New Collection,\\" Moscow * 2002 Exhibition of graphics, Gallery Le Vall, Novosibirsk * 2004 \\"Reliefs and everything else,\\" Zverev SRC Gallery, Moscow * 2005 Black and white graphics, Zverev SRC Gallery, Moscow * 2006 Dry fresco painting, Zverev SRC Gallery, Moscow * 2007 \\"Reliefs of Georgia - relief Memoriam,\\" Reliefs Club\\" Brest, Moscow * 2007 Paintings, drawings, reliefs, Russian gallery, Tallinn, Estonia * 2007 \\"Color and gold Boris Kocheishvili,‚Äù Exhibition Center, \\"New Manege,\\" House of Anton Chekhov, Moscow * 2007 Paintings, drawings, reliefs, Exhibition Hall, Institute of Art, Moscow * 2008 \\"Legacy\\" painting, Exhibition Hall of \\"Our Heritage\\" Magazine, Moscow * 2010 ‚ÄúSigns of attention,‚Äù Paintings, reliefs, and poetry, Gallery A3, Moscow * 2010 Architectural drawings by Boris Kocheishvili, VKHUTEMAS Gallery, Moscow. * 2011 ‚ÄúPersons and their reflections,‚Äù State Literary Museum, Moscow * 2011 ‚ÄúSecond birth,‚Äù Early graphic works, 2.36 Gallery, Moscow * 2011 ‚ÄúOn a bank,‚Äù PL Gallery, Moscow * 2013 ‚ÄúSimple summer,‚Äù Russian Museum, St. Petersburg * 2015 ‚ÄúOkoem,‚Äù Zdes Gallery, Moscow ==Selected group exhibitions== * 1963 Prints, Pushkin Museum, Moscow * 1981 \\"Exhibition of 23,\\" Central House of Artists, Moscow * 1985 \\"Chicago International Art Fair,\\" Chicago, IL * 1988 \\"FIAC,\\" Paris, France * 1992 Together with O.

Originally purchased to transport coal for United States Navy ships during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, she served in that role until sold in 1919. While serving as the Chilean flagged steamer, Llai Llai, she was rammed by a Chilean warship on 11 March 1920 and sank near Iquique, Chile. ==Commercial service history== The USS Sterling was built by Robert Duncan and Company, Port Glasgow, Scotland. Originally christened as SS Lamington, she was launched on 23 August 1881 for the shipping firm Renton and Company, Glasgow, who planned to use her on their Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, Australia route. By July 1891, Lamington was transporting coal from the east coast of the United States, when she was rammed by the Old Dominion Steamship Company's Guyandotte off Lambert's Point, Virginia. On 5 February 1896 the Lamington, hauling fruit from Valencia, Spain to New York City ran aground 15 miles east of the Fire Island Lighthouse. Life saving crews from the Coast Guard Stations at Blue Point, Lone Hill and Bellport were able to rescue much of her crew from the wreck using breeches buoys on the first day. Salvage operations began almost immediately by men and tugs from the Merritt Wrecking Company, which likely kept her from breaking up during a storm that swept waves in over the deck and pushed her farther inland. At the first break in the storm the remaining crew, and one small Spanish pony, were rescued. After her cargo was removed, she was refloated on 26 February and towed to New York. The Merritt Company, awarded the salvage rights to the battered wreck of the Lamington, sold it for 17,500 dollars to C. A. Campbell and Company of Boston, Massachusetts, who planned to use her to work the coal trade. By April 1897, with her home port in Boston and renamed Sterling, she was moving coal along the United States' Atlantic coast, from as far south as Newport News, Virginia to as far north as Portsmouth, New Hampshire. ==Acquisition and commissioning== The United States Navy purchased the Sterling for 190,000 dollars from C. A. Campbell and Company in April 1898. Retaining her merchant name, she was commissioned on 16 April 1898 with Commander Robert E. Impey in command. ==Military Service history== Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, 1898 Pressed immediately into service during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Sterling was assigned to support the Flying Squadron from 1 through 24 May 1898. The Flying Squadron's commander, Commodore Winfield S. Schley, noted the Sterling lacked a hoisting engine, and deemed her insufficient for coaling his forces. She was then assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron where, on 27 May, Rear Admiral William T. Sampson sent her, under escort of the to join the blockade of Santiago de Cuba. Should it have been necessary to prevent the Spanish fleet from leaving, Sterling was to have been sunk at the narrowest part (determined to be 300 feet wide) of the channel leading into the harbor. That requirement never materialized, and the Sterling performed her primary mission of coaling warships. Through the remainder of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and until 1899, Sterling operated along the eastern coast of the United States and in the Caribbean area as a collier. On 31 December 1898, Sterling left Montevideo for San Juan, Puerto Rico, where she took the crippled in tow to Norfolk, Virginia for repairs. It was at this time the Great Blizzard of 1899 struck the Norfolk area and nearly dashed the Sterling on the breakwater near Cape Henlopen. Despite dragging both anchors and full steam on, a shipwreck was only diverted due to a fortunate shift in the wind. Despite a hole in her bow, Sterling was immediately ordered to sail for Boston and join the Topeka. Arriving in Boston around 17 February 1899, she was placed out of commission (likely to repair her damaged bow), on 1 March 1899. In November of that year, due to shortage of funds, repair work was stopped. Ordered to Asiatic Squadron, 1900 In early August 1900, repairs were ordered resumed for the Sterling. By late September, repairs were completed at the Charlestown Navy Yard and Sterling was one of seven colliers identified to support Admiral George C. Remey's Asiatic Squadron. Despite these orders, there is no record of Sterling leaving Boston until November 1901. Atlantic Fleet, 1901-1910 By 13 November 1901, Sterling was recommissioned, with orders to Lambert's Point to load coal for Guantanamo. Before she could resume her role of carrying coal for the Atlantic Fleet, she and the were ordered to New Orleans, Louisiana to support testing a new floating dry dock there. Sterling was successfully floated in the dry dock on 2 January 1902, fulfilling the preliminary trials prior to full test using Illinois. On 6 January, the Illinois was successfully raised by the floating dock and by the 14th Sterling left New Orleans. On May 8, 1902, Mont Pel√©e erupted and completely destroyed Saint-Pierre, Martinique killing 30,000 people. United States Secretary of the Navy William H. Moody ordered Yates Stirling, the commanding officer of United States forces at San Juan, Puerto Rico, to fit out the Sterling with supplies so she could make way for Martinique immediately. As the collier's captain was a merchantman, Commander George W. Mentz was ordered aboard to command her overall relief efforts. On 16 May, Sterling arrived in Fort-de-France with the United States' first installment of relief supplies and was still anchored nearby when she witnessed Mt. Pel√©e's subsequent eruption on May 20. For the remainder of 1902 she was active along the east coast, transporting coal and supporting naval war games, until late in December when she was damaged in a collision with the off Culebra, Puerto Rico. Quickly repaired, she was back in operation within two months. In June and July 1903, the battleships , , , and colliers , and Sterling participated in a transatlantic \\"race\\" from Tompkinsville to the Azores to determine how well the four battleships could stay together at various speeds over long distances. The 1906 Report of the Secretary of the Navy notes the Sterling was in the Norfolk Navy Yard undergoing repairs in August 1904. In early 1905, she supported Rear Admiral Sigsbee's Caribbean division of the North Atlantic Squadron. In August 1905 she was placed out of service, pending almost 24,000 dollars of repair work, at League Island where she remained through August 1906. After recommissioning on 24 August, she resumed regular coaling duties through May 1908. Of significance during this time, Sterling along with , , and , accompanied the Great White Fleet from Hampton Roads, Virginia to Port of Spain, Trinidad, the first refueling stop along the fleet's circumnavigation of the world. On 13 May 1908, she was placed in reserve at Boston. She was recommissioned on 24 November 1908 and resumed collier service along the Atlantic coast and the West Indies. In December, while searching for coal barges that had broken loose from their tug, Sterlings crew rescued the two master M. E. Eldridge, her crew exhausted after losing her sails in a storm and being adrift for over two days. The 1910 Report indicates that she was out of service on 30 April, berthed at the Portsmouth Navy Yard, New Hampshire for repair. She was back in service from 15 August 1911 to 29 May 1912 when, at Norfolk, Virginia, she underwent a repair survey. In August 1912, Sterling transported the foremast of the battleship , which was blown up in Havana Harbor in 1898, from Governor's Island to Annapolis, where it was later erected on the grounds of the Naval Academy. In late December 1912, Sterling transported naval aviators, their aircraft and other necessary supplies and equipment from the Naval Academy to Guantanamo, Cuba to establish a Naval Aviation training camp during the Atlantic Fleet's winter maneuvers. She resumed regular coaling assignments through 9 August 1913, when she was placed out of service. She was still assigned to the Norfolk Navy Yard on 1 January 1914, but was recommissioned on 2 February 1916. On 16 February 1916, Sterling left Norfolk, Virginia with supplies for the gunboat , medicine funded by the American Jewish Relief Committee and 60,000 pounds of matzoth paid for by Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society for Jewish sufferers in Palestine. After arriving in Naples around 3 April, Germany denied her clearance to Egypt so the supplies were delivered by other means. World War I Sterling spent the remainder of World War I supplying American bases and ships with fuel to maintain a steady flow of men and materiel to the battlefields in Europe. She served with the Atlantic Fleet Train until 9 January 1918, when the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) was established. On 19 April 1917, Sterling was so badly damaged in a collision with the in Hampton Roads, her commander beached her off Sewell's Point to avoid sinking. While still resting on a sandbar with water reaching her second deck, she was deemed salvageable by Navy inspectors. On 6 May 1919, Sterling was reassigned to the 3d Naval District for decommissioning and disposal. She was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 7 July 1919, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 3 August 1919. On 15 September, she was sold to F & H Starr, of New York City. ==Awards== *Spanish Campaign Medal *World War I Victory Medal (with Transport clasp) ==Collision and loss at sea== In late 1919, she was resold to the Anglo-South American Bank at Valparaiso, registered as a Chilean steamship, and renamed Llai Llai (for a town in Chile). On 11 March 1920, she was en route to load a cargo of nitrate and collided with the Chilean armored cruiser O'Higgins and sank near Iquique, Chile. ==References== * ==See also== * Category:1881 ships Category:Colliers of the United States Navy Category:Ships built on the River Clyde ","title":"USS Sterling (1898)"},{"id":"46343249","text":"The Persijn Estate (Persijn landgoed) in Maartensdijk is an estate with a white villa just west of the A27 motorway.

SCIMP is expressed in antigen-presenting cells (APC), namely B cells, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and macrophages. == Structure and interactions == Like other TRAPs, SCIMP has negligible extracellular domain and transmembrane domain followed by intracellular domain, containing several tyrosines and one proline-rich region (PRR). Upon phosphorylation, these tyrosines serve as docking domains for SH2 domains containing proteins. In a contrast to phospho- tyrosines, proline rich regions are generally less susceptible to post- translation modifications and they are rather targets of constitutive interactions with SH3 domains containing proteins. It has been shown that SCIMP interact via SH2 domains with Csk kinase, negative regulator of Src family kinases, but also with Slp65/76 and Grb2 adaptors, which are key pro- signalling soluble adaptor proteins in lymphocyte signalling network. SCIMP is constitutively associated with Lyn kinase via SH3 domain. == Membrane localization == Some of TRAPs are palmitoylated in a border region between transmembrane and intracellular domain. The aliphatic chain of Palmitic acid is anchored to the membrane bilayer and thus influence protein targeting to membrane microdomains. SCIMP is also palmitoylated and is associated with tetraspanin-enriched mircrodomains (TEMs). TEMs, unlike lipid rafts, are based more on protein-protein interactions than lipid-lipid/lipid-protein interactions. One of the resident proteins in TEMs is MHC class II molecule. SCIMP is present in the immunological synapse during antigen presentation between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell (APC). == In vitro studies and putative function == SCIMP becomes strongly phosphorylated after MHC II stimulation. Studies performed with fusion protein CD25-SCIMP showed its ability to induce calcium release and Erk phosphorylation upon anti-CD25 antibody treatment. The calcium release was even stronger in CD25-SCIMP mutant protein in binding side for Csk. Indicating negative feedback loop performed by Csk kinase. Fusion proteins are commonly used in order to study signalling ability of proteins with a small extracellular domain hidden for antibody in membrane glycocalix. However knock down of SCIMP didn¬¥t influence calcium release after anti MHC II antibody treatment, but only decrease level of Erk phosphorylation in longer time point (10 min.) == References == Category:Immunology Category:Proteins ","title":"SCIMP protein"},{"id":"46343284","text":"Latchman Bhansingh (born 26 November 1966) is a former Canadian international cricketer.

Painting by Joseph-D√©sir√© Court, 1841. The coronation of the Danish monarch was a religious ceremony in which the accession of the Danish monarch was marked by a coronation ceremony. It was held in various forms from 1170 to 1840, mostly in Lund Cathedral in Lund, St. Mary's Cathedral in Copenhagen and in the chapel of Frederiksborg Palace in Hiller√∏d. Enthronements of the Danish monarch may be historically divided into three distinct types of rituals: the medieval coronation, which existed during the period of elective monarchy; the anointing ritual, which replaced coronation with the introduction of absolute monarchy in 1660; and finally the simple proclamation, which has been used since the introduction of the constitutional monarchy in 1849. == Coronations of the elective monarchy == King Frederick II in St. Mary's Cathedral in Copenhagen in 1559. Historically an elective monarchy, the Danish kings had been elected and acclaimed at the Thing assemblies; this continued even after the tradition of coronations began. Ultimately, the acclamation rite only ceased with the introduction of hereditary monarchy in 1660, the 1657 acclamation of crown prince Christian (the later Christian V of Denmark) being the last occasion. The first coronation in Scandinavia took place in Bergen in Norway in 1163 or 1164. The first coronation in Denmark was that of Canute VI in St. Bendt's Church in Ringsted in 1170. The medieval monarchs used various locations for their coronations, with Lund Cathedral in Lund, the archepiscopal seat of Denmark, being the most preferred. Other locations include Viborg, Vordingborg, Kalmar and Ribe. After the accession of the House of Oldenburg to the Danish throne in 1448, the coronations were held in St. Mary's Cathedral in Copenhagen, and usually performed by the Bishop of Zealand. The coronation ritual (as of 1537) began with a procession of the ruler and his consort into St. Mary's cathedral in Copenhagen, followed by the Danish crown jewels. The monarch was seated before the altar, where he swore to govern justly, preserve the Lutheran religion, support schools, and help the poor. Following this, the king was anointed on the lower right arm and between the shoulders, but not on the head. Then the royal couple retired to a tented enclosure where they were robed in royal attire, returning to hear a sermon, the Kyrie and Gloria, and then a prayer and the Epistle reading. Following the Epistle, the king knelt before the altar, where he was first given a sword. After flourishing and sheathing it, the still-kneeling monarch was crowned by the clergy and nobility, who jointly placed the diadem upon their ruler's head. The sceptre and orb were presented, then returned to attendants. The queen was anointed and crowned in a similar manner, but she received only a sceptre and not an orb. Finally, a choral hymn was sung, following which the newly crowned king and queen listened to a second sermon and the reading of the Gospel, which brought the service to an end.Hoffmann (1990) == Anointings of the absolute monarchy == King Christian V and Queen Charlotte Amalie at Frederiksborg Palace in 1671. With the introduction of absolute monarchy in 1660, the full coronation ritual was replaced with a ceremony of anointing, where the new king would arrive at the coronation site already wearing the crown, where he was then anointed. The anointings were held in the chapel of Frederiksborg Palace in Hiller√∏d, with the exception of the 1767 anointing of King Christian VII which was held in the chapel of Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen. == Proclamations of the constitutional monarchy == This rite was in turn abolished with the introduction of the Danish constitution in 1849. Today the crown of Denmark is only displayed at the monarch's funeral, when it sits atop their coffin. The present queen, Margrethe II, did not have any formal enthronement service; a public announcement of her accession was made from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace, with the new sovereign being acclaimed by her prime minister at the time (1972), Jens Otto Krag, then cheered with a ninefold \\"hurrah\\" by the crowds below. == Historical list of coronations ==  Coronations  { width=90%  ! width=10%  Date ! width=10%  Site ! width=10%  Picture ! width=25%  Name ! width=25%  Reign ! width=20%  Other regnal titles - align=\\"center\\"1 January 1443align=\\"center\\"Ribe Cathedralalign=\\"center\\"80pxalign=\\"center\\"Christopher III with Dorothea of Brandenburgalign=\\"center\\"9 April 1440 - 5 January 1448align=\\"center\\"King of Norway King of Sweden - align=\\"center\\"28 October 1449align=\\"center\\"St. Mary's Cathedral, Copenhagenalign=\\"center\\"80pxalign=\\"center\\"Christian I with Dorothea of Brandenburgalign=\\"center\\"1 September 1448 - 21 May 1481align=\\"center\\"King of Norway King of Sweden - align=\\"center\\"18 May 1483align=\\"center\\"St. Mary's Cathedral, Copenhagenalign=\\"center\\"80pxalign=\\"center\\"John with Christina of Saxonyalign=\\"center\\"21 May 1481 - 20 February 1513align=\\"center\\"King of Norway King of Sweden - align=\\"center\\"11 June 1514align=\\"center\\"St. Mary's Cathedral, Copenhagenalign=\\"center\\"80pxalign=\\"center\\"Christian II with Isabella of Austriaalign=\\"center\\"20 February 1513 - 13 April 1523align=\\"center\\"King of Norway King of Sweden - align=\\"center\\"7 August 1524align=\\"center\\"St. Mary's Cathedral, Copenhagenalign=\\"center\\"80pxalign=\\"center\\"Frederick I with Sophie of Pomeraniaalign=\\"center\\"13 April 1523 - 10 April 1533align=\\"center\\"King of Norway - align=\\"center\\"12 August 1537align=\\"center\\"St. Mary's Cathedral, Copenhagenalign=\\"center\\"80pxalign=\\"center\\"Christian III with Dorothea of Saxe-Lauenburgalign=\\"center\\"4 July 1534 - 1 January 1559align=\\"center\\"King of Norway - align=\\"center\\"20 August 1559align=\\"center\\"St. Mary's Cathedral, Copenhagenalign=\\"center\\"80pxalign=\\"center\\"Frederick II with Sophie of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrowalign=\\"center\\"1 January 1559 - 4 April 1588align=\\"center\\"King of Norway - align=\\"center\\"29 August 1596align=\\"center\\"St. Mary's Cathedral, Copenhagenalign=\\"center\\"80pxalign=\\"center\\"Christian IV with Anne Catherine of Brandenburgalign=\\"center\\"4 April 1588 - 28 February 1648align=\\"center\\"King of Norway - align=\\"center\\"23 November 1648align=\\"center\\"St. Mary's Cathedral, Copenhagenalign=\\"center\\"80pxalign=\\"center\\"Frederick III with Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-L√ºneburgalign=\\"center\\"28 February 1648 - 9 February 1670align=\\"center\\"King of Norway }  Anointings (1660-1849)  { width=90%  ! width=10%  Date ! width=10%  Site ! width=10%  Picture ! width=25%  Name ! width=25%  Reign ! width=20%  Other regnal titles - align=\\"center\\"7 June 1671align=\\"center\\"Frederiksborg Palace Chapelalign=\\"center\\"80pxalign=\\"center\\"Christian Valign=\\"center\\"9 February 1670 - 25 August 1699align=\\"center\\"King of Norway - align=\\"center\\"15 April 1700align=\\"center\\"Frederiksborg Palace Chapelalign=\\"center\\"80pxalign=\\"center\\"Frederick IValign=\\"center\\"25 August 1699 - 12 October 1730align=\\"center\\"King of Norway - align=\\"center\\"6 June 1731align=\\"center\\"Frederiksborg Palace Chapelalign=\\"center\\"80pxalign=\\"center\\"Christian VIalign=\\"center\\"12 October 1730 - 6 August 1746align=\\"center\\"King of Norway - align=\\"center\\"4 September 1747align=\\"center\\"Frederiksborg Palace Chapelalign=\\"center\\"80pxalign=\\"center\\"Frederick V with Louise of Great Britainalign=\\"center\\"6 August 1746 - 14 January 1766align=\\"center\\"King of Norway - align=\\"center\\"1 May 1767align=\\"center\\"Christiansborg Palace Chapelalign=\\"center\\"80pxalign=\\"center\\"Christian VII with Caroline Matilda of Great Britainalign=\\"center\\"14 January 1766 - 13 March 1808align=\\"center\\"King of Norway - align=\\"center\\"31 July 1815align=\\"center\\"Frederiksborg Palace Chapelalign=\\"center\\"80pxalign=\\"center\\"Frederick VI with Marie of Hesse-Kasselalign=\\"center\\"13 March 1808 - 3 December 1839align=\\"center\\"King of Norway - align=\\"center\\"28 June 1840align=\\"center\\"Frederiksborg Palace Chapelalign=\\"center\\"80pxalign=\\"center\\"Christian VIII with Caroline Amalie of Augustenburgalign=\\"center\\"3 December 1839 - 20 January 1848align=\\"center\\"King of Norway (prior of being king of Denmark) } == See also == * Coronations * Monarchy of Denmark == Notes  References == * * Category:Danish monarchy Denmark Category:Ceremonies in Denmark ","title":"Coronation of the Danish monarch"},{"id":"46343604","text":"Ghouri, also Ghauri are a widely spread community of people in Pakistan.

He was the founder and first organizer of the Tour of Flanders cycling classic. ==Biography== Van Wijnendaele was the fifth of 15 children of a family in the hamlet of Wijnendaele, near Torhout. His father, a flax worker, died when Karel was 18 months.Vanwalleghem, Rik, Het Wonder van Vlaanderen, Pinguin, Belgium, , p18 He wrote in 1942: \\"Being born into a poor family was my strength. If you're brought up without frills (\\"sober opgekweekt wordt\\") and you know what hunger is (\\"door een mager leven gaat\\"), you grow up hard enough to withstand bike racing.\\" He left school at 14, worked for a baker, looked after cows, washed bottles and delivered parcels. He worked for well-to-do French-speaking families in Brussels and Ostend and felt humiliated by the way they treated him. Van Wijnendaele tried cycle-racing, won a few lesser prizes but soon turned to writing about cycling as a regional correspondent.Van Wijnendaele first wrote for De Torhoutenaer, his local paper, then from 1909 for Onze Kampioenen in Antwerp and Sportvriend in Izegem. It was then that he adopted his pen-name. This attracted the attention of De Maeght and his collaborator, race organiser L√©on Van den Haute, who asked van Wijnendaele to join their new paper Sportwereld. The first issue appeared in time for the Championship of Flanders on 12 September 1912. Van Wijnendaele became its editor on 1 January 1913. In 1925 he became co-owner and in 1931 full owner of Sportwereld, thereby also owning the Tour of Flanders, until the sports paper and the event were bought by daily newspaper Het Nieuwsblad . He remained editor-in-chief of Het Nieuwsblad's sports section until his death in 1961. He is buried at the cemetery of Sint-Martens-Latem. ==Flemish nationalism== Van Wijnendaele is known to have linked cycling and the Tour of Flanders to Flemish emancipation, in a time when the Belgian elite was still French- speaking. His articles fed the myth of the Flandriens, Flemish men who rose above their humble origins and became cycling champions. In modern times, media uses the term Flandrien to denote winners and specialists of all cobbled classic races. In 1964, a monument in honor of Van Wijnendaele was inaugurated near the top of the Oude Kwaremont, in the Ronde van Vlaanderenstraat (English: Tour of Flanders street) in Kluisbergen. The site is a pivotal location in the Tour of Flanders route. ==External links== *Official website Karel Van Wijnendaele ==Further reading== * Het rijke Vlaamsche wielerleven.

The spaceprobe would orbit Saturn and fly through Enceladus's geyser- like plumes multiple times. It would be powered by energy supplied from solar panels on the spacecraft. ==Overview== 'tiger stripes' feature.

Elana Glowatz, IB Times. 20 December 2017. If selected at another future opportunity, the ELF mission would search for biosignature and biomolecules in the geysers of Enceladus. The south polar jets loft water, salts and organic molecules dozens of miles over the moon's surface from an underground regional ocean. The hypothesis is that the water is warmed by thermal vents similar to features found deep in Earth's oceans. ELF's instruments would measure amino acids ‚Äî the building blocks of proteins ‚Äî analyze fatty acids, and determine whether methane (CH4) found in the plumes could have been produced by living organisms. In 2008, the Cassini orbiter was flown through a plume and analyzed the material with its neutral mass spectrometer. The orbiter detected simple organics, including methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) nitrogen, and complex organic compounds. Cassini also detected sodium and potassium at a concentration implying a salty liquid ocean. However, Cassini did not have the equipment with the sensitivity required for direct analyses. Mission concept 'tiger stripes' where the geysers are located. The Enceladus Life Finder (ELF) mission would pursue the implications of Cassini orbiter's 2005 discoveries of active jetting from, and existence of an ocean within, Enceladus. The mission concept would have the ELF orbiter fly 8 to 10 times over a period of 3 years through plumes of water launched above the south pole of Enceladus. The geysers could provide easy access for sampling the moon's subsurface ocean, and if there is microbial life in it, ice particles from the sea could contain the evidence astrobiologists need to identify them. The Principal Investigator is Jonathan Lunine of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Objectives The goals of the mission are derived directly from the most recent decadal survey: first, to determine primordial sources of organics and the sites of organic synthesis today; and second, to determine if there are current habitats in Enceladus where the conditions for life could exist today, and if life exists there now. To achieve these goals, the ELF mission has three objectives: #To measure abundances of a carefully selected set of neutral species, some of which were detected by Cassini, to ascertain whether the organics and volatiles coming from Enceladus have been thermally altered over time. #To determine the details of the interior marine environment -- pH, oxidation state, available chemical energy, and temperature -- that permit characterization of the life- carrying capacity of the interior. #To look for indications that organics are the result of biological processes through three independent types of chemical measurements that are widely recognized as diagnostic of life. ==Proposed scientific payload== hydrothermal activity on Enceladus. The ELF spacecraft would use two mass spectrometers to assess habitability of the interior oceanic environment. The payload consists of the MASPEX and the ENIJA, optimized to analyze respectively the gas and grains: * Mass Spectrometer for Planetary Exploration (MASPEX) is a next generation mass spectrometer with significantly improved performance over existing instruments, and optimized to analyze the gas expelled from the vents. * Enceladus Icy Jet Analyzer (ENIJA), optimized to analyze solid particles expelled from the vents. The Cassini spacecraft has measured small silica particles, normally formed at 90 ¬∞C or higher, streaming from Enceladus. The size and composition of the particles suggest that they come from current hydrothermal activity,Ocean Within Enceladus May Harbor Hydrothermal Activity.

ELF's instruments would conduct three kinds of tests in order to minimize the ambiguity involved in life detection. The first would look for a characteristic distribution of amino acids (the building blocks of proteins). The second test would determine whether the carbon number distribution in fatty acids or isoprenoids is biased toward a particular rule (even, odd, or divisible by a small integer). The third would measure carbon and hydrogen isotopic ratios, together with the abundance of methane relative to other alkanes, to assess whether the values fall in the range for biological processes. ==See also== * Abiogenesis * Astrobiology * Enceladus Explorer * Enceladus Life Signatures and Habitability (ELSAH) * Explorer of Enceladus and Titan (E2T) * Europa Clipper * Journey to Enceladus and Titan (JET) * Life Investigation For Enceladus (LIFE) * THEO ==References== Category:Discovery program proposals Category:Enceladus Category:Missions to Saturn Category:New Frontiers program proposals Category:Proposed NASA space probes Category:Proposed astrobiology space missions ","title":"Enceladus Life Finder"},{"id":"46343729","text":"C.

Operated by the Great Lakes Historical Society, it celebrates the natural and built heritage of the North American Great Lakes from a U.S. perspective. The museum is most noted as the docking location of a museum Lake freighter, the SS Col. James M. Schoonmaker. ==Description== The National Museum of the Great Lakes (NMGL) grew out of the Great Lakes Historical Society, a nonprofit organization of Great Lakes enthusiasts centered in the Cleveland area. For many years, the Society operated a small museum in Vermilion, Ohio. The Society moved its operations and opened a larger museum structure in Toledo in 2014, stimulated by the chance to combine its museum functions with the display of a historic lake freighter from the Second Industrial Revolution. The Schoonmaker is, as of 2019, moored adjacent to the museum. The 1911-launched vessel's riveted plates and pre-radar pilothouse show the technology available to shipbuilders and mariners at the beginning of the 1900s. The vessel is open to the public during the warm months. In 2018, the museum acquired through donation the retired Great Lakes Towing Co. tug Ohio. Plans are to refurbish the tug and open it for tours in the spring of 2019. The NMGL has taken on a growing affiliate role in the discovery, identification, and preservation of sunken ships in Lake Erie. With advances in maritime technology, it has become possible to find and identify an increasing percentage of these hulks. Sunken boats and ships, particularly vessels built before 1900, can be examined to discover facts about boatbuilding and maritime experience that are not clearly written down in historical texts. The NMGL's riverfront museum structure, opened April 26, 2014, attempts to celebrate both the natural and the man-made heritage of the Great Lakes. Primary displays, including model ships, allow a visitor to move through the Lakes' 350-year history of navigation. Physical memorabilia show the moving parts of sailing and steam operation, from rigging and machinery to the cutlery and chinaware used by the Great Lakes' now-vanished fleet of steam packets and passenger liners.

While in Aurora, Portillos played his club ball in the Real Colorado system. After high school, Portillos started school at the University of Washington, where he was named team Rookie of the Year for 2010. Portillos transferred to powerhouse University of Akron for his sophomore season and became a mainstay for the Zips for three years. While in Akron, Portillos worked alongside current Rowdies goalkeepers coach Stuart Dobson. Tampa Bay Rowdies On 23 February 2015 it was announced that Portillos had signed his first professional contract with the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League. Portillos first arrived in Tampa Bay for the Rowdies' Jan. 30-Feb. 1 invite-only combine, where he impressed Thomas Rongen's coaching staff and joined the team as a trialist. Portillos' first start with the Rowdies came against Swedish Allsvenskan champions Malm√∂ FF, and his first goal was the only one in a 1-0 victory over Portuguese side C.D. F√°tima during a preseason tour of Portugal. Portillos' preseason performance persuaded Head Coach Thomas Rongen to include him in the starting eleven for the Rowdies regular season opener against the defending Soccer Bowl champion San Antonio Scorpions. Portillos played all 90 minutes as part of a staunch Rowdies backline that stifled the Scorpions attack en route to a 3-1 win. On April 15, Portillos suffered a season-ending injury during training, rupturing his right Achilles tendon.

The oldest parts are the tower, nave and choir with apse. During the late Middle Ages a buttress was added to support the tower. During the second and third quarters of the 15th century the interior of the church was also vaulted. In the process, a set of Romanesque murals were obstructed, so that half of the murals are visible above the vaulting. The church was expanded during the 1770s with an addition to its northern side. A new church porch and entrance was added to the western side of the tower in 1837.

According to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, they were among an estimated 550 women and girls from Western countries who had travelled to join ISIL‚Äîpart of what someThomas Hegghammer, an expert on Islamist militancy affiliated with the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (source: ) have called \\"a jihadi, girl-power subculture\\". ==Background== Main entrance of Mulberry Academy Shoreditch, formerly known as Bethnal Green Academy On 17 February 2015, Abase, Begum, and Sultana flew via Turkish Airlines from Gatwick Airport in West Sussex, England, to Istanbul, Turkey. Their families went to Turkey in March to investigate their disappearance, deeming the police investigation inadequate. Their disappearance has been attributed to Aqsa Mahmood, a woman from Glasgow who joined ISIL in 2013. There were electronic communications between the girls and Mahmood. Mahmood faces criminal charges if she returns. Mahmood denies the allegations. In March 2015, footage was circulated of Abase Hussen, father of Amira Abase, at a 2012 rally led by Islamist preacher Anjem Choudary against the film Innocence of Muslims. The Metropolitan Police examined the footage but said that it was unlikely that offences had been committed. Hussen said in April that he felt ashamed of his involvement in the rally, as he did not know who had organised it. The girls stole family jewellery to pay for their flights. Begum married Dutch Islamic convert and IS jihadi fighter Yago Riedijk just days after arriving in Raqqa. They had two children who died from malnutrition and disease. At a 2015 Home Affairs Select Committee, then Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe stated that they would not face criminal charges if they returned to the United Kingdom. ==Aftermath== The disappearance resulted in the Metropolitan Police giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons on its circumstances in March 2015. The families of the girls received an apology from Scotland Yard, who did not tell them about Sharmeena Begum (unrelated), the other girl from their school who went to Syria in 2014. British Prime Minister David Cameron said that people should not be made \\"scapegoats\\" for joining ISIL. Contrary to the stance of the Metropolitan Police, Cameron said, \\"Whoever has gone out to join a terrorist organisation is breaking the law and has to face the consequences of breaking the law and we have to let the law take its course in the proper way\\". In March 2015, a travel ban was imposed upon five girls from the Bethnal Green Academy due to concerns from social services that the girls attend the same school as the three who had already joined the group, stating that it was in the public interest. Later on, Shamima Begum was reported to have married an American jihadist recruit who left her once she became pregnant. She had three children, all now deceased. Sultana was said to have married a western ISIL fighter with Somali heritage, but wanted to return to the UK after he was killed in battle. Shortly afterwards Sultana was killed in a Russian airstrike. Sultana's family in a phone interview with ITV in August 2016 said that they believed she died in an airstrike in May 2016 at the age of 17 while planning to escape. The lawyer who represents the family of the teenagers, Tasnime Akunjee, told ITV that she became too scared of making an escape attempt after another girl Samra Kesinovic was beaten to death for trying to escape. Abase married an 18-year-old Australian jihadist, Abdullah Elmir, in July 2016 who was reported by Australian intelligence agencies to have been killed in coalition airstrikes. After the teenagers married foreign jihadists, they moved into the homes of their new husbands in ISIL's de facto capital of Raqqa. In February 2019, The Times journalist Anthony Loyd found Begum in a Syrian refugee camp. When interviewed, Begum revealed that she was pregnant and hoped to return to the UK to raise her child, but did not regret her decision to join ISIL. In the debate that followed, the UK Home Office announced it would revoke her UK citizenship, while Bangladesh did not recognise her as a citizen. ==See also== *United Kingdom and ISIL *Brides of ISIL *Caliphate (TV series) ==References* * * Category:2015 in the United Kingdom Category:British children Category:British expatriates in Syria Category:English Islamists Trio Category:Trios Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Bethnal Green trio"},{"id":"46343957","text":"2 Timothy 1 is the first chapter of the Second Epistle to Timothy in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The letter is traditionally attributed to Paul the Apostle, the last one written in Rome before his death (c. 64 or 67), addressed to Timothy..Jerome Murphy-O'Connor, Paul: A Critical Life, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996, pp. 356‚Äì59. There are charges that it is the work of an anonymous follower, after Paul's death in the first century AD.. This chapter contains an opening greeting, a personal story of Paul and Timothy, a description of the opponents they are facing. ==Text== The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 18 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Codex Sinaiticus (AD 330‚Äì360) *Codex Alexandrinus (400‚Äì440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (c. 450; extant verses 3‚Äì18) *Codex Freerianus (c. 450; extant verses 1‚Äì3, 10‚Äì12) *Codex Claromontanus (c. 550) Parts of Codex Freerianus (~AD 450): A. Hebrews 13:16‚Äì18; B. 2 Timothy 1:10‚Äì12 ==Opening Greeting and Warnings (1:1‚Äì2)== The format of the opening greeting is familiar and follows the few first-century letter-writing conventions, comprising the name of the sender(s) and the recipient(s) with a salutation, similar to the one in the earlier epistle to Timothy. Verse 1 :Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, in keeping with the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, NKJV *\\"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus\\": refers to the converted Pharisee and apostle to the Gentiles; the same person who authored all the undisputed Pauline letters. The term \\"apostle\\" invokes the concept of his calling to ministry and appeals to authority. Verse 2 :To Timothy, my dear son: :: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. NKJV *\\"Timothy\\": a Paul's convert, originally of Lystra (Acts 16:1) with a Jewess mother, Eunice, an unnamed Greek father and a grandmother named Lois (2 Timothy 1:5).Halley, Henry H. Halley's Bible Handbook: an abbreviated Bible commentary. 24th edition. Zondervan Publishing House. 1965. p. 631 *\\"My dear son\\" (NKJV; KJV: \\"my dearly beloved son\\"; Greek: ·ºÄŒ≥Œ±œÄŒ∑œÑ·ø∑ œÑŒ≠Œ∫ŒΩ·ø≥, agapƒìt≈ç tekn≈ç): In 1 Timothy 1:2, and Titus 1:4, written at an earlier period than this Epistle, the expression used is in the Greek, \\"my genuine son\\" (Greek: Œ≥ŒΩŒ∑œÉŒØ·ø≥ œÑŒ≠Œ∫ŒΩ·ø≥, gnƒìsi≈ç tekn≈ç). Alford sees in the change of expression an intimation of an altered tone to Timothy, more of affection, and less of confidence, to indicate that Paul saw a lack of firmness in him, so he needs to stir up afresh the faith and grace in Christ (2 Timothy 1:6), but this seems not justified by the Greek word \\"agapetos\\", which implies the attachment of reasoning in the one \\"beloved,\\" not of solely instinctive love.. *\\"Grace, mercy, and peace\\" (Greek: ; , , ): This varies from the blessing at the beginning of the Epistles to the Romans, 1 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and 1 Thessalonians, by the addition of the word \\"mercy,\\" as in 1 Timothy 1:2 and Titus 1:4, and also in and .. ==Thanksgiving for Timothy's Faith (1:3‚Äì5)== The portion of thanksgiving-prayer is typical of the Hellenistic or Hellenistic-Jewish letters and included in most of Pauline letters, but the tone in this epistle is more for encouragement and forms a basis of Paul's appeal to Timothy. Verse 5 :When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. KJV * \\"Eunice\\" was a Jewish woman who \\"believed\\" in Christ, married to a Greek man and have a son, Timothy (Acts 16:1). *\\"The unfeigned faith\\": how Paul describes the faith and heritage of Timothy, which Paul is thankful for. Philip Towner summarized Paul's intention in this part is to confirm with Timothy that \\"in terms of our faith and spiritual heritage, we are cut from the same cloth. The obligations and call to duty that this implies for me also implies for you.\\" ==The Renewed Call to Boldness and Faithfulness in Ministry (1:6‚Äì14)== Based on Paul's confidence in Timothy's faith as expressed in the previous section, Paul gives his instructions to Timothy, more like handing over his ministry to his successor. Verse 6 :Therefore I remind you to stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. NKJV Verse 9 :He has saved us and called us to a holy life‚Äînot because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time, NKJV Philip Towner sees this and the next verse present \\"a carefully constructed unit of theology that emphasizes a traditional understanding of salvation.\\" Verse 10 :but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. NKJV * \\"Now been revealed (NKJV; KJV: \\"made manifest\\") through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus\\": referring to the grace through which God's elect are saved and called; although it was given in Christ to them, before the world was, but lay hidden in God's heart, in Jesus Christ and in the promises of the Old Testament, is now made manifest clearly and abundantly through the appearance of the Savior, Christ, in human nature, full of grace and truth. * \\"Who has destroyed (NKJV; KJV: \\"abolished\\") death\\": with it also the law of sin, which is the cause of death, and the devil; as he took away its sting and removed its curse, he has utterly abolished the second death, so they will never be hurt by it; all which Jesus did through dying, and rising again: triumphed over death, as having got the victory over it; now holding the keys of it in his hand. * \\"Has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel\\": Christ was the first man who rose again from the dead to an immortal life; the first to be shown the path of life. The doctrine of the resurrection of the dead was already known in the Old Testament, but not as clearly revealed as in the Gospel and so fully attested as the resurrection of Christ, as well as of many saints in the general resurrection at the last day. Moreover, the eternal life, which is a free gift from God, lay hidden in his purpose, promise, and covenant, now put into the hands of his Son Jesus Christ, and he has brought it to light in a more apparent manner than ever before, by appearing in human nature, his personal ministry, by his death and resurrection from the dead, and through the Gospel, as preached by his ministers; which gives an account and shows the way to it, pointing out and describing the persons that will enjoy it. Verse 13 :Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. NKJV *\\"Sound\\": here is in the sense of \\"healthy\\".Note [a] on 2 Timothy 1:13 in ESV ==Models of Shame and Courage (1:15‚Äì18)== Paul names Phygellus and Hermogenes who have turned away from him in Asia, in contrast to Onesiphorus, who remains faithful. The first two characters illustrate for Timothy 'the shameful way of willful dissociation' from Paul and his ministry. Verses 16‚Äì18 :The Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain; but when he arrived in Rome, he sought me out very zealously and found me. The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord in that Day‚Äîand you know very well how many ways he ministered to me at Ephesus. NKJV Paul greets \\"the household of Onesiphorus\\" (as Paul did again in 2 Timothy 4:19, without referring to the man himself) and mentions the loyal services he had done; after that Paul wishes him well (verse 18a). Roman Catholics consider these verses as an implication that Onesiphorus was already dead, as \\"the easiest and most natural hypothesis\\". ==See also== * Asia * Ephesus * Eunice * Jesus Christ * Lois * Onesiphorus * Paul of Tarsus * Phygellus * Rome * Timothy *Related Bible parts: John 14, Acts 16, 1 Timothy 1 ==ReferencesSources== * * ==External links== * King James Bible - Wikisource *English Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate *Online Bible at GospelHall.org (ESV, KJV, Darby, American Standard Version, Bible in Basic English) *Multiple bible versions at Bible Gateway (NKJV, NIV, NRSV etc.) 01 ","title":"2 Timothy 1"},{"id":"46343966","text":"Tim Smart is a British businessman and, from May to September 2016, was the Chairman of Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust.

Barnwell was replaced briefly by Craig Federhen prior to Uzi's first concert. The band released only one EP, Sleep Asylum, released by Homestead Records in 1986. The band's sound featured \\"gritty wall of sound guitars, tape loops, and heavy drumbeats, accompanied by Zedek's strong vocal presence,\\" which drew comparisons to noise rock acts such as Sonic Youth and to a lesser extent, Big Black. The EP was included at No. 5 in the annual Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics poll. Following the release of the EP, Uzi disbanded due to tensions between band members. Sleep Asylum was later reissued on compact disc in 1993 by Matador Records in the U.S. and in 1994 by Placebo in the UK ==Post-breakup and other projects== Before forming Uzi, Zedek was a member of White Women. She released one single with her second band, Dangerous Birds, \\"Alpha Romeo\\" (1982, Propeller). The single's Zedek-composed B-side, \\"Smile on Your Face\\", was later included on the influential Sub Pop compilation Sub Pop 100. After Uzi's demise, Zedek joined the New York-based no wave band Live Skull in 1987, appearing on their albums Dusted (1987) and Positraction (1989) and the Snuffer EP (1988). Live Skull split up in 1990. Zedek then moved back to Boston and formed the more blues-rock-oriented Come along with former Codeine drummer Chris Brokaw., releasing four albums before they disbanded in 2001. That same year, she issued her first solo album, Been Here and Gone, since followed by two others under her name alone (Trust Not Those in Whom Without Some Touch of Madness and Hell Is in Hello, both 2004) and two as the Thalia Zedek Band (2008's Liars and Prayers and 2013's Via). Zedek also participated in the 1998 Suffragette Sessions tour. Lee was the drummer of Boston alternative metal band El Dopa, whose sole album, United in States of Narcolepsy, was released in 1997 on Conscience Records. Lee also played drums on Marlene Tholl's 2007 album Kore, released by Small and Green Records. Following Uzi, Barnwell and Young resurfaced with A Scanner Darkly, releasing one album, This Is The Way, in 1988 on Belgian label Sub Rosa. Later in '88, Young's solo project, Emerald Vein, released a solo album, Existence, on Sub Rosa. A second Emerald Vein album, Land of the Living (with Barnwell on bass), was issued by Sub Rosa in 1991. Prior to Uzi, Milstein founded the Velvet Underground Appreciation Society in 1977 and edited the club's fanzine, What Goes On. Milstein was part of the collaborative ensemble Between Meals along with Jad Fair (Half Japanese), Moe Tucker (The Velvet Underground), Andy Paley, Erik Lindgren (Birdsongs of the Mesozoic) and David Greenberger (Duplex Planet) and performed percussion, vocals and guitar on their mini-album Oh No I Just Knocked Over a Cup of Coffee, recorded in 1980 and 1982 but released in 1984 on Iridescence Records. Milstein's first solo project, Pep Lester and His Pals, released the Jack-O-Lantern Moon EP on Iridescence in 1984, which included musical contributions from Fair, Lindgren, Greenberger, Christmas members Michael Cudahy and Liz Cox (both later of Combustible Edison), and Mission of Burma members Roger Miller and Martin Swope, and mixing on one track by Willie \\"Loco\\" Alexander. A Pep Lester double LP, The Mathematical Genius of Pep Lester, featuring over 20 guest musicians, was released by Forced Exposure in 1988. Milstein later compiled an album, Tapeworm: SFX by Phil Milstein, consisting of a montage of the tape effects he used with Uzi, released in 1990 by Penn Jillette's 50 Skidillion Watts Records. Using the name Phil X. Milstein, he also collaborated on a live album of experimental music with Sonic Youth frontman Thurston Moore, title Songs We Taught the Lord, Vol. 2. It was recorded December 4, 1996 at the Middle East club in Cambridge and released in 1997 on Hot Cars Warp Records. Milstein was also a member of 7 or 8 Worm Hearts, appearing on their 1989 self-released cassette All Writhe; guested on three tracks on Cul de Sac's debut album, Ecim, released in 1991 by Capella; and was a collaborator with Tom Ardolino on the \\"MSR Madness\\" series of song poem compilations. ==Band members== *Thalia Zedek ‚Äì vocals, guitar (1984‚Äì1987) *Danny Lee ‚Äì drums (1984‚Äì1987) *Randy Barnwell ‚Äì bass guitar (1984‚Äì1987) *Bob Young ‚Äì guitar (1984‚Äì1987) *Phil Milstein ‚Äì tape loops (1984‚Äì1987) *Craig Federhen ‚Äì bass guitar (circa 1984) ==Discography== EPs * Sleep Asylum (1986, Homestead Records) ==References * Category:Musical groups established in 1984 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1987 Category:Alternative rock groups from Massachusetts Category:Musical groups from Boston Category:American noise rock music groups Category:American post-punk music groups Category:Homestead Records artists Category:No wave groups Category:Musical quintets ","title":"Uzi (band)"},{"id":"46343985","text":"Pushpagiri may refer to: * Pushpagiri Vihara, an ancient Buddhist monastery in Odisha, India * Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary, a wildlife sanctuary in Karnataka, India ** Pushpagiri, a peak in the Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary * Pushpagiri, Andhra Pradesh, a village in India ** Pushpagiri Temple Complex, located by the village of Pushpagiri ","title":"Pushpagiri"},{"id":"46344001","text":"Christopher McCullough (born February 5, 1995) is an American professional basketball player for the Rytas Vilnius of the Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL) and Basketball Champions League. Prior to attending Syracuse University, McCullough went to Salisbury School, Brewster Academy, and IMG Academy. ==High school career== McCullough attended Salisbury School for his freshman and sophomore years. During his sophomore season, he led the Salisbury varsity basketball team to its first ever NEPSAC Class A championship. In the championship game, McCullough scored 26 points, while also adding eight rebounds and two blocked shots. At Salisbury, McCullough was coached by Jeff Ruskin. Following his sophomore year at Salisbury, McCullough transferred to Brewster Academy and then, later on, to IMG Academy. ==College career== As a freshman at Syracuse in 2014‚Äì15, McCullough started in the team's first 16 games of the season before a knee injury suffered against Florida State on January 11 required surgery and ended his campaign. In those 16 games, he averaged 9.3 points, 6.9 rebounds, 1.1 assists, 1.7 steals and 2.1 blocks in 28.1 minutes per game. ==Professional career== Brooklyn Nets (2015‚Äì2017) In April 2015, McCullough declared for the 2015 NBA draft, while still recovering from an ACL injury. Despite that, on June 25, he was selected with the 29th overall pick by the Brooklyn Nets. On July 1, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Nets. He missed the first half of the 2015‚Äì16 season with the ACL injury he sustained as a freshman at Syracuse.

The Rytas allowed McCullough to return to the team on 12 October as he deeply regretted the incident of violating the club's internal rules and conviced head coach Donaldas Kairys that he is motivated to play. He played his first game after the suspension on 17 October and scored 13 points, while the Rytas achieved a 60‚Äì98 victory versus the Nept≈´nas Klaipƒóda. ==NBA career statistics== Regular season -  left;\\"  left;\\" Brooklyn  24  4  15.1  .404  .382  .478  2.8  .4  1.2  .5  4.7 -  left;\\"  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Brooklyn  14  0  5.1  .516  .167  .667  1.2  .1  .1  .1  2.5 -  left;\\"  left;\\" Washington  2  0  4.0  .000  .000  .500  1.0  .0  .5  .0  .5 -  left;\\"  left;\\" Washington  19  0  4.7  .429  .125  .643  1.3  .2  .0  .3  2.4 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Career  59  4  9.0  .426  .306  .548  1.9  .3  .5  .3  3.3 ==International Career Statistics== As of the end of the 2019 PBA Commissioners' Cup Finals at RealGM! -  align=center  2018-19  align=left  Brujos de Guayama  BSN  8  27.1  .461  .250  .816  9.0  1.5  1.1  .8  16.3 -  align=center  2018-19  align=left  Shanxi Zhongyu  CBA  3  26.2  .472  .375  .833 8.0  2.0  .3  .3  15.7 -  align=center  2019  align=left  San Miguel Beermen  PBA  16  43.0  .466  .336  .748  15.1  3.5  1.3  2.4  32.4 - -class=sortbottom  align=\\"center\\" colspan=2  Career  All Leagues  27  36.5  .465  .327  .767  12.5  2.7  1.2  1.7  25.8 ==References *Syracuse Orange bio Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:African- American basketball players Category:American expatriate basketball people in China Category:American expatriate basketball people in Lithuania Category:American expatriate basketball people in the Philippines Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from New York (state) Category:BC Rytas players Category:Brooklyn Nets draft picks Category:Brooklyn Nets players Category:Erie BayHawks (2017‚Äì19) players Category:Long Island Nets players Category:Northern Arizona Suns players Category:Philippine Basketball Association imports Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:Rio Grande Valley Vipers players Category:San Miguel Beermen players Category:Shanxi Zhongyu players Category:Sportspeople from the Bronx Category:Syracuse Orange men's basketball players Category:Washington Wizards players Category:Wisconsin Herd players ","title":"Chris McCullough"},{"id":"46344006","text":"A light and air unit, also known as a breathing support unit, is a specialized piece of firefighting apparatus used by firefighters to provide supplemental lighting and SCBA air bottles at the scene of an emergency. During prolonged emergencies, particularly structure fires, where firefighters must remain on air (wearing their SCBAs), these air bottles will need to be replaced and refilled. The light and air unit has the ability to refill the SCBA bottles while in the field using onboard air compressors(cascade). It also carries a supply of spare air cylinders. These units are highly customizable and can vary greatly between departments. These multifunctional units are also equipped with diesel generators which supplies electricity to power portable lights and overall scene illumination. This is usually done via a roof mounted telescoping light bank. The unit also has the ability to supply electrical power in an emergency to a shelter, base camp, or medical facility.

He played four years of college basketball at Duke University. ==High school career== 2014 McDonald's All-American Game In 2014, Allen was selected as a McDonald's All-American out of Providence School in Jacksonville, Florida, where he won a state championship the previous year. He won the McDonald's All-American Slam Dunk Contest, jumping over future Duke teammate Jahlil Okafor. ==College career== Coach K embraces Allen at the end of his final home game at Duke University. During Allen's freshman season at Duke, he averaged 4.4 points per game and was named to the ACC all-academic team. Allen became a major contributor in the NCAA tournament. On April 7, 2015, he played in the championship game, scoring 16 points, including 8 straight. After the game, commentators cited Allen as one of the main reasons for Duke's win. Coach Mike Krzyzewski agreed, saying, \\"We were kind of dead in the water. We were nine points down and Grayson just put us on his back.\\" During the 2015‚Äì16 season, Allen was one of the best offensive players in the ACC, averaging 21 points per game and shooting 41% from three-point range. He played an average of 36.6 minutes per game and made 83.7% of his free throws. Entering his junior season, Allen was considered one of the top returning players in college basketball. He was named to the Associated Press preseason All-America team and was the ACC media's pick as preseason ACC Player of the Year. On November 29, 2016, Allen scored 24 points and 4 assist in a 78‚Äì69 win against Michigan State in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge.

Memphis Grizzlies (2019‚Äìpresent) On July 6, 2019, the Memphis Grizzlies announced that they had acquired Allen from the Jazz. ==Foul incidents== Allen received national attention during his sophomore season at Duke following an incident during a game against Louisville Cardinals. On February 8, 2016, Allen was assessed a flagrant-one foul after he tripped Louisville forward Ray Spalding. Commentators said the move appeared to be intentional, as Allen stuck out his leg while on the ground as Spalding was hopping over him. In the second game against Louisville that season, he exchanged elbows while scuffling for a ball on the ground and later received a technical foul and ejection for yelling at a referee following his fifth foul on a charge call. On February 25, in the closing seconds of a 15-point win against Florida State, Allen tripped opposing guard Xavier Rathan-Mayes. A day later, Allen received a reprimand from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) for his second tripping incident in less than a month. Prior to the start of the 2016‚Äì17 season, Allen stated that he was ready to put the tripping incidents behind him. However, on December 21, he tripped Elon's Steven Santa Ana and was charged with a technical foul. The next day, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski suspended Allen from the team indefinitely and subsequently stripped him of his team captaincy after Duke's game on December 31. Allen returned to play on January 4, 2017, after being suspended for one game. On March 9, 2018, Allen was assessed a flagrant-one foul in the ACC Tournament for tripping North Carolina's Garrison Brooks with what was called a \\"hip check.\\" On July 11, 2019, Allen was ejected from an NBA Summer League game between the Boston Celtics and the Memphis Grizzlies after committing back to back flagrant fouls that were called on television as \\"cheap shots\\" reacting to a \\"simple back screen\\", causing the announcers to criticize his reputation for dirty play on television and call for his removal from the game. ==Career statistics== College -  left;\\" 2014‚Äì15  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Duke  35  0  9.2  .425  .346  .849  1.0  .4  .3  .1  4.4 -  left;\\" 2015‚Äì16  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Duke  36  35  36.6  .466  .417  .837  4.6  3.5  1.3  .1  21.6 -  left;\\" 2016‚Äì17  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Duke  34  25  29.6  .395  .365  .811  3.7  3.5  .8  .1  14.5 -  left;\\" 2017‚Äì18  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Duke  37  37  35.6  .418  .370  .850  3.3  4.6  1.7  .1  15.5 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Career  142  97  27.9  .430  .380  .834  3.2  3.0  1.0  .1  14.1 NBA Regular season -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  left;\\" Utah  38  2  11.0  .376  .323  .750  .6  .7  .2  .2  5.6 -  left;\\"  left;\\" Memphis  38  0  18.9  .466  .404  .867  2.2  1.4  .3  .1  8.7 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Career  76  2  14.9  .429  .371  .800  1.4  1.0  .2  .1  7.1 Playoffs -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" 2019  left;\\" Utah  2  0  7.0  .286  .000  .714  .5  .0  .0  .0  4.5 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Career  2  0  7.0  .286  .000  .714  .5  .0  .0  .0  4.5 ==References * *Duke Blue Devils bio Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:All-American college men's basketball players Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players at the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Final Four Category:Basketball players from Florida Category:Duke Blue Devils men's basketball players Category:McDonald's High School All-Americans Category:Memphis Grizzlies players Category:Salt Lake City Stars players Category:Shooting guards Category:Sportspeople from Jacksonville, Florida Category:Utah Jazz draft picks Category:Utah Jazz players ","title":"Grayson Allen"},{"id":"46344073","text":"Cherry Hill may refer to several places in the U.S. state of Arkansas. *Cherry Hill, Perry County, Arkansas, an unincorporated community *Cherry Hill, Polk County, Arkansas, an unincorporated community ","title":"Cherry Hill, Arkansas"},{"id":"46344074","text":"Rohel Jaison Peters (born 22 November 1989) is a Montserratian cricketer who plays for the Leeward Islands in West Indian domestic cricket.

SHINE is an acronym for Subcritical Hybrid Intense Neutron Emitter. == Business model == In 2009, the supply of molybdenum-99 (Mo-99), a precursor to technetium-99m used in more than 30 medical imaging procedures, fell short of demand due to maintenance idling of a pair of research reactors, one located in the Netherlands, forcing doctors to use more dangerous isotopes. By 2016, the largest global supplier of the isotope, a Canadian research reactor, was scheduled to go idle. In 2010, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a part of the United States Department of Energy, began funding a number of method development ventures aimed at ensuring that shortages in the United States could be avoided as well as reducing the use of highly enriched uranium and with it lowering the risk of nuclear proliferation. SHINE was among a handful of early recipients of funds from the NNSA program and received through it as of 2014. SHINE has also relied on venture capital funding, having secured up to from Deerfield Management beginning in October 2014. The 2014 market for medical isotopes was estimated to be about per year. Several companies in addition to SHINE are vying for part of this market, and the need for redundancy in production will support a number suppliers beyond the minimum needed to meet current demand. The company plans to start production scale generation of isotope in 2018, having pushed the proposed start date back several times, it has secured a number of supply agreements predicated on this start date. In addition to supplying Mo-99, SHINE has secured a National Science Foundation grant to develop production methods for Iodine-131, used in the treatment of Graves' disease and certain cancers. == Facilities and technology == Original technology for production of Mo-99 was reactor-based and unavoidably produced significant nuclear waste. SHINE plans to use particle accelerator technology developed at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison by company founder Gregory Piefer. The method, referred to as \\"neutron generator technology\\", uses helium and free neutrons, produced by colliding a beam of deuterium particles with tritium gas, to bombard low-level enriched uranium targets leading to the production of \\"useful isotopes with minimal waste.\\" In addition to the diagnostically useful Mo-99, the process can also produce Iodine-131, used in medical treatments. In 2013, SHINE constructed a full-scale prototype particle accelerator at their Monona, Wisconsin facility to be used to demonstrate the technology. Eight accelerators would be used at the Janesville facility. On June 15, 2015, Argonne National Laboratory demonstrated that SHINE's production, separation and purification process could produce Mo-99 which meets purity specifications of the British Pharmacopoeia. The NRC approved SHINE's construction permit for a facility in Janesville, Wisconsin in late February 2016. If constructed, the facility would still require NRC licensing to operate. In 2014 the facility was originally slated for opening in 2016, was then delayed to 2017. As of February 2016, construction was planned for 2017 with production potentially beginning in 2019. == References  External links == * * Category:2010 establishments in Wisconsin Category:Nuclear medicine organizations Category:Dane County, Wisconsin Category:Janesville, Wisconsin Category:Health care companies based in Wisconsin ","title":"SHINE Medical Technologies"},{"id":"46344138","text":"By-elections in Hungary occur to fill vacant constituency seats in the National Assembly of Hungary.

It was released on May 29, 2015, by Beluga Heights Records and Warner Bros. Records. The lead single \\"Want to Want Me\\" which reached number one in six countries, was released on March 9, 2015. The album is a follow-up to Derulo's previous studio album, Tattoos (2013) in the international market and Talk Dirty (2014) in the United States. ==Background== The first song produced for the album was the first single, \\"Want to Want Me\\", which Derulo has decided to make single after listening it to with several friends. For the song \\"Painkiller\\", in collaboration with Meghan Trainor, the singer revealed that he decided to make this collaboration after meeting the singer backstage at a couple of shows. The collaboration with Stevie Wonder in \\"Broke\\" was born during a dinner at the White House. Derulo explained the significance of the title saying: \\"It's called Everything is 4 because it's my fourth album, but there are also other meanings. All happens for a reason, everything is for my mom, everything is for my fans. Everything is for myself to prove that I can do it. Everything is for the future. I could go on, but in the end the meaning is \\"Everything happens for a reason\\". Then there is also the meaning of the number 4: a chair has four legs, a table even. They are also 4 seasons, representing change. So 4 is a number that follows us everywhere. 4 is symmetrical. Then, Everything is 4.\\" ==Singles== \\"Want to Want Me\\" was released on March 9, 2015, as the album's lead single. Commercially, it was a success, reaching top positions in Austria and the United Kingdom. The song debuted at number 45 on the Billboard Hot 100, with 50,000 copies sold, since then it has peaked at number 5. The song's music video premiered on March 23, 2015. As of June 2015, \\"Want to Want Me\\" has sold 1.1 million digital copies in the United States. The album's second single \\"Cheyenne\\", was released on June 30. The song peaked at number 66 on the Billboard Hot 100. \\"Try Me\\" was released in October 2015 as the album's third single outside of the United States. It reached the top 5 in Norway and Poland, and was certified 2√ó Platinum in Norway. \\"Get Ugly\\" was released in December 2015 as the album's fourth and final single. It was certified Gold in the US and Silver in the UK. ==Critical reception== On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from music critics, Everything Is 4 received an average score of 67, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\", based on 9 reviews. ==Commercial performance== Everything Is 4 debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200, selling 22,000 copies in its first week.

Blanc. == Production == L√ºthi und Blanc was shot at locations in the Canton of Vaud and in Z√ºrich, and produced in Glattfelden. == Reception == As well as Fascht e Familie, L√ºthi & Blanc is still very popular in the Swiss German culture, and from time to time re-broadcast in the Swiss German television.

Smith was recognized internationally as one of the tea industry's leading entrepreneurs, and often spoke to various industry groups about branding, product development, and origin projects. He was an active investor in, and consultant to, multiple business ventures in North America and abroad. A philanthropist, Smith supported numerous community projects locally and internationally, ranging from work with Mercy Corps to local schools and arts organizations, creating special tea blends for the Oregon Ballet Theatre and the Oregon College of Art and Craft. == Beginnings == Steven Smith was born on May 29, 1949, and raised in Portland, Oregon. His first introduction to tea came at the home of his grandmother. Smith's father, Daniel Smith, imported and sold an eclectic array of used foreign cars. His mother, born Verla Slick, known as \\"Babe,\\" was a grocery cashier, bowling enthusiast and partner at Cornucopia, one of the first coffee, tea, and spice shops in Portland. After graduating in 1967 from Franklin High School, Smith attended Portland State University and served aboard the USS Hancock during the Vietnam War. He completed his military service in 1971. == Early career == As a manager of Sunshine Natural Foods, the first natural foods shop in Portland, Smith co- founded Stash Tea Company in 1972 with partners Stephen Lee and Dave Leger and investors Tom Mesher and Jay Garner. Noting the interest in their teas and herbal blends by university and college students outside of Portland, the partners started the mail order division, which was run out of Smith's barn by Smith's then-wife Teri (formerly Schwarz; now Duncan) with Leslie Lee and Colleen Leger. Stash introduced herbal and specialty black teas to retail and food service accounts throughout North America, eventually growing to become one of the largest-selling food service specialty tea brands in America. During this time, Smith also started Universal Tea Company, which traded in wild-crafted botanicals. In 1975, Smith, Lee, and Leger pioneered the market for domestic peppermint and spearmint, selling Oregon-grown mint to Lipton, Celestial Seasonings, and others. Stash Tea Company was acquired by Yamamotoyama, the oldest tea company in Japan, in 1993. == Tazo == Following the sale of Stash, Smith launched Tazo tea company in January 1994. Created in collaboration with the Sandstrom Partners design firm and writer Steve Sandoz, the Tazo brand blended the history and myth of tea cultures with a unique sense of humor. Marketed as \\"The Reincarnation of Tea,\\" Tazo found distribution in retail stores and foodservice operations throughout North America. As Tazo's \\"certified tea shaman,\\" Smith is credited with developing over 60 proprietary blends in multiple beverage formats. Smith was joined in his Tazo venture by early investors Stephen Lee and Tom Mesher. Tal Johnson, formerly of Endeavour Capital, came aboard as CEO in 1995. Shortly thereafter, in October 1996, he married Kim DeMent on the Makaibari tea estate in Darjeeling, India. The ceremony was presided over by a Hindu priest and Buddhist Rinpoche and witnessed by Smith's daughter, Carrie Smith-Prei (formerly Smith). In January 1999, simultaneous with the birth of son Jack, Tazo was acquired by Starbucks Coffee Company. Smith and his team continued to lead the company until January 2006. Smith also conceptualized and implemented the CHAI Project in 2002, a collaboration of Tazo, Starbucks, Mercy Corps, and Tazo supply chain partners to positively impact the lives of people in the tea-producing region of Darjeeling and Assam. == Steven Smith Teamaker == Retiring from Tazo in 2006, Smith moved to Avignon, France with his wife, Kim, and their young son. The family returned to Portland in 2008. Inspired by the fine chocolatiers and winemakers of Provence, Smith and his wife co-founded the Steven Smith Teamaker brand in 2009, once again working with Sandstrom Partners and other members of his former Tazo team, including Tony Tellin, who had been trained by Smith and quickly became Smith's chief taster. The company is located in a former blacksmith shop at 1626 NW Thurman Street in Portland, near the site of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition of 1905. The Smith Teamaker line includes full leaf black, green and white teas and herbal infusions packaged in individual sachets and loose form, as well as ready-to- drink tea beverages made with water that has been infused with ripe fruit though a proprietary process called \\"fruitsmithing\\". == Death and legacy == Smith died of liver cancer in Portland on March 23, 2015. In addition to the CHAI Project, Smith was an active supporter of numerous community projects and causes, the support sometimes taking the form of blends made especially for the organization. This work included the Portland International Film Festival, Oregon Ballet Theatre, Oregon College of Art and Craft, the Caldera Arts Center, and the Mercy Corps School Education Retention Project (SERP) as well as in kind donations, including to local schools, community projects, and larger foundations. Smith Teamaker is now headed by his wife Kim DeMent Smith. ==References== Category:1949 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Philanthropists from Oregon Category:Businesspeople from Portland, Oregon Category:Portland State University alumni Category:Franklin High School (Portland, Oregon) alumni Category:American naval personnel of the Vietnam War Category:United States Navy sailors ","title":"Steven Smith (teamaker)"},{"id":"46344343","text":"Pestka is a Polish-language surname.

The money is represented on a \\"Golden Wall,\\" which is divided into 10 columns that display rows of gold coins. Every column represents 10% of the total prize pot. Rounds 1‚Äì3 A different team member plays each of the first three rounds. The host gives 10 keywords, corresponding to the 10 questions that will be asked, and the team decides who will answer the questions. The other two members have 20 seconds to give them as much information on those words as possible. The questions are multiple- choice, each with three answer options. A correct answer lights up one column in bright gold and protects the money corresponding to it, while a miss \\"decimates\\" the prize pot, reducing it by 10% and draining all the coins out of one column. The team is given five \\"pass-backs\\" and five \\"overrules\\" to use throughout these three rounds. If the playing member is unsure of the answer, they may use a pass-back to get advice from their teammates. Conversely, if these two believe that a given answer is incorrect, they may use an overrule to change it. The pot begins at ¬£20,000 in the first round, setting the value of each column at ¬£2,000. After each round, the Golden Wall is reset and the remaining money is evenly divided among all 10 columns. (E.g. if a team misses two questions in Round 1, ¬£16,000 is left in the pot and each column in Round 2 is worth ¬£1,600.) Final round One last set of 10 keywords is presented, and the team decides who will play first on their behalf. The host begins to read open-ended questions on the first keyword, with no 20-second briefing from the teammates, and a clock begins to count down from two minutes once he finishes reading the first question. A correct answer advances to the next keyword, while a miss leads to a new question on the same one. If the contestant misses three questions in a row, the clock is stopped, the prize pot is decimated, and the remaining money is re-distributed among all 10 columns. That contestant must sit out for the rest of the round, and their place is taken by one of the other two, who begins on a replacement keyword for the one that was missed. Pass-backs and overrules may not be used in this round. If time runs out or if all three members fail, the team leaves with nothing. If they complete all 10 columns, each member wins an equal share of the remaining money. ==Critical reception== Steve Finan of Sunday Post praised the show for upholding the true meaning of the word 'decimate', which is to reduce by one tenth and is of Latin origin; in Roman times a 'decimatio' was a punishment. Finan wrote that the word had \\"been suffering a lingering death\\" as a synonym for \\"damage, devastate, or ... destroy\\", leaving a \\"poorer\\" vocabulary with no word to \\"express a reduction of one in ten\\". Finan stated that he was \\"indebted\\" to the show's host for restoring the word's Roman use and called him a \\"swashbuckling warrior on the side of the grammatical good guys\\". Ian K of the Carrick Gazette said that the show \\"was pleasant enough viewing, but it seemed to me to be one which lacked that 'something special' that really successful quiz shows have\\". In addition, Hayden Woolley gave the show a mixed review; while he commended the choice of host, he criticized the complexity and slow pace of the game, facetiously noting how overpowering the wall was and giving an overall review of 3/5. ==Transmissions== {  center;\\" - !

He started two publicly traded semiconductor companies, Novellus Systems and Mattson Technology, and has also worked in the solar power industry. He currently serves as Chairman of Husk Power and is a board director at Siva Power, a thin film solar cell company based in Silicon Valley, and is involved with several other private companies and non-profits. Mattson holds 12 patents. ==Early life and education== Mattson was born in Norwood, Massachusetts on October 29, 1954, and grew up in California. He graduated from San Jose State University with a BSc in aeronautical engineering. Mattson also holds an MBA in Finance from Santa Clara University.Executive Profile: Brad S. Mattson, Bloomberg, accessed April 7, 2015 ==Semiconductor career== Applied Materials After graduating San Jose State University, Mattson took a job with Applied Materials as a field service engineer.SEMI Oral History Interview - Brad Mattson, SEMI, February 4, 2004, accessed April 7, 2015 Mattson repositioned his career into product management and marketing, eventually becoming a product manager and then director of marketing for Applied Materials' etch division. In the late 1970s there was no commonly accepted method that would forecast the total cost of ownership that spanned the equipment's lifetime once all costs were considered. To help solve this problem Mattson developed a cost of ownership (COO) model for Applied.Mattson, Brad. The Solar Phoenix: How America Can Rise from the Ashes of Solyndra to World Leadership in Solar 2.0. Robertson Publishing. 2014. pp. 117 Mattson left Applied after about five years to become VP for the plasma systems group of Laboratory for Electronics (LFE) in Massachusetts. Novellus Systems Mattson resigned his position at LFE in the early 1980s and started his own company, Novellus Systems to make chemical vapor deposition (CVD) systems. Novellus would eventually achieve a market capitalization over $3B, becoming one of the largest semiconductor equipment companies in the world.Pederson, Jay P. International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 18. Detroit: St. James Press, 1997. Funding Universe. Web. April 8, 2015. http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/novellus-systems-inc-history/ Mattson incorporated Novellus in 1984. In the early 1980s the semiconductor industry was in a downturn and there were many layoffs, so Mattson had difficulty raising outside funding, instead funding it with his own money. At Novellus, Mattson designed and built the company's first two prototype CVD systems. At the time, CVD equipment was achieving about ¬±5 percent uniformity on 6-inch wafers, but Novellus prototypes were achieving one percent uniformity on 8-inch wafers that were processed ten-times faster. Eventually Mattson secured an investment from Monsanto, who sold wafers to the semiconductor industry. With new financing to expand operations, Mattson grew Novellus into one of the top three CVD equipment companies in the late 1980s. Novellus supplied CVD systems to semiconductor producers like Motorola, Advanced Micro Devices, NEC, and LSI Logic. Four years after its founding, Novellus had its IPO on NASDAQ in August 1988. Novellus Systems was acquired by Lam Research in 2011 for $3.3 billion Mattson Technology While taking a break from work in the late 1980s, Mattson began investing in companies on the side. Mattson was working with one company to develop stripping hardware designs for wafers. Mattson become more directly involved with the company, and the firm was incorporated as Mattson Technology with Mattson as CEO in 1988. Mattson Technology became a publicly traded company in 1994. In 2001, Mattson stepped aside as CEO of Mattson Technology but remained as Vice Chairman until 2002. While at the company, Mattson was a finalist for the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award of Northern California in the \\"High Technology-Electronics\\" category. ==Renewable energy career== Mattson working with Husk Power Systems installing solar panels in off-grid locations in India. According to Mattson, the September 11 attacks strongly influenced his thinking about whether or not his work was actually helping people and making the world a better place,Mattson, Brad.

Robertson Publishing. 2014. pp. iv or if he was only working with already \\"really successful countries and successful companies\\" despite his wanting \\"to see technology benefit humanity in a more direct way.\\" That same year, Mattson served as a judge for The Tech Awards's Environment category and the theme of \\"technology benefiting humanity\\". In 2009 Mattson became a partner at VantagePoint Capital Partners, a venture capital firm that focuses on renewable energy and cleantech. In 2011 Mattson became CEO of Siva Power, but what was then Solexant, a solar startup developing cadmium telluride solar panels. Mattson halted the company's plans to build a factory in Oregon, and instead ramped-up R&D; to develop copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) solar technology. After two years Mattson unveiled the new company as Siva Power in 2013. In 2017, Bruce Sohn, the former President of First Solar became CEO of Siva Power, with Mattson serving as Executive Chairman of the Board. In 2014, Mattson self published a book, The Solar Phoenix: How America Can Rise from the Ashes of Solyndra to World Leadership in Solar 2.0, in which he explains why he believes solar is fundamental to the world's energy future and the industry's place in the United States. ==Public speaking and mentoring== Mattson speaks and presents at organizations devoted to energy and humanitarianism, such as Intersolar, Greentech Media Solar Summits, the Rotary Club,The Solar Phoenix - How America can Rise from the Ashes of Solyndra to World Leadership in Solar 2.0, The Rotary Club of Santa Clara, accessed April 7, 2015 IEEE, U.

Both types of pads in insects make use of liquid secretions and are considered 'wet'. Dry adhesive mechanisms primarily rely on van der Waals‚Äô forces and are also used by organisms other than insects. The fluid provides capillary and viscous adhesion and appears to be present in all insect adhesive pads. Little is known about the chemical properties of the adhesive fluids and the ultrastructure of the fluid producing cells is currently not extensively studied. Additionally, both hairy and smooth types of adhesion have evolved separately numerous times in insects. Few comparative studies between the two types of adhesion mechanisms have been done and there is a lack of information regarding the forces that can be supported by these systems in insects. Additionally, tree frogs and some mammals such as the arboreal possum and bats also make use of smooth adhesive pads. The use of adhesive pads for locomotion across non-horizontal surfaces is a trait that evolved separately in different species, making it an example of convergent evolution. The power of adhesion allows these organisms to be able to climb on almost any substance. The exact mechanisms of arthropod adhesion are still unknown for some species but this topic is of great importance to biologists, physicists and engineers. These highly specialized structures are not restricted to one particular area of the leg. They may be located on different parts, such as claws, derivatives of the pretarsus, tarsal apex, tarsomeres or tibia. From the scaling analysis, it has been suggested that animal lineages relying on the dry adhesion, such as lizards and spiders have a higher density of terminal contact elements compared to systems that use wet adhesive mechanisms such as insects. Since these effects are based on fundamental physical principles and highly related to the shape of the structure, they are also the same for artificial surfaces with similar geometry. Adhesion and friction forces per-unit-pad area were very similar in smooth and hairy systems when tested. Strong adhesion may be beneficial in many situations but it also can create difficulties in locomotion. Direction-dependence is an important and fundamental property of adhesive structures that are able to rapidly and controllably adhere during locomotion. Researchers are unsure whether direction-dependence is achieved through changes in contact area or through a change in shear stress. Friction and adhesion forces in most animal attachment organs are higher when they are pulled towards the body than when they push away from it. This has been observed in geckos and spiders but also in the smooth adhesive pads of ants, bush-crickets and cockroaches. Adhesive hairs of geckos are non-symmetrical and feature distally pointing setae and spatulae that are able to generate increased friction and adhesion when aligned with a proximal pull. The adhesive hairs of some beetles behave similarly to those of geckos. While directional-dependence is present in other animals, it has yet to be confirmed in insects with hairy adhesive pads. It has been observed that a surface micro-roughness asperity size of less than five micrometres can strongly reduce insect attachment and climbing ability and this adhesion reducing effect has been put to use in a variety of plant species that create wax crystals. Adhesive chemical secretions are also used for predation defence, mating, holding substrates, anchor eggs, building retreats, prey capture and self-grooming. ==Smooth adhesive pads for locomotion== Smooth adhesion has evolved in many families of organisms independently, which creates structures that appear unrelated to each other but generate the same function. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that adhesive structures of arthropods evolved several times. Organisms such as ants, bees, cockroaches and grasshoppers use smooth adhesive pads. There are different types of smooth adhesive pads in these organisms such as the arolia, pulvilli, and euplantulae, all of which have a cuticle that is extremely soft and deformable. The arolia of some ant species has been observed to be fluid-filled and is extended and contracted to provide adhesive force. The euplantulae in crickets have a hexagonal microstructure which is similar to toe pads in tree frogs. Generally, insects are able to adhere to surfaces through the contact between the insect adhesive organs and substrates that are mediated by nanometre-thin films of adhesive fluid. Some functional principles of smooth pads (adaptability, viscoelasticity, pressure sensitivity) are similar to those known from industrial pressure-sensitive adhesion. Smooth adhesive organs are ‚Äò‚Äòpillowlike,‚Äô‚Äô which refers to the soft and fluid-filled, cuticular sac, that moulds to the surface increasing the contact area on rough surfaces. It appears that the fluid in smooth adhesive systems mainly serves to maximize contact on rough substrates. The internal fibrous structure of smooth pads might be vital to their ability to deform or for shear-induced lateral increase in contact area or for efficient transfer of tensile forces, yet at this point its specific function is unknown. ==Hairy adhesive pads for locomotion== Both hairy and smooth pads in arthropods act to maximize the amount of contact with a surface. The foot pads of flies are densely covered with flexible hair-like structures called setae, and some lizards and spiders use similar hairy pads to create adhesive effects. This indicates a favourable design for hairy pad adhesion. Hairy pads can be classified as pulvillus, fossula spongiosa, and tenent hairs. Hairy attachment pads employed few other features, such as flaw tolerance, lower sensitivity to contamination and roughness. Hairy attachment systems are typical for evolutionary younger and successful insect groups, such as Coleoptera and Diptera. The density of hairs increases with increasing body weight. An increase of the attachment strength in hairy systems is realized by increasing the number of single contact points. Protuberances on the hairy pads of Coleoptera, Dermaptera and Diptera belong to different types. Representatives of the first two lineages have socketed setae on their pads. Setae can range in length from a few micrometers to several millimeters. Dipteran outgrowths are acanthae which are single sclerotized protuberances originating from a single cell. The acanthae are hollow inside and some have pores under the terminal plate, which presumably deliver an adhesive secretion directly to the contact area. Hairy attachment pads of reduviid bugs, flies and beetles secrete fluid into the contact area. The secretion contains non-volatile, lipid-like substances, but in some species it is two-phasic emulsion presumably containing water-soluble and lipid-soluble fractions. Adhesion strongly decreases as the volume of the secretion decreases, which indicates that a layer of pad secretion that covers the terminal plates is crucial for generating a strong attractive force. Data suggests that besides van der Waals and Coulomb forces flies rely on attractive capillary forces mediated by the pad secretion. At low humidity, adhesion strongly depends on the amount of liquid deposited on the surface, and therefore contact duration. The hairy pad design has been argued to have a number of advantages over the smooth design, such as superior performance on rough substrates, effortless detachment, self-cleaning properties and increased adhesion due to contact splitting. Unlike frog and lizard adhesive pads which are often dry, insects tend to have an associated fluid for adhesion. The fluid that is secreted has a special property of being composed of an immiscible mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic material. Adhesive foot pads only stick when pulled toward the body, but unstick when moved away from it, which allows for effortless and rapid detachment. Insects can do this actively through their claw flexor muscle, but in most cases, the foot is able to attach and detach passively, without the help of any nerves and muscles. (Bullock, Drechsler, & Federle, 2008) ==Other uses for adhesives in insects== Adhesive chemical secretions are also used for predation defence, mating, holding substrates, anchor eggs, build retreats, prey capture and self grooming. Structures for use in repelling attackers or temporarily or permanently adhering to a substratum or a mating partner have been found in the developmental stages of the egg, larvae, pupae, and adult. Some species have developed adhesives for prey capture and some use adhesive glue for cocoon building. Adhesive glands of the head can involve mouthparts, antennae, the labial salivary glands, or species specific glands. A variety of glands, often located in the abdomen, can be used for defensive adhesion mechanisms. ==Insect adhesive glands== Epidermal glands and their secretions are highly diverse and vary in their function for: protection from adverse environmental conditions and microbial contamination, regulation of water balance, communication with pheromones and alelochemicals, defense from predators and parasites, construction and making food accessible. Class 1 epidermal cells are the predominant glandular cell type for adhesive gland systems in insects with features that indicate either lipid or protein secretion. In class 1 cells for locomotion lipoidal secretion is most common, although the secretions are often mixtures of lipids with proteins and carbohydrates. Class 1 cells that are used for more permanent body or egg anchorage and of retreat building make use of protein-based secretions. Class 2 epidermal adhesive gland cells have only been found in the defence systems of Aphidoidea and Tingidae. Defensive adhesive secretions function mechanically and also develop a chemical irritant function caused by reactive substances of low molecular weight which combines within the sticky secretion to produce toxic glue. Class 3 epidermal adhesive glands are usually bicellular and consist of a terminal secretarily active cell and an adjacent canal cell that surrounds the cuticular conducting duct. Hundreds of gland cells and glandular units are contained in class 1 or 3 and might aggregated to form whole gland organs so as to discharge large amounts of a secretion. Adhesive cells used for locomotion are all class 1 epidermal adhesive cells. Class 3 epidermal adhesive cells may play a role in some hairy adhesive pads, but this has not yet been confirmed. Some adhesive glands that are used for locomotion are also used for capturing or holding on to prey (Fac, 2010). The secretion of some class 1 cells and class 3 cells are mixed in the subcuticular or intracuticular spaces. They may also be mixed in the larger glandular reservoirs before being discharged which allows the formation of complex structural mixtures as well as chemical reactions between the components of the mixture. Gland cells used by female insects for gluing eggs to a substratum during oviposition have not been well studied. Glands used for sticking eggs to surfaces have been observed to be of the class 1 type. Adhesive glands are involved in the production of silks, which are produced by a variety of dermal glands for building shelters, cocoons, and supporting sperm. Class 1 cells are often applied for this purpose. ==Adhesive secretions== Most bioadhesives use polymers, (carbohydrates and proteins) to create the adhesive and cohesive strength. Natural adhesives used by both plants and animals are composed of only a few basic components, such as proteins, polysaccharides, polyphenols, and lipids that are mixed in various combinations. Natural adhesive chemical and micromechanical functions are often not well understood. Adhesives that are for mechanical work are often composed of high-molecular compounds containing proteins, resins, mixtures of long-chain hydrocarbons and mucopolysaccharides, or waxes. Defensive adhesive secretions often combine their mechanical effect with a low molecular weight chemical irritant to deter predators. There is a great diversity of aliphatic compounds in insect adhesive secretions. Aliphatic compounds are a major constituent secretions for some locomotion organs in insects and they are also involved in the formation of defence secretions. Adhesives of this type contain only limited amounts or no polar components such as fatty acids, esters, alcohols. Often these compounds are temperature sensitive. Very little research has been done on classifying and identifying carbohydrates within insect adhesive secretions. So far, glucose, trehalose and mucopolysaccharides that contain glucose, galactose, mannose, beta-glucopyranose, and/or (N-acetyl-beta-) glucosamine have been identified as components of insect adhesives. Carbohydrates have been found in defense secretions as well as for sticking eggs together. Aromatic compounds have been identified in the adhesive defence secretion of termites and ants. It is also thought to be used by butterflies to secure eggs. Insect adhesives contain a broad spectrum of isoprenoids. These compounds have been found in defense mechanisms in some species such as termites. Amino acids, peptides, and proteins are nearly always found in insects' adhesive secretions. They are employed for adhesion across many functions such as defense, locomotion and cocoon building. ==Arachnid adhesion== Spiders have independently evolved hairy adhesive pads. Their pads do not use an associated fluid and are much similar to many lizards and are not like the hairy pads that are used by insects. ==Convergence with mammals== Smooth adhesive pads are an example of convergent evolution between amphibians (geckos and frogs), arthropods and mammals (possum). The mechanisms involved even appear to be similar. This could indicate that this method of locomotion has found its optimal form in many species of animals. Hairy attachment systems of the gekkonid lizards and spiders do not produce fluids, these organisms rely on van der Waals interactions for the generation of strong attractive forces. Tree frog toe-pads are made of columnar epithelial cells that are separated from each other at the apices. Pores for mucous glands open into the channels that are between the cells which create a toe pad epithelium that has an array of flat topped cells with mucous filled grooves between them. The purpose of having cells separated at the tip is to allow the toe to conform to the structure it will adhere to. The hexagonal design around the outside of the cells (similar to the crickets) is likely to allow for the mucous to spread evenly over the cell. Smooth adhesive pads are found in arboreal possums, which are marsupials that glide between trees. The possum is also capable of using smooth adhesive pads to climb vertically, making use of large toe pads. The pads consist of an epidermal layer of stratified squamous epithelium with the outer most layer's cells being flattened. The pad has alternating ridges and grooves with sweat glands emptying into the grooves providing fluid for wet adhesion. Bats have also evolved adhesive pads separately. Some bats make use of an adhesive appendage, while others have suctioning adhesive organs. ==Importance to humans== Some researchers propose using the advanced locomotive mechanisms seen in arthropods for modelling robotic movement to create maximally efficient movement. Currently insect adhesive pads still outperform most artificial adhesives with respect to rapid controllability. Some researchers also suggest using arthropod-based adhesive mechanisms for more effective tape and binding tools. Additionally, some research indicates that the wrinkling effect that occurs in human fingers when submerged in water acts to increase grip on wet objects. The mechanism is unknown but it may be due to changes in adhesion properties of the finger pads. By examining the properties of bioadhesion, finger pad adhesion can be better understood. However, this study on increased finger pad dexterity from wrinkling has been heavily disputed. Despite this, it can be argued that a better understanding of insect adhesion mechanisms can help guide the development of better adhesives for human mobility and technology, as well as inform a better understanding of human finger function. ==See also== *Gecko feet *Synthetic setae ==References== Category:Arthropod anatomy Category:Adhesives ","title":"Arthropod adhesion"},{"id":"46344442","text":"The following Confederate Army units and commanders fought in the Battle of Five Forks of the American Civil War.

She currently resides in Athens, OH where she is an Assistant Professor of English at Ohio University. An Affrilachian Poet, she is the author of Kaffir Lily (Wind Publications, 2010), How Swallowtails Become Dragons (Accents Publishing, 2011), The Galaxy is a Dance Floor (Argos Books, 2016), and Call Her By Her Name (Northwestern University Press, 2016). She is the editor of The Swallowtale Project: Creative Writing for Incarcerated Women (2012), and co-editor of the anthologies, Circe's Lament: An Anthology of Wild Women (Accent's Publishing, 2015), Undead: A Poetry Anthology of Ghouls, Ghosts, and More (Apex Publications, 2017), and Black Bone: 25 Years of the Affrilachian Poets(University of Kentucky Press, 2018). Spriggs's work is considered primarily speculative in nature drawing upon mythology, folklore, surrealism, and science fiction for inspiration. She often focuses on the connections between art and community and the identity of Black women in the American South. From 2006 to 2012, she was the creator and artistic director of the annual Wild Women of Poetry Slam at the Kentucky Women Writers Conference. In 2013, her poem \\"The ________ of the Universe: A Love Story\\" was tattooed onto 248 residents of Lexington as part of the Lexington Tattoo Project. Also in 2013, at Transylvania University's Morlan Gallery, she collaborated with videographer Angel Clark to curate the multimedia exhibit \\"The Thirteen,\\" which memorialized 13 black women who were lynched or killed in Kentucky. She was featured on the track \\"Hypnopomp (Epilogue)\\" in CunninLynguists' 2011 album Oneirology. Her passion for poetry sprouted from the visual arts, once she found solace in writing poems and stories. Her writing evolved into a career once she applied to be a writer for the Kentucky Foundation for Women and decided to pursue this practice as a full-time job. Her inspiration comes from her love for storytelling: \\"Sometimes writing is telling my own story through (other people), and sometimes, it‚Äôs telling their stories through my own.\\" ==Education== Spriggs is now a doctoral candidate at the University of Kentucky. Spriggs graduated from Transylvania University in 2003 with a degree in history and a minor in studio art.

For his career, he had a MVFC record 221 receptions for 2,601 yards and 25 touchdowns. ==Professional career== Prior to the draft, Bleacher Report's Matt Miller listed Pruitt as the seventh-best tight end prospect in his final 2015 rankings. Dane Brugler of CBSSports.com placed him at No. 4, while NFL.com's Lance Zierlein slotted him in at No. 10. He was considered to be a late-Day 2 or Day 3 pick. Pruitt impressed at the 2015 NFL Combine; weighing in at 252 pounds, Pruitt ran the 40-yard dash in 4.58 seconds, which was by far the best time among tight ends. He also posted the top vertical jump at the position with a leap of 38'0\\", and his 9'10\\" broad jump finished as fourth-best. In the shuttles, he had the third-best time in both the 20-yard (4.37 seconds) and 60-yard (11.85) workouts. Minnesota Vikings Pruitt with the Vikings in 2015 Pruitt was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in the fifth round (143th overall pick) of the 2015 NFL Draft. The pick was part of a trade where the Vikings and Detroit Lions swapped third round picks, and the Lions' sent their fifth-rounder to Minnesota. Pruitt signed a four-year, $2,510,588 deal with the Vikings with a $230,588 signing bonus that's all guaranteed. During the first two weeks of the 2015 season, Pruitt recorded just four snaps in each game. Against the Detroit Loions in Week 7, Pruitt recorded his first NFL catch, a 13-yard gain to convert on third-and-12; needing to get past the 28, Pruitt caught the ball at the Detroit 35, broke two tackles, spun and was hit twice more at the 29‚Äì30 but surged forward. He also showed his versatility by delivering a key block that helped running back Adrian Peterson break free for a 75-yard gain. With Rhett Ellison out with a concussion against the Chicago Bears in Week 8, Pruitt saw a season-high 28 snaps out of the 58 offensive plays the Vikings ran in their 23‚Äì20 win. He finished the game with two catches for 15 yards. Pruitt had two receptions for a season-high 36 yards in the Vikings' loss to the Arizona Cardinals in Week 14. Pruitt was released by the Vikings on November 8, 2016 and was later signed to the practice squad. Chicago Bears On December 13, 2016, Pruitt was signed by the Chicago Bears off the Vikings' practice squad. He was released by the Bears on September 2, 2017. Buffalo Bills On September 4, 2017, Pruitt was signed to the Buffalo Bills' practice squad. He was released on September 14, 2017. Houston Texans On September 18, 2017, Pruitt was signed to the Houston Texans' practice squad. He was promoted to the active roster on December 5, 2017. He was placed on injured reserve on December 19, 2017. On September 2, 2018, Pruitt was waived by the Texans and was re-signed to the practice squad. Tennessee Titans On September 10, 2018, Pruitt was signed by the Tennessee Titans off the Texans practice squad after Delanie Walker suffered a season-ending ankle injury. On November 18, 2018, in a 38-10 Week 11 loss to the Indianapolis Colts, Pruitt caught his first reception of the season for 19 yards. On December 22, 2018, Pruitt caught his first NFL touchdown from Blaine Gabbert in the Titans' 25-16 Week 16 win against the Washington Redskins. On March 24, 2020, Pruitt was re-signed by the Titans. ==References *Southern Illinois Salukis bio Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from South Bend, Indiana Category:Players of American football from Indiana Category:Players of American football from Missouri Category:American football tight ends Category:Southern Illinois Salukis football players Category:Minnesota Vikings players Category:Buffalo Bills players Category:Houston Texans players Category:Tennessee Titans players ","title":"MyCole Pruitt"},{"id":"46344570","text":"ƒ∞≈üte Benim Stilim (previously aired as Bu Tarz Benim) is a reality competition show in Turkey. The show is hosted by √ñyk√º Serter. The jury members on this show are Nur Yerlita≈ü, Ivana Sert, Kemal Doƒüulu, Uƒüurkan Erez, and Kerimcan Durmaz. The influential fashion designer Nur Yerlita≈ü later decided to withdraw from the seventh season of the show due to her illness. == Show format == Female contestants, compete each week in front of a judge to get points on their style. The contestants have to come up with a different outfit, each day from Monday to Friday to get the fashion star. On the final day of the week, called \\"Gala Gecesi\\", they have to dress, according to a fixed theme to win a prize and style points. By the end of the day, a total of points is presented, and the contestant with the lowest score gets eliminated. Another same version of the show format are produced in other countries as well, such as the show My Style Rocks in Greece on Œ£ŒöŒëŒ™ and \\"Bravo, ai Stil!\\" (Romanian: Great, you've got the style!) through the TV formats Turkish production company Global Agency, on the Turkish-owned Television channel Kanal D Romania, where the prizes for the \\"Final Gala\\" are among 100,000 lei (equivalent of ‚Ç¨22,000) and an television career for the 1st-place winner, and a brand new car for the second-place winner. In this show also every weekly eliminatory galas, each contestant which rank low among the juries and or being nominated by their rival contestants to elimination, one of the two contestant who rank the lowest among public votes will have to exit the contest. This version of the show, includes Televoting (around ‚Ç¨1.25 SMS VAT tax included) to vote their favourite, another jury who can choose to give or to take one's contestant achieved star at the end of the show during Monday through Friday, and at the eliminatory or non-eliminatory galas every Saturday, a group of three well-known male celebrities will appreciate with a \\"like\\" or \\"dislike\\" their apparence on the stage and also give an bonus of three points for their decided favourite apparence.

He attended Vanderbilt University, where he received a degree in physics. He later attended University of Texas at Austin, where he received his Ph.D in zoology in 1969. He is recognized in the term Eskinogram, and has been a leader in the discovery of mechanisms underlying entrainment of circadian clocks. ==Research== Aplysia californica Menaker lab In his early scientific career, Eskin studied circadian rhythms in the house sparrow, while working in chronobiologist Michael Menaker's lab at the University of Texas at Austin. Eskin's most cited paper while in Menaker's lab concerns his research of non-ocular entraining cues in house sparrows. In it, Eskin and Menaker showed the scientific community the ability of house sparrows to entrain to auditory cues as opposed to previously shown light cues.  Ongoing research  Eskin's current research focuses on long-term memory formation. His lab focuses on the role of the circadian clock and the regulation of glutamate uptake in synaptic plasticity, using aplysia and rats as model organisms primarily. Role of glutamate transporters in memory formation Eskin's lab has extensively studied the role of glutamate transporters in synaptic plasticity in aplysia. Specifically, his group has shown that glutamate uptake increases during long-term sensitization in Aplysia, long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus of rats, and morphine addiction and withdrawal in rats. Deficiencies in glutamate uptake during changes in synaptic efficacy have also been linked to diseases such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, and Epilepsy. Blockage of NMDA receptors prevents glutamate from binding, which prevents the formation of long-term memory. Eskin's group believes that the mechanism for glutamate uptake is phylogenetically conserved for multiple types of synaptic plasticity. They currently study the mechanism by which this process takes place. Role of circadian clocks in memory formation Eskin has also researched the role of the circadian clock in glutaminergic synaptic plasticity. Although it was known that the brain's circadian clock could influence physiological outputs such as sleep and wakefulness, metabolic rate, and body temperature, Eskin suggested that the circadian clock may play another role as a regulator for memory formation. He and his lab have shown that an aplysia's ability to form long-term memory is dependent on the time of day, namely that aplysia are able to form long-term memories during the day, but are unable to at night. This was done via regulation of several factors, including neurotransmitter release, MAPK signaling, and immediate early gene expression. Short-term memory, however, has not been shown to vary based on time of day. The mechanism by which this occurs is not currently understood, but Eskin and his lab have continued to study the circadian characteristics of glutamate uptake in synaptic plasticity in order to learn more about the mechanism by which memory formation is controlled by a circadian clock. Furthermore, such information will be useful for chronobiology as a whole in helping explain how a biological clock regulates its outputs to produce rhythm. ==Eskinogram== The three components of an Eskinogram: Input, Oscillator, and Output. Eskin developed the Eskinogram as a heuristic that provides a mechanism for understanding circadian clock pathways. It presents a clock pathway as having three components: input, oscillator, and output. Further modifications to this core model can be made for more complex systems. For example, one oscillator may be able to control multiple outputs. Model use The Eskinogram has notably been used to model how the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) acts as a master oscillator for the human biological clock. A group of photoreceptors called the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) act as the input for the clock mechanism. These cells then use a pathway dependent on melanopsin to signal to the SCN. The SCN then uses a transcription-translation feedback loop, consisting of a set of clock genes that regulate their own expression, to act as a complete oscillator and signal locomotor outputs accordingly. Impact The Eskinogram is regarded as a central dogma for circadian researchers. This has led to Eskin's work being influential to later researchers in chronobiology. For example, Eskin worked closely with Dr. Samer Hattar on his thesis on circadian rhythms.\\"Why Many of Us Suffer Seasonal Affective Disorder\\" Brain Science Institute .

Its members believed that Africa's independent states should co-operate and exist in harmony, but without political federation and deep integration as supported by its main rival, the so-called Casablanca Group.Pierre Englebert & Kevin C. Dunn (2013), Inside African Politics, London: Lynne Rienner, pp. 320‚Äì321. In 1963, the two groups united to establish a formal, continent-wide organisation, the Organisation for African Unity. The alliance first met on 8‚Äì12 May 1961 in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, one of its leading countries. Other members included Nigeria and most of Francophone Africa, including Senegal and Cameroon. Their approach was more moderate and less radical than that of the Casablanca Group. Its leaders stressed the importance of Africa's newly independent states retaining their autonomy and strengthening their own bureaucracies, militaries and economies. They promoted nationalism, the creed that each nation of Africa should be self-governing, over Pan-Africanism, the belief that the whole continent should seek ever closer union and integration of their politics, society, economy and so on. The Monrovia Group's ideas ultimately prevailed. In 1963, states from both groups joined to create the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). Its Charter places the principles of independent statehood, non- interference and national sovereignty at its heart. The OAU's pursuit of integration was minimal and its opposition to continental federation unequivocal. The OAU, like its successor the African Union (AU), is a reflection of the more nationalist values of the Monrovia Group and a repudiation of the more supra-national ideas of the Casablanca Group. == See also == * African Union * Casablanca Group ==References== Category:Pan-African organizations Category:1960s in Africa Category:Monrovia Category:Organizations established in 1961 Category:Organizations disestablished in 1963 Category:1961 establishments in Liberia Category:1963 disestablishments in Africa ","title":"Monrovia Group"},{"id":"46344668","text":"The Button was an online meta-game and social experiment that featured an online button and 60 second countdown timer that would reset each time the button was pressed. The experiment was hosted on the social networking website Reddit beginning on 1 April 2015 (April Fools' Day) and was active until 5 June 2015. The game was started by a Reddit administrator. The Button garnered enthusiasm from Reddit users worldwide, attracting clicks from over one million unique user accounts. Various websites, browser extensions, and mobile applications were created for tracking the live statistics of the Button and enabling users to visit the Button when the timer dropped below a certain threshold. The Button's countdown timer reached zero several times due to technical issues, but was reset since button press attempts were still being made. On 5 June 2015, the countdown timer reached zero with no button press attempts, ending the experiment. == Overview == The specific Reddit community (subreddit) for the Button had the standard Reddit appearance but with a molly-guarded button next to a 60-second countdown timer at the top of the page. When the button was clicked, the countdown would reset. The button could only be pressed once by each unique Reddit account created before the event started on 1 April. There was also a cumulative count of all unique users who had clicked the button since its launch. The Button was a light blue color. All users received a small dot called a \\"flair\\" next to their username. Users who had not pressed the button had a grey dot, and users who had pressed it had a dot colored based on the state of the timer when the button was pressed. When hovering the cursor over this colored dot, the time in seconds on the counter when the user clicked the button would be displayed. On the subreddit, users' times and the subsequent flair colors became status symbols. {  + Flair colors - ! Time clicked !! Color -  60s‚Äì52s  style=\\"background: #820080; color: white\\"  Purple -  51s‚Äì42s  style=\\"background: #0083C7; color: white\\"  Blue -  41s‚Äì32s  style=\\"background: #02be01; color: white\\"  Green -  31s‚Äì22s  style=\\"background: #E5D900\\"  Yellow -  21s‚Äì12s  style=\\"background: #e59500\\"  Orange -  11s‚Äì0s  style=\\"background: #e50000; color: white\\"  Red -  Did not click  style=\\"background: #888; color: white\\"  Grey -  Not able to click style=\\"background: #e4e4e4\\"  White } ==History== The button was introduced on 1 April 2015 in a post to the official Reddit blog. On 5 June 2015, at 21:49:53 UTC, a person with Reddit username \\"BigGoron\\" became the last user to press the button (dubbed \\"The Pressiah\\" by the community). Sixty seconds later, the countdown timer reached zero and ended 2 months and 4 days after it had begun. The button was deactivated, and overlaid with the text \\"the experiment is over\\". Six minutes later, Reddit administrator and creator of the button \\"powerlanguage\\" announced the forum would be archived within ten minutes. The experiment ended with 1,008,316 logged button clicks. ==Technical issues== The Button experienced technical issues which caused it to reach zero despite users pressing it in time. This occurred multiple times and was attributed to database errors by reddit's administrators. The outages caused community discontentment and some speculation that the subreddit was being gamed by the administrators. Although The Button was revived within a day of the outages, the administrators of Reddit considered closing The Button experiment early. == Community interaction == The inherent segregation on this specific Reddit community (subreddit) led to the development of cult-like groups surrounding specific flairs or beliefs towards the button itself. Each individual cult could be easily identified by the color of its flair, represented by the short time frame in which any user pressed the button. Of the cults, the most basic was the division between those that would press the button, \\"the pressers\\", and those that would abstain, \\"the non-pressers\\". More so, a unique cult formed over each of the six other colored flairs. The separate cults all held their own beliefs surrounding what might happen when the clock reached zero. A public image surrounding each cult eventually developed. Some, such as the \\"grey\\" flair given to those who would not press the button, or the \\"red\\" flair given to those that pressed it when the timer showed 0‚Äì11 seconds, were regarded as pretentious and arrogant about their beliefs, and hostile towards newcomers. Others, however, like the \\"purple\\" flair given to those that pressed the button between 52‚Äì60 seconds, were seen as compassionate and welcoming to new members. Regardless, each cult maintained a public image through the use of dressed and color-coded mascots. In addition, names arose to represent each of the cults, such as \\"The Emerald Council\\" for the green flair, or \\"The Violet Hand\\" for the purple flair. Eventually the community built around the button referred to the colored flairs not by their color, but by the name given to the cults representing them. Within the larger group of the grey flair, those who would not press the button, smaller cults formed with unique beliefs to others that also held the grey flair. Of these, the most prominent was the \\"Knights of The Button\\". Members of this cult attempted to prevent the button from ever reaching zero by pressing it before the clock could fully descend. The 'Knights' went so far as to create an algorithm associated with a large pool of thousands of \\"dummy\\" accounts to press the button automatically before it could reach zero. However, of these accounts, one was not verified to have been created prior to April 1, 2015 and therefore was unable to press the button, permitting it to finally reach zero. == See also == *Place - Reddit's April Fools' Day event in 2017 *Reddit == References  * Category:April Fools' Day Category:Subreddits Category:Group processes Category:Psychology experiments ","title":"The Button (Reddit)"},{"id":"46344678","text":"Acclamation (foaled 16 May 2006) is an American Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. After showing promising, but unremarkable, form in his first two seasons of racing, he emerged as a top-class turf performer in 2010 when he won the Jim Murray Memorial Handicap and the Charles Whittingham Handicap. In the following season, he improved again, repeating his wins in the Jim Murray Handicap and the Charles Whittingham Handicap and adding wins in the Eddie Read Stakes, Pacific Classic (on a synthetic track) and the Clement L. Hirsch Turf Championship. At the end of the year, he was voted American Champion Older Male Horse. In an abbreviated 2012 season, he won a third Charles Whittingham Handicap and a second Eddie Read Stakes before being retired after winning his last seven races. ==Background== Acclamation is a bay horse with a white star and a white sock on his left hind leg. He was bred in California by Bud Johnston's, Old English Rancho. He was sired by Unusual Heat who won the Amethyst Stakes, Glencairn Stakes and the Platinum Stakes in Ireland before becoming a successful breeding stallion in California. His dam Winning In Style was a granddaughter of Solidity, who was bought for $1,250 by Old English Rancho's founder Ellwood Johnson. She was a descendant of the broodmare Thorn Apple, making her a distant relative of I'll Have Another. Bud Johnston raced the horse in partnership with his wife Judy and Peter and Mary Hilvers. Acclamation was trained throughout his racing career by Donald Warren and usually raced in a red shadow roll. ==Racing career== Early career Acclamation began his racing career at Hollywood Park Racetrack in late 2008 when he finished unplaced in two maiden races before opening his account in a similar event on December 21. In 2009, Acclamation began his season in allowance races finishing third at Hollywood Park and second at Del Mar racetrack before winning at Del Mar in August. He failed to win in his remaining six races that year but finished third in the Del Mar Derby, Hollywood Derby and San Gabriel Handicap. 2010: four-year-old season Acclamation began his third season with four races on the synthetic Cushion Track at Santa Anita, producing his best effort when finishing third to Jeranimo in the Strub Stakes on 13 February. He then moved back to the turf track at Hollywood and finished fourth in the Grade III Inglewood Handicap on April 26. On May 15, Acclamation, ridden by Christian Santiago Reyes started a 14.5/1 outsider for the Grade 2 Jim Murray Handicap over one and a half miles at the same course. He took the lead soon after the start, opened up a clear advantage and won by a race record margin of seven and a half lengths from Falcon Rock. On June 6, the horse was moved up in class to contest the Grade I Charles Whittingham Memorial Handicap over a mile and a quarter. As in his previous race, he took the lead soon after the start and maintained his advantage throughout to win by one and a half lengths from Hyades. The win was the first at the highest level for Donald Warren. Acclamation ran poorly in his two remaining races in 2010, finishing last of nine behind Chinchon in the United Nations Stakes and sixth of seven behind The Usual Q. T. in the Eddie Read Handicap. 2011: five-year-old season Acclamation began his 2011 campaign by finishing fifth in the Frank E. Kilroe Mile Handicap on March 6 and then failed when tried on dirt in the Charles Town Classic finishing last of the ten runners behind Duke of Mischief after encountering what Warren described as \\"mud and rain and trouble on the first turn\\". He was never beaten again. Joel Rosario took over the ride when Acclamation returned to turf and attempted to repeat his 2010 success in the Jim Murray Handicap. He started the 7/5 favorite and won by seven lengths from Falcon Rock. After the race, Warren commented \\"It was a perfect plan today... as long as he's not shuffled around and bumped around. He doesn‚Äôt like to be bothered too much and doesn‚Äôt like to be hit with the stick. He's easily rateable and he's such a natural mile and one-half horse\\". On June 11 the horse started odds-on favorite for the Charles Whittingam Memorial and won the race for the second time, leading from the start and beating Celtic New Year by three and a half lengths. In the Eddie Read Handicap at Del Mar on July 24, Acclamation started third choice in the betting behind Caracortado and Smart Bid (Mervin H. Muniz Jr. Memorial Handicap). Acclamation took the lead from the start and set a steady pace before accelerating at halfway and drawing away to win by three and a quarter length from Jeranimo. Joel Rosario commented \\"I could see his ears up and going back and forth. He was just having fun out there.\\" Pat Valenzuela took over the ride when Acclamation was switched to the synthetic Polytrack surface for the Grade I Pacific Classic at Del Mar on August 29 and started third favorite behind Twirling Candy (Malibu Stakes, Strub Stakes, Californian Stakes), and Game On Dude. Valenzuela sent the horse into the lead from the start, setting a steady pace before accelerating approaching the final turn. He held off the strong challenge of Twirling Candy in the straight to in by a head, with the pair finishing four lengths clear of the other runners. Valenzuela, who had been given the ride by Warren for his skill at riding speed horses said \\"my horse stuck his neck out and fought the battle. He wouldn‚Äôt let him by.\\" On his final run of the season, Acclamation started odds-on favorite for the Clement L. Hirsch Turf Championship over a mile and a quarter at Santa Anita and won by three quarters of a length from the 2010 winner Champ Pegasus. After the race owner Bud Johnson said of the winner \\"He's a very accomplished horse. We're very proud of him.\\" He was expected to run in the Breeders' Cup Turf or the Breeders' Cup Classic, but was ruled out for the rest of the year with a bruised foot. 2012: six-year-old season Acclamation returned after a lengthy absence for two races in the summer on 2012 after he had been kept of the course by several minor problems. On June 10 he took the Charles Wittingham for a third straight year, leading from the start and winning by a length from the San Marcos Handicap winner Slim Shadey, to whom he was conceding four pounds. On July 21, the horse repeated his 2011 success in the Eddie Read, making all the running and winning by two and three quarter lengths from the Argentinian import Interaction. After the race Valenzuela said \\"he's a great horse\\". \\"I‚Äôve been lucky enough to ride some very good horses, champions, like Sunday Silence and Arazi, and Best Pal. And this horse is right there with them. No doubt about it.\\" Shortly after the race Acclamation sustained a tendon injury to his left foreleg. Although he appeared to recover and was aimed at the Breeders' Cup the injury flared up again in training and he did not race again. ==Assessment and awards== In the Eclipse Awards for 2011, Acclamation was voted American Champion Older Male Horse, taking 95 votes ahead of Game On Dude (70) and Tizway (52). In the poll for American Champion Male Turf Horse he finished runner-up behind Cape Blanco. He was named Californian-bred Horse of the Year for both 2011 and 2012. ==Stud record== Acclamation was retired from racing to stand at the Old English Rancho at Sanger, California in 2013 at a fee of $20,000. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:2006 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in California Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Thoroughbred family 23-b Category:Eclipse Award winners ","title":"Acclamation (horse)"},{"id":"46344687","text":"Louisville, which is now a ghost town, was a mining camp in El Dorado Canyon near the Techatticup Mine in the Eldorado Mining District, of New Mexico Territory.

He was sired by Cantab, a successful hurdler who won the Triumph Hurdle in 1961 before becoming a successful National Hunt stallion. His other progeny included Little Polveir, Little Owl (Cheltenham Gold Cup) and Dixton House (National Hunt Handicap Chase). Cantab was a representative of the Byerley Turk sire line, unlike more than 95% of modern thoroughbreds, who descend directly from the Darley Arabian. The Thinker was the best racer produced by the unraced Maine Pet, but his full-sister Heather-Can did place in a few National Hunt flat and hurdle races in 1979 and 1980. As a young horse, The Thinker was bought by Arthur Stephenson and entered the ownership of Tom McDonnagh. He was trained in County Durham by Stephenson, who was known for consistently winning numerous minor races at northern racecourses, his motto being \\"little fish are sweet\\".http://www.thefreelibrary.com/For+the+Record%3A+Hooked+on+the+little+fish%3B+Arthur+Stephenson+farmed...-a060965802 ==Racing career== Early career In November 1985 at Ayr, The Thinker won the Joan Mackay Handicap Race against eight other horses at 14-1 odds. Running in the W.L. Hector Christie Memorial Trophy at Catterick in December 1985 and ridden by Kevin Jones, The Thinker was an 11-8 favourite and \\"appeared to have the race sewn up\\" when he was defeated by a neck by a late challenge from Hazy Glen. He did not finish the Townton Handicap Chase at Wetherby later in December 1985 having been pulled up during the race. In January 1986, he was unplaced for the Stokesley Handicap Chase at Catterick. In February 1986, The Thinker won the Stanwix Handicap Chase in Carlisle defeating the Grand National placer Mr. Snugfit. He was unplaced in the March 1987 running of the Kim Muir Memorial Challenge Trophy at Cheltenham. In April 1986, The Thinker recorded his first major win when he won the Midlands Grand National at Uttoxeter Racecourse in snowy conditions.http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/content/articles/2009/03/03/midlands_grand_national_feature.shtml He won the County of Ayr Handicap Chase in May. He was unplaced in the November 1986 Charlie Hall Memorial Wetherby Pattern Chase and the November 1986 Joan Mackay Handicap Chase at Ayr. On 27 December 1986, The Thinker won the Rowland Meyrick Handicap Chase at Wetherby. He was unplaced in the January 1987 Peter Marsh Challenge. The Thinker was entered in the 1987 Grand National but was withdrawn shortly before the start due to Stephenson's concerns about the muddy course conditions and the results of a training gallop the morning of the race. 1987 Cheltenham Gold Cup The 1987 Cheltenham Gold Cup, run on 19 March was the 60th running of Britain's most prestigious steeplechase. Arthur Stephenson was not at Cheltenham, preferring to attend the meeting at Hexham, where he had seven runners, and The Thinker was taken to the course by Stephenson's nephew Peter Cheeseborough. The twelve runner field was headed by the 5/4 favourite Forgive 'n' Forget who had won the race in 1985, whilst the other runners included Door Latch and Bolands Cross (second and third behind Desert Orchid in the King George VI Chase, Wayward Lad, Charter Party, Combs Ditch, Earls Brig and West Tip. The Thinker, ridden by Ridley Lamb started at odds of 13/2 after considerable late support from gamblers who felt he would be well-suited by the testing conditions. An hour before the race, snow fell heavily on the course rendering the conditions virtually unraceable and the runners for the Gold Cup, having made their way to the start, were recalled to the paddock. After a delay of well over an hour, during which the snow began to melt, the runners were recalled to the start and the race began. Lamb settled The Thinker towards the rear of the field in the early stages as Cybrandian led the field on the first circuit. Charter Party fell at the fifth whilst Earls Brig was pulled up early on the second circuit and Bolands Cross fell at the fifteenth. Four fences from the finish, Cybrandian led from Door Latch, but The Thinker had made steady progress into third ahead of Forgive 'n' Forget, Wayward Lad and Combs Ditch. The Thinker moved into second but made a bad jumping error at the third last and turned into the straight in third place behind Cybrandian and Wayward Lad. The Thinker maintained his position over the last two fences before tracking to the right on the run-in and producing a strong late run to overtake Cybrandian in the last hundred yards and win by one and a half lengths. Door Latch and West Tip finished well to take third and fourth ahead of Wayward Lad. Later career The Thinker won the Peter Marsh Limited Handicap Chase at Haydock Park in January 1988 against West Tip. In the 1988/9 season, The Thinker won a minor race at Kelso Racecourse and then took the listed Tommy Whittle Chase at Haydock Park, taking the lead at the second last and winning easily by twelve lengths from Kissane.Racing Post He then finished third under top weight of 164 pounds in the Welsh National and fell at the tenth fence in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. On 8 April, The Thinker again carried 164 pounds when top weight for the 1989 Grand National. Ridden by Simon Sherwood, he lost his position on the second circuit but stayed on strongly in the closing stages and finished third of the forty runners behind Little Polveir and West Tip.Racing Post On his only other appearance of the season The Thinker was pulled up in the Whitbread Gold Cup. In the following season The Thinker failed to win in four starts but finished second in the Edward Hanmer Chase, the Tommy Whittle Chase and the Greenall Whitley Gold Cup. In December 1990, The Thinker returned after a nine-month break to finish third in the Rowland Meyrick Handicap Chase at Wetherby Racecourse. The Thinker was being prepared for a run in the 1991 Grand National when he broke his left hind leghttp://www.thefreelibrary.com/All+our+yesterdays%3A.-a072718403 when cantering at Aintree two days before the race and was euthanised at the age of thirteen.Daily Express Page 36, Friday 6 April 1991 ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1978 racehorse births Category:1991 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 21 Category:Byerley Turk sire line ","title":"The Thinker (horse)"},{"id":"46344869","text":"Belhassen is a family name frequent in Tunisia.

General Thao Ma, who wished to reserve the transports for strictly military use, was forced into exile on 22 October 1966 by fellow generals angling to use the transports for smuggling opium and gold. ==Overview== The 1966 coup grew out of political factionalism in the military high command of the Kingdom of Laos. When General Phoumi Nosavan was forced into exile in February 1965, he no longer could use his influence to shield the subordinates in his faction. Brigadier General Thao Ma, commander of the Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF), was one of them.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 150, 199‚Äì200.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 123‚Äì125. ==Background== Generals Kouprasith Abhay, Oudone Sananikone, and Ouane Rattikone plotted against the air force head. On 3 July 1965, a land mine blew up a jeep in Thao Ma's entourage in an attempted assassination. There was widespread agreement that his rivals were responsible. Later in the year, controversy flared over usage of the RLAF's transports. When three C-47s were delivered to air force headquarters in Savannakhet, Kouprasith and Ouane demanded their transfer to Wattay, where they would be available to the generals. Thao Ma refused the transfer on the grounds that the transports would be used for smuggling gold and opium instead of military use. To retaliate, promotions within the RLAF were limited.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 156‚Äì157. On 1 April 1966, the General Staff held a planning meeting. After informing Kong Le that the RLA was about to absorb his Neutralist troops, they chastised Thao Ma for his independence, noting that the RLAF was a Royal Lao Army unit. His emphasis on raiding the Ho Chi Minh Trail instead of flying close air support for the infantry was criticized. On 21 April, General Ouane announced that Sourith Don Sasorith would be appointed to command the RLAF.Anthony, Sexton, p. 201. A mutiny was then fomented within the RLAF in early May 1966, with the Chief of Staff and several fighter pilots bribed to cause trouble. By 12 May, the General Staff ordered Thao Ma to pass command to the RLAF Chief of Staff, take up staff duties in a new job, and move RLAF headquarters to Wattay Airbase outside Vientiane.Anthony, Sexton, p. 202. In mid-May, the air force general met fellow conspirators Bounleut Saycocie, Thao Ty, and Nouphet Daoheuang on five consecutive nights. They decided to rebel against the General Staff on 4 June, the day before Thao Ma would pass command to his Chief of Staff.Conboy, Morrison, p. 157. However, Thao Ma began his revolt two days early, on 2 June 1966. General Nouphet's regiment surrounded the Savannakhet airstrip. However, the other plotters took no action, and the insurrection was over within 48 hours. The transports were split off into a separate Military Airlift Command under Sourith, leaving fighter operations to Thao Ma. He moved 30 loyal pilots and a dozen AT-28s to Luang Prabang. Thao Ma found himself under increasingly heavy emotional strain.McCoy (1972), p. 332. The ongoing internal strife brought RLAF operations to a near standstill during Summer 1966. However, King Sisavang Vatthana's influence kept Thao Ma in his command. On 27 September, Thao Ma lost control of the transports. However, he remained in charge of the AT-28s, which were now dispersed into four air operations centers in four separate Military Regions of Laos.Anthony, Sexton, p. 203. By early October, rumor had it that Thao Ma was about to be shuffled into a desk job.Conboy, Morrison, p. 158. On 16 October, the General Staff forced Kong Le into exile.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 206‚Äì207. According to one source, Thao Ma was not immediately aware of this, and counted on Kong Le's aid in a coup situation.McCoy (2003), pp. 332‚Äì333. ==The coup== On 20 October 1966, General Ouane and General Bounthone Marthepharak were in Savannakhet on a duty round. In the wake of Kong Le's forced departure, Thao Ma felt both his career and his life were in danger. He lined up a $31,000 slush fund to bribe two regiments stationed in the vicinity of Savannakhet. Nouphet would seize Ouane and Bounthoune while Thao Ma would lead an air strike on General Staff headquarters in Vientiane. Nouphet would use his regiment to arrest Ouane and Bounthone. A second regiment would be airlifted from Savannakhet to Vientiane to arrest Kouprasith and Oudone if they survived the air strike, and to take charge of Vientiane. Thao Ma confided his plan for launching a coup to the assistant air attach√© at Savannakhet. At dawn on 21 October, the coup was launched. The assistant air attach√© warned the Air Attach√© in Vientiane of the impending attack on the capital. Kouprasith and Oudone fled RLA headquarters just prior to the bombing run. Nor was this the only obstacle to coup success. Colonel Bounleut Saycocie failed to bring the bribe fund from Vang Pao. Nouphet and his regiment failed to arrest Ouane and Bounthone. The regiment to be airlifted stood down under orders from a superior officer. However, eight AT-28s launched from Savannakhet and cut across the Kingdom of Thailand's air space to attack Vientiane. The Royal Thai Air Force alerted; they put interceptors in the air. All U.S. Air Force missions over Laos were momentarily cancelled by General William Momyer; they scrambled F-102 interceptors. At 0830 hours, even as Thao Ma radioed a communique that Ouane had been detained, the AT-28s struck a gun park, two munitions depots, the Royal Lao Army headquarters, and Kouprasith's villa. The gun park and a nearby communications center suffered at least 23 dead.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 207‚Äì209. Thao Ma prepared to lead a second sortie. However, Ambassador William H. Sullivan, the British Ambassador, and Prince Boun Oum flew to Savannakhet and persuaded the RLAF general to withhold a second assault. At 2200 hours, the RLAF coup force manned AT-28 cockpits and loaded loyal technicians onto a C-47 transport. In Vientiane, power was cut to the entire city so that a night raid would have no aiming points. However, instead of striking again, the coup pilots flew into exile at Udorn. The Lao coup troops spent eight months imprisoned before being granted political asylum by the Thais. Thao Ma was sentenced in absentia to the death penalty.Shackley, pp. 132‚Äì136. ==Aftermath== Thao Ma was that rarity among Lao generals, a fighting man. His departure was a severe blow to RLAF morale. The loss of ten pilots' services seriously curtailed RLAF operations. Sourith filled the RLAF commander's vacancy; he was responsive to Ouane. Once assured of air transportation, Ouane contracted for the opium shipment that was the focus of the 1967 Opium War.McCoy (2003), p. 333. ==NotesReferences== * Anthony, Victor B. and Richard R.

He was also known as the second El Hijo de Rey Misterio, Spanish for \\"The Son of the Rey Misterio\\", the second wrestler under that name after the first El Hijo de Rey Misterio. He also works on the independent circuit in the United States and in Mexico. His real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. ==Professional wrestling career== Independent circuit (2007‚Äì2020) Horus began wrestling in 2007 in some Tijuana promotions. On May 27, 2011, since the retirement of El Hijo de Rey Misterio, he was presented by both Rey Misterio Sr. and Konnan as the second El Hijo de Rey Misterio, making his debut in Tijuana. His first match as Misterio was a tournament to crown the WWA World Welterweight Champion on May 27, 2011, which Horus won. In 2014, Misterio changed his name to Rey Horus, because the original El Hijo de Rey Misterio returned to wrestling. On March 27, 2015, Horus made his biggest appearance in the United States when he participated in the WrestleMania Weekend King of Indies tournament. Horus defeated Lil Cholo in the first round, but on March 28 he was defeated by Willie Mack in the quarter-final match. On April 6, 2015, Evolve announced Horus as AR Fox's substitute at Evolve 41. On September 1, 2017, Horus entered Pro Wrestling Guerrilla's 2017 Battle of Los Angeles, losing to Rey Fenix in his first round match. Lucha Underground (2016‚Äì2018) In the debut episode of Lucha Underground (season one) on October 29, 2014, the opening scene featured an unnamed character being rescued from multiple attackers by the green masked Dragon Azteca. This led to Dragon Azteca mentoring the white-hooded unnamed character in lucha libre. During part one of season one's Ultima Lucha, El Dragon Azteca fought his hooded prot√©g√© to a draw at the entrance of the Temple where Lucha Underground's matches occurred. Due to the prophecy predicting El Dragon Azteca's death if he entered the Temple, the hooded man offered to go in Azteca's place to rescue Black Lotus from Dario Cueto. Azteca refused to listen, vowing that his spirit would live on after his death. Following the storyline death of Dragon Azteca, his mask was taken up by his student. In late 2015 Horus took part in Lucha Underground first appearing in the Season 1 finale as a nameless outside spectator but at Ultima Lucha 1 took up the mask of his master and became known as Dragon Azteca Jr. In Season 2 Dragon Azteca Jr. started participating in matches and won The Lucha Underground Trios Championship along with Prince Puma & Rey Mysterio. In Season 4, he would defeat Dezmond X and King Cuerno to win the Gift of the Gods Championship, but he lost it against Marty The Moth Martinez.

It lies on the B4314 Pendine to Templeton road, close to the border with Carmarthenshire and is in Lampeter Velfrey community and parish. It is a historical meeting point of several roads. The population at the 2011 census was 349. ==Name== Tavernspite is a corruption of Tafarn Ysbyty (Hospice Tavern), referring to the sole building at the site in the 18th century; it was believed to have been a hospice for pilgrims to St David‚Äôs built by Whitland Abbey monks. ==Description== Tavernspite is in rural south Pembrokeshire on the B4314 road between Princes Gate and Red Roses, Carmarthenshire. The village sits on an intersection of several other country roads, including the B4328 from Whitland. It has a school, pub, garden centre and holiday park.Google maps ==History== Alpha Inn, opened 1963 (date of original building unknown) Cartographer Emanuel Bowen recorded Tavernspite in 1729 as having a building on the site of the Plume of Feathers inn. From 1787, after the road through the village had been turnpiked (the Tavernspite Turnpike Trust was established in 1771), Tavernspite would have been known to travellers on the Ireland mail coach from London and Bristol which passed through the village on the way to Milford Haven. In 1798 the Tavernspite Roads Bill was passed by Parliament for the repairs of the roads running from the village. In the early 1800s there were two inns. Richard Fenton in 1811 mentions Tavernspite having an inn where the Milford mail coach could change horses and where post-chaises were kept. He examined a large tumulus half a mile before he reached the village and uncovered an urn. He describes the village as in a bleak situation on the edge of a large tract of uncultivated ground, which he finds unusual as the turnpike gives good access to markets. In 1833 there was an establishment called the Ordnance Arms. In Lewis's 1833 Topographical dictionary Tavernspite is included in the parish of Lampeter Velfrey. He describes the settlement as In 1840 there was an inn called the Feathers and there were 10 houses in the settlement. A pre-1850 parish map shows an inn. A school was opened by the Rev. William Seaton in 1845 and a year later there were 124 children being educated there. Some of the toll gates on the roads around Tavernspite were caught up in the Rebecca Riots of 1843, leading the Tavernspite Turnpike Trust to publish their accounts in order to satisfy the public over how the money raised by tolls was expended. In the 1870s two fairs were held: 20 July and 5 September. On the Ordnance Survey maps of 1868-98, the Plume of Feathers is marked, along with a smithy, school and gate house, and there are a number of other buildings shown but not named. The county boundary between Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire is shown as running through the centre of the village. Preserved village water supply The village is recorded as a historic place name by the Royal Commission in the early 20th century. A village hall was built in 1924, but the village did not have access to mains water until after World War 2. Prior to that, residents drew water from the village well; the pump still stands. Electricity was connected in 1953 and in the 1940s and 1950s council houses were built. The village had expanded to 56 houses by 1988. Since there is no war memorial in the village, the possibility was raised in 2013 that Tavernspite could be a doubly thankful village, the only other known in Pembrokeshire being Herbrandston. However, it has since come to light that Levi Thomas of Tavernspite died at Gallipoli in 1915, although his name does not appear on any of the local Pembrokeshire war memorials. The Alpha Inn was established in 1963, the building having previously been a bakery and shop, then a garage and petrol station. ==School== A school was opened by the Rev. William Seaton in 1845 and a year later there were 124 children being educated there. The current school, Tavernspite Community Primary, was built in 1954 and in 2018 catered for 220 pupils aged 3 to 11 years, with a number of clubs and extracurricular activities, and serving a large catchment area. The school was the first Pembrokeshire Outdoor School and is an accredited Forest School. It has been awarded The Sustainable Schools Platinum Award and voted the ‚ÄòEco- School of the Year in Wales'. In 2008, the school was the first in Wales to benefit from the Green Energy for Schools programme by receiving solar panels worth ¬£20,000, sufficient to produce 3,000 kW¬∑h of electricity each year. In 2011-12 one of the school's teachers, Adam Lopez, was a writer for The Guardian.

Sam J. Tsemberis (born March 11, 1949 in Skoura, Greece) is a Greek Canadian clinical and community psychology practitioner, and the founder and executive director of Pathways to Housing, a Housing First program for individuals with serious mental illnesses, long histories of homelessness, and often co-occurring substance abuse.\\"Meet the outsider who accidentally solved chronic homelessness\\", Washington Post (retrieved May 18, 2015) Pathways to Housing is the organization that is credited with originating the Housing First model in America. ==Pathway Housing First== Tsemberis and homeless consumers first developed a consumer-run drop‚Äìin center for people experiencing homelessness and mental illness. They then created the Pathways to Housing program, which came to be known as Housing First (Tsemberis et al., 2003). They initially showed that the program was more effective in getting people off the streets and keeping them housed than the citywide average for programs funded under the same city-state agreement to provide housing for people with serious mental illnesses and chronic homelessness (Tsemberis, 1999), then conducted a randomized controlled trial of the Pathways to Housing model in comparison to the dominant model which attempted to provide ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù housing for individuals in treatment programs, and allow them to earn their way toward more autonomous settings via cooperation with service providers and success in treatment. The Pathways model was substantially more successful (99 fewer days homeless in the first year for people randomly assigned to Pathways to Housing vs. the control group), and the greater success lasted for the full four years of the study. The model also proved more cost effective, in large part due to reductions in psychiatric hospital stays (Gulcur et al., 2003). By 2010, the Federal Interagency Council on Homelessness advocated Housing First in its strategic planThe housing first checklist: A practical tool for assessing housing first in practice. United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (retrieved July 11, 2013) asserted: ‚ÄúHousing First is a proven method of ending all types of homelessness and is the most effective approach to ending chronic homelessness.‚Äù The Mental Health Commission of Canada put the Housing First model to rigorous randomized trial in five Canadian cities and found that in the first year it more than doubled the time participants spent in stable housing relative to a control group (Goering et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2013) and the model has spread to Europe. According to the Pathways to Housing website, the model has been included in over 300 cities‚Äô 10-year plans to end homelessness, and the model is credited with helping to reduce rates of homelessness among adults with serious mental illnesses. Indeed, a current problem is that everyone is jumping on the housing first bandwagon, whether they actually adhere to the core principles of consumer choice or not. Tsemberis is re-branding the model ‚ÄúPathway Housing First‚Äù and has published a manual (Tsemberis, 2010) to try to help people who want to implement the model. In 2018, Tsemberis visited Dublin to support the roll out of the Housing First initiative in Ireland. He was listed as one of the speakers at the 2019 Housing First Scotland Conference and the Mayor‚Äôs Summit on Homelessness in Amarillo, which took place in July 2019. ==FootnotesReferences== *Goering, P., Veidhuizen, S., Watson, A., Adair, C., Kopp, B., Latimer, E., & Angela, L.

Competition began in 2002 with multiple tournaments held for Super Smash Bros. Melee, released for the GameCube in 2001. Later tournaments also featured the original Super Smash Bros. (1999), Super Smash Bros. Brawl (2008), Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and for Wii U (2014), and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (2018). Major Smash tournaments include Community Effort Orlando, DreamHack, Evolution Championship Series, Genesis, Super Smash Con and The Big House. From 2004 to 2006, Major League Gaming (MLG) included Melee in its Pro Circuit, and then supported the MLG Smash Series in 2007. In 2010, MLG had Brawl in its Pro Circuit. The MLG Anaheim 2014 and MLG World Finals 2015 championship also featured Melee and Wii U events. Super Smash Bros. games also have a large, widespread grassroots scene that supports tournaments at the amateur and local level. == History of competitive Melee== One of the \\"Five Gods\\", Jason \\"Mew2King\\" Zimmerman, at a tournament at SXSW 2016 The first publicized Super Smash Bros. Melee tournaments were held in early 2002 with the Tournament Go series. Early tournaments had disputes over what the official ruleset should be, but the Tournament Go organizer, Matt \\"MattDeezie\\" Dahlgren, eventually came up with a ruleset that would become similar to the current fundamental ruleset. On March 1, 2003 the International Video Game Federation hosted the first corporate sponsored Super Smash Bros. tournament, the IVGF Northwest Regionals, won by Jeremy \\"Recipherus\\" Fremlin. From 2004 to 2006, Major League Gaming sponsored Melee on its Pro Circuit. The period of 2003 to 2006 was the Golden Age of Melee, as the game was in the Major League Gaming circuit. Ken Hoang was considered to be the best player during this time, earning him the nickname \\"The King of Smash\\". In addition to Ken, Christopher \\"Azen\\" McMullen, Daniel \\"ChuDat\\" Rodriguez, Joel Isai \\"Isai\\" Alvarado, Christopher \\"PC Chris\\" Szygiel, Daniel \\"KoreanDJ\\" Jung, and Jason \\"Mew2King\\" Zimmerman were considered the best players at the time. Although it dropped Melee from its 2007 Pro Circuit, MLG still sponsored a number of tournaments as part of the underground 2007 Smash Series for a year. In 2010, MLG picked up Brawl for its Pro Circuit for a year. During this time, Nintendo prohibited MLG from live streaming Brawl matches. At 2014 MLG Anaheim Melee was once again hosted at an MLG event. Melee was also included at the Evolution Championship Series (Evo) in 2007, a fighting game tournament held in Las Vegas. Brawl replaced Melee for EVO 2008, but received criticism for the inclusion of items. The competitive Smash scene shrank in 2009 due to criticisms of the mechanics of Brawl. The period from 2012 to 2013 was the \\"Dark Age\\" due to Melee's temporary decline and then Brawl's decline. After this \\"Dark Age,\\" EVO 2013 started Smash's comeback in the competitive scene and, thus, started the \\"Platinum Era,\\" otherwise known as the \\"Five Gods\\" Era. Melee was again hosted at EVO 2013 after it won a charity drive to decide the final game to be featured in its tournament lineup. Due to the large turnout and popularity that year, Evo again included Melee at both their 2014 and 2015 event. New Jersey-based Apex is another prominent Super Smash Bros. tournament, and has a series of qualifying events that are a prerequisite to playing at Apex. In 2015 Apex announced that they were officially sponsored by Nintendo of America, which was the first official sponsorship of a community-run event. Apex 2015 was the largest Smash tournament in history until EVO 2015 and featured every official title in the series. In June 2014 Nintendo held an exhibition Super Smash Bros. for Wii U tournament at E3 2014. Despite the success of Apex 2015, the tournament was muddled in controversy and structural issues. Apex has since been discontinued. There was a small revival for Apex 2016, but on a much smaller scale with almost nobody outside of regional attendance. Currently, the biggest Melee events in the United States are Community Effort Orlando (CEO), DreamHack, Evolution Championship Series (EVO), GENESIS, The Big House, Shine, and Super Smash Con (SSC). Currently ‚Äì the Platinum Era ‚Äì the best players of Melee, colloquially known as the \\"Five Gods\\", are Mew2King, Joseph \\"Mango\\" Marquez, Kevin \\"PPMD\\" Nanney (formerly known as Dr. PeePee), Adam \\"Armada\\" Lindgren, and Juan \\"Hungrybox\\" Debiedma. However, William \\"Leffen\\" Hjelte broke through the barrier of the Five Gods, after defeating Mew2King at Apex 2015, that stood for many years, and is universally agreed to be at a comparable skill level; he is known to be a God slayer and the top 6 were collectively known as the \\"Big 6\\" and he was the only Smash player to have beaten all Five Gods. Since then, only Justin \\"Plup\\" McGrath has also beaten all Five Gods to join Leffen as a God slayer, and since then the \\"Big 6\\" moniker was canned due to Plup's rise in the player rankings, peaking at second. Plup was also the first player outside of the Big 6 since Jeff \\"SilentSpectre\\" Leung and Amsah Augustuszoon in 2010 to take a tournament set from Armada when Plup beat Armada at The Big House 7. On September 18, 2018, Armada announced his retirement from playing Melee singles, citing a lack of motivation, a \\"sense of dread,\\" and \\"almost physical sickness\\" when attending tournaments, bringing the number of active Gods to three, as PPMD had cited mental health issues since his last tournament in March 2016. SmashBoards estimated that in 2014 around 3,242 events featuring a Super Smash Bros. game had occurred worldwide. == Other games == MKLeo at Frostbite 2020 The other Smash titles also had strong competitive scenes in the past, and are often still played at larger events that feature either Melee or Ultimate. The best Super Smash Bros. Brawl players included Ally, Mew2King and Nairoby \\"Nairo\\" Quezada. Daniel \\"SuPeRbOoMfAn\\" Hoyt is considered the best active Super Smash Bros. player, though Joel \\"Isai\\" Alvarado is widely considered to be the greatest of all time. Gonzalo \\"ZeRo\\" Barrios is considered the best Wii U player, while other notable players include Samuel \\"Dabuz\\" Buzby, Ramin \\"Mr. R\\" Dalshad, Nairoby \\"Nairo\\" Quezada, Elliot \\"Ally\\" Caroza, Gavin \\"Tweek\\" Dempsey, and Leonardo \\"MKLeo\\" Perez. While most of Wii U's top players would go on to migrate to Ultimate, ZeRo would end up retiring from competitive play to focus on a career in online streaming. As of the most recent \\"Panda Global Rankings\\" list ‚Äî an aggregated bi-annual list of the best players across Melee and Ultimate, managed by esports organization \\"Panda Global\\" ‚Äî MKLeo is currently considered the best player in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. == Status == The culture of competitive Melee has been met with some criticism by the game's developers. Masahiro Sakurai expressed concern for the skill gap between casual and competitive players, and has said that competitive play strays from his original vision for the game. Before Evo 2013, Nintendo of America sent a cease and desist letter to bar the tournament from streaming Melee matches, but after experiencing public backlash allowed the live stream to continue as planned. Sakurai's philosophy for Brawl was for the game to be more readily accessible to new players. Consequentially, Brawl is less popular among professional gamers due to its perceived lack of competitive depth and slow play. In response, some players used an exploit with the Wii's SD Card save system to mod the game, creating Project M, which has a gameplay and physics environment more similar to that of Melee's. In addition, the less popular Brawl- was designed to make every character incredibly powerful and Brawl+ was developed to make Brawl more balanced, especially with the character Meta Knight being considered extremely overpowered in the original game. For Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, Sakurai designed the game to appeal to both competitive and casual smashers, stating that his vision for the pace of two titles was between Melee and Brawl. However, some professional players have criticized it for resembling Brawl more than Melee. Despite this, the game has endured an active competitive scene comparable to that of Melee, and held the record for the overall largest tournament of any Super Smash Bros. game, seeing 2,662 entrants at EVO 2016. This record was eventually overtaken by Super Smash Bros. Ultimate ‚Äì a game that has seen greater overlap between the Melee and Wii U community due to further strides being made in its competitive mechanics ‚Äì and ended up peaking at 3,534 entrants at EVO 2019. Ken Hoang, considered to be the game's best player for many years, has won over 50,000 from Smash tournaments. The competitive Smash community was featured in a 2013 crowd-funded documentary called The Smash Brothers by Travis Beauchamp. The film detailed the history of the professional scene and profiled seven prominent Melee players including Hoang and EVO 2013 champion, Joseph \\"Mang0\\" Marquez. The other five players were Christopher \\"Azen\\" McMullen, Jason \\"Mew2King\\" Zimmerman, Isai \\"Isaiah\\" Alvarado, Chris \\"PC Chris\\" Szygiel, and Daniel \\"KoreanDJ\\" Jung. A full-length series called Metagame, also by Beauchamp, featuring Swedish player Adam \\"Armada\\" Lindgren and American player Kevin \\"PPMD\\" Nanney was originally set to be released in 2016 and raised over 30,000 through Kickstarter. However, Metagame has been met with considerable delays and is unreleased as of the third quarter of 2020.  Competitive rule set  Games played using competitive rules are generally played with lives (known as \\"stocks\\" in-game), with the timer set, and items turned off. It is played either Double- elimination format, or a double-elimination bracket seeded from pools. Super Smash Bros., Melee and Project M start with four stocks and eight minute time limit, Brawl with three stocks and eight minute time limit, and 3DS/Wii U with two and six minute time limit. Although Ultimate's competitive scene is in its infancy, three stocks and a seven or eight minute timer is the norm. If the time runs out, the winner is determined by whoever has more stocks left; if both players have the same number of stocks, then winner is determined by whoever has the lower damage percentage. If both players have the same number of stocks and amount of damage, then, depending on the tournament, the whole match must be played again, or a shorter match with a single stock each is played. Pausing can disrupt the gameplay; thus, if a player pauses while in the middle of a match to gain an advantage, then that player must forfeit a stock or the game. In stricter tournaments, the player must forfeit a stock regardless of advantage (or lack thereof), though the pause function is usually disabled in these tournaments. Most matches are played in best-of- three game sets. Best-of-five sets are played anywhere from top 32 to grand finals. There are stages that are deemed legal by the tournament organizers; these stages are starter stages. Players strike the starter stages before a match to determine the first stage they will play on; also, players must choose their characters without the other person's knowledge for the first match. In subsequent matches there are also counterpick stages allowed. For instance, in Melee singles, the starter stages are Battlefield, Final Destination, Dream Land N64, Yoshi's Story, and Fountain of Dreams. Players use a 1-2-1 format to strike which stages they do not want to play on until one is left. Once the first match is complete, the losing player can choose any of the starter stages or he or she can also choose a counterpick stage ‚Äì in this case, Pok√©mon Stadium. After the first match is complete, the losing player chooses a stage, then the winning player chooses his or her character, then the losing player chooses his or her character before heading to subsequent matches. In best-of-3 sets, the winner can ban one stage so the losing player cannot choose that stage. Generally, players cannot select a stage on which they have previously won; this rule is known as \\"Dave's Stupid Rule\\" or the \\"Stage Clause\\". However, a modified version of this rule is being used currently, in which a player can select a stage he or she won on only with the other player's approval. Competitive play may be either singles, or doubles. In singles, two players face off against each other. In doubles, two teams of two players fight each other. Sharing stocks with your teammate is allowed. Friendly fire is enabled, so teammates can damage or save each other. This is to ensure fairness, as certain combinations of characters in teams can prove to be overpowered. It also ensures that two-on-one situations aren't overwhelmingly tilted in the winning team's favor. It also adds a couple of extra strategies. For example, some characters can absorb attacks, to heal themselves or to charge an attack for later use. With friendly fire on, a player can attack their ally specifically to allow them to absorb it. Additionally, most characters have a triple jump that, once used, prevents the character from taking any action until they are hit with an attack, land back on the stage, are KO'd. If a player is not going to make it back to the stage, their ally can hit them with a weak attack, allowing them to re-use their triple jump and make it back. A similar thing applies to Jigglypuff's Rest move, which is extremely powerful, but immobilizes Jigglypuff for several seconds, unless it is hit by an attack. An ally can use his or her weakest move to knock Jigglypuff out of this state, denying the enemy the chance to use a powerful move on it. Super Smash Bros. for Wii U adds an 8-player mode, which allows triples and quadruples teams, although there have been comparatively few tournaments. In addition, a player gets port priority when he or she wins in a best-of-one of, usually, rock-paper-scissors. Smasher Mew2King found out that the player who is player 1 or is closest to player 1 has priority in attacks that hit each other at the same time. Also, a neutral start may be enacted if a player suggests it. In some Brawl rulesets, Meta Knight is either banned from certain stages or is completely banned from tournaments due to his overpowered nature of attacks. == Wombo Combo meme == \\"Wombo Combo\\" is an internet meme from a December 2008 Melee doubles match that took place at the SCSA West Coast Circuit tournament. The match featured Jeff \\"SilentSpectre\\" Leung and Mitchell \\"Tang\\" Tang on one team and Julian \\"Zhu\\" Zhu and Joey \\"Lucky\\" Aldama on the other. In the match, as Lucky lost all of his lives, SilentSpectre and Tang then performed several moves in tandem which removed Zhu's ability to respond. The commentators of the match ‚Äì Brandon \\"HomeMadeWaffles\\" Collier, Phil DeBerry, and Joseph \\"Mango\\" Marquez ‚Äì exclaimed \\"Happy Feet, Wombo Combo. That ain't Falco\\". They then screamed wildly as SilentSpectre and Tang locked Zhu in a game-winning combo. The meme is the subject of a mini documentary, and is one of the memes seen in the Wii U eShop game Meme Run. It has also been used in many \\"MLG Montage\\" parody videos. == Sexual abuse allegations == In July 2020, over 50 members of the Super Smash Bros. competitive community, including players and commentators, were accused of various forms of sexual misconduct. These included allegations of sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape, and child grooming.https://kotaku.com/over-50-sexual-misconduct-allegations-have-the- super-sm-1844328719 Nintendo responded to the wave of allegations, condemning \\"all acts of violence, harassment, and exploitation against anyone and that we stand with the victims\\".https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53308579 == Tournament results == * Brawl * Melee * Nintendo 3DS and Wii U * Project M * Super Smash Bros. * Ultimate == References  External links == * SmashBoards Category:Nintendo events ","title":"Super Smash Bros. in esports"},{"id":"46345218","text":"Joseph H.

Examples of its use in Florence include the interior pilasters, entablatures, and other decorative elements of Brunelleschi's Pazzi Chapel and Michelangelo's Medici Chapel. == Physical traits == Pietra serena comes out of the ground as a blue-gray color. Due to a chemical reaction in the stone, it turns into red. This is due to oxidization in the clay matrix of the stone. Pietra serena has a very limited durability. This has led to problems with conservation efforts. This durability is also the reason why it is very workable. == Quarries == Pietra serena was very popular in the Renaissance, and because of this the quarries where the stone was found were exploited.

It aims to understand how humans view space, place, and environment. It involves the formalization of factors that influence our spatial cognition to create a more effective representation of space. These improved models assist in a variety of issues, for example, the developing maps that communicate better, providing navigation instructions that are easier to follow, utilizing space more practically, accounting for the cultural differences on spatial thinking for more effective cross-cultural information exchange, and an overall increased understanding of our environment. Notable researchers in this branch of geography include David Mark, Daniel Montello, Max J. Egenhofer, Andrew U Frank, Christian Freksa, Edward Tolman, and Barbara Tversky, among others. Conference on Spatial Information Theory (COSIT) is a biennial international conference with a focus on the theoretical aspect of space and spatial information. The US National Research Council published a book titled, ‚ÄúLearning to think spatially (2006)‚Äù written by the Committee on Support for Thinking Spatially. The committee believes that incorporating GIS and other spatial technologies in K‚Äì12 curriculum would promote spatial thinking and reasoning. == Origin and early works == The connection between spatial cognition and human activity and survival exists from ancient times. As learned from etymology, geometry has its origins in land surveying of the annual floods of the Nile river. Spatial cognition developed from the study of cognitive psychology which began to be considered as a separate field in the late 1960s through Ulric Neisser‚Äôs book Cognitive Psychology (1967). Initially, research on spatial cognition was hindered due to many leading researchers believing that visual and spatial world could be explained using language processing. Later on, research on imagery showed that by reducing the representation of the visual and spatial world into language researchers ignored ‚Äòfascinating‚Äô issues.Kosslyn, Stephen Michael. Image and mind. Harvard University Press, 1980. Around the same time, geographers were studying how people perceived and remembered the geographical world.O'keefe, John, and Lynn Nadel. The hippocampus as a cognitive map. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978. Cognitive geography and behavioral geography draw from early behaviorist works such as Tolman's concepts of \\"cognitive maps\\". More cognitively oriented, these geographers focus on the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning, decision making, and behavior. More behaviorally oriented geographers are materialists and look at the role of basic learning processes and how they influence the landscape patterns or even group identity.Norton, W. (1997). Human geography and behavior analysis: An application of behavior analysis to the evolution of human landscapes. The Psychological Record, 47, 439‚Äì460 Examples of early works on Cognitive Geography include Tolman‚Äôs \\"Cognitive maps in rats and men\\" compared the behavior of laboratory rats with the navigation and wayfinding abilities of humans. Similar work during that period dealt with the peoples‚Äô perception of direction and spatial relations, for example, Americans typically think that South America is aligned directly south of North America when in fact most of South America is much further east. In the early 70s, the focus was on how to improve maps by providing useful information, delivering an understandable message, and making it more aesthetically pleasing. == Research in cognitive geography == The interaction between humans and the environment is a major focus among the Geographers. The objective of this research area is to minimize the disparity between the environment and its geometric representation and the removal of spatial cognitive biases that are inherent. Examples of spatial cognitive biases include the overestimation of distance between two locations when there is a large number of intersections and nodes in the path. There is a tendency to recollect irregular streets or rivers as straighter, more parallel, or more perpendicular than they are. David Mark through his research illustrates how spatial features like inland water bodies (lakes, ponds, lagoons) are categorized differently in English and French speaking population, and therefore, could cause issues in cross-cultural geographical information exchange. Studies have been done on wayfinding and navigation. Wayfinding is defined as ‚Äúthe mental processes involved in determining a route between two points and then following that route‚Äù and involves planning trips, optimizing routes, and exploring different places. The researchers are trying to find the perfect amount of information, not more and not less, for making navigation more efficient. Landmarks play an important factor in wayfinding and navigation, therefore, researchers are looking to automate the selection of landmarks which would make maps easier to follow. Displaying information through maps has been shaped by how humans sense space and direction. Communicating effectively through maps is a challenge for many cartographers. For example, symbols, their color, and their relative size have an important role to play in the interaction between the map and the mapmaker. The study of Geo-ontology has also been of interest to researchers in this field. Geo-ontology involves the study of the variations among different cultures in how they view and sense landforms, how to communicate spatial knowledge with other cultures while overcoming such barriers, an understanding of the cognitive aspects of spatial relations, and how to represent them in computational models.Mark, David M. \\"Spatial representation: a cognitive view.\\" Geographical information systems: Principles and applications 1 (1999): 81‚Äì89. For example, there might be some geographic meaning that might not be well explained using words. There might be some differences in understanding when spatial information is explained verbally instead of non-verbal form. Some of the questions that cognitive geographers deal with include the influence of scale on the information provided in maps, the difference in how we view geographic knowledge differently from different sources, for example, text-based, map-based, or any real-world experience. A typical study in Cognitive Geography involves volunteers responding to a questionnaire after being shown some spatial information. The researchers use this data to find the spectrum of interpretations by the volunteers about the subject in focus.Montello, Daniel R. \\"Cognitive research in GIScience: Recent achievements and future prospects.\\" Geography Compass 3.5 (2009): 1824‚Äì1840.Montello, Daniel R. \\"Cognitive geography.\\" (2009). == See also == * Behavioral geography * Cognitive psychology * Spatial Cognition * Geovisualization * Wayfinding == References ==  Notes   Further reading  * Downs, Roger M., and David Stea.

Veiga also worked at the Centre for Higher Education on Policies Studies (CIPES) in Matosinhos, Portugal for several years. Veiga's poem 'Angola', figuring the speaker's country as a surrogate mother, has frequently been anthologised.See, for example, Stella and Frank Chipasula, ed., The Heinemann Book of African Women's Poetry, 1995; Ulli Beier and Gerald Moore, The Penguin Book of Modern African Poetry, 1999. ==Works== * Destinos, 1961 * Poemas, 1963 * Liberta√ß√£o, 1974 ==References== Category:1931 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century Angolan poets Category:Portuguese emigrants to Angola Category:Angolan people of Portuguese descent Category:Angolan women poets Category:20th-century women writers ","title":"Am√©lia Veiga"},{"id":"46345262","text":"Days of Comedy (Macedonian Cyrillic: –î–µ–Ω–æ–≤–∏ –Ω–∞ –∫–æ–º–µ–¥–∏—ò–∞) is an international theater comedy festival in Kumanovo, Macedonia.

In addition, he is said to have gone out to Greater Syria (al-ShƒÅm) in order to fight against non-Muslims on the Byzantine frontier.

She began rapping and performing slam poetry in 2010, and gained wider recognition in 2013 for her appearance on the track \\"Lost\\" from Chance the Rapper's mixtape, Acid Rap. Noname released her debut mixtape, Telefone, on July 31, 2016 to critical acclaim. Her debut album, Room 25, was released on September 14, 2018 and received further critical acclaim. Since 2019, Noname has run her own book club, focused on texts from authors of colour. ==Early life== Noname grew up in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago. She was raised by her grandparents until she was in middle school. When she returned to live with her mother, she had a new sibling and she and her mother did not get along. As a teenager, she listened to blues musicians Buddy Guy and Howlin' Wolf, and spent time in her mother's bookstore. She started writing poetry after taking a creative writing class in high school.Eoin Butler. (2016). JAMILA WOODS ft. NONAME vry blk. Dublin, Ireland: The Irish Times Ltd. As a teen, she spent time in the YOUMedia project‚Äîa space for young artists to create and network‚Äîthen based in the Harold Washington Library. There, she befriended many local talents, including Chance the Rapper. == Career ==  2010‚Äì2015: Early works  Noname's interest in poetry led her to compete in local open mics and slam poetry competitions; she placed third place in Chicago's annual Louder Than a Bomb competition. Noname then started to freestyle rap with friends, collaborating with local Chicago artists including Chance the Rapper, Saba & Mick Jenkins. In 2013, she appeared on Chance the Rapper's second mixtape, Acid Rap, contributing a verse to the track \\"Lost,\\" where she sang the chorus to the song as well as her own verse. She later contributed a verse for the song \\"Finish Line/Drown\\" from Chance the Rapper's 2016 mixtape Coloring Book. In December 2016, she appeared with Chance the Rapper on Saturday Night Live. She announced her first tour on November 13, 2016. In 2014, she was featured on Mick Jenkins' mixtape The Waters, contributing to the track \\"Comfortable\\". In 2015, she was featured on multiple tracks from Kirk Knight's album Late Knight Special. During that year, she also featured on fellow Chicago rapper Ramaj Eroc's single \\"I Love You More\\".  2016‚Äì2017: Telefone  Noname on her Telefone tour in 2017 Noname first used the stage name \\"Noname Gypsy\\", which she chose as a teenager when she was transitioning from poetry to music, believing \\"gypsies were very nomadic, just not about staying in one space for a long time\\". In March 2016, she removed \\"Gypsy\\" from her stage name after learning of its racial connotation, saying she was unaware of the negative connotations of the term \\"gypsy\\" and did not want to offend Romani people. In a 2016 interview with The Fader, she explained her current stage name, following the change: > I try to exist without binding myself to labels. I‚Äôm not really into labels > at all, even the way I dress; I usually don't wear anything with a name > brand. For me, not having a name expands my creativity. I‚Äôm able to do > anything. Noname could potentially be a nurse, Noname could be a > screenwriter. I‚Äôm not limited to any one category of art or other existence, > on a more existential level. Noname released her first mixtape, Telefone, on July 31, 2016, after three years of production. Telefone was Noname's method of publicizing her new stage name, through songs presented as open-ended telephone conversations. The album is centered around important telephone conversations that Noname has had. Her rap speaks of black women's pain and also highlights the struggles of growing up in Chicago. The album was originally released as a free download on Bandcamp, and then on vinyl in September 2017. Rolling Stone wrote it was one of 2016's \\"most thought-provoking hip-hop.\\" Stereogum wrote that Noname possessed \\"a potency and urgency in her complicated, spoken word-esque cadences and subdued delivery that escapes many of her more animated peers.\\" Consequence of Sound wrote that \\"the louder her music is played, the brighter her cadence glows, giving her lyrics a type of 3D craft that makes Telefone a diary of lessons too relevant to keep to yourself.\\" In October 2016, Noname and fellow Chicago resident, Saba, collaborated to produce \\"Church/Liquor Store\\", a song that explores the Westside of Chicago where liquor stores sit directly next to places of worship. Noname critiques the gentrification of the neighborhood and the erasure of crime believed to accompany it. Noname performed a NPR Tiny Desk Concert in April 2017.  2018‚Äì2019: Room 25  In August 2018, Noname announced that her second album, Room 25, would be released in the fall of 2018. The album, which took approximately one month to record, chronicles the two years since the release of Telefone, during which she moved from Chicago to Los Angeles, and had a short romantic relationship. Noname compared her maturity on Room 25 to Telefone, saying \\"Telefone was a very PG record because I was very PG. I just hadn't had sex.\\" Unlike Telefone, Room 25 was created due to a financial obligation. Noname said in an interview, \\"It came to a point where it was, like, I needed to make an album because I need to pay my rent. I could've done another Telefone tour, but I can't play those songs anymore. Like, I could, but I physically hate it because I've just been playing them for so long.\\" Noname paid for the entire album herself using money from touring and guest appearances on Chance the Rapper projects. The album was released on September 14, 2018. El Hunt of NME described the album as \\"flawless\\" and \\"smartly constructed and laced with intricate subtlety.\\" Rolling Stone said Noname was \\"One of the best rappers alive\\" and included her on a list of \\"Artists You Need to Know\\". Pitchfork designated Room 25 as \\"Best New Music\\" and wrote that it is \\"a transcendent coming-of-age tale built around cosmic jazz and neo-soul, delivered by a woman deeply invested in her interiority and that of the world around her.\\" PopMatters said the album was \\"vintage neo-soul and future rap hand in hand; a soulful sanctuary for those turned off by the austerity of mainstream mumble rap\\". She performed a three-song medley of \\"Blaxploitation,\\" \\"Prayer Song,\\" and \\"Don't Forget About Me\\" from the album in her solo television debut on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on October 17, 2018.  2019-present: Factory Baby  On May 15, 2019, Noname announced that her upcoming second studio album would be titled Factory Baby. Noname also formed trio Ghetto Sage, with Smino and Saba. In November 2019, Noname announced she was considering quitting music and expressed frustration with her predominantly white audience. She went on to say that the demographics of her fanbase made her want to quit music: \\"I refuse to keep making music and putting it online for free for people who won‚Äôt support me. If y'all don't wanna leave the crib I feel it. I don't want to dance on a stage for white people.\\" In 2020, she reiterated that her music career was on pause to focus on education and her book club. On June 18, 2020, two days after J. Cole had seemingly criticized her activism in his song \\"Snow on tha Bluff\\", Noname released the Madlib- produced \\"Song 33\\", in which she alluded to Cole and reflected on violence against black women, mainly the death of 19-year-old Black Lives Matter activist Oluwatoyin Salau. She later took down the song and expressed regret at responding to Cole, stating that although she had tried to bring the attention back to issues she cared about, she ultimately felt it created further distraction. On August 7, 2020, Noname appeared on a remix to Anderson Paak's \\"Lockdown\\", along with JID and Jay Rock. == Noname Book Club == In July 2019, Noname created a book club. She came up with the idea after a fan commented on Twitter that they were reading the same book as her, Jackson Rising, about Cooperation Jackson. The book club encourages support of locally owned bookstores, with her website providing a director of bookstores owned by people of color. Noname described the book club as a ‚Äúa little bit of a fuck you to Amazon, and kind of a fuck you to the FBI,\\" referencing how FBI's COINTELPRO program had targeted Black independent booksellers. The book club chooses two books a month, with the first two books chosen being Pedagogy of the Oppressed by Paulo Freire and We Are Never Meeting in Real Life by Samantha Irby. Celebrities sometimes choose the book club selection, including Kehlani (choosing Parable of the Sower by Octavia E. Butler) and Earl Sweatshirt (choosing Faces & Masks (Memory of Fire, Vol. 2) by Eduardo Galeano). The book club has partnerships with libraries in Oakland, Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, where the library promote and help readers find the chosen books. In January 2020, Noname created \\"Library Card Registration Day\\" asking people to go to their local libraries on January 11 and register for a library card. The day was described by Noname as \\"basically an 'F you' to major corporations who have privatized the way we consume goods and services,\\" specifically referencing how her mother's bookstore had closed due to Amazon. Noname also called for her followers to end their subscriptions with Amazon, tweeting that Amazon had \\"created a consumer model that is extremely addictive and removes human compassion. We don‚Äôt think about the workers who are underpaid and exploited. We just want our next-day delivery.\\" == Influences == Musically and stylistically, Noname has credited musicians Avril Lavigne, Nina Simone, Andr√© 3000, Kanye West, and Missy Elliott as her influences. She cites the author Toni Morrison and poet Patricia Smith as notable influences on her writing style. ==Discography== Studio albums { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center;\\" + List of studio albums, with selected details ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:19em;\\"  Album details - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Room 25  * Released: September 14, 2018 * Label: Self-released * Format: Digital download - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Factory Baby  * Released: 2020 * Label: Self-released * Format: Digital download } Mixtape { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:19em;\\"  Album details - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Telefone  * Released: July 31, 2016 * Label: Self-released * Format: Digital download, vinyl } Singles { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Song 31\\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/song-31-feat-phoelix- single/1448279189  rowspan=\\"3\\" 2019 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Song 32\\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/song-32-single/1458433570 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"H√§agen Dazs\\"https://www.complex.com/music/2019/10/ghetto-sage- noname-saba-smino-haagen-dazs - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Song 33\\"  2020 } Guest appearances { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center;\\" + List of non- single guest appearances, with other performing artists, showing year released and album name ! ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\"  Artist(s) ! scope=\\"col\\"  Album - ! ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"The Truth\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\"  2013  Mick Jenkins  Trees & Truths - ! ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Lost\\"  Chance the Rapper  Acid Rap - ! ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Touchdown\\"  John Walt  Get Happy 2.0 - ! ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"All Love\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\"  2014  C-Sick, Taylor Bennett, Nick Astro  La Collection - ! ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Comfortable\\"  Mick Jenkins  The Water[s] - ! ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Future Plans Pt.

His father inherited the earldom after the death of his uncle, William Hay, 6th Earl of Erroll, who died leaving only a baby girl, Jean Hay. The Peerage of Scotland is unique in that it allows the titles to descend along the female line. Jean could have conceivably inherited the earldom as Countess of Erroll. Instead, the crown negotiated for George to inherit, with the condition that he pay 4,000 merks to the sixth earl's widow, Helen, Dowager Countess of Erroll, and that one of his sons marry Jean Hay \\"at the King‚Äôs pleasure.\\"Wormald, Jenny, Lords and Men in Scotland, John Donald (1985), 406.

Sir James Balfour Paul writes that documents show King James VI and I frequently getting involved in the Earl of Erroll's family affairs and Erroll's clear displeasure with his interference. #Alexander Hay, deaf-mute, was set aside in the succession. In 1582, King James nominated Dundee surgeon William Duncan to accompany Alexander to France to seek medical assistance.

They had three children: #George Hay, father of John Hay, 12th Earl of Erroll #William Hay #Lady Margaret Hay, died unmarried The eighth earl also had an illegitimate daughter Agnes, who married Patrick Bruce of Fingask. His second wife, Lady Agnes survived him. In September 1587 she complained to the Privy Council about Colin Campbell of Glen Lyon, who came with a force of 100 men to her house of Inchestuill and assaulted her. Later, she married Alexander Gordon of Strathdoun, a son of George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1585-1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 213, 699.

This album featured Bing singing patriotic songs such as: \\"Ballad for Americans\\", \\"God Bless America\\" and \\"The Star- Spangled Banner\\". The songs were later presented in a 33 1/3 rpm split set with The Man Without a Country. == Background to \\"Ballad for Americans\\" recording == Crosby did not approach the project lightly. He studied the work before the session, and his concentration in the studio was intense. Usually, Crosby would record up to five tunes in two hours or so, rarely taking more than two takes, but with \\"Ballad for Americans\\", he devoted an hour to each of the four segments. New York Post critic Michael Levin wrote: :This is the finest recorded performance Bing had done to date and shows that in the last few years he has gone beyond binging and has really learned how to sing. Levin made a comparison with Paul Robeson‚Äôs Victor set that would have pleased Decca chief Jack Kapp‚Äôs team: :For all of Robeson‚Äôs magnificent voice, we prefer the Crosby version. The recording is better, the orchestration is better, and the chorus is better trained. == Track listing == These previously issued songs were featured on a 3-disc, 78 rpm album set, Decca Album No. DA-453. { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"width: 100%; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #FCFDFF; border-collapse: collapse;\\" -bgcolor=#D3D3D4  Side / Title  Writer(s)  Recording date  Performed with  Time - bgcolor=#F2F0E6  colspan=5Disc 1 (23579): -  A. \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\"  Francis Scott Key, John Stafford Smith  March 22, 1939  John Scott Trotter and His Orchestra and Max Terr's Mixed Chorus  2:46 -  B. \\"God Bless America\\"  Irving Berlin  March 22, 1939  John Scott Trotter and His Orchestra and Max Terr's Mixed Chorus  3:12 - bgcolor=#F2F0E6  colspan=5Disc 2 (23580): -  A. \\"Ballad for Americans ‚Äì Part One\\"  John La Touche, Earl Robinson  July 6, 1940  The Ken Darby Singers and Victor Young's Decca Concert Orchestra  2:26 -  B. \\"Ballad for Americans ‚Äì Part Four\\"  John La Touche, Earl Robinson  July 6, 1940  The Ken Darby Singers and Victor Young's Decca Concert Orchestra  2:16 - bgcolor=#F2F0E6  colspan=5Disc 3 (23581): -  A. \\"Ballad for Americans ‚Äì Part Two\\"  John La Touche, Earl Robinson  July 6, 1940  The Ken Darby Singers and Victor Young's Decca Concert Orchestra  2:24 -  B. \\"Ballad for Americans ‚Äì Part Three\\"  John La Touche, Earl Robinson  July 6, 1940  The Ken Darby Singers and Victor Young's Decca Concert Orchestra  3:06 } == Other releases == The album with all of the same selections was transferred to a Dual 10\\" LP along with The Man Without a Country 78 rpm set in 1950 with the catalogue number DL 8020. == References == Category:Bing Crosby compilation albums Category:1946 compilation albums Category:Decca Records compilation albums ","title":"What We So Proudly Hail"},{"id":"46345440","text":"Sung-ho Choi is a Korean-American mixed media artist.

It grows in woodland and dense heath in clay loam and sandy clay, sometimes on the edge of saltpans. ==Conservation status== This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. ==References== acutifolia Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Plants described in 1867 Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia ","title":"Melaleuca acutifolia"},{"id":"46345734","text":"Christopher Szygiel (born August 23, 1987), better known by his handle PC Chris, is a former American professional Super Smash Bros. Melee player. PC Chris gained national attention after defeating \\"The King of Smash\\" Ken at MLG New York 2006. PC Chris received television coverage on the MTV reality television episode True Life: \\"I'm A Professional Gamer\\" and was documented in an episode of the 2013 documentary series The Smash Brothers. The handle PC Chris comes from his hometown of Port Chester, New York. PC Chris formerly held a title for having the largest prize check in a Melee tournament winning $10K at MLG Las Vegas 2006. PC Chris held the title for about 9 years until Adam \\"Armada\\" Lindgren won EVO 2015, earning $11,214. ==Career== MLG 2006 PC Chris started his MLG career by winning MLG New York Opener 2006, the first tournament in the MLG 2006 Pro Circuit, defeating Ken twice. However, at MLG Dallas 2006, he lost to Ken in winners' finals and then to \\"ChuDat\\" in losers' finals, placing 3rd. At MLG Anaheim 2006, he lost to ChuDat again in winners' semis, then defeated \\"KoreanDJ\\", \\"Isai\\", and ChuDat in losers' bracket, and won the first set of grand finals against Ken, but still lost the second set, placing 2nd. He lost to ChuDat and \\"Azen\\" at MLG Chicago 2006, placing 5th. PC Chris also won MELEE-FC6, defeating Mew2King in two consecutive sets during grand finals. MLG Orlando 2006 proved to be his worst tournament in the season, as he lost to Azen and then to \\"HugS\\" early in losers' bracket, finishing at a disappointing 13th place. Despite this, his placement of 2nd at MLG New York Playoffs 2006, where he defeated ChuDat twice but lost to Azen twice, allowed him to qualify for the MLG 2006 championship. PC Chris eventually managed to win MLG Las Vegas 2006 and take the MLG 2006 championship, defeating Azen, Isai, and KoreanDJ twice. In 2007, PC Chris placed 4th at Cataclysm 3, losing to Mew2King and KoreanDJ, 3rd at MLG Long Island 2007, losing to Mew2King twice, 5th at Pound 2, losing to ChuDat and Mew2King, and 2nd at MELEE-FC Diamond, losing to Mew2King in two sets of grand finals. He did, however, win Zero Challenge 3, sweeping through losers' bracket and defeating Mew2King in two sets of grand finals after losing to Mew2King in winners' quarters. Evo 2007 and retirement PC Chris qualified for the EVO 2007 championship by placing 3rd at EVO East 2007 and 2nd at EVO West 2007. He eventually placed 4th at EVO World 2007. PC Chris's final three top performances were 5th at Viva La Smashtaclysm, losing to Azen and Mew2King, 3rd at Pound 3, losing to Mew2King and MaNg0, and 4th at Revival of Melee, losing to MaNg0 and \\"DaShizWiz\\". PC Chris spent years in a semi- retired state; while he still participated in several national tournaments and usually made it into the bracket, his results were not nearly as notable as they once were. PC Chris explains his semi-retirement due to having to focus on a full-time job. After his retirement, PC still did play in a number of tournaments, including the national Apex 2012. Return On January 9, 2015, PC Chris posted a Tweet announcing his return to competitive Melee play. Shortly after, he attended Neo Nebulous Beta 2, where he placed 13th, and then made it into the pro bracket in the 2nd seed of his pool at Super Nebulous 2 on January 24, 2015. He lost to Ice first round, but was able to take Game 1, much to the shock of many. He then defeated Eikelmann in loser's before being defeated by Lord HDL 2-0 to get 17th. PC Chris attended Apex 2015, where he nearly made bracket, placing 49th of 1,037 competitors. In it, he placed 2nd in his 1st round pool, losing only to Fuzzyness, a top-level European smasher. In 2nd round pools, he defeated players including Velocity and ROFL, and even had a close set with Kalamazhu, zero to death comboing him in the opening of Game 1. It went down to the last life Game 3, but PC Chris was eventually defeated, getting a huge cheer from the crowd on his exit. He later fought Ken in the Salty Suite, where he lost the first game as Fox but switched to Falco starting with game 2. The match went to Game 5 last life, but PC Chris won it out 3-2 without getting hit on his last life. He was unable to attend EVO 2015. ==Notable tournament placings== { style=\\"text- align:center\\" - !Tournament!!Date!!1v1 placement!!2v2 placement!!Partner - MLG DC 2005January 2930, 200517th5thHusband - Gettin' Schooled 2June 2526, 20055th6thEve - MELEE-FC3July 1012, 200513th4thChillin - BOMB 4November 12, 20057th5thUnknown - MLG New York 2005February 2526, 20053rd---- - MLG New York Opener 2006April 2123, 20061st2ndWes - MLG Dallas 2006May 1920, 20063rd---- - MLG Anaheim 2006June 2324, 20062nd9thKaiser - MELEE-FC6July 1315, 20061st---- - MLG Chicago 2006July 2122, 20065th5thThe King - Zero Challenge 2August 1517, 20069th---- - MLG Orlando 2006August 2627, 200613th7thKillaOR - MLG New York Playoffs 2006October 1314, 20062nd5thWes - MLG Las Vegas 2006November 1819, 20061st7thWes - Cataclysm 3March 34, 20074th7thMilktea - MLG Long Island 2007May 56, 20073rd5thOneAndOnly Kip - EVO East 2007May 2527, 20072nd---- - Pound 2June 1617, 20075th1stMew2King - MELEE-FC DiamondJuly 1214, 20072nd1stCort - Zero Challenge 3July 2022nd, 20071st5thMilktea - EVO West 2007July 2729, 20072nd---- - EVO World 2007August 2426, 20074th---- - Super Champ ComboSeptember 2930, 20072nd2ndCort - Viva La SmashtaclysmNovember 1011, 20075th4thCort - Pound 3February 23rd, 20083rd3rdCort - Revival of MeleeMarch 78, 20094th1stMango - Pound 4January 1618, 201017th49thKiwi - Apex 2010August 68, 201033rd25thMofo - Apex 2012January 68, 201249th9thOTG - Zenith 2012May 2627, 20129th4thOTG - Apex 2015January 30February 1, 201549th57thDoH - MVG SandstormApril 18‚Äì19, 201513th ‚Äî  ‚Äî } ==Personal life== PC Chris believed Super Smash Bros. for Wii U had potential to be a great competitive game.

It was also released as a single. ==Lyrics and music== The theme of \\"Gypsy\\" is a familiar one to Morrison. As with \\"Caravan\\" and other songs, the song extols the archetype of the wandering gypsy who has the freedom to move around but on the other hand lacks a secure place to settle down. Music critic Steve Sparacio said that it \\"conjures visions of a caravan with camping camp-fires bright and dancers dancing.\\" \\"Gypsy\\" uses a ballad form. The music has a Middle Eastern feel. The rhythm alternates between double-time and triple time. Rolling Stone Magazine critic Stephen Holden describes these rhythms as \\"driving and excited\\" and describes the guitar textures as \\"exotic.\\" The instrumentation also includes saxophone and piano. Irish Times critic Stewart Parker suggested that the chord progressions of \\"Gypsy\\" resemble those of \\"The House of the Rising Sun.\\" ==Reception== Santa Fe New Mexican critic Anne Hillerman considered \\"Gypsy\\" to be \\"better than anything [Morrison had] written before.\\" According to Holden, \\"Gypsy\\" \\"demonstrates that Van is precisely a musical gypsy ‚Äî cryptic, sensual, and shrewd ‚Äî a master at casting spells and at leading us through whatever territory he feels like exploring.\\" Music critic Johnny Rogan stated that \\"Gypsy\\" is a \\"reasonable attempt to recapture the excellence of 'Caravan.'\\" Billboard said of the song that \\"dark tonal texture combines with an infectious, hard -driving beat, for an eerie anthem to the joys of mobile living.\\" Music critic Dink Lorance praised Morrison's vocal performance as well as the saxophone playing. Austin American critic Joe Gracey says that the \\"lye lye lye\\" refrain could have made the song trite, but since \\"Gypsy\\" is unpretentious it is not disappointing. The single just missed the Billboard Hot 100, topping the Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart at #101. ==References * Category:Van Morrison songs Category:Songs written by Van Morrison Category:1972 songs Category:1973 singles Category:Song recordings produced by Ted Templeman Category:Warner Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Van Morrison ","title":"Gypsy (Van Morrison song)"},{"id":"46345784","text":"Neva Goodwin Rockefeller (born June 1, 1944) is co-director of the Global Development And Environment Institute (GDAE) at Tufts University, where she is a research associate at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and director of the Social Science Library: Frontier Thinking in Sustainable Development and Human Well-Being. Goodwin works towards a contextual economics theory that will have more relevance to contemporary real-world social and ecological concerns than does the dominant economic paradigm.

The original game centers around Neptune, one of four goddesses who adventures in a world where she can recruit other characters to form a party. Some of the supporting characters are playable depending on the title and also whether it is a remake or an option as downloadable content. Some characters also start as antagonists, and there are a regular set of villains. Most characters are based on and named after the video game consoles, video game developer companies or publishers. The characters have been commented on by game reviewers who had mixed feelings about their designs, personalities and voice acting. ==Conception and development== Naoko Mizuno, the creator of the Hyperdimension Neptunia series described the origins of the game and its characters: \\"First and foremost, I realized there were no games on the market that actually dealt with or parodied the game industry itself. The second thing is that, at the time, characters that changed‚Äîthat took on different forms‚Äîwere really popular, but there were none that were cute girls.\\" She developed Neptune as a parody of the game industry with the fictional scenario where Sega was still attempting to reach the top of the console business. In looking back at the games, Mizuno said that she would have like to have had the characters fully voiced, but that the editing in of new scenes and content made that impossible. Executive producer Norihisa Kochiwa said that character designer Tsunako had developed some designs but had run into complications. The company considered partnering with another company but it did not work out. At the end of 2009, Tsunako had changed up the character designs and color scheme so they fit within the world's setting. Kochiwa said \\"Had that collaboration been realized then Neptunia would have never been born.\\" Director Shingo Onodera said that \\"the game was originally supposed to be about 3 princess sisters and a main character. I came in right around when that project was halted and turned into Neptunia.\\" Mizuno created a new group of main characters for Mk2 in response to the moe subculture trend, especially the concept of the younger sister. \\"The younger sister characters, like Nepgear, are still inexperienced, immature, and not fully grown compared to their older sisters. One of the reasons behind creating such heroines was that I wanted to depict the younger sisters‚Äô adorable efforts to grow strong and mature enough to save their older sisters and Gamindustri.\\" She also noted there are no male main characters in the series: \\"I say this because I know; I'm a woman myself. It's so much fun to have private girl talks and have some girl time without boys around.\\" The character design was done by Tsunako, with another designer named Minamitsu joining the team starting with Victory. Minamitsu had been working on some other otome games, but regards Victory as her first major title. Kochiwa has remarked that working on Neptunia not only from the art and game system aspects, has affected Compile Heart's other titles. Tsunako said Victory was a turning point for the franchise as it helped solidify the relationships among the sisters. The anime adaptation contributed to the Neptunia character design and development as it presented the characters from a different perspective. Tsunako said \\"the animators did a great job so as a designer I feel like I was able to learn from them as well.\\" Onodera said \\"Being able to observe and learn how people from a different industry handled things like direction, script-writing, building tension, plus visualizing characters and their personalities helped me to see what was lacking in the original Neptunia.\\" Onodera also credits the anime and Mk2 for inspiring them to do the Re;Birth versions. In deciding what maker characters to include, the team worked with Compile Heart and their relations with other companies. The inclusion of Tekken allowed for more characters to cross over from other franchises such as Millionaire Arthur and God Eater. ==Main protagonists== The main protagonists are goddesses that represent consoles or portable hardware brands in the video game industry. Their normal interacting form is that of a girl, but during combat, they can transform into a more powerful \\"HDD Mode\\" of themselves. Four CPUs The Console Patron Unit (CPU) is a goddess character in the world of Gamindustri, each of whom is named after a video game system and is charge of a domain. Director Shingo Onodera said that in creating the scenario for the first game, the three goddesses had lacked something in their personalities so they gave each of them a gimmick. ; Purple Heart : : The primary playable character in most of the video game titles in the franchise, Neptune is the goddess of Planeptune, and is named after and represents the cancelled Sega Neptune. She has short purple hair, purple eyes, and cross-shaped hair clips that resemble the directional keypad of the console controller. In her NIS America profile, she is described as energetic and optimistic, but \\"tends to drag others into her problems without realizing it.\\" However, her personality changes once she transforms into Purple Heart, taking on a much more serious and mature character with long purple hair styled in two braids, blue eyes, and a black one-piece swimsuit. In Mk2 her youthful appearance and personality in contrast to her younger sister Nepgear have strangers confusing her as the little sister. : In the first game, she is banished to the mortal world and loses her memory, and thus assembles a team of girls to fight monsters in Gamindustri. In Mk2 (and Re;Birth2), she is a supporting character who is held captive in the Gameindustri Graveyard while the player assumes her sister Nepgear's role in rescuing her. She returns to being the starter playable character in Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory where she is sent to the alternate V dimension. In MegaTagmension Blanc, she and Blanc collaborate in making a zombie film. In Neptune vs Sega Hard Girls, she is at war with Saturn (from Sega Hard Girls) when the history suddenly changes and her spirit then possesses IF's motorcycle. : Neptunia creator Mizuno said that Neptune is her favorite character from the series because she is \\"energetic and bright to the point of idiocy\\". Mizuno also liked her jumping action catchphrase \\"Like a kangaroo!\\" from the Victory title. ; Black Heart : :The goddess of Lastation, she represents the PlayStation 3. She has red eyes and long black hair styled in twin tails. According to game director Shingo Onodera, Noire's original color scheme was red, but was then changed to black. Her NIS America profile describes her as hardworking, polite, an \\"ideal goddess\\", but that she tries too hard sometimes, \\"cares a lot about what others think of her and seems to harbor many secrets about herself.\\" Director Shingo Onodera said that Noire was given a gimmick of being a cosplayer. Onodera also noted Noire's remark to herself of not having any friends to form a band had resulted in being painted as the friendless character. As her transformed character Black Heart, she has long white hair, blue eyes, and a black suit. In the original game, she does not get involved in the story until the end of the game, however, in Re;Birth1 she becomes a playable character. She is described as competitive, tough, and aggressive towards Neptune, and is sometimes involved as an opponent to the party in the game. In Mk2 she is described as righteous but not the most flexible person, and a bit of a tsundere towards her sister Uni. In Victory, she appears in the V dimension, but has not become a CPU. She also has a friend named Plutia. In her transformed state though, she likes her newfound freedom and acts troublesome and uninhibited.: Within the \\"V dimension\\" of Victory, her appearance resembles of the original PlayStation. : In 2011, Noire won Compile Heart's Neptunia character popularity poll, and became the starring character of a spin-off game. In Hyperdevotion Noire: Goddess Black Heart, she and the other goddesses are presented in chibi style and interact with new characters in a world called Gamarket. ; White Heart : :The goddess of Lowee, she represents the Wii. She has short, light brown hair, and is described as shy and bottles her emotions, occasionally leading to violent outbursts. According to game director Shingo Onodera, Blanc's original color scheme was blue, and was then changed to white. As White Heart, she has long light blue hair in long sideburns, and a white suit. In that form, she is also quiet and inexpressive. Onodera gave Blanc a hobby of being an avid reader. Onodera had planned for Blanc to be the lonely character but reception to Noire's remark to herself about not having friends changed that direction. In the first game, she dislikes Neptune, and she does not get involved in the story until the end of the game, however, in Re;Birth1 she becomes a playable character. In Victory, Blanc appears in the alternate V dimension where she still has the same personality, and is still a CPU of Lowee, concerned about the developing nations of Lastation and Planeptune. However, her White Heart persona is angry and impulsive. : In 2014, Blanc was the winner of the second Neptunia character popularity poll. She is the starring character of MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies.http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2015-07-16/gekijigen-tag- blanc-neptunia-vs-zombie-gundan-game-october-15-release-listed/.90505 In that title, she and Neptune are making a zombie movie. ; Green Heart : :The goddess of Leanbox, she represents the Xbox. In her human form, she has long blond hair, blue eyes, and a quiet, feminine personality. She is popular among her people, but is a hardcore gamer whose playing sometimes interferes with her duties. As Green Heart, she has long, light green hair styled in a ponytail, soft speech, and a laid-back attitude. In the first game, she considers Neptune her nemesis. In the original game, she does not get involved in the story until the end of the game, however, in Re;Birth1 she becomes a playable character. In Mk2 it is revealed she does not have a younger sister, and acts more maternal around the other CPUs. In Victory, she appears in the alternate V dimension, where she tries to invade the other continents while they are fighting each other. She is also more proud of her breast size. Her transformation persona Green Heart in this title is more mature than her character in the other games. CPU Candidates Each of the nations in Hyperdimension Neptunia Mk2 has representatives of the goddesses called CPU Candidates, which turn out to be their younger sisters. Their item counterparts are portable handhelds in contrast to the home console references of the goddesses. Of the goddesses, Vert does not have a younger sister, while Blanc has twin younger sisters. ; Purple Sister : : The main character in Hyperdimension Neptunia Mk2, she is the younger sister of Neptune.

In Mk2, IF and Compa free Nepgear and they form the main adventuring party to rescue her sister from the Gameindustri Graveyard and save the world from the ASIC organization. : In Victory she follows her sister Neptune to the V dimension, but as she is not the main character anymore, she feels like she is a punching bag and put down by the others.

Heidi Kemps of GamesRadar wrote that the main characters \\"come from the school of modern moe\\" and that the secondary characters were \\"just presented as generic blank silhouettes.\\" Kallie Plagge of IGN, in reviewing Re;Birth1, found the game missed chances to use their characters to satirize the game industry and that the characters would repeatedly point out each other's obvious attributes such as tsundere. In reviewing Mk2, Matthew Bennett, associate editor of Electronic Gaming Monthly critiqued Nepgear's character \\"Instead of four powerful and beautiful heroines we‚Äôre left with one pre-pubescent girl who‚Äôs suffering from a severe case of schizophrenia, never quite sure if she‚Äôs saving the world, or writing a Dear Diary entry.\\" and also the characters' 3D modeling, which \\"on paper sounds like a fantastic upgrade, but though offering more emotion, just look out of place against the 2D backgrounds.\\" Idea Factory business developer Damien Urvois, in promoting the Re;Birth version of Neptunia said that \\"Nowadays, the demand for mo√© is quite high overseas, so, we must quickly release the main titles.\\" Executive producer Norihisa Kochiwa said \\"I think the reason why the series has lasted so long and is loved so much is due to the characters.\\" ==NotesReferences * Hyperdimension Neptunia characters at Giantbomb Category:Hyperdimension Neptunia Hyperdimension Neptunia Hyperdimension Neptunia ","title":"List of Hyperdimension Neptunia characters"},{"id":"46345805","text":"1945 US edition (publ.

Contemporary reviewers compared the novel to the work of Henry James, though the book's feminism was then considered unfashionable.Susan Janet Kaplan, 'Rosamond Lehmann's The Ballad and the Source: A Confrontation with \\"The Great Mother\\"', Twentieth Century Literature, Vol. 27, No. 2 (Summer 1981), pp.127-145 Lehmann returned to the character of Rebecca in her last novel, A Sea-Grape Tree (1976), which follows her as an adult dealing with betrayal by a married lover. ==References * Review, Kirkus Reviews, April 2, 1945 Category:1944 British novels Category:English novels Category:William Collins, Sons books ","title":"The Ballad and the Source"},{"id":"46345817","text":"Kim Ho-sun (; born 9 March 1941) is a South Korean film director, producer, and screenwriter who has enjoyed both critical and box office success. ==Biography== Kim Ho-sun was born 9 March 1941 in South Hamgyong Province, now part of North Korea. He dropped out of Kyung Hee University and made his directorial debut in 1974 with Hwannyeo. A member of the so-called \\"Visual Age\\" of Korean directors, Kim made some of the bestselling Korean films of the 1970s. The local Korean cinema industry in the 1970s had to face the challenges of foreign imports, increased television ownership, and the stifling censorship of the military dictatorship of Park Chung-hee. Kim began his directing career making what are known as \\"hostess films,\\" one of the few genres that the censors allowed some latitude to, these were melodramas that portrayed the lives of bargirls and their milieu. Kim showed that despite the formulaic restrictions the censors placed on filmmaking, locally made films could still be individual and sell well, and in doing so inspired his fellow filmmakers. In terms of tickets sold, Winter Woman that he directed in 1977 was the bestselling domestic film of the 1970s, and would hold the record until General's Son in 1990. Since 2007, Kim has been a senior advisor to the Korea Film Directors' Society (KFDS). ==Filmography== {  - ! Year ! English Title ! Hangul ! Romanization !

The focus is upon Indigenous women being empowered in the context of Indigenous cultural values and priorities, rather than mainstream, white, patriarchal ones. In this cultural perspective, it can be compared to womanism in the African-American communities. Indigenous communities are diverse, with some women holding considerable power within their tribal nations, and many others living in patriarchal communities. Women who hold power at home have differing goals from those who are still struggling for basic human rights on the home front. Modern Indigenous feminism has developed as a community and analyses out of a need to prioritize the issues faced by Indigenous women. Surviving generations of ongoing genocide, colonisation, and racism have resulted in differing priorities for Indigenous women. Mainstream feminists have often been unwilling to prioritize issues which are urgent crises in Indigenous communities. For example, the Missing and murdered Indigenous women epidemic, forced sterilization of Indigenous women, the struggle for land rights, and the disproportionate sexual victimization of Native American women (MMIW), specifically as targets of white men. Indigenous feminism is related to postcolonial feminism as it acknowledges the devastating consequences of colonisation on Indigenous peoples and the lands they inhabit, and the importance of decolonisation in dismantling oppressive systems that were introduced as a result of colonisation. The central role of the ancestral landbase, and current land rights and environmental struggles, connect Indigenous feminism to some aspects of ecofeminism. Differentiating indigenous feminism from mainstream white feminism and its related forms of feminism (including liberal feminism and Orientalist feminism) is important because \\"indigenous women will have different concrete experiences that shape our relation to core themes\\" than those of non-indigenous women. Indigenous feminism is also known by other, geographically specific, names such as: Native American feminism in the United States, First Nations feminism in Canada, Aboriginal or Indigenous Australian feminism in Australia. Despite the use of the more globally-applicable word \\"indigenous\\", the majority of text that refers to \\"Indigenous feminism\\" tends to focus on North American indigenous populations (Native American, First Nations, Inuit and M√©tis). == Effects of colonisation == In most Indigenous communities, it is colonisation and Christianity that has brought about the most profound and harmful changes in the standing and treatment of women. Through colonisation, Indigenous people became subject to a racist patriarchal system that significantly shifted the social, economic, and cultural practices of pre-contact Indigenous societies. The economic, political, and spiritual power granted to women in Indigenous communities was threatening to the arriving Europeans who used \\"Xenophobia and a deep fear of Native spiritual practices\\" to justify genocide as a means of domination. Additionally, \\"while women's traditional roles in Indigenous communities vary widely, colonization has reordered gender relations to subordinate women, regardless of their pre- contact status.\\" Colonization worked to restructure Indigenous social systems to fit within the white settler ideal. The struggles faced by Indigenous people today are due to the actions taken by settlers to assert dominance through colonization. White settlers often brought a new type of economic system from their European nation that included the idea of private property, ownership, and gendered labor, which was forced onto Indigenous communities. In A Recognition of Being: Reconstructing Native Womanhood, Anderson notes, \\"the split between public and private labour and the introduction of the capitalist economies disrupted the traditional economic authorities of Native women.\\" Poverty is a problem for many Indigenous people, and can be traced back to the artificially enforced economic ideals of the colonizer onto Indigenous groups. In order to strip women of political power, colonizers forced regulatory systems onto Indigenous people, the Indian Act of Canada is one example of this. This act defined women's status as inferior to men's. Indigenous identity and status were now determined based on a patrilineal blood line, which cost women much of their social and political power. The political and spiritual power of women are often connected, as the spiritual or theoretical role for women can inform a real political role. As a result, \\"heteropatriarchal religious traditions have excluded women and two-spirited peoples from leadership roles.\\" The combination of loss of power from the economic, political, and spiritual leadership places Indigenous people at a heightened risk of violence. The overall argument about the effects of colonialism \\"isn't just that we are being colonized, but [also] that we are assuming that nation-state form of governance is the best way to govern the world.\\" == Theory and scholarship == Indigenous feminism seeks to build on traditional models while also incorporating modern, intersectional feminist ideas. Indigenous feminism diverges from postcolonial feminism, as some have argued that postcolonial theory in general has largely ignored the histories of colonialism as it exists for Indigenous populations. Some other Indigenous scholars (such as Robert Warrior, Elizabeth Cook-Lynn, Craig S. Womack) have expressed concern over the limits of postcolonial theory and its application to Indigenous studies. There is often distrust of Western theoretical paradigms which can marginalize Indigenous perspectives. In \\"Who Stole Native American Studies?\\" Elizabeth Cook-Lynn discusses the significant debate about what constitutes post-colonial, and who gets the privilege of naming when a society becomes post-colonial. As a result, many have moved to Indigenous feminism as a way to redress these issues with postcolonial feminism. The development of modern Indigenous feminism came out of a counterinsurgency against the attempt to apply western feminism equally and effectively to all women regardless of their experiences. Such attempts are seen as fruitless because it homogenized the very diverse experiences of women and Indigenous people. Building off of the theory of intersectionality from Kimberle Crenshaw, Indigenous feminist theory seeks to reverse the ways that White feminism \\"conflates or ignores intragroup differences.\\" Cheryl Suzack and Shari M. Huhndorf argue in Indigenous Women and Feminism: Politics, Activism and Culture that: \\"Although Indigenous feminism is a nascent field of scholarly inquiry, it has arisen from histories of women's activism and culture that have aimed to combat gender discrimination, secure social justice for Indigenous women, and counter their social erasure and marginalization ‚Äì endeavors that fall arguably under the rubric of feminism, despite Indigenous women's fraught relationship with the term and with mainstream feminist movements.\\" It is important to note that the urgent issues to address Indigenous feminism cross the boundary between what is considered feminist and what is considered indigenous. Much of Indigenous feminism has taken shape around issues that resulted from colonial practices. Indigenous feminism is a direct result of, and a direct answer to the colonization and continued oppression of Indigenous peoples around the world. The need to question cultural practices from within allows Indigenous women to actively shape their own communities and helps encourage self-determination and cultural ownership. Differentiating Indigenous feminism from white feminism illuminates the ways that white feminism does not fully account for Indigenous experiences. Similarly, Indigenous feminism is set apart from other Indigenous rights movements, such as Indigenous liberation theory, because those theories have \\"not been attentive to the gendered ways in which colonial oppression and racism function for men and women, or to the inherent and adopted sexisms that some communities manifest.\\" There are some within Indigenous communities who choose not to identify as feminist and therefore distance themselves from the mainstream feminism. There are many reasons for this choice, however, Kim Anderson argues that if > Western feminism is unpalatable because it is about rights rather than > responsibilities, then we should all take responsibility seriously and ask > if we are being responsible to all members of our societies. If we are to > reject equality in favour of difference, then we need to make sure those > differences are embedded in systems that empower all members. If we see > feminism as being too invested in Western liberalism and individual > autonomy, then we need to ensure that our collectivist approaches serve > everyone in the collective. And if we want to embrace essential elements of > womanhood that have been problematic for Western feminists ... then we have > to ensure that these concepts don't get stuck in literal or patriarchal > interpretations. Many scholars and activists identify Indigenous feminism as relating to radical feminism since it often advocates for an upheaval of all systems of power that organize the subjugation of Indigenous women based on both male supremacy and racial difference. Indigenous Feminism encourages participation in decolonization needed from both men and women. Myrna Cunningham (Miskita) has stated that: \\"The struggle of Indigenous Peoples is not a threat to our struggles as Indigenous women. On the contrary, we see these struggles as reciprocal.\\" Decolonization is seen as the ultimate tool to combat subordination of Indigenous people. == Critique of white feminism == Indigenous feminists are often reluctant to engage with western mainstream feminist theory due to its failure to recognize the effects of the gendered process of colonialism on indigenous women, as well as a historical pattern of white women not understanding, or not being willing to be allies against, the multiple oppressions faced by Indigenous women. Mainstream feminists usually assume that fighting oppression on the basis of sex or gender is the top (or even sole) priority, while indigeneity is of secondary importance. Moreton- Robinson has written that white feminists \\"are extraordinarily reluctant to see themselves in the situation of being oppressors, as they feel that this will be at the expense of concentrating upon being oppressed.\\" This focus on putting white women's needs before those of Indigenous women has historical roots, and can make Indigenous feminists weary of homogenizing the supposed goals and rights of \\"women\\". All Indigenous women share the common experience of oppression resulting from colonialism; this is an oppression which they share with all other Indigenous peoples. The perspective of Indigenous women is therefore shaped by their historical connection to their landbase, a legacy of dispossession, racism, and sexism, continuing their activism within at times matriarchal contexts, as well as negotiating sexual politics across and within non-white cultures. White middle-class feminist women's relative privilege is tied to an often-unquestioned and unacknowledged legacy of benefiting from colonialism and the dispossession of Indigenous people. For Indigenous women, all white feminists have benefited from colonization, and continue to reap these benefits; white women are overwhelmingly and disproportionately represented, have key roles, and constitute the normal standard of womanhood within Australia and other colonial countries. According to Carrie Bourassa, the problem in addressing Indigenous feminist issues through this lens is that white mainstream feminism was itself infused with a narrative of colonialism. It has used indigeneity, racism, heteronormativity, and Christianity as tools to ‚Äúother‚Äù Indigenous people and justify a need to ‚Äúcivilize‚Äù them; as a result, there has been a lack of inclusion of Indigenous women's work in mainstream discourses. Typically, when white feminists have ‚Äòadvocated‚Äô or ‚Äòincluded‚Äô Indigenous women in their activism, it has been in a tokenistic sense; advocating primarily for their own benefit, and not for the collective benefit of all women, inclusive of the needs of Indigenous Australian women. It has been evident in many Indigenous feminist movements that ‚ÄúAboriginal (and other forms of Indigenous feminism) feminism is a theoretical engagement with history and politics, as well as a practical engagement with contemporary social, economic, cultural and political issues‚Äù. While Indigenous women may acknowledge that there is overlap in the goals of Indigenous feminists and mainstream feminists, many, like Celeste Liddle (Arrernte) \\"strongly believe that as Aboriginal women, whilst our fights are related to ongoing feminist struggles within other racially marginalized groups, they are not the same.\\" An argument made by Minnie Grey in her essay, From the Tundra to the Boardroom to Everywhere in Between, about mainstream feminism is how it often fails to look beyond the basics of female oppression based on sex and gender at other issues, such as class, education, and the effects of these forms of oppression on Indigenous men. > \\"We, as Inuit women, have been striving for such things as equal pay for > equal work, equal share of roles for the good of the family, equal rights to > participate in the decision-making processes of our governments, equal > rights for the hiring of women at all levels of commerce and science, equal > rights in education, and most importantly, equal rights to raise our > children in safe, healthy, and positive conditions. This means, among other > things, above the poverty line. I look at these aspirations not as women's > liberation, but as people's liberation. In fact, we need and love our men, > and similarly, we need to liberate them from the concepts that bind them to > unbreakable traditional roles that, in turn, keep the status quo intact in > many regions of the world.\\" One such example of the need to incorporate uniquely Indigenous perspectives is in the second wave's struggle for wage parity with their male counterparts. Celeste Liddle argues that \\"for example, whilst equal pay is important for all of us, for many years Aboriginal people were historically not paid for their labour at all.\\" Therefore, the second wave's fight for wage equality (among other issues), was perceived to push the rights of Indigenous women to the periphery. Another such example is in the length of time taken to achieve certain rights. For example, while white women deemed to be citizens of Canada were granted the right to vote in 1918, all other women were not allowed the right to vote until much later. Aboriginal women in Canada were not allowed to vote until the 1960s, at which time the second wave of feminism had moved away from such issues. Rauna Kuokkanen (Sami) has argued for a specifically Indigenous paradigm, as opposed to a feminist one because while \\"some feminist theories and practices also aim at social and political changes in a society...their approaches often exclude notions of collectivity as well as land rights which are central elements for Indigenous peoples.\\" Another criticism against mainstream feminism is presented by Cunningham: > \\"They see that the dominant feminist paradigm is based on an unacknowledged > model of centre and periphery. In this model, Indigenous, African- > descendent, and poor women occupy the periphery and must accept the ideas > and conceptualization of feminism as defined by those at the centre. In > other words, we Indigenous women are expected to accept the dominant picture > of what constitutes women's oppression and women's liberation. The trouble > is, this picture is only a partial match with our own experiences. Elements > of our experience that do not match this picture are denied or marginalized. > This dominant model tries to homogenize the women's movement, claiming that > all women have the same demands and the same access to the enjoyment of > their rights. This flawed assumption denies the diverse cultural, linguistic > and social needs and visions of distinct groups of women.\\" Indigenous Feminist scholars have resisted the co-optation and exploitation of their scholarship as another result of colonialism. As a collective, various Indigenous feminist scholars have called for \\"the profound need for transparency and responsibility in light of the traumatic histories of colonization, slavery, and genocide that shape the present\\" in order to ensure Indigenous feminism is informed by decolonization. == Criticism of Indigenous feminism == A criticism of Indigenous feminism among some western academics and pop culture writers is that Indigenous populations \\"choose to distance themselves from feminism\\". Feminism is viewed as unimportant by some indigenous women because the status of women in some of these societies was higher prior to colonization. That is to say, according to Hall, that to be \\"indigenous\\" is inherently \\"feminist.\\" But this critique itself relies on a definition of feminism (or \\"white feminism\\") as \\"colonial discourses relevant to western women only\\". Feminism as a whole is often generalized as a white American phenomenon, with multiple scholars and feminists arguing that white feminism insufficiently addresses the concerns of women of more diverse backgrounds. Indigenous Australian feminist Aileen Moreton-Robinson argues that all Indigenous women experience living in a society that casts them aside, which needs to be challenged through the practice of Indigenous feminism. While all feminism is meant to identify interconnected forms of oppression that affect all women, historically, racism along with non-Native ignorance of Native women's continued existence and particular struggles (such as the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women crisis) has continued to alienate Indigenous women who don't see mainstream feminism as welcoming them or addressing their most crucial concerns. A majority of the texts that are labeled as \\"Indigenous feminism\\" refer solely to the Indigenous populations of Native Americans in the United States and, to a lesser extent, to the First Nations peoples of Canada. This is often the case when \\"Indigenous feminists\\" themselves are referred to, such as Leanne Betasamosake Simpson and Leslie Marmon Silko. There are several forms of feminism that address indigenous populations and may follow similar theories, themes, and/or scholarships of Indigenous feminism, but do not directly identify as \\"Indigenous feminism\\". These forms of feminism can include Intersectional feminism, Transnational feminism, Postcolonial feminism, Native Hawaiian feminism, Feminism in India, and Asian feminism. These forms of feminism are often separated from one another, in both scholarship and activism, due to the slight differences in beliefs and focuses. Some have called for more unity among these groups, theories and approaches. == Activism == Resistance and activism against dominant colonial powers can come in a number of forms, including but not limited to: legal or political protest, healing practices, storytelling, or art activism. Missing and murdered Indigenous women (MMIW) The ongoing attempted genocide of Indigenous women is of utmost priority in Indigenous feminism, while in mainstream feminism this femicide is rarely prioritized, unless it is non-indigenous women being murdered. On October 4, and February 14, Indigenous feminists have for years encouraged the community to participate in vigils and actions for justice for these women and their families. \\"Sisters In Spirit\\" are one group organizing the vigils, in honour of the lives of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG). These vigils resulted in the Government of Canada launching a National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in September 2016. This inquiry examined and reported on the violence against Indigenous women and girls in Canada by looking at the patterns, underlying factors and ultimately, the systemic cause of the violence. While the progress of the inquiry was slowed and at times stifled by issues such as lack of clarity regarding testimony dates and limited staff and resources, it eventually reached the conclusion that there is an ongoing genocide against Indigenous women in North America. In the United States, the National Resource Center to Enhance Safety of Native Women and their Children (NIWRC) was created \\"to enhance the capacity of American Indian and Alaska Native (Native) tribes, Native Hawaiians, and Tribal and Native Hawaiian organizations to respond to domestic violence.\\" This organization also shares in Indigenous feminist themes by their dedication sovereignty and the safety of Indigenous women and children. Idle No More Idle No More is an Indigenous movement founded by three Indigenous women and one non-Native ally, with the intent to \\"shift the contemporary discourses of rights, sovereignty, and nationhood by arguing that it is Indigenous women who ought to hold the political power of Indigenous nations, or at the very least have an equal seat at the debate table.\\" Their major themes of activism include sovereignty, the resurgence of nationhood, environmental protection, and resistance of violence against Indigenous women. This work is being done through making changes to The Indian Act of Canada, a piece of legislation that restricts Indigenous sovereignty, as well as advocating for environmental protection. Their activism asks people, regardless of Indigenous descent or not, to honor Indigenous sovereignty and to protect the environment. Another Canadian organization that focuses and promotes Indigenous feminist ideals is the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC). They work to empower women by developing and changing legislation which affects Indigenous people. Indigenous Peoples' Day Working to change the name of \\"Christopher Columbus Day\\" to \\"Indigenous Peoples' Day\\" is an example of changing the narrative of Indigeneity in the United States. Advocates for this change believe that Columbus has been subject to \\"adoration\\", despite many negative aspects to him, including \\"his arrogance, his poor administration of his colonial ventures and his blinkered conscience, which was untroubled by the enslavement of Native Peoples, even when doing so went against the wishes of his royal backers.\\" This day joins other days of celebration of Indigenous populations, including Native American Heritage Month in the United States, Dia del Respeto a la Diversidad Cultural (Day of Respect for Cultural Diversity) in Argentina, Dia de la Hispanidad (Hispanicity Day) in Spain, Dia de la Resistencia Indigena (Day of Indigenous Resistance) in Venezuela, and International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples. Intergenerational trauma and Indigenous healing practices Because of the intergenerational trauma that is passed down from each generation to the next due to the violent colonization, healing is an important aspect of resistance. Healing practices include doing work that reverts to the pre-colonized cultural traditional Indigenous work such as weaving, sewing, music, or even active participation in Indigenous community. Along with this, reclaiming sovereignty through storytelling and writing are also forms of Indigenous activism. Writing is a particularly useful tool in healing and activism. It serves as both, \\"means of surviving oppression and a way to engage in the healing process.\\" The book This Bridge Called My Back, Writings by Radical Women of Color makes this idea a reality, by publishing the honest and creative narratives about Native and Indigenous feminism, and contextualizing these pieces as academia. ==Variations by Nation and region== Australia Throughout Australian history, much of the activism by Indigenous feminists has advocated for far more than female liberation, but continuously advocated for the liberation of Indigenous Australians as a whole, including the bettering of health care, changes to structural racism in the media and judicial system, as well as improvements to the education system with a more inclusive, bilingual teaching system in the hope to revive Indigenous languages within schools and communities. Feminist movements within the Indigenous community are seemingly never strictly about the bettering of treatment for women, but for the improved quality of life for all Indigenous Australians. The continued fight for ultimate liberation in Indigenous communities, primarily by women, means seeking re-empowerment as individuals and as a community. This re-empowerment movement first seeks to acknowledge colonisation as a form of disempowerment, to then rebuild and revive Indigenous women's spiritual and cultural practices accompanied by healing. It is acknowledged and believed that a key element of healing the soul of wounds caused by colonisation is for women to tell their stories; stories that have otherwise been erased, distorted or altered to suit the needs of the coloniser. Presently, there are continued debates and protests occurring nationally to change the date or name of ‚ÄòAustralia Day‚Äô, which presently falls on the 26th of January. In Indigenous Australian cultures, the 26th of January marks ‚ÄòInvasion Day‚Äô ‚Äì the day in which the British flag was raised on Australian soil. There are calls to change the date entirely, due to the traumatizing nature of the day for Indigenous Australians, as well as recommendations to change the name to ‚ÄòSurvival Day‚Äô, to acknowledge the mistreatment and displacement of Indigenous communities. In line with these calls, Melbourne's Yarra Council have ceased holding citizenship ceremonies on the 26th of January. Native American feminism Native American feminism or Native feminism is an intersectional feminist movement rooted in the lived experiences of Native American and First Nations (FNIM) women. As a branch of the broader Indigenous feminism, it similarly prioritizes decolonization, indigenous sovereignty, and the empowerment of indigenous women and girls in the context of Native American and First Nations cultural values and priorities, rather than white, mainstream ones.Ramirez, Renya K. \\"Race, Tribal Nation, and Gender: A Native Feminist Approach to Belonging, Meridians, Volume 7, Number 2, (2007), pp. 22-40 Published by Indiana University Press A central and urgent issue for Native feminists is the Missing and murdered Indigenous women crisis (MMIW). ==See also== * Gender roles among the indigenous peoples of North America * Chicana feminism * Global feminism * Gypsy feminism * Islamic feminism * Postcolonial feminism * Postfeminism * Transnational feminism * Womanism == References  Further reading == * Anderson, Kim. \\"Affirmations of an Indigenous Feminist.\\" Indigenous Women and Feminism: Politics, Activism, Culture.

Despite being born into a distinguished Onmyouji family, he has no magical powers. He had been living a quiet and normal life, as he could not accomplish anything without any magical powers. When he was young, he made a promise to Natsume Tsuchimikado to become her shikigami and protect her. He goes to school with two close friends: Touji and Hokuto. In the first few episodes it shows his strong feelings for Hokuto and cares for her deeply. After witnessing the tragic death of Hokuto, he became Natsume's shikigami to keep the promise he made to her many years ago. Hokutuo's death also was another reason he was driven to transfer to the academy, in search for Hokuto's master. He seems to have some sort of \\"bad luck\\", which he considers to be an ancient curse passed down by his ancestors. He is extremely weak academically, and is usually tutored by Natsume to avoid being held back a year. Later in the series, the real identity of Harutora is revealed. He is the real reincarnation of Yakou Tsuchimikado. When he and Natsume were born, their places were exchanged. He was sent to a branch of the family whilst Natsume was sent to the main family. Shortly after he gains the Raven Coat tool, Natsume is killed while under the effects of the tool. He performs the Taizan Fukun Ritual to revive Natsume after regaining his memory when Kon destroys her 5 seals. He is later shown staying by Natsume's side as she wakes up, and then kisses her. He tells her that he is sorry, and he hopes that one day they will meet again. Natsume Tsuchimikado : The main protagonist of the second arc, Natsume is Harutora's childhood friend and the daughter of the main family of the Tsuchimikado clan. She is a prodigal onmyouji attending a school in Tokyo. During her summer break, she comes to Harutora's town and interrupts his peaceful life by holding him to the promise he made long ago, to become her familiar. She is heir to the Tsuchimikado family and is assumed to be the reincarnation of Yakou Tsuchimikado. As a family tradition, she has to present herself as male in front of other onmyouji families, a tradition that was created to hide the true identity of Yakou's reincarnation. However, they found out that she was actually a girl when her clothes were torn apart. She has a Gohou-Type shikigami (Defense Familiars) called Hokuto, a true dragon spirit who has served the main family of Tsuchimikados for generations. She deeply cares about her family reputation and holds the burden of being the next heir of the Tsuchimikado clan. After the incident with Suzuka Dairenji, she is shown to be wearing the same ribbon Hokuto won from Harutora in the shooting game. She cares about Harutora and has had a crush on him since childhood. Touji Ato : A former delinquent well known for always wearing a green bandanna, who is also Harutora's best friend from school, Touji is capable of special spirit sensing and has a vast knowledge of onmyodo. He realized that Natsume had conjured Hokuto well before Hokuto herself. He is enrolled at the Onmyo Academy in Tokyo along with Harutora, and will usually help Harutora if he gets into trouble. He was a victim of the Spiritual Disaster, two years prior to the story. It was revealed that he had been possessed by the oni which caused the Spiritual Disaster; Harutora's father, who is a doctor, treated him although the after-effects remain. Thus in the end he became a half-oni and now tries to gain control to contain the oni inside him. The reason he enrolled to Onmyo Academy was to purify his inner oni. Suzuka Dairenji : The youngest of the Twelve Divine Generals, nicknamed \\"the Prodigy\\", she is a wanted criminal for researching and using forbidden magic. Suzuka comes to town searching for Natsume, so she can use her spiritual powers in the Taizan Fukun Ritual which Natsume has been researching, along with Yakou Tsuchimikado, to revive her brother. This leads Suzuka into conflict with the Onmyo Agency. Although she is a powerful onmouji, she is regarded as the weakest Divine General, as Reiji Kagami comments. She is the daughter of the deceased Divine General and the former leader of the Twin Horn Syndicate, Shidou Dairenji. In episode 3, it is revealed that Suzuka and her brother were subjected to deadly experiments by their father before and after their birth, which resulted in her being an excellent Onmyouji. Her brother later died from effects of the experiments; hence she came to Harutora's town to perform the Taizan Fukun Ritual and revive her dead brother. She was also guilty of actions which lead to Hokuto's death, however Harutora releases her from her guilt when he reveals that Hokuto was remotely controlled by its user. After that incident it is heavily implied that she has developed a crush on Harutora but fails to act or even accept these feeling hence knowing of Harutora's feelings for Natsume Tsuchimikado. Most of her magic was temporarily sealed by Onmyo Agency and she later enrolls in the Onmyo Academy as her punishment for the incident in the countryside. Kyouko Kurahashi : The granddaughter of the director of the Onmyo Prep School and heir to the Kurahashi family, Kyouko Kurahashi is one of the top students at the school and one of only 3 known students to possess a Gohou-Type shikigami (which consists of two Yaksha series, man-made familiars called Hakuou & Kokfuu). Initially, she appears antagonistic towards Harutora (and by extension Natsume), due to suspicion around his use of his family's fame and status to be Natsume's shikigami and to suddenly enroll directly into the elite academy mid-semester. After a series of events, she reconciles with Harutora, establishing a friendship based on common ground. She also reveals two surprising truths; firstly, the Kurahashi family were once a branch family of the Tsuchimikado family, and secondly, she had visited the Tsuchimikado's home as young child and made a promise with Natsume. Once they were reunited, however, Natsume treated her as a complete stranger, and frustrated at having her feelings trampled Kyouko uses Harutora as a pretext to start fights between the two girls. Ironically, the person she met that day wasn't Natsume, but Harutora, who she mistook as Natsume. After helping Harutora save Natsume from a Yakou Disciple, the two make up. This later causes Kyouko to admit to Harutora that she is in love with Natsume, because he is her first love. Kyouko now plans to further her relationship with Natsume and forces a reluctant Harutora to assist, as payment for the Yakou Disciple incident. However she later realizes that Harutora is the person she met and that Natsume is a girl, so she renews her plan, now directed at Harutora, with Natsume being her rival. Tenma Momoe : A classmate who befriends Harutora and Touji during their first day at the academy, Tenma ends up unwittingly involved in the Yakou Disciple incident when he is caught in an attack from a shikigami called a Kodoku, intended for Harutora. He resolves himself, however, to help Harutora rescue Natsume after listening to his request. Since then, Tenma has been drawn into various events related to the cult, despite his somewhat cowardly nature. He is knowledgeable about current events of the Onmyodo world at large, and sometimes helps Harutora catch up with his studies by lending him his notebook. It was later revealed that Tenma is from a prestigious onymouji family, and is also the successor of the Momoe family and Witchcraft Corporation, his deceased parents' man-made shikigami manufacturing company. The shikigami from the company are for general use, as well as making the use of shikigami accessible to everyone. Akino Souma : She is a branch family member of the Souma Clan, one of the three great Onmyouji families, and is a \\"Living Spirit\\". Akino originally met Natsume in Seihuku Temple and the pair became fast friends. After some \\"dire circumstances\\" within the temple, resulting in its destruction, she travels with Natsume and rest of Tsuchimikados to Tokyo. ==Onmyo Academy/Onmyo Preparatory School== Jin Ohtomo : Harutora's homeroom teacher. A fairly quirky person who tends to be more laid back then one would expect from a teacher, to the point where some would accuse him of being irresponsible. Despite that, he's usually good at giving solid advice to students and is a known activist against the school's harsh policies when comes to education. He lost his leg in a clash with Ashiya Douman and now has a prosthetic leg. He was a former Magic Investigator and Divine General nicknamed \\"The Shadow\\" who worked under Daizen Amami to investigate the Twin Horn Syndicate until he resigned and started working as a homeroom teacher at Onmyo Preparatory School in order to observe and protect Natsume. Miyo Kurahashi : The current head of the Kurahashi family and Onmyo Prep School, she is a well-known figure in the underworld of Onmyouji and her son (and Kyouko's father) is the Chief of Exorcism Division of Onmyo Agency. The current Kurahashi Clan is considered one of the most powerful Onmyouji families, whose influence over the politics of Onmyoudo and Japan rivals that of the once glorious Tsuchimikado family. A skilled Diviner, she helped the Onmyo Agency solve numerous extremely difficult cases. Miyo is also one of the few people who knew Yakou personally. She has a pet cat which she uses as a messenger to relay information at long distances. Mako Fujino : A 26-year-old matron at the boys dormitory, she works in Onmyo Academy and is also a good friend of Ako Kifu. She's into \\"Boys Love\\" relationships, and often fantasizes about it with Ako. She spread rumors about \\"Harutora, Touji and Natsume's relationship\\" after being mistaken by Natsume's shikigami with Harutora, who looks exactly like Natsume (albeit with a male body). Ako Kifu : Matron of the girls dormitory and a good friend of Mako Fujino. Fujiwara : An old man who works in the Onmyo Academy, he cares about his students well-being.

Shaver : Reiji's Shikigami, which serves as a medium for the sword Higekiri. After being affected by Ashiya Douman's Magical tool, which can create Spiritual Disasters, Shaver went insane and tried to attack Natsume by forcing her to summon Hokuto for a fight.

In the end he was killed by Shaver, before he could carry it out. ==Twin Horn Syndicate/Bicornis Fellowship== Takiko S≈çma : A mysterious girl who appears for the first time in the 15th episode, in front of the Heavenly Altar. Takiko affirms she is a student, but Harutora, Natsume and Touji have never seen her or heard her name, despite her seeming to know them. Later it is revealed that she was disguised as Atsune Hirata and has acted as a double agent between Twin Horn and Onmyo Agency's Magic Crime Investigation Division. She is the last remaining direct member of the Souma family who are implied have royal origins, as well as being a shrine maiden. The Souma Clan along with Kurahashi Clan stood on top of the world of Onmyoudo together with the Tsuchimikado Clan during World War II and supported the Tsuchimikado's through their control of military. However, when Japan lost the war they all but disappeared. While she is one of older members of the Twin Horn Syndicate, Takiko consider herself differently from the current Yakou Disciples because she seeks to fulfill his will and ideals which the organization was founded on.

Shid≈ç Dairenji : The former head of the Twin Horn Syndicate/Bicornis Fellowship, and the Imperial Household's Lingering Spirit Division. He used himself as a core to trigger the spiritual disaster two years prior to the story. In the end, he became an ogre (demon) and progressed into Phase 4-scale Phenomena, but later died of unknown causes. He is the father of the Divine General, Suzuka Dairenji. When he was alive he was a Divine General nicknamed the \\"Professor\\". In episode 17 it is later learned his original family name was actually \\"Souma\\" and Dairenji was just another House that he married into (his wife's family name), thus implying blood relations with Takiko. Takiko revived him as Yase-Doji (Imperial Pallbearer: a type of Ogre shikigami) to serve her as her Shikigami.

Takiko revived him as Yase- Doji to serve her as her Shikigami along with Shidou. His memories of his previous life were kept intact and he gained a great power that surpassed any he had in his previous life. He too modified his appearance, appearing younger so as to match Takiko's 'taste'. As Takiko's Shikigami, his Yase-Doji contract name is Kumomaru. Yoshitaka Makihara : One of the leaders of the degraded fanatical faction of the Twin Horn Syndicate. He and his cohorts within the Onmyo Agency were the ones behind attempts at kidnapping Natsume and participated in Spiritual Terrorism prior to the story. Makihara and his men tried to escape the crackdown from the Magical Investigators by once again manipulating spirit pulses to cause another spiritual disaster. He was shot dead by, and had his memories erased by, Hirata. Makihara was good friends with Chihiro Mutobe and Etou. ==The Tsuchimikado Clan== Yakou Tsuchimikado : A genius Onmyoji and visionary, Yakou had appeared in the midst of the Great Pacific War and would be known as the father of modern Onmyoudo. It was through his actions that the art of Onmyoudo was able to revitalize itself in Japan by creating a new foundation, attaining him fame as well as many followers. A key figure in the Japanese Imperial Army, his leadership in the Onmyo Agency won the military and the country many victories. However it would also be he who caused the Great Spiritual Disaster which brought about country's immediate downfall in the war. Despite the controversy that had arisen surrounding him in the aftermath of this, his legacy is still enormously respected and revered. Little is known of what happen to him afterwards, but there are many who theorize that Yakou's grand ritual may not have necessarily failed and that he actually has undergone reincarnation. These theories and rumors, further fueled by divination, predicted that Yakou would incarnate himself half a century later to the next head of the Tsuchimikado household whom his powers have blossomed in; then he will once again raise up and lead the Onmyouji to a new era. Many of those who are strongly devoted to him refer to Yakou as the King of North Star/Polaris King. Yasuzumi Tsuchimikado : The current head of the Tsuchimikado clan and Natsume's father, he can read the stars and predict the future accurately. In Volume 8 of the light novel, it was revealed that he had given his son to a branch family to safeguard, and had Natsume take his place, meaning he is the biological father of Harutora. Takahiro Tsuchimikado : Harutora's father, a doctor who is currently treating Touji, is a First Class Mystical Investigator in the Onmyo Agency.

Known for her attitude, she is quite well liked among her peers. It is claimed that she went by many names such as \\"Ram of Akiba, Heavenly Bellie or Lady Thunder of the Flash, but in reality she was nicknamed the \\"Human Power Generator' due to how highly destructive her powers normally are. She specializes in Lightning manipulation. It is later revealed she is not Harutora's real mother. ==Others== Hokuto : Harutora's childhood friend. She had a romantic relationship with Harutora and got really jealous when Harutora was kissed by Suzuka. During his next encounter with Suzuka, she sacrifices herself to save Harutora from Suzuka's shikigami Tsuchigumo, revealing herself to be a shikigami. Hokuto is actually Natsume's shikigami, whom Natsume used as a medium to be close to Harutora. Hokuto's 'death' was one of the things that prompted Harutora to become Natsume's shikigami, but Harutora wanted to be her shikigami since they were kids when they made a promise. She shares her name with another Shikigami called Hokuto, a dragon. As Hokuto is Natsume she loved Harutora and Harutora has showed in multiple occurrences that he held deep feelings for her as well. (Technically, they loved each other through Hokuto). Kon : Harutora's shikigami. A diminutive silver-fox spirit who wears miko-like clothing and wields a wakizashi, Kon has served the Tsuchimikado clan for a long time. She has been by Harutora's side since the moment he became Natsume's shikigami, but due to his low spiritual power and awareness, he was unable to hear or see her. A rare Gohou-type shikigami, she possesses independent thought and actions and is fiercely loyal to her master, and even gets jealous when Harutora associates with other girls. Shortly before Harutora's awakening as Yakou, Kon reveals her true identity as Hishamaru, one of Yakou's two legendary familiars who had 'disappeared' after his death. Kon forcefully destroyed her 5 seals, restoring her true power and her appearance as Hishamaru. Her first seal hides both it and the other seals, the second seal hides her personality, the third seal her appearance, the fourth seal her power, and the final seals her memory. Hishamaru : She, along with Kakugyouki, are the two powerful legendary shikigami of Yakou Tsuchimikado, who were constantly at his side and renowned enough to gain military rank in the Japanese Army during World War II. It is revealed in a short flashback that she has a familial connection to Yakou and is born into a branch family, thus explaining her position as Yakou's familiar. She apparently disappeared shortly after her master's disappearance; later, it is explained that she has been secretly waiting for Yakou's return. Kakugyouki considers her to be more loyal to Yakou than he is. Her faithfulness isn't just loyalty, but also her devoted feelings for Yakou because he approached her without fear and showed her kindness, commenting how cute she was when they first met. Kakugyouki : One of Yakou's two powerful legendary Shikigami, who were constantly at his side and renowned enough to gain military rank in the Japanese Army during World War II. He apparently disappeared shortly after his master's disappearance. He is later shown to be very much alive and is now a wanderer. He has one arm missing, as seen at the end of episode 6. Kakugyouki states that he has no plans to get involved with the Yakou Cult (Twin Horn Syndicate) and remains neutral in conflict between them and the Onmyo Agency. Suzu Saotome : A mysterious eccentric 3rd year student that people often mistake for being younger than she is. She likes little girls, despite appearing like one herself. She is actually Doman's familiar, even if she refers to herself as his \\"disciple\\". Her actual identity is that of infamous Ryou Saotome (pronounced Suzu), the leading Yakou researcher. She once worked for the Lingering Spirit Division, but left after a year. Along with being a graduate of Onmyo Prep, in her school days she was classmates with Jin Ohtomo and Zenjirou Kogure, forming the third member of Three Crows of 36th batch. Doman Ashiya : One of the most powerful onmyouji from Abe no Seimei's era. He was the rival of Abe no Seimei and fought him for nearly a thousand years ago. Ashiya Douman has shown interest in Yakou's reincarnation and seems to have connection with Twin Horn Syndicate/Bicornis Fellowship and Kakugyouki. He also fought with Jin Ohtomo, resulting in Jin losing his leg. Currently, he is no longer a human but a Phase 5 oni. He forces himself to stay as a Phase 3 because if he did become Phase 5, he would cease being 'Ashiya Douman'. He later agrees to become Jin's familiar. Toshiya Dairenji : Suzuka's kind, but ill-fated, older brother who succumbed to his father's experiments and died prior to the story. Suzuka attempted to bring him back by trading her life for his using the Taizan Fukun Ritual. Her brother ends up returning as a shade. The shade then tries to kill Suzuka, but is stopped by Harutora. Once sealed and put to rest by Natsume, a distraught Suzuka and Harutora together bury him. ==References Tokyo Ravens ","title":"List of Tokyo Ravens characters"},{"id":"46345963","text":"Martin Tillman (born 6 November 1964) is a Swiss cellist and composer. ==Biography== Tillman was born in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, in 1964.

Wootten was granted permission to open a photographic studio on the base, (The Photo Hut ) and Wooten eventually received the first commission for a woman in the National Guard. Her early client, Lieutenant Cherry, became North Carolina's 61st Governor. Cherry Point air station and base was named after Cherry, as well as Cherry Hospital. The Wootten-Moulton Studio received The Showmanship Award from The Walt Disney Company for outstanding achievements in professional photography. == Awards and exhibitions == Wootten received the North Carolina State Award for \\"Most Beautiful Photographs of Trees in America\\" from the American Forestry Association in 1934 for her photograph Live Oaks.\\"It Is A Prize Winner,\\" Charlotte Observer, 12 January 1934 Her work has been exhibited at Harvard University, the Century of Progress Exposition, the Academy of Arts in Richmond, Virginia, and in numerous locations in North Carolina. * 1923, May 3‚Äì31: International salon of the Pictorial Photographers of America.

Cvetko's visual talent has been displayed in several award-winning films including the Sundance Film Festival Special Jury Prize winner Inequality For All and the Academy Award-nominated short subject Facing Fear. She provided the cinematography for the Academy Award- winning documentary, Inside Job. Her work has been featured in American Cinematographer magazine. ==Background and education== Cvetko came to the United States as an expatriate of the former Yugoslavia in the late 1980s to pursue a career in filmmaking. Originally a still photographer, Cvetko was inspired by the prolific work of Agn√®s Godard to become an established female cinematographer. This inspiration led her to move to the San Francisco Bay Area. While attending classes at the University of California-Berkeley extension program, Cvetko met film professor Larry Clark. Clark became Cvetko's mentor and gave her access to her first production set. ==Career== Cvetko began her career with No War, a documentary film about the conflict in Bosnia. Directed and shot by Cvetko, No War was well received, shown in over 15 festivals around the world and winning the Grand Prix du Public in Films de Femmes in 2001. Cvetko's skill in documentary filmmaking continued to develop through several feature films including Miss Representation, directed by Jennifer Siebel Newsom and premiering at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival in the documentary competition and Sundance 2013 Special Jury Prize winner Inequality For All. She was the cinematographer for Inside Job, directed by Charles Ferguson. Premiering at Cannes Film Festival in 2010, Inside Job won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Red Army, Cvetko's latest documentary, was screened at 2014 Cannes Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival. She lent her visual talent to narrative films including (Untitled) directed by Jonathan Parker, On a Tuesday directed by David Scott Smith, and Dorme directed by Sylvia Binsfeld. Cvetko is versed in both film and digital cinematography utilizing digital most recently on the film The Architect with the use of the ARRI Alexas camera. Her cinematographic skill using film can be seen in On a Tuesday, shot on Super 35mm with a Kodak Vision2 5205 250D. Cvetko and director David Scott Smith created a panoramic, wide-screen 3.18 aspect ratio to shoot in the historic San Francisco City Hall. Discovered by accident while scouting locations in San Francisco City Hall, Cvetko said \\"It was breathtaking. The space was just asking to be seen that way.\\" This exceptional work in cinematography was also featured in In Camera magazine. Critical recognition Cvetko's cinematography has been praised. The New York Times called her work \\"clean wide-screen cinematography [that] provides an aesthetic polish,\\" and Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood stated that her sharp cinematography was \\"perfect\\". ==Selected filmography== *No War (2000) *Birju (2002) *Raw (2005) *Dirty Test (2005) *Even Now (2005) *Dorme (2006) *Car Stories (2006) *Daily Specials (2006) *Last Flight Home (2007) *The Book (2007) *On a Tuesday (2007) *How to Be Popular (2007) *TBD (2007) *(Untitled) (2009) *Inside Job (2010) *Miss Representation (2011) *Inequality for All (2013) *Facing Fear (2013) *Red Army (2014) *She's Beautiful When She's Angry (2014) *The Architect (2016) ==Awards and nominations== *No War -- Winner of 2001 Grand Prix du Public in Films de Femmes *Inside Job -- Winner of 2010 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature *Inequality for All -- 2013 Special Jury Prize, Sundance Film Festival *Facing Fear -- 2013 Academy Award-nominee for Best Documentary Short Subject ==References *Svetlana Cvetko at professional website. * Category:Living people Category:American film directors Category:American women cinematographers Category:American women film directors Category:American cinematographers Category:Yugoslav emigrants to the United States Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Svetlana Cvetko"},{"id":"46346365","text":"A.Lewis'' ==Life== Lewis gained his BA in philosophy, economics and statistics from George Washington University in 1969, and a PhD in applied mathematics from Harvard University in 1979.

He used visual statements, his sense of humor and love of puns to \\"address cultural stereotypes.\\" His work has been collected by the San Antonio Museum of Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum, and nationally and internationally. He is best known for his series of 150 large-scale paintings called \\"Humanscapes\\" that were painted between 1965 and 1989.Hickey, David (1988). \\"Mel Casas: Border Lord.\\" Artspace: Southwestern Contemporary Arts Quarterly 12, no. 4: 28‚Äì31. Casas was also well known as a writer and theorist. His \\"Brown Paper Report\\" is considered an important document of Chicano history. In his writing, he emphasized the importance of \\"self-determination\\" and equality for Chicanos/as. He is considered to be one of the important founders of the Chicano Arts movement. Casas felt that once artists had a fair chance to exhibit in the United States, then they would become part of \\"Americana.\\" == Biography == Casas was born in El Paso, Texas to Mexican parents during the Great Depression. He grew up and lived in El Segundo Barrio. His father liked to draw and this influenced Casas to start drawing on his own. As a young man decided that he wanted to be an artist. Casas felt that he had a good education in elementary school and junior high. He attended El Paso High School which he chose in order to get a better education. At the time, there were more Anglo students at El Paso High and Casas felt alienated from the other students because of his background and heavy Mexican accent. It was Casas' first encounter with discrimination. He graduated from high school in 1948. After graduating high school, Casas worked for Pacific Fruit Express, a railroad company, as an iceman. He also helped with his father's Swedish massage business located in downtown El Paso. Later, Casas was called into the United States Army and his father insisted it was his duty to serve. Casas served in the Korean War from 1950-1953, where he was injured and subsequently returned to the United States. Casas was awarded a Purple Heart for bravery in the war. Casas went to college using the G.I. Bill. First, he started to study psychology, due to practical considerations, but later changed to art and teaching. In college, he had a very strong background in classical art theory, drawing and painting. He received a BA in 1956 from Texas Western College (now the University of Texas at El Paso). Casas then received a MFA from the University of the Americas in Mexico City in 1958. Casas received an all-level certificate to teach in Texas. He was considered by his students to be a \\"generous\\" teacher, helping to launch many young art careers. Casas taught art at Jefferson High School in El Paso, Texas for about three years. One of his students was Gaspar Enriquez. Casas served as president of the Con Safo art group in the early 1970s. Con Safo is a Pachuco slang expression whose most common meanings are: \\"the same to you,\\" \\"don't mess with this,\\" and \\"forbidden to touch.\\"Cordova, Ruben C. (2009). Con Safo: The Chicano Art Group and the Politics of South Texas. Los Angeles: UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center Press. In its abbreviated form, C/S, it is used to protect murals from defacement. The art group adopted the name \\"Con Safo\\" on December 19, 1971, at which time Casas presented his \\"Brown Paper Report,\\" which listed 22 definitions for the term Con Safo. Felipe Reyes, a painter, was the prime mover of the Con Safo group, which he views as a final reorganization of a group he cofounded in 1968, which was initially known as El Grupo. In December 1971 the Con Safo group consisted of Felipe Reyes, Jose Esquivel, Jesse Almaz√°n, Roberto R√≠os, and Jose Garza (all of whom were members of El Grupo), and Mel Casas and Jesse Trevi√±o. Other notable artists who subsequently joined the group include Rudy Trevi√±o (who later served as president) C√©sar Mart√≠nez, Amado Pe√±a, Carmen Lomas Garza, Santos Mart√≠nez, Kathy Vargas, Roberto Gonzalez, and Rolando Brise√±o. Several of these artists were students of Casas, who was teaching at San Antonio College. Through the Con Safo group, members gained exposure by participating in exhibitions for which they were paid a fee by the exhibiting institutions. Con Safo was considered influential and helped Chicano art receive recognition when Chicanos and their work were largely excluded from museums and galleries. Casas taught for 29 years at San Antonio College where he was Chair of the Art Department for 12 years. Casas felt that he had the opportunity to teach a \\"very good cross-section of the city\\" which was something he enjoyed. Being the chair of the department, however, was stressful for Casas, since he was often on call. He retired in 1990. After retiring, Casas and his wife Grace went to Italy, spending two years in Brandisi and two in Sicily. Casas had a two-year battle with cancer. He died in his home with his family and his wife of 35 years, Grace Casas. He and Grace had one child, Bruce. With his first wife, Maria, Mel had four children: Alfredo, Ingrid, Mike and Sonya. == Art == Casas was first recognized for his work in the abstract expressionist style which was considered \\"typical\\" for his time period in the United States. Casas recalls that eventually he felt that the abstract work was too \\"pretty\\" and it wasn't the right artistic language for him. After the mid 1960s he began to do more representational work. He was very interested in dealing with the objectification of women in media and \\"debunking\\" racial stereotypes. Though Casas is best known for a handful of works that treat Chicano themes, he created an unusually wide array of works with varied themes and styles. He used clever word play mixed with imagery. He challenged stereotypes, especially in some of the works in his \\"Humanscape\\" series. The 153 paintings that make up the \\"Humanscape\\" series were inspired by a \\"glimpse of a drive-in movie screen.\\" Cordova, who curated four Humanscape exhibitions with approximately half of the paintings,Silva, Elda (11 June 2015). \\"Casas Exhibit too big for one Gallery,\\" San Antonio Express-News, retrieved July 10, 2015, http://www.expressnews.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article/Casas-exhibit- too-big-for-one-gallery-6319825.php#photo-8131225 divides the Humanscapes into five groups. In the first group, from 1965 through 1967, Casas made depictions of audiences watching films at drive-in cinemas and conventional movie theaters. The blurry, nebulous audience members were gradually endowed with more color and form, and from late 1967 through 1970, many Humanscape paintings dealt with the Sexual Revolution. Casas began making politically themed paintings in 1968, and he emphasized this subject matter from 1970 through 1975. From 1975 through 1981, Casas' favorite topic as art about art. Finally, from 1982 through 1989, the last Humanscapes treated what Casas called the \\"Southwestern clich√©s.\\" In this series, Casas focuses on imagery from popular culture and how these media images can and do affect viewers who Casas called voyeurs, instead. \\"Humanscapes\\" addresses various issues, such as Chicano politics and identity by using biting humor, pop culture and folk art. His incorporation of imagery from Mexican and Pre-Columbian iconography in conjunction with pop art was unique. His choice of subject matter, which satirized racism and may show sexualized nudes, was often considered to be \\"provocative.\\" Casas felt that media, like television, movies and advertising had the power to change people and could be used to change them for the better. His paintings often reacted to these media types by using erotic themes to highlight the effect that media had on the viewer. The \\"Humanscapes\\" were generally painted on large-scale canvases, mimicking the drive-in movies that inspired them. The text chosen for many of the \\"Humanscapes\\" help create visual \\"conundrums\\" that are meant to allow the viewer to question and re- interpret the ideas that are juxtaposed with the imagery. Earlier \\"Humanscapes\\" had limited palette choices, but later paintings had more colors and were rather vibrant. As Casas' paintings became more colorful, they also began to have a richer sense of satire and visual play. Casas often paid a price for his trenchant social criticism. He was designated \\"Artist of the Year\\" by the San Antonio Art League for 1968, only to have this honor revoked three days later. Casas, who referred to the dominant notion of beauty as the Barbie doll ideal, spoke of the privileges of blond hair and blue eyes while he undressed a Barbie doll during his acceptance speech. As a fellow artist, he was good at asking critical questions of the work of others and encouraging them to submit their work to exhibitions and competitions. In later years, he ceased exhibiting, but painted almost daily, even when he was battling cancer. == Quotes == > To me, being an outsider is the next thing to being an artist.

Trevor Wilson. The series began as a YouTube web series titled Letterkenny Problems, and it was commissioned as a television series by Crave in March 2015. It debuted in February 2016, and later also aired on The Comedy Network. The show follows the residents of Letterkenny, a small rural community in Ontario loosely based on Keeso's hometown of Listowel, Ontario. At the 5th Canadian Screen Awards in 2017, the series won the award for Best Comedy Series. In October 2017, the series received a production commitment of more than 40 new episodes. The eighth season premiered on Crave on December 25, 2019, and on Hulu on December 27. In June 2020, the series was renewed for a ninth season. In the United States, Letterkenny is distributed by Hulu and the first two seasons debuted on July 13, 2018. Subsequent seasons were added on December 27, 2018. In May 2019, Hulu acquired exclusive rights to the series and future seasons in the United States, and that season 7 would premiere on the platform as a Hulu Original on October 14, 2019. ==Overview== Letterkenny revolves around a small rural Canadian community of the same name, and most episodes open with the text: \\"There are 5000 people in Letterkenny. These are their problems.\\" The series focuses on siblings Wayne and Katy, who run a small farm and produce stand with help from Wayne's friends Daryl and Squirrely Dan. It also focuses on ice hockey players Reilly and Jonesy, two best friends who are involved in an on-and-off polyamorous relationship with Katy. Episodes deal with small- town life amongst different types of people: the farmers (the \\"hicks\\"), the out-of-towners who make up the local ice hockey team, the town's closeted minister, the drug addicts (the \\"skids\\"), members of the nearby First Nation reserve (the \\"natives\\"), the local Mennonites and Qu√©b√©cois. Plots often revolve around Wayne defending his reputation as \\"the toughest guy in Letterkenny\\", the exploits of the town's hockey team who rarely win, Wayne's attempts to break up Katy's relationships with various men he dislikes, the skids' schemes to rip off the residents of both Letterkenny and the natives, and Wayne's dating life after dumping his high school sweetheart who cheated on him. In an effort to subvert the usual trope of small-town residents having lower intelligence levels, one of the show's running jokes is that almost every character possesses the ability to think quickly and come up with a near-constant barrage of wordplay and puns, as well as have sophisticated views on worldly topics. ==Production== Letterkenny is the first original series commissioned by Crave, and premiered on that platform on February 7, 2016. The show has its roots in Letterkenny Problems, a short-format web series created by Keeso and released on YouTube in 2013. Letterkenny Problems garnered a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Original Fiction Program or Series Created for Digital Media at the 2nd Canadian Screen Awards in 2014. The town of Letterkenny portrayed in the series is fictional, and not based on the actual ghost town in Renfrew County. Tierney and Michael Dowse are also involved in the production of the series. Tierney also has a supporting role as Pastor Glen in the series, whose cast also includes Michelle Mylett, Dylan Playfair, Andrew Herr, Tyler Johnston, Lisa Codrington, Alexander De Jordy, Kaniehtiio Horn and K. Trevor Wilson. The series is filmed in Sudbury, Ontario. On March 10, 2016, Letterkenny was renewed for a second season of six episodes. On August 8, 2016, just weeks after production wrapped on Season 2, CraveTV announced that they had ordered a third season. On March 17, 2017, a St. Patrick's Day special episode, \\"St. Perfect's Day\\" was released. The third season, shot during the winter season, was released on Canada Day, July 1, 2017. A Halloween episode was announced on October 2, 2017, which was released on October 20, 2017. The fourth season of six episodes was released on December 25, 2017. On October 23, 2017, it was announced that the series had a new media partner which agreed to a production commitment for 40 new episodes, a 26 city Letterkenny Live! tour beginning in February 2018 and the expansion of Letterkenny merchandise. The six-episode fifth season was released on June 29, 2018. ==Cast and charactersEpisodes== Season 1 (2016) Season 2 (2016) St. Patrick's Day special (2017) Season 3 (2017) Halloween special (2017) Season 4 (2017) Easter special (2018) Season 5 (2018) Christmas special (2018) Season 6 (2018)  Valentine's Day special (2019)  Season 7 (2019) Season 8 (2019) ==Littlekenny== In 2019, Bell Media announced the launch of Littlekenny, a six-episode animated spinoff. The series, an origin story focusing on the main characters as children, premiered on June 28. Episodes are between two and four minutes in length. == Home media == Several seasons of the series were released on DVD in Canada by Elevation Pictures, while Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released DVDs of the series in the United States. ==Reception== Critical reception John Doyle of The Globe and Mail called the series \\"refreshing and intoxicating\\", and \\"funny, mad, droll, childish, and spiky.\\" Focusing on the show's characteristic use of often thick Ontario dialect, he wrote that \\"Not since Trailer Park Boys launched have we heard the flavourful, salty Canadian vernacular used with such aplomb and abandon\\"; but also that \\"Almost all the conversations are raw comedy and utterly plausible as small-town guy talk, not just in Canada but in villages and parishes wherever the grass grows.\\" Alan Sepinwall of Rolling Stone called the show \\"marvelously goofy\\" and \\"strange, simple, [and] delightful\\". Ratings CraveTV has stated that Letterkenny's debut was the biggest debut of any series on their platform since it launched in 2014, and that as of March 10, 2016, nearly one in three subscribers have watched the series.

The French theater company performed both before the Swedish royal court in the theaters of the royal palaces, as well as before the Swedish public in Stockholm. It is known to have played a significant part in the education of the pioneer generation of actors at the Royal Dramatic Theatre. The French theater was composed in Paris by Jacques Marie Boutet de Monvel in 1781, when it was engaged by king Gustav III of Sweden to perform before the Swedish royal court. Initially, they performed exclusively for the royal court in the theaters of the royal residences, such as Drottningholm Palace Theatre and Confidencen. From 1783 onward, they also performed before the Swedish public at Bollhuset. The public performances were, in practice, normally visited exclusively by the upper classes of Stockholm, who were able to understand the French language. The French Theater appeared before the public at Bollhuset on Wednesdays and Fridays, and at the royal court whenever they were commanded to. The company were considered of high quality, and performed the latest plays from Paris. They shared Bollhuset with the Royal Dramatic Theatre from 1788, but they performed separately and referred to as the \\"French Theater\\" and the \\"Swedish Theater\\" respectively. The actors of the French Theater were expected by the king to educate Swedish pupils, and many of the first generation of Swedish actors at the Royal Dramatic Theatre were students of the actors at the French Theater, such as Lars Hjortsberg and Fredrica L√∂f. The French Theater were dissolved after the death of Gustav III in 1792. ==Members== ;Actors and singers * Mademoiselle Baron * Monsieur Caron * Francois Chatillon * Monsieur Clericourt * Monsieur Cressent * Monsieur Delaroche * Madame Delaroche * Anne Marie Milan Desguillons * Joseph Sauze Desguillons * Elise Du Belloi * Monsieur Dugay * Madame Dutillier * Francois Marie Mouss√© F√©lix * Madame Felix * Ad√©laide- Th√©r√®se Feuch√®re * Monsieur Feuillet * Sophie Hus * Jean-R√©my Marcadet * Marie Louise Marcadet * Sidonie de Massat * Monsieur Michu * Madame Montrose * Jacques Marie Boutet de Monvel * Catherine-Victoire Le Riche de Cl√©ricourt - Monvel * Monsieur Sainville * Monsieur Saint-Ange * Henri O.

Steven is a hybrid between a \\"Gem\\", a fictional alien being that exists as a magical gemstone projecting a body of light, and a normal human being. Voiced by Zach Callison, he debuted in the series' pilot episode and made his main series debut in the first episode, \\"Gem Glow\\". The show generally takes place around Steven's perspective: the audience always follows Steven and learns about the plot and backstory as he does. As such, the only scenes without the character are those that he sees as visions or that are told to him as stories. The character was received positively, with his evolution through the series, ideology revolving around kindness and empathy, and disregard for gender norms receiving most praise. ==Creation== Steven was created by Rebecca Sugar, with his appearance and name based on Rebecca Sugar's brother Steven Sugar, a background artist for the show. ==Character== Zach Callison, Steven's voice actor. Steven, in his early teens when the series begins, is the youngest member of the Crystal Gems. He is the first and only known Gem‚Äìhuman hybrid, the product of the union between the Crystal Gems' original leader, Rose Quartz, and Greg Universe, a human musician and car-wash owner. Rose \\"gave up her physical form\\" to create Steven, leaving behind only her pink, pentagonal-faceted gem, now embedded in his navel. As a result, some Gems have considered Steven and Rose to be the same entity; a major character arc for Steven involves his wrestling with his mother's complex legacy, and whether he must take responsibility for her choices. With this gem, Steven develops a wide variety of magical abilities. He is able to summon his mother‚Äôs shield; create a spherical force field; heal Gems, humans, and objects with his saliva; create sentient plant life; shapeshift; float through the air; use empathetic telepathy and astral projection; combine bodies and minds with other Gems and/or humans to form powerful \\"fusions\\"; and revive the dead with his tears. By the movie, Steven has fully mastered his Gem abilities. Cheerful, kind-hearted, carefree, and always willing to see the best in people, Steven is beloved by the Gems and well-liked by the people of Beach City, including his best friend Connie Maheswaran. Steven is said to take after Rose in terms of personality, as he is empathetic and all-loving, though Rebecca Sugar says that he actually inherited this attitude from Greg. Over the course of the series, Steven matures greatly, garnering new respect for his position as a protector of Earth and becoming more aware of the dangers of being a Crystal Gem. According to Sugar, Steven's greatest flaw is his self-sacrificing nature; he continually sets aside his own safety and emotional well-being in favor of others, which eventually takes a toll on his mental health. Late in the series, Steven grows concerned about his role as the inheritor of his late mother's legacy, especially after he finds out that Rose Quartz herself was in actuality originally Pink Diamond, a member of the Great Diamond Authority that reigns supreme over the Gem race. The other Diamonds‚ÄîYellow, Blue, and White Diamond‚Äîassume Steven is Pink Diamond in an alternate form and attempt to hold him responsible for her actions and make him reclaim Pink Diamond's place among them. In the series finale, \\"Change Your Mind\\", White Diamond briefly removes his gem from his body; it regenerates itself into a form identical to that of Steven's physical body, thus finally reassuring him that he truly is his own individual, not merely a reincarnation of his mother. In the epilogue series, Steven Universe Future, Steven struggles with feelings of purposelessness after the Gem empire is reformed and his friends and family no longer need his help, and his unresolved emotional trauma from the events of the original series leads him to overreact to minor stresses and life changes. Near the end of the series, this stress builds up to the point that he turns into a giant, kaiju-like monster, endangering Beach City, but the love and support of his friends and family help turn him back to normal. In the final episode of the series, Steven leaves Beach City indefinitely to seek out a new purpose and live like a normal human. Steven usually wears a red T-shirt with a yellow star in the center, blue jeans, and salmon-pink flip-flops. In cold weather, he often wears a hooded sweatshirt or knitted sweater. In Steven Universe: The Movie, he retains his jeans and flip-flops but now wears a sky blue T-shirt, again bearing a yellow star and a pink varsity jacket with white trims. In Steven Universe Future, he retains his clothing from the film but now wears a black T-shirt instead of a blue one. ==Reception== Steven has been well-received by fans and critics alike. Susana Polo of Polygon praises Steven for being the \\"toxic masculinity antidote\\" in that his dominant traits of empathy and kindness are what make him such a vital member of the Crystal Gems. Polo also commends Steven's subversion of gender definitions, him being a young boy in a feminine role with defensive abilities that manifest in shades of pink. Similarly, in a post on Bitch Flicks, Ashley Gallagher also praises Steven's rejection of typical masculinity and his stereotypically defensive and feminine powers such as his shield and his healing while also expressing approval of his relationship with Connie. Highly praising the evolution of the character through the series, Eric Thurm of Polygon stated after the season five finale: \\"Back in the show‚Äôs first season, Steven was far more irritating. He was myopic, focusing on what was right in front of him to the detriment of more important priorities ‚Äî especially when what was right in front of him was the prospect of getting ridiculously buff. He was a huge goofball incapable of taking anything seriously. And he had a child‚Äôs instinct for deception when it seemed like he might be in trouble, whether that meant forming a 'Secret Team' to hide a mistake or asking the Gems to pretend to be his human mother. But the story of Steven Universe isn‚Äôt about Steven discarding the things that made, and still make, him childish ‚Äî it‚Äôs about figuring out how to use them in more specific, salutary ways. The idea that there are childish qualities worth cultivating, alongside others that can and should be avoided or shed, is a refreshingly nuanced (and accurate) take on how to be a person, even if being that kind of person requires fusing with your own body, especially for kids. Being able to gain emotional maturity, insight, and wisdom while still retaining the best parts of being new to the world ‚Äî that‚Äôs the disposition Steven Universe asks of us as we, whether 14 or 34 or 34,000, continue to grow.\\" ==References *Steven Universe on IMDb Category:Television characters introduced in 2013 Category:Fictional musicians Category:Child characters in television Category:Teenage characters in television Category:Fictional extraterrestrial‚Äìhuman hybrids Category:Child superheroes Category:Steven Universe characters Category:Fictional characters from Delaware Category:Fictional characters with healing abilities Category:Male characters in animation Category:Fictional shapeshifters Category:Fictional characters with post-traumatic stress disorder Category:Fictional empaths Category:Male characters in television Category:Vegetarianism in fiction ","title":"Steven Universe (character)"},{"id":"46346551","text":"Aleksandr Vladislavovich Ushakhin (; born 26 September 1964) is a Russian professional football coach and a former player. ==Career== On 29 January 2019, Palanga announced that Ushakhin joined the club's staff together with Artyom Gorlov. ==References * Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Soviet footballers Category:Russian footballers Category:Russian football managers Category:Russian expatriate football managers Category:Russian expatriate sportspeople in Lithuania Category:Expatriate football managers in Lithuania Category:FC Luch Vladivostok managers Category:FK Palanga non-playing staff Category:Association football defenders ","title":"Aleksandr Ushakhin"},{"id":"46346591","text":"John Wayne \\"Buzzy\\" Connors (born January 30, 1936) is a Canadian politician.

In 1910 he translated Henri Bergson's Introduction √† la metaphysique into Hungarian. He was a member of the so-called Sunday circle around B√©la Bal√°zs and Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs. With Karl Mannheim, Arnold Hauser and Ervin Szab√≥ he was also involved in the Budapest Free School of Humanities, founded by Luk√°cs. A December 1915 lecture on historical materialism to the Hungarian Philosophical Society criticized economic determinism. His March 1918 lecture to a joint meeting of the Sunday Circle and the Sociologial Society, 'Conservative and Progressive Idealism', opposed positivism and associated radical politics with philosophical idealism. In December 1918 he joined the Hungarian Communist Party and was appointed as editor of V√∂r√∂s √öjs√°g (The Red Journal). In April 1919, speaking as director of the new Marx-Engels Workers' University, he lectured on 'The Philosophic Foundations of the Human Sciences', arguing that socialism needed to be joined to philosophy rather than the natural sciences. He was Director of Higher Education in the Hungarian Soviet Republic. After the Republic fell he emigrated to Vienna, and from 1921 to 1930 lived in Berlin, where he was a member of the Communist Party of Germany. In 1921 he published \\"Observation on Scientific Education and the Proletariat\\" in Communist Review. His Introduction to Marx's Philosophy appeared in 1921 or 1922, and in 1923 he reviewed Karl Korsch's Marxism and Philosophy for Die Internationale. In 1923 he lectured, alongside Lukacs, at the Marxist Work Week, out of which later grew the Institute for Social Research. In 1930 Fogarasi moved to Moscow to work for the Comintern. A Fellow of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, he worked with Eugen Varga, Stalin's economic advisor. In 1945 he returned to Budapest, where he became rector of the University of Economics. He received the Kossuth Prize in 1952. He died in Budapest on 28 April 1959. ==Works== * (tr.) Bevezet√©s a metafizik√°ba [Introduction to metaphysics] by Henri Bergson.

Slager had stopped Scott for a non-functioning brake light. Slager was charged with murder after a video surfaced showing him shooting Scott from behind while Scott was fleeing, which contradicted Slager's report of the incident. The race difference led many to believe that the shooting was racially motivated, generating a widespread controversy. The case was independently investigated by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of South Carolina, and the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division conducted their own investigations. In June 2015, a South Carolina grand jury indicted Slager on a charge of murder. He was released on bond in January 2016. In late 2016, a five-week trial ended in a mistrial due to a hung jury. In May 2016, Slager was indicted on federal charges including violation of Scott's civil rights and obstruction of justice. In a May 2017 plea agreement, Slager pleaded guilty to federal charges of civil rights violations, and he was returned to jail pending sentencing. In return for his guilty plea, the state's murder charges were dropped. In December 2017, Slager was sentenced to 20 years in prison, with the judge determining the underlying offense was second-degree murder. ==Persons involved== Scott during his service in the U.S. Coast Guard in the mid-1980s *Walter Lamar Scott was a 50-year-old forklift operator, studying massage therapy. An arrest warrant had been issued since a , 2013 court hearing regarding his child support payments. Scott had previously been jailed three times because of the child support payments. Scott previously served two years in the U.S. Coast Guard before being given a general discharge in 1986 for a drug-related offense. *Michael Thomas Slager, 33 years old at the time of the incident, served in the North Charleston Police Department (NCPD) for five years and five months prior to the shooting. Before becoming a police officer, he served in the U.S. Coast Guard. Slager was named in a police complaint in 2013 for allegedly using a Taser on a man without cause. Slager was cleared by the police department over the incident; the victim and several witnesses said they were not interviewed. Following the Scott killing, North Charleston police stated they would re-review the 2013 complaint. Slager was named in a second tasing-without-cause complaint following an August 2014 police stop. A complaint filed in January 2015 resulted in Slager being cited for failing to file a report. Personnel documents describe Slager as having demonstrated \\"great officer safety tactics\\" in dealing with suspects, and note his proficiency with a Taser. ==Shooting== At , , 2015, in the parking lot of an auto parts store at 1945 Remount Road, Slager stopped Scott for a non- functioning third brake light. Scott was driving a 1991 Mercedes, and, according to his brother, was headed to the auto parts store when he was stopped. The video from Slager's dashcam shows him approaching Scott's car, speaking to Scott, and then returning to his patrol car. Scott exited his car and fled with Slager giving chase on foot. Slager pursued Scott into a lot behind a pawn shop at 5654 Rivers Avenue, and the two became involved in a physical altercation. At some point before or during the struggle, Slager fired his Taser, hitting Scott. Scott fled, and Slager drew his .45-caliber Glock 21 handgun, firing eight rounds at him from behind. The coroner's report stated that Scott was struck a total of five times: three times in the back, once in the upper buttocks, and once on an ear. During Slager's state trial, forensic pathologist Lee Marie Tormos testified that the fatal wound was caused by a bullet that entered Scott's back and struck his lungs and heart. Immediately following the shooting, Slager radioed a dispatcher, stating, \\"Shots fired and the subject is down. He grabbed my Taser.\\" When Slager fired his gun, Scott was approximately away and fleeing. In the report of the shooting filed before the video surfaced, Slager said he had feared for his life because Scott had taken his Taser, and that he shot Scott because he \\"felt threatened\\". A passenger in Scott's car, reported to be a male co-worker and friend, was later placed in the back of a police vehicle and briefly detained. A toxicology report showed that Scott had cocaine and alcohol in his system at the time of his death. The level of cocaine was less than half the average amount for \\"typical impaired drivers\\", according to the report. Tormos testified that Scott did not test positive for alcohol. Eyewitness video An eyewitness to the shooting, Feidin Santana, recorded video of the incident on his phone. At first Santana did not share the video out of fear of retribution, but he became angered when the police report differed from his view of the events. In an interview on MSNBC, Santana said, \\"I felt that my life, with this information, might be in danger. I thought about erasing the video and just getting out of the community, you know Charleston, and living some place else.\\" The video was subsequently shared with Scott's family through an activist of Black Lives Matter, and later with the news media. Santana said that after a struggle in which Slager deployed his Taser, Scott was \\"just trying to get away from the Taser,\\" and that before he started recording, he observed that Slager \\"had control of the situation\\". In an interview on The Today Show, Santana said Scott \\"never grabbed the Taser of the police. He never got the Taser.\\" (original interview with Today) After Scott was shot and had dropped to the ground, Slager approached him, repeatedly instructed him to place his hands behind his back, and handcuffed him, leaving him face down on the ground. Although police reports stated that officers performed CPR on Scott, no such action is visible on the video. The video shows that Slager ran back toward where the initial scuffle occurred and picked something up off the ground. Moments later, he dropped the object, possibly the Taser, beside Scott's body. Another officer, Clarence W. Habersham Jr., is seen in the video; he puts on medical gloves and appears to examine Scott. ==Aftermath== Critics, such as the Reverend Al Sharpton and the predominantly African-American National Bar Association, called for the prosecution of Clarence Habersham, the second officer seen in the video, alleging an attempted cover-up and questioning \\"whether Habersham omitted significant information from his report.\\" Critics also questioned Habersham's statement in his report that he \\"attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds,\\" saying that the videotape shows little attempt to aid Scott after the shooting. Slager's original lawyer, David Aylor, withdrew as counsel within hours of the release of the video; he did not publicly give a reason for his withdrawal, citing attorney‚Äìclient privilege. On , the North Charleston city manager announced that the NCPD had fired Slager but would continue to pay for his health insurance because his wife was pregnant. The town's mayor, Keith Summey, said they had ordered an additional 150 body cameras, enough that one could be worn by every police officer. A GoFundMe campaign was started to raise money for Slager's defense, but it was quickly shut down by the site. Citing privacy concerns, they declined to go into detail about why the campaign was canceled, saying only that it was \\"due to a violation of our terms and conditions\\". Scott's funeral took place on , at the W.O.R.D. Ministries Christian Center in Summerville, about 20 miles from North Charleston. Scott's killing further fueled a national conversation around race and policing. It has been connected to similar controversial police shootings of black men in Missouri, New York, and elsewhere. The Black Lives Matter movement protested Scott's death. A bill in the South Carolina state house, designed to equip more police officers with body cameras, was renamed for Scott. The Senate set aside to fund it, enough to buy 2,000 cameras for South Carolina officers. In North Charleston, whites make up 37% of the population, but the police department is 80% white.http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-michael-slager-walter- scott-police-shooting-20161130-story.html In May 2016, a short documentary film about the shooting called Frame 394 was released by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The documentary is about Daniel Voshart, a Canadian cinematographer and image stabilization specialist, who claims to have discovered evidence in frame 394 of the shooting video \\"that challenged the accepted narrative of what transpired between Slager and Scott\\"; and it follows his \\"moral dilemma of what to do with this potential key evidence\\". Initially, Voshart examined the footage to help indict Slager, having been convinced by the footage that it \\"was an example of police corruption at its worst\\". After clarifying the video and inspecting frame 394, however, he noticed that as Slager began reaching to draw his firearm, it appeared that Scott was still holding Slager's Taser, \\"potentially enough to make Slager fear for his life and maybe meet the grounds needed to use lethal force.\\" It was impactful in Slager's trial after Voshart showed Slager's lawyer, Andy Savage, the stabilized video. During the trial, the officer \\"testified that he did not realize the Taser had fallen behind him when he fired the fatal shots.\\" Investigation Separate investigations were conducted by the FBI, the U.S. Attorney in South Carolina, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, and the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). An autopsy was performed by the Charleston County coroner on April 4, 2015, which showed that Scott had been shot in the back multiple times. The coroner ruled the death a homicide. Prosecution and conviction of Slager After the police department reviewed the video, Slager was arrested on and charged with murder. On , a South Carolina grand jury indicted Slager on the murder charge. The murder charge was the only charge presented to the grand jury. On , 2016, after being held without bail for almost nine months, Slager was released on $500,000 bond. He was confined to house arrest until the trial, which began , 2016. On , the judge declared a mistrial after the jury became deadlocked with 11 of the 12 jurors favoring a conviction. A retrial had been scheduled to begin in August 2017. However, the state charges were dropped as a result of Slager pleading guilty to a federal charge. On , 2016, Slager was indicted on federal charges of violating Scott's civil rights and unlawfully using a weapon during the commission of a crime. In addition, he was charged with obstruction of justice as a result of his statement to state investigators that Scott was moving toward him with the Taser when he shot him.[includes indictment document] Slager pleaded not guilty, and a trial was scheduled to begin in May 2017. Slager faced up to life in prison if convicted. On , 2017, as part of a plea agreement, Slager pleaded guilty to deprivation of rights under color of law (18 USC ¬ß 242). In return for the guilty plea, the charges of obstructing justice and use of a firearm during a crime of violence were dismissed. On , 2017, U.S. District Judge David C. Norton sentenced Slager to 20 years in prison. Although defense attorneys had argued for voluntary manslaughter, the judge agreed with prosecutors that the \\"appropriate underlying offense\\" was second-degree murder. Because there is no parole in the federal justice system, Slager will likely remain in prison about 18 years after credit for time served in jail. He began serving his sentence in Colorado's Federal Correctional Institution, Englewood in February 2018. An appeal for reduction of sentence was denied in January 2019. As of 2020, Slager, Federal Bureau of Prisons #31292-171, is still at FCI Englewood; his earliest possible release is August 16, 2033. Civil settlement In an out-of-court settlement, the City of North Charleston agreed in October 2015 to pay to Scott's family.

Brandt Smith Jr. (born April 18, 1959), is an associate professor from Jonesboro, Arkansas, who is a Republican member of the Arkansas House of Representatives for District 58 in a portion of Craighead County in the northeastern portion of his state. ==Background== A native of Albuquerque, New Mexico, Smith was the son of Curtis Smith, Sr., a Southern Baptist pastor for forty years who earlier served in the United States Navy Reserve, the United States Army, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington, D.C. Mrs. Smith, the former Deloris Jean Williams, was a homemaker who was also employed by Wal-Mart. Smith's boyhood home, high school, and information prior to 1986 are not available, but his father, and presumably Smith as well, lived in a number of locations ranging from Panama City, Florida, to Birmingham, Alabama; Memphis, Tennessee, and Paragould, Arkansas. In 1990, Smith received a Bachelor of Arts from the National Louis University in Chicago, Illinois. In 1997, he obtained a master's degree in Religious Education from Mid-America Baptist Theological Seminary, in South Germantown, Tennessee, since relocated to Cordova, near Memphis, Tennessee.

In mid-November 2014, Iraqi forces retook the city of Baiji, and re-entered the Baiji Oil Refinery. However, clashes continued in the region, and on 21 December 2014, ISIL forces captured Baiji and put the Baiji Oil Refinery under siege once again. == Background == On 11 June 2014, ISIL insurgents advanced into Baiji, seizing the main court house and police station and setting them on fire. The militants, who were travelling in a group of around 60 vehicles, also took control of the Baiji prison and freed all the inmates within. Local residents told members of the media that ISIL sent a group of local tribal chiefs ahead of them to convince the 250 guards at the oil plant to withdraw, while soldiers and police had been warned to leave as well. Later in the day, militants reportedly retreated from Baiji either due to persuasion from local tribal leaders or due to reinforcements from the Iraqi Army's Fourth Armored Division arriving in the city. However, the next day it was confirmed ISIL was still in control of the town, except the refinery which was surrounded. On 18 June, ISIL attacked the refinery with mortars and machine guns. An official from inside the refinery stated the militants had captured 75 percent of the facility, while a military spokesman claimed the attack had been repelled with 40 insurgents being killed. On 19 June, Iraqi government forces claimed to have regained full control of the Baiji oil refinery, after heavy fighting that left 100 militants dead. An Iraqi witness who drove past the Baiji refinery told the Associated Press that ISIL had hung their banners from the watch towers and created checkpoints surrounding the facility, despite government claims of control. On 20 June, the town was still under complete control of the militants while the oil refinery was surrounded by ISIL forces and had once again come under attack. Iraqi security forces repelled several ISIL attempts to take the refinery between June and October 2014. == The battle ==  Advance into the city and to the refinery  On 29 October 2014, Iraqi government forces and allied militias advanced to within 2 km of the city of Baiji in an attempt to retake the city and break the siege of the refinery. On 31 October, the Iraqi forces entered the town and captured two neighborhoods before their operations were halted due to a triple ISIL suicide-attack, followed by a ground assault, on the Army headquarters at the Tikrit University further south. On 4 November, two British Royal Air Force Tornado GR4 aircraft flying in support of Iraqi ground forces attacked and destroyed an Islamic State pickup truck using a Brimstone missile. On 7 November, police Major General Faisal Ahmed was killed by a suicide truck-bomber in Baiji. Two days later, Iraqi forces took control of parts of the city. Using helicopters to attack the militants, they entered the city from the south and the west, and took over the city center and the al-Tamim neighbourhood. This left ISIL forces stranded between the city and the refinery, as Iraqi forces advanced slowly due to car-bomb attacks on the road. It was reported that Iraqi forces had control of 40% of the city center. Many residents said that there were non-stop clashes in the area. On 10 November 10, a British MQ-9 Reaper identified and attacked a group of ISIL militants which had been laying improvised explosive devices in the area. A single Hellfire air-to-surface missile was used to conduct the attack. On 11 November, an ISIL suicide-bomber killed eight people in Baiji. The bombing occurred after a large crowd of people gathered around soldiers who had taken parts of the city center. On 14 November, it was reported that the Army had taken full control of the city, forcing ISIL forces to withdraw, with their next target being the oil refinery. The next day, Iraqi forces reached the facility's gates, breaking the ISIL siege of the refinery. Three days later, state TV aired footage of soldiers entering the Baiji refinery for the first time in months. An Iraqi reporter said that the security forces had \\"made the refinery a graveyard\\" for ISIL. Later, the US Department of State congratulated the Iraqi forces for retaking the country's largest oil refinery. By this point, it seemed that the demoralized Iraqi Army had scored a badly needed, decisive victory.  Fighting continues and ISIL counterattack  By 25 November, fighting in the city center continued, with ISIL fighters still being present in four out of 12 of Baiji's neighborhoods. The militants were also continuing to hold positions at the refinery's perimeter. Between 13 and 18 December, ISIL recaptured seven neighborhoods, including the central part of the city, after Iraqi government forces retreated, due to a lack of support and ammunition. On 21 December, the ISIL jihadists recaptured the city and re-established a siege of the oil refinery, as Iraqi security forces continued to defend the main roads towards the Speicher military base and the Baiji Oil Refinery. == Aftermath == On 23 December 2014, Iraqi security forces and Shi'ite militias fighters launched an offensive on Baiji, after losing control of the city two days earlier. == See also == *Fall of Mosul *First Battle of Tikrit *Sinjar massacre *Siege of Amirli *Operation Ashura *Battle of Ramadi (2014‚Äì15) *December 2014 Sinjar offensive *November 2015 Sinjar offensive *Second Battle of Tikrit (March‚ÄìApril 2015) *List of wars and battles involving the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ==References * Operation Inherent Resolve airstrike updates Category:Conflicts in 2014 Category:Military operations of the Iraqi Civil War in 2014 Category:Military operations of the Iraqi Civil War involving the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Category:Military operations of the Iraqi Civil War involving the United States Category:Military operations of the Iraqi Civil War involving Quds Force Category:Military operations of the Iraqi Civil War involving Hezbollah Category:Military operations of the Iraqi Civil War involving Canada ","title":"Battle of Baiji (2014)"},{"id":"46346822","text":"Widow White Creek is a small tributary of Norton Creek in McKinleyville, California, that lies just south of the Arcata-Eureka Airport in Humboldt County.

A photograph of then-Labour Party leader Ed Miliband eating a bacon sandwich was the source of sustained commentary in 2014 and 2015. Taken for the Evening Standard newspaper while Miliband was campaigning for local elections in May 2014, it was said to make him look awkward, error-prone or incapable of performing simple tasks. It sparked several internet memes, both supportive and mocking, and fuelled a debate about the lengths to which politicians attempt to control their public image as well as criticism that the focus was motivated by antisemitism. Miliband dismissed the debate, arguing it was unimportant. Others, including opponents, described the media focus as unfair or part of a wider negative personality-based media campaign. The photo was used in a mocking front page of 'The Sun', the UK's most widely read newspaper, on the day before the 2015 general election. ==Photograph== The photograph was taken on 21 May 2014 by Jeremy Selwyn in London for the Evening Standard newspaper, during the first stop of Miliband's two-day campaign tour ahead of local and European elections. After arriving at New Covent Garden Market at 6.30am to promote his policies for small businesses, Miliband visited a cafe where he ate the sandwich. The Standard published the photographs as part of a gallery of 13 titled \\"Ed Miliband's Bacon Sandwich\\". It was accompanied by a story by political editor Joe Murphy, \\"Ed Miliband's battle with a bacon sandwich as he buys flowers for his wife at London market\\". Murphy's story began: Defending the photographs in December 2014, Selwyn said it was an unplanned shot, and that all politicians are \\"fair game\\" despite their press officers' strict controls on photography. ==Initial reactions== According to the tabloid newspaper The Daily Mirror writing two days after the event, the photograph of Miliband \\"struggling\\" to eat the bacon sandwich had immediately generated mockery and claimed it had made him \\"look a fool\\". In the ensuing week it became an Internet meme, with online users transposing it onto well-known images from history and popular culture, such as the Last Supper and When Harry Met Sally..., under the hashtag #EdEats. Publishing a selection of the parodies, The Daily Telegraph interpreted the incident as a backfired attempt by the Labour leader to look normal, claiming it was his awkward expression which sparked the parodies. On 19 May 2014, Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg was challenged by LBC host Nick Ferrari to eat a bacon sandwich live on air. Clegg expressed empathy with Miliband, saying: The Independent wrote on 21 May 2014 that \\"despite extensive stage-managing and with a seemingly simple task at hand, the Labour leader still struggled in his bid to look normal and back in touch with the general public\\", linking it to slip-ups which he had made in recent interviews. ==Subsequent references== Miliband reacted to the photograph on 25 July 2014 in a speech to party members, saying: In October 2014, UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage made headlines for eating a bacon sandwich while campaigning before the Heywood and Middleton by-election. In November 2014, The Independent writer Boyd Tonkin linked the media narrative around the photograph to antisemitism, stating that \\"His clumsy aversion to pork products betrays him as an alien, a member of some foreign tribe\\" while the media reported that Farage ate his sandwich better because \\"Nige is authentically one of us\\". On 6 May 2015, Keith Kahn-Harris wrote in The Guardian \\"contemporary antisemitism is often strange and difficult to pin down, often disappearing into a miasma of claims and counter-claims. This is yet another example.\\" Writing on 13 March 2015 in The Guardian, Labour activist Owen Jones said the popularity of the photograph was part of a right- wing media campaign against Miliband, stating that \\"The media have a wider narrative about Ed Miliband: sad pathetic geeky loser who cannot even eat a bacon sandwich with any dignity. You can easily select photographs to make any politician look undignified, or generally reinforce whatever narrative you have selected\\". In April 2018, Jones referred to the incident as \\"antisemitic dog-whistles\\". In April 2017, Miliband appeared on The Last Leg and was photographed with another bacon sandwich, while sitting on a motorbike in a leather jacket. The show's host, Adam Hills, said that this was because they needed \\"to create an alternative photo of Ed with a bacon sandwich and we need to get it trending [on Twitter]\\". 2015 general election campaign Parliament dissolved on 30 March, marking the official start of the campaign period for the 2015 general election, with polling day being on 7 May. On 7 April 2015, Prime Minister David Cameron ate a hot dog with a knife and fork. Although members of the public deemed him \\"posh\\" for doing this, The Independent offered the alternative suggestion that Cameron's campaign team were aiming for him to avoid looking like Miliband, which \\"may have been stage managed one step too far\\". The day before polling day, the tabloid newspaper The Sun used the full photo on its front page, partially super-imposed with the headline \\"Save Our Bacon\\", with bylines reading \\"This is the pig's ear Ed made of a helpless sarnie. In 48 hours, he could be doing the same to Britain\\" above, and \\"Don't swallow his porkies and keep him out\\". This was interpreted by The Independent as a front page \\"entirely dedicated to mocking the Labour leader over the infamous incident.\\" It sparked another Twitter trend in a show of support for the Labour leader, with users sharing photos of themselves eating bacon sandwiches and other food in a deliberately messy fashion, with the hashtag #JeSuisEd, a reference to Je Suis Charlie. Cameron's Conservatives won the general election with an unexpected overall majority. Following Labour's defeat, Miliband resigned as leader. It is unclear what effect, if any, the photograph had on the eventual result. 2017 general election campaign During the 2017 United Kingdom general election campaign, a picture of Theresa May eating chips was compared to the photo of Miliband eating the sandwich, to which Miliband tweeted to May, \\"we should talk...\\". ==See also== * *Piggate ==References== Category:Color photographs Category:Bacon sandwiches Category:Political Internet memes Category:2014 in London Category:Ed Miliband Category:2014 in British politics Category:2014 works Category:2014 in art Category:2010s photographs ","title":"Ed Miliband bacon sandwich photograph"},{"id":"46347041","text":"\\"What's in It for Me\\" is a song by John Berry.

The projects have been directed at reducing infant mortality, property crime, changing drug laws, adding anti- discrimination curricula to U.S. and international schools, and increasing voluntarism. Wishnow and his campaigns have received over 70 national and regional awards including a Peabody award, three Emmy awards, and four Presidential commendations. ==Career== Wishnow attended Northeastern University in Boston and earned a BA in English Journalism. As a student editor at Northeastern, he was physically threatened while covering the 1963 Selma, Alabama racial unrest. He later earned a Master of Journalism degree from Northwestern University in Evanston, IL in 1967. In 1967, he covered the \\"Summer of Love\\" in San Francisco for The Boston's Herald Traveler. He started his work at WBZ radio Boston in 1968 as a public affairs director and producer for The Jerry Williams Show. Wishnow later became creative services director producing public service campaigns which were designed to provide measurable help to the station's audience. In 1974, Wishnow founded The Wishnow Group, an activist public affairs firm based in Marblehead, Massachusetts. Wishnow provided the copyrighted name and assisted in the major market launch of AmeriCorps. Wishnow has worked with nonprofits including the Anti-Defamation League and the March of Dimes, University of Chicago Hospitals, and government agencies including US Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, US Law Enforcement Systems Association, and the US Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Wishnow has worked with corporate clients and underwriters, including American Express, Digital Equipment Corporation, Sears, Montgomery Ward and Blue Cross Blue Shield. ==WBZ public affairs campaigns== T-Group 15 In 1969, Wishnow produced an event which locked nine Boston African-American and white school decentralization activists, including Louise Day Hicks, a Bostonian politician and lawyer who strongly opposed court ordered busing and desegregation in public schools, together in a room for over 22 hours with microphones and cameras until compromises over the closing of a key black feeder school were reached. The result was broadcast on WBZ. An African-American and a white psychologist was present during the experiment and the participants were given cues in a \\"sensitizing\\" environment to direct the discussion. The project was named \\"T-Group 15.\\" The 11-hour edited broadcast included four hours of live audience reaction with the participants and was aired on WBZ for 15 hours without commercials. Rush Hour Rescue Wishnow worked with ALA Auto & Travel Club of Wellesley, Massachusetts and WBZ radio to develop a service which included a van that provided free emergency road service for cars that broke down on major area highways. Commuter Computer \\"Commuter Computer\\" was a service created by Wishnow and Jerry Swerling, a public relations director of ALA Auto & Travel Club. Listeners sent in forms with their schedules and locations. A computer matched them up with ten people who had similar carpooling needs. Tens of thousands of people joined the effort. The project sparked carpool campaigns in Chicago, Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne, Indiana, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Baltimore and Miami. Stomp Smoking Wishnow produced a community anti-smoking campaign developed by a team of physicians to provide information and emotional support. In addition to regular PSA's and broadcasts on WBZ, the station personalities went through their own smoking withdrawal on the air live with listeners. The project also featured access to a 24-hour telephone hot-line, anti-smoking clinics, and community-centered support. Shape-up Boston \\"Shape-up Boston\\" was a six-month-long campaign created by Wishnow. It centered on the issues of diet exercise and nutrition. The campaign featured signed and notarized \\"Stomp Smoking\\" oaths. The project was later replicated as \\"Go to Health\\" at ABC radio in Los Angeles with support from Sears. WBZ Drug Bill Another project Wishnow produced was aimed at providing junior high and high school students, teachers, and parents with information on substance abuse. A family of six with serious drug issues took part in on-air drug counseling. In 1972, on-air audience discussions guided by expert attorneys led to the drafting of legislation which came to be known as the \\"WBZ Drug Bill,\\" which was passed by Massachusetts State Legislature. The bill lightened penalties for possession of marijuana and led to reduction in jail sentences as a punishment for first and second offenders. ==Wishnow Group public affair campaigns== H.O.T. Car \\"Hands off This Car\\" (\\"H.O.T. Car\\") was a community-based program Wishnow produced for WNAC-TV (CBS) Boston to reduce car theft by providing the public with information and a free kit including tapered door locks, kill switches, and engraving tools designed to protect cars from theft. If a car was stolen, the program provided free on-air stolen car reports and cash rewards. The project expanded nationally through the Montgomery Ward auto club and participating network owned and affiliated TV stations where it reached over 51 US markets. The project was credited with reducing auto-theft by an average of 26%. For Spacious Skies Wishnow joined with Jack Borden, former news reporter for WBZ-TV Boston, to create the \\"For Spacious Skies\\" campaign, established in 1981. The campaign focused on increasing awareness of the sky visibility as a way to reduce air pollution. Dr. Leonard Duhl, a psychiatrist at U.C. Berkeley reported that sensory detachment from the environment is a major factor in personal and social ill health. The board for the campaign included photographer Ansel Adams. Efforts for the campaign were funded through grants from the Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Department of Energy. As part of the push to gain awareness, \\"The Conference on the Sky,\\" a three-day facilitated meeting, was held on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. The conference included meteorologists, astronomers, photographers, musicians, writers, environmentalists, psychologists, pilots, and other professionals whose careers were connected to the sky. The project is ongoing under Borden's leadership. Priority One  \\"Priority One\\" was a year-long comprehensive property crime prevention project designed to provide the public with education and tools to make their homes and neighborhoods more secure. Wishnow produced the project in cooperation with WNAC-TV (CBS) Boston and the Massachusetts Police Chiefs Association. Local police patrolman in hundreds of Massachusetts cities and towns personally knocked on doors of every house or apartment within their jurisdiction and presented a free kit containing anti- theft information and devices including special locks and engraving tools. GTE and Stop & Shop provided blue light bulbs that participants could display in their windows once they had hardened up their homes. The project received a National Emmy award. A World of Difference \\"A World of Difference,\\" a year-long project was created by Wishnow with WCVB TV for the Anti-Defamation League's New England director Lenny Zakim was first tested in Boston. IT was designed to stem acts of bigotry in schools and communities with PSA's and hours of special programming. It centered on a national and locally created curriculum guidebook initially published by The Boston Globe. The year-long campaign was then brought to 30 additional markets. It was broadcast through network owned and affiliate TV stations reaching over 70% of the country. The project, and its K‚Äì12 curriculum, now in 14 countries in addition to the United States, continues through the Anti-defamation League. The campaign has won Wishnow a part in two Emmy awards for community service, as well as a Peabody award. Beautiful Babies: Right From the Start \\"Beautiful Babies ... Right from the Start\\" was a Wishnow created project to combat infant mortality. The campaign was tested in 1987 in Washington at WRC TV (NBC) with the March of Dimes and Blue Cross Blue Shield. Pregnant women could receive a free coupon book for baby care and supplies worth hundreds of dollars. The books were made available at drugstores, medical clinics, by phone and mailed out by the March of Dimes. They included emergency numbers and steps for good perinatal health. The coupons could only be used when stamped after each monthly prenatal care visit by a qualified medical personnel. This process and the accompanying media saturation was credited with increasing all-important compliance to care. There was a 7% decrease in infant mortality in Washington, DC. The project was replicated in Chicago with the University of Chicago hospitals and WBBM TV. == Publications == He authored the book The Activist: How to Create Measurable Public Affairs Projects which was edited by Paul La Camera and published by the National Broadcast Association for Community Affairs in 1983. ==Personal life== Wishnow lives in Marblehead, Massachusetts with his wife, Pei Pei Wu, PhD. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American activists Category:American non-fiction writers Category:Northeastern University alumni Category:Northwestern University alumni ","title":"Jerry Wishnow"},{"id":"46347069","text":"The Hamburg Football Association (), the HFV, is one of 21 state organisations of the German Football Association, the DFB, and covers the state of Hamburg and some parts of southern Schleswig-Holstein.Regional Associations DFB website - Map and details of the regional associations, accessed: 8 April 2015 ==Overview== DFB, its five regional and 21 state associations The HFV is also part of the Northern German Football Association, one of five regional federations in Germany.

The screenplay was written by Matt Fleckenstein with additional screenplay material by Ben Gluck. The film stars Tyler Perry as the voice of Madea, and was produced by Perry, Matt Moore, and Ozzie Areu. It was released on January 20, 2015. While the film is mainly animated, the beginning and ending scenes however are live-action like the other Madea films. ==Plot== In the live-action world, Madea is watching television while eating her breakfast. After wishing she could discipline the kids in the animated show she is watching, she is transported into the cartoon. In the animated world, Madea chases a group of rude and unruly skateboarders, a chase that the police soon join. Madea elicits an apology from the skateboarders, but is subsequently arrested by the police. Madea is placed under house arrest and sentenced to community service at her old school. Madea attends the school's gym class, and is horrified at the kids‚Äô raucous behavior. Madea locks the children in a cage, but the children protest, claiming they have to practice to win a local sporting event and its cash prize. The police are alerted to Madea's actions and return her home. That evening, Madea returns to the school to find her purse. She encounters two of the children, Netta and Dang Dang, who are also looking for the purse. After learning the children are homeless, Madea takes them home with her. Madea makes the children breakfast in the morning, but after learning Madea is planning to call social services Netta and Dang Dang leave. Madea finds Netta and Dang Dang playing basketball with the other children at Moms Mabley Community Center, a local youth center in Freedom Park. However, the center is condemned by Betsy Holiday, a mayoral candidate for Atlanta. Holiday details her plans to construct new buildings and make the city's neighborhoods safe for children. However, Madea distrusts Holiday's intentions. Madea takes the children to Chastain Park, which has since been repurposed into a shopping mall, and explains this is what Holiday intends to do with their youth center. Madea breaks into Holiday's headquarters and confronts her. Madea learns Holiday also has a team entering the sporting event, the ‚ÄúChastain Park Players.‚Äù Madea rallies the children together. They ultimately defeat the Chastain Park Players in the sporting event and win the $25,000 prize, which they will use to save the youth center. Madea and the children celebrate, but Holiday steals the check and speeds away, with Madea and the police able to catch her. The youth center is saved, and Madea, her brother Joe, and her best friend Aunt Bam are watching a friendly basketball game, while Betsy Holiday is seen doing community service. She implies that she is happier now that she is not running for mayor or working for bosses anymore, but Madea teases her by throwing chips on the floor. Back in the live-action world, Madea wakes up back at her kitchen table eating breakfast, wondering if the whole thing was a dream. == Cast== *Tyler Perry as Madea / Joe / Brian *Cassi Davis as Aunt Bam *Rolonda Watts as Betsy Holiday *Avery Kidd Waddell as Officer Fred *Philip Anthony-Rodriguez as Officer Frank *Georg Stanford Brown as Mystery Man *Kevin Michael Richardson as Judge Michaels *Mari Williams as Netta *Indigo as Dang Dang *Caitlyn Taylor Love as Wheels / Chris *Maya Kay as Lacy *Bootsy Collins as Homeless Man *Kate Higgins as Yoshi ==Reception== Brian Orndorf of Blu-ray.com gave the film a five out of ten, saying \\"Tough Love plays to the Perry fanbase, featuring cameos by Madea‚Äôs brother Joe and Aunt Bam (Cassi Davis), and keeps its street cred with a finale that includes a chase between two cars fitted with hydraulics.

They are members of the Carolina League and are the Class A-Advanced affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers. They play their home games at Five County Stadium. The franchise originated in 1978 as the Kinston Eagles of Kinston, North Carolina. In 2012 they relocated to Zebulon amid a series of purchases and moves, and took up the name of the previous Carolina Mudcats team. ==Franchise history== Carolina Mudcats at Five County Stadium Montreal withdrew from Kinston following the season. With no major league sponsor and very little fan support, Kinston likewise withdrew from the Carolina League. By 1978, the Carolina League decided to expand back to 12 teams due to a renewed fan interest in baseball as well as the introduction of two new major league teams. Former airline pilot Ray Kuhlman brought minor league baseball back to Kinston by investing in one of the new Carolina League franchises. The Kinston Eagles were unaffiliated for their first season back in the circuit in . By the next campaign, they were associated with the Toronto Blue Jays. Toronto stayed with Kinston for seven years, and the team eventually took on the Blue Jays name. Kinston did not win any championships during the Blue Jays years. Kuhlman and his wife ran the team themselves and saw steady annual increases in attendance each year. Following the season, the Blue Jays dropped Kinston as a franchise, and professional baseball in the city seemed to be in doubt once again. There was talk of moving the franchise to Charles County, Maryland, but the city remained in the Carolina League with an independent ball club that took on the Eagles name. The season proved to be disappointing in the standings and at the gate, and talk of a move was renewed, but ownership secured an affiliation with the Cleveland Indians during the off season. For 25 years, Cleveland and the KTribe, as they came to be known, enjoyed a successful partnership which produced 17 playoff appearances and five Carolina League championships (, , , , and ). The value of the team rose along with its onfield success. In , Kuhlman sold the team for $100,000. The franchise was sold again in for $225,000, and changed hands again in for $750,000. The team's value in was estimated at $1.5 million. Six figure attendance totals became the norm throughout the 1990s and into the new century. In , the Indians won the Southern Division crown for both halves of the year, but they lost in the first round of the playoffs to the wild card team, the Salem Avalanche. It was the seventh season in a row that the Indians made the postseason, which was a new Carolina League record formerly held by the Burlington Bees (‚Äì). Kinston's player development contract with Cleveland ended following the 2011 season. In 2012, the Indians moved the franchise to Zebulon, North Carolina, as part of a complicated series of moves and purchases by Pensacola businessman Quint Studer. Studer purchased the existing Carolina Mudcats of the Southern League, relocating them to Pensacola as the Pensacola Blue Wahoos. To seal this purchase, Studer had to facilitate the move of the Kinston team to Zebulon, where they took up the Mudcats name and branding. The Mudcats name and branding has existed in Zebulon, North Carolina since 1991, but was launched in Columbus, Georgia, two years prior as the Columbus Mudcats. In Zebulon, the Double-A franchise was first affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates; its affiliation eventually passed to the Colorado Rockies, Florida Marlins, and Cincinnati Reds with whom the franchise was affiliated when it was moved to Pensacola. The Class A Mudcats' initial affiliation with Cleveland was inherited from the predecessor Kinston Indians' established relationship with the Cleveland club. In October 2017, the Mudcats were purchased by the Milwaukee Brewers, who entered into a player development contract with the team before the season. ==RosterNotable alumni== Baseball Hall of Fame alumni * Rick Ferrell (1926) Inducted, 1984 * Jim Thome (1990) Inducted, 2018 Notable alumni * Edwin Rodr√≠guez, Manager * Cody Allen, Pitcher for the Cleveland Indians (2011) * Doyle Alexander (1983) MLB All-Star * Jesse Barfield (1979) MLB All-Star * Gordon Beckham * David Bell (1992) * Albert Belle (1987-1988) 5 x MLB All-Star; 1995 AL HR Leader; 3 x AL RBI Leader (1993, 1995-1996) * Ger√≥nimo Berroa (1985) * Steve Blass (1962) MLB All-Star * Ron Blomberg (1968) * Pat Borders (1985) 1992 World Series MVP * Russell Branyan (1997) * Sean Casey (1996) 3 x MLB All-Star * Bartolo Col√≥n (1995) 4 x MLB All-Star; 2005 Cy Young Award * Mark Eichhorn (1980) * Doc Ellis (1965) MLB All-Star * Alan Embree (1992) * Cecil Fielder (1984) 3 x MLB All-Star; 2 x AL HR Leader (1990-1991); 3 x AL RBI Leader (1990-1992) * Tony Fernandez (1980-1981) 5 x MLB All-Star * Brian Giles (1991) 2 x MLB All-Star * Ron Guidry (1973) 4 x MLB All-Star; 2 x AL ERA Leader (1978-1979);1977 AL Cy Young Award * Mike Hargrove (1986, MGR) MLB All-Star; 1974 AL Rookie of the Year * Roberto Hernandez (2004) MLB All-Star * Glenallen Hill (1985) * Tyler Holt * T.J.

The franchise comprises a three-part award-winning documentary film series directed by Bernard MacMahon, a feature-length musical documentary film, a book, ten album releases and an educational program. American Epic is widely considered as the definitive portrait of the musical era, and one of the best music documentaries ever made. The American Epic documentary series was first broadcast from May 16‚Äì30, 2017 on the BBC in the United Kingdom and on PBS in the USA. The story is told through twelve ethnically and musically diverse musicians who auditioned for and participated in these pioneering recording sessions; The Carter Family, the Memphis Jug Band, Elder J.E. Burch, The Williamson Brothers, Dick Justice, Charley Patton, The Hopi Indian Chanters, Joseph Kekuku, Lydia Mendoza, the Breaux Family, Mississippi John Hurt, and Blind Willie Johnson. The American Epic Sessions was first broadcast on June 6, 2017. It is a documentary film in which an engineer restores the fabled long-lost first electrical sound recording system from 1925, and twenty contemporary artists pay tribute to the momentous machine by attempting to record songs on it for the first time in 80 years. The film was directed and co-written by Bernard MacMahon and stars Nas, Alabama Shakes, Elton John, Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Jack White, Taj Mahal, Ana Gabriel, Pokey LaFarge, Beck, Ashley Monroe, and Steve Martin. A book, American Epic: The First Time America Heard Itself was published on May 2, 2017. It was collaborative memoir written by film director Bernard MacMahon, producer Allison McGourty, and music historian Elijah Wald, chronicling the 10-year odyssey researching and making the American Epic documentary series and The American Epic Sessions films. American Epic: The Collection was released on May 12, 2017 - a 5 CD box set of 100 songs featuring one track by each of the hundred artists researched as potential subjects for the American Epic films. On the same day American Epic: The Soundtrack was released compiling 14 vintage and 1 contemporary performance featured in the American Epic documentaries. On June 9, 2017, Music from The American Epic Sessions was released, featuring contemporary artists recording live on the restored first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s.

The albums were American Epic: The Best of Mississippi John Hurt, American Epic: The Best of The Carter Family, American Epic: The Best of Blind Willie Johnson, American Epic: The Best of Memphis Jug Band along with American Epic: The Best of Lead Belly who was not featured in the film. These releases were accompanied by two genre compilations; American Epic: The Best of Blues and American Epic: The Best of Country. The albums were released as digital downloads with truncated versions issued on vinyl. In the fall of 2017 an educational program based on the American Epic film series was launched at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. == Documentary series == American Epic is a documentary film series about the first recordings of roots music in the United States during the 1920s and their cultural, social and technological impact on North America and the world. Directed and co-written by Bernard MacMahon, the story is told through twelve ethnically and musically diverse musicians who auditioned for and participated in these pioneering recording sessions; The Carter Family, the Memphis Jug Band, Elder J.E. Burch, The Williamson Brothers, Dick Justice, Charley Patton, The Hopi Indian Chanters, Joseph Kekuku, Lydia Mendoza, the Breaux Family, Mississippi John Hurt, and Blind Willie Johnson. The film was the result of ten years of intensive field research and postulated a radically new take on American history, namely that America was democratized through the invention of electrical sound recording and the subsequent auditions the record labels held across North America in the late 1920s, which were open to every ethnic minority and genre of music. The films contained many previously untold stories, a vast amount of previously unseen and extremely rare archival footage and dramatically advanced audio restorations of the 1920s and 1930s recordings. MacMahon decided all the interviewees had to personally have known the long-deceased subjects of the films and these interviews were conducted on location where the musicians had livedAmerican Epic#Bibliography Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, pp. 3-5 accompanied by panoramic tracking shots of the geographical locations both present and vintage to give a sense of the wildly varied North American landscape and its influence on the music. During pre-production, when MacMahon presented his vision for the films and the archival footage to Robert Redford at their first meeting, Redford pronounced it ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs greatest untold story.‚Äù The film series received a number of awards, including the Foxtel Audience Award at the 2016 Sydney Film Festival, the Discovery Award at the 2016 Calgary International Film Festival, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy. On April 23, 2018, the Focal International Awards nominated American Epic for Best Use of Footage in a History Feature and Best Use of Footage in a Music Production. Many critics have cited the American Epic films as being one of the best music documentaries ever made.

The film was directed and co-written by Bernard MacMahon and stars Nas, Alabama Shakes, Elton John, Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Jack White, Taj Mahal, Ana Gabriel, Pokey LaFarge, Beck, Ashley Monroe and Steve Martin. The film employed a diverse line-up of performers, both ethnically and musically, to represent the breadth of cultures that were first given a national platform through the invention of this recording machine. It also explored the extent to which the recordings made on it in the 1920s influenced and inspired contemporary music. The film involved a decade of work restoring the machine, which was pieced together from spare parts scattered across the globe, in order to better understand the origins of modern recording technology,[1] Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, pp. 238-239[1] Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, p. 243 and the influence the machine had on world culture. The machine would go on to put sound on talking pictures. Prior to the release of The American Epic Sessions, the recording system was mysterious and had not been seen in almost 80 years.[1] Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, pp. 235-237 Engineer Nicholas Bergh who reassembled and restored the machine explained, ‚ÄúI had two mentors when I was getting into audio who started their careers in the late 1930s in America and both of them told me that even by the late ‚Äò30s this system was basically mythical and they had never seen any components of it or even pictures. So even in ten years it had basically disappeared off the face of the earth.‚Äù The recreation of a live 1920s-style recording session in the film explored the essence of what makes a great recorded performance.[1] Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, p. 261 The film received widespread acclaim for its direction, musical performances, sound and cinematography. The film won the Discovery Award and the Audience Award at the Calgary International Film Festival, was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award, Bernard MacMahon and Allison McGourty were nominated as Breakthrough Talents by the British Academy Film Awards and the film won a Grammy Award for the Alabama Shakes performance of ‚ÄúKiller Diller Blues‚Äù.

The book chronicles the 10-year odyssey researching and making the American Epic films. It features interviews with subjects of the films and contains supplementary information and photographs not featured in the documentary films or the music releases. The book and an audiobook was released on May 2, 2017. The book was the winner of the 2017 Association for Recorded Sound Collections Award. == Soundtrack and albums == The American Epic films were accompanied by 10 music releases. These included American Epic: The Collection - a 5-CD box set of 100 songs featuring one track by each of the hundred artists researched as potential subjects for the American Epic films. American Epic: The Soundtrack which released featured performances from the American Epic documentaries. Music from The American Epic Sessions featured contemporary artists recording live on the restored first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s. The album contained 32 performances recorded for The American Epic Sessions film. A series of compilations were released of artists featured in the American Epic documentary films. The albums were: American Epic: The Best of Mississippi John Hurt, American Epic: The Best of The Carter Family, American Epic: The Best of Blind Willie Johnson, American Epic: The Best of the Memphis Jug Band along with American Epic: The Best of Lead Belly who was not featured in the film series. These releases were accompanied by two genre compilations: American Epic: The Best of Blues and American Epic: The Best of Country. The Best Of albums were released as digital downloads with truncated versions issued on vinyl. New sound restoration techniques developed for the American Epic film production were utilized to restore the songs on the albums. The 78rpm disc transfers were made by sound engineer Nicholas Bergh using reverse engineering techniques, garnered from working with the original 1920s recording equipment on The American Epic Sessions, along with meticulous sound restoration undertaken by Peter Henderson and Joel Tefteller to reveal greater fidelity, presence, and clarity to these 1920s and 30s recordings than had ever been heard before. Nicholas Bergh commented, ‚Äúthe recordings in this set are special since they utilize the earliest and simplest type of electric recording equipment used for commercial studio work. As a result, they have an unrivaled immediacy to the sound.‚Äù Some of the recordings were repressed from the original metal parts, which the production located whilst researching the films.[1] Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, p. 29 Peter Henderson explained ‚Äúin some cases we were lucky enough to get some metal parts ‚Äì that‚Äôs the originals where they were cut to wax and the metal was put into the grooves and the discs were printed from those back in the ‚Äò20s. Some of those still exist ‚Äì Sony had some of them in their vaults.‚Äù The releases won particular acclaim for the song selection and the sound quality of the transfers of vintage 78rpm records. == Educational program == In September 2017 the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools announced a nine-month preschool to high school educational program based on the American Epic films beginning on October 6, 2017. The school, founded by American educator John Dewey in 1896, has over 2,015 students enrolled in 15 grades. Lab Board Chair David Kistenbroker stated ‚Äúthe program is designed to further Lab's mission by bringing practicing artists to campus, in various capacities, to work directly with Lab students.‚Äù The program featured director of the film Bernard MacMahon and producer and co-writer Allison McGourty as Artists-in-Residence. \\"The artist in residence concept‚Äîsuccessfully tested in other ways at Lab‚Äîhas the potential to ignite creativity in entirely new and unexpected ways,\\" said Mr. Kistenbroker. \\"By working side-by-side with leading artistic practitioners, our students and our faculty benefit. It is absolutely consistent with how John Dewey envisioned a community of learners.\\" ==References==  Notes   Bibliography  * Wald, Elijah & McGourty, Allison & MacMahon, Bernard.

They began playing in the NCAA's Division I-A in 2001, became a football only member of the Sun Belt Conference in 2004, and joined that conference for all other sports in 2005. Troy University's athletics nickname was the Red Wave until the early 1970s when the student body voted to change the name to Trojans. Prior to becoming a member of NCAA Division One athletics in 1993, Troy University was a member of the Gulf South Conference of the NCAA Division II ranks. At the time, Troy's primary rivals were Jacksonville State University, Livingston University (now the University of West Alabama), and the University of North Alabama. The rivalry between Troy and Jacksonville State was arguably the fiercest of those. However, since Troy University moved to Division I-A participation in football and because Troy and JSU no longer share the same conference affiliation, this once heated rivalry has cooled significantly. Troy has Sun Belt rivalries with all East Division schools (Appalachian State, Coastal Carolina, Georgia Southern, Georgia State, and South Alabama). Currently, the Trojans' most prominent rival in all sports is their main Sun Belt rival, South Alabama. ==Sports sponsored== A member of the Sun Belt Conference, Troy sponsors teams in eight men's and nine women's NCAA sanctioned sports. {  style=\\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\\" - -  Baseball  Basketball -  Basketball  Cross country -  Cross country  Golf -  Football  Soccer -  Golf  Softball -  Tennis  Tennis -  Track & field‚Ä†  Track & field‚Ä† -   Volleyball -  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"\\"  } Men Football Troy University has fielded a football team continuously since 1946. Troy has won national championships at the NAIA level in 1968 and at the NCAA Division II level in 1984 and 1987. Troy Trojans football player Gary Banks during a game in October 2007 Troy University football began playing in the NCAA's Division I-A in 2001, became a football only member of the Sun Belt Conference in 2004, and joined that conference for all other sports in 2005. In 2001, Troy defeated Mississippi State University in Starkville, Mississippi to notch the Trojans' first victory over a BCS level program. On September 9, 2004, the Trojans garnered the program's first win over a ranked opponent when they defeated then #17 ranked Missouri, 24-14, upsetting former Heisman-hopeful Brad Smith's Heisman Trophy chances. Three years later in 2007, the Trojans routed Oklahoma State at home by a score of 41-23. The Trojan football team made its first bowl game appearance in the Silicon Valley Football Classic against Northern Illinois University on December 30, 2004, but lost. The Trojans won their first bowl game on December 20, 2006 at the New Orleans Bowl against Rice University by a score of 41-17. The football program won five straight Sun Belt titles from 2006 to 2010, finishing their run in 2010 with a New Orleans Bowl win over Ohio by a score of 48-21. At the end of the 2014 season, longtime head coach Larry Blakeney retired from coaching. He finished his career at Troy with a 178-113-1 record, 8 conference championships, and 5 bowl appearances. He was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 2009. Current head coach Neal Brown was hired following Blakeney's retirement. After starting his first season ever as a head coach in 2015, going 4-8, he led a monumental turnaround for the football program in the 2016 season, as the Trojan finished 10-3, including a 28-23 win over Ohio in the Dollar General Bowl. During that season, Troy cracked the AP Top 25 for the first time since the program joined the FBS in 2001. Troy was also the first football program in the Sun Belt Conference to ever receive a Top 25 ranking. The Trojans football team has won three national titles: 1968 (NAIA), 1984 (Div. II), and 1987 (Div. II). Basketball The Troy University men's basketball team is currently under the direction of head coach Phil Cunningham.

The Trojans' faced 3-seed Xavier in the first round, but the Trojans lost 71‚Äì59. They finished the 2003 season with a 26-6 overall record. In their most recent post-season appearance in 2010, the Trojans won the Sun Belt Conference regular-season title but lost in the conference tournament final. Because of this, Troy made its way back to the NIT for the second time since 2004, falling to Ole Miss in the first round. The Trojan basketball team is recognized in recent Division I Basketball history for leading the nation in three-pointers from 2004 to 2006, making 1068 three-pointers over the course of 89 games (11.66 per game) during those three seasons. Troy's most famous claim to fame, however, is their game against DeVry Institute of Atlanta on January 12, 1992 when the Trojans came out victorious by the NCAA-record score of 258‚Äì141.

Despite the shorter history of the women's team, they've established themselves as proven winners. The women have been extremely successful recently, capturing three Sun Belt Conference titles and also receiving an individual at-large NCAA Regional berth for player F√°tima Fern√°ndez Cano in 2016. Cross Country The women's cross country team was dominant while a member of the Gulf South Conference, winning the conference title five-straight years from 1982 to 1986. ==Defunct Programs== Rodeo Troy University had one of the top collegiate rodeo programs in the nation during its existence. In 2007, Troy calf roper Ben Mayworth won the calf roping national championship at the National Finals College Rodeo in Casper, Wyoming. The rodeo program's home facility was the Pike County Cattlemen's Arena in Troy where it hosted a three-day rodeo each October that featured college rodeo programs from throughout the southern region of the United States. The university discontinued its rodeo program at the end of the 2014 season. ==National Championships== Troy has won 14 NCAA national championships across five different sports, as well as 2 NAIA national championships.

Once a popular Swiss wrestler, Sommer now tinkers with his bottle ships and wants to be left alone. However, Hiro (Lo√Øc Sho G√ºntensperger) does not respect Sommer's seclusive live. When Hiro's grandmother, the owner of Sommer's apartment, unexpectedly dies, the boy asks Sommer to accompany him to the south of Japan where Hiro intends to attend a school for Sumo wrestlers. Sommer does not intend to fulfill Hiro's wish, concluded with his past. But the little boy is just as stubborn as Sommer; after Hiro threatens him with terminating his lease, the old man fulfills the boy's wish. Sommer leaves Switzerland for the first time in his life, and the two travel to Japan to start developing a strong friendship. == Title == The title of the film refers to the German surname Sommer, and to the German word for \\"summer\\".

The film stars Jesse Cornplanter of the Seneca people and Soon-goot, a 17-year-old unknown actress.\\"Unspoiled Indians in True Portrayals\\", New York Dramatic Mirror, April 9, 1913, p. 31. The movie is the first feature film to use a cast of Native Americans. ==Plot== The story begins along the Lake Superior Michigan shoreline with the appearance of a mighty spirit that tells the Native Americans a peacekeeper will bring wisdom and unite the warring tribes. Hiawatha is born to Wenonah and after her death her mother Nokomis raises the child. Hiawatha becomes an excellent hunter and later weds Minnehaha, but she dies during a severe winter. The final episodic adventure tells of the arrival of the \\"Black Robe\\" or missionary who brings Christianity to the Native Americans. Hiawatha welcomes him and proclaims the real prophet has arrived. As Hiawatha bids farewell to the warriors, he tells them to listen to the words of the missionary and then departs forever toward the sunset. ==Production== Jesse Cornplanter (center) in Hiawatha (1913). Producer Frank E. Moore had previously staged the outdoor spectacle Hiawatha: The Indian Passion Play for nearly a decade before he launched his filmed version. Newspapers reported that 150 \\"full-blooded\\" Seneca of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Confederacy) from the Cattaraugus Reservation in upstate New York participated in the movie's production. For the lead role of Hiawatha, Moore hired Seneca actor-turned-artist Jesse Cornplanter, who later collaborated as an illustrator with ethnographer/archaeologist Arthur C. Parker and was the author of Legends of the Longhouse (1938). Jesse Cornplanter was a descendant of the 18th-century Seneca war chief and diplomat Cornplanter The Anglo- American musical theater conductor John Joseph Braham, Sr. composed the musical score for Hiawatha. Braham would later compose the score for the 1913 Edward S. Curtis film, In the Land of the Head Hunters.Obituary of John Joseph Braham, Sr., The New York Times, October 29, 1919. The movie's cinematographer Victor Milner suggested to Moore that Edgar Lewis, a former stage actor, should direct. Milner said that to achieve a superimposition of two images, he had to shoot the visioning of the famine of death on a separate negative and double print it. Although other silent versions of Hiawatha existed before 1913, Moore's film was the first to use a cast of Native American actors. In 1909, Carl Laemmle, who founded Independent Moving Pictures (later absorbed into Universal Studios) had released an earlier one-reel version of Hiawatha. Years later Laemmle acknowledged that his \\"white cast smeared with bronze paint\\" was a target for ridicule. Laemmle's story ended with Hiawatha and Minnehaha happily embracing, but Moore's Hiawatha follows Longfellow's poem in which Minnehaha dies and Hiawatha welcomes the arrival of the missionary, who converts the Native Americans to the Christian faith. In 1910, Laemmle followed up his 1909 version of Hiawatha with the sequel, The Death of Minnehaha.\\"The Death of Minehaha\\", Moving Picture World, March 12, 1910, p. 384. ==Reception== Hiawatha opened at New York City's Berkeley theater where it achieved \\"splendid sales\\", according to the Moving Picture News.\\"Hiawatha Selling Fast\\", Moving Picture News, May 24, 1913. Moore distributed Hiawatha selling the film by states rights to 12 states.Billboard, May 23, 1913. A review in Moving Picture World praised the film and said: In April 1913, both the American Museum of Natural History and the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society jointly presented Hiawatha at the museum with a simultaneous reading of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem during the film's projection. The museum had lent Moore its expertise for the film and believed that Hiawatha had ethnographically redeeming features and educational appeal. One of the movie's highlights was a healing ritual of the sacred Iroquois False Face Society. Hiawatha was originally four reels, or 40 minutes. The Motion Picture, Broadcasting & Recorded Sound Division in the Library of Congress owns only an abridged copy of the film. ==References* *Jesse Cornplanter * Category:American silent feature films Category:Films based on works by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American drama films Category:1913 drama films Category:1913 films ","title":"Hiawatha (1913 film)"},{"id":"46347661","text":"Rachmad Hidayat (born 10 March 1992, in Medan) is an Indonesian professional footballer who plays for Liga 2 club PSMS Medan as a attacking midfielder. ==Career== Rachmad started his career in Putra Muda Soccer School in Medan, then, Rachmad moved to Medan United Academy.

By long and relentless fighting, he sought to rebuild the Mongol Empire of his predecessors.Beatrice Forbes Manz, \\"Tem√ºr and the Problem of a Conqueror's Legacy,\\" Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Third Series, Vol. 8, No. 1 (Apr., 1998), 25; \\"In his formal Temur continued throughout his life as the restorer of Chinggisid rights.

Prior to attacking Syrian cities, Timur had initially sent an ambassador to Damascus who was executed by the city's Mamluk viceroy, Sudun. In 1400, he started a war with the Mamluk sultan of Egypt Nasir-ad-Din Faraj and invaded Mamluk Syria. Timur's forces took Aleppo in November 1400. He massacred many of the inhabitants, ordering the building of a tower of 20,000 skulls outside the city.Battle of Aleppo@Everything2.com. After taking Aleppo, Timur continued his advance where he took Hama, along with nearby Homs and Baalbek,le Strange, 1890, p.xxiii. and besieged Damascus. ==Battle== An army led by the Mamluk Sultan Nasir-ad-Din Faraj was defeated by Timur outside Damascus leaving the city at the mercy of the Mongol besiegers.Margaret Meserve, Empires of Islam in Renaissance Historical Thought, (Harvard University Press, 2008), 207. With his army defeated, the Mamluk sultan dispatched a deputation from Cairo, including Ibn Khaldun, who negotiated with him, but after their withdrawal he put the city to sack. One particularly distressing incident, verified by independent eye witnesses, was the burning of the famous Umayyad mosque and many others. Noted imams and religious priests went to Timur and asked for his mercy in the name of Allah. He falsely assured them to take shelter in mosques with their women and children. When thus they totalled more than 30,000 people; he got the doors locked and burnt them alive. The Umayyad Mosque was burnt and men and women taken into slavery. A huge number of the city's artisans were taken to Timur's capital at Samarkand. These were the luckier citizens: many were slaughtered and their heads piled up in a field outside the north-east corner of the walls, where a city square still bears the name burj al-ru'us, originally the tower of heads. ==Aftermath== After the capture of Damascus, Timur's Neo Mongol empire now bordered another emerging power in the region, the Ottoman Empire. The two powers soon came into direct conflict. Bayezid demanded tribute from one of the Anatolian Beyliks who had pledged loyalty to Timur and threatened to invade.Tucker, Spencer C. (2010) Battles That Changed History: An Encyclopedia of World Conflict. ABC-ClIO; p. 140 Timur interpreted this action as an insult to himself and in 1400 sacked the Ottoman city of Sebaste (modern Sivas). Timur would later go on to defeat the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid at the Battle of Ankara. ==ReferencesBibliography== *.

He is noted for being the first chaplain of the Legislative Council of Upper Canada, for being the first Anglican priest in what is now Ontario, for building the first church in what is now Kingston, Ontario, and for opening the first grammar school in Upper Canada. ==Early life== John Stuart was born near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in 1740. After graduating from the College of Philadelphia in 1763 he taught school, but returned to the college to complete a master's degree. He converted from Presbyterianism to Anglicanism and was ordained by the Bishop of London as a deacon, and later, as a priest. Stuart married Jane Okill in 1775 and they would have eight children. ==Missionary to the Mohawks== Upon receiving an appointment from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel he was assigned as a missionary to the Mohawks at Fort Hunter, New York. His work of serving the people in his chapel at Fort Hunter began in 1770. He was also responsible for a small school at nearby Johnstown where he also conducted monthly services, and he ministered to the Mohawks at Canajoharie where he met Mohawk leader Joseph Brant. Stuart collaborated with Joseph Brant to translate the Gospel of St. Mark into the Mohawk dialect.Osborne 2011, p. 31 Since Stuart was a Loyalist and an Anglican priest, he was harassed by American Revolutionary War rebels. His home was looted, property confiscated, and his church desecrated. He was almost arrested in 1777 but saved by Joseph Brant and his troops. ==British Canada years== By 1781, Stuart was permitted to leave for the Province of Quebec. He was exchanged for an army officer who had been imprisoned by the British. Stuart arrived in Canada with his wife, Jane (n√©e Okill), three children and his black slaves. He settled in Montreal where he became the chaplain for the 2nd Battalion of the King's Royal Regiment of New York. He also operated a school and ministered to Loyalist settlers. Stuart realized that prospects of obtaining a more secure position or obtaining property in Montreal were low, so in 1783 he petitioned Governor Haldimand to allow him to move to Cataraqui (now Kingston), grant him land and appoint him Chaplain of the Garrison of Cataraqui. He was successful and so he moved to Cataraqui with his family in 1785. He visited the neighboring Mohawk settlers and tended to his fellow citizens. His church consisted of only a room in the garrison quarters at T√™te-de-Pont Barracks. The room was used until the first St. George's Church was built in 1792. St. George's was the first church to be built in the Kingston area.Mika 1987, p. 135Osborne 2011, p. 33 He is often referred to as the \\"Father of the Upper Canada Church\\". In 1786 Stuart opened the first school west of the Ottawa River.John Stuart - Dictionary of Canadian Biography Retrieved 2015-04-07 It was located in one room in his rectory and had an enrolment of 30 pupils. The schoolroom was expanded by adding a small shed and it would become the first grammar school (Secondary School) in Upper Canada. He ran the school until 1788.Mika 1987, p. 25 In 1792, Lieutenant Governor Simcoe appointed him chaplain of the Legislative Council of Upper Canada. Stuart became the first Anglican priest in what is now the province of Ontario. In 1799 he was granted an honorary Doctorate of Divinity degree from the College of Philadelphia. John and Jane Stuart had eight surviving children. Their eldest son, George OKill Stuart, would become rector of Kingston after the death of his father.Osborne 2011, p. 258 ==See also== *Mohawk Chapel ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography *John Stuart - Dictionary of Canadian Biography Retrieved 2015-04-07 *The Revd.

He was frequently referred to by his full name or as \\"Morris L. Marks\\" to distinguish him from several contemporaries named Morris Marks. ==History== A son of Lyon Marks ( ‚Äì ) and Mrs. Marks (c. 1783 ‚Äì 5 February 1857), he and his brother Solomon Lyon Marks migrated from London to South Australia on the Abberton, arriving in December 1846, and was a successful importer and merchant in Adelaide and Burra. He and his brother were, as M & S Marks, owners of the \\"Liverpool Mart\\" in Hindley Street, Adelaide's largest emporium. He was, in 1848, a member of the consortium (with Burnet Nathan, Louis Hart, Joseph Hart, and Samuel Hart) which purchased from George Morphett land on Rundle Street for the first Synagogue (consecrated 3 September 1850). He married in 1850 and later had a large family. He was a passenger on the steamer Osmanli, which hit a reef and sank in D'Estrees Bay, Kangaroo Island on 25 November 1853. No-one was seriously injured but Marks lost a quantity of gold. He was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly, representing The Burra and Clare from March 1857 to August 1858, when he resigned in order to make a trip to Europe. On his return he continued his business, but did not stand for re-election. He spent some time alternating between New Zealand and Melbourne. In this letter to The Argus he gave his address as 23 Bourke Street in January 1862. In 1883 Marks and his family left for New Zealand, and were resident in Wellington. They returned to Australia, living in Albert Park, Victoria, where he died on Saturday, 4 March 1893. ==Family== Marks married Leah Solomon (ca.1832 ‚Äì 9 August 1908), sister of Judah Moss Solomon, on 30 January 1850.

He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of South Carolina and a Juris Doctor from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 2011.\\"Representative Justin T. Bamberg\\", S.C. House siteJustin Bamberg's Biography ==Career== Bamberg serves as a Democratic member of the South Carolina House of Representatives and worked as a personal injury trial lawyer with Bamberg Legal, LLC. In 2015, he represented the family of police-shooting victim Walter Scott. In October 2015, Bamberg, an attorney with the law firm of Bamberg Legal in Bamberg, South Carolina, along with attorney L. Chris Stewart of Stewart Seay & Felton in Atlanta, Georgia, negotiated a $6.5 million pre-suit settlement on behalf of the Estate of Walter Scott to resolve claims for wrongful death and civil rights violations. It was the largest pre- suit settlement of its kind in South Carolina history. The former officer, Michael Slager, pled guilty to federal civil rights violations and sentenced to 20 years for the murder of Walter Scott. In late 2015, Bamberg initially supported and formally endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. In January 2016, Bamberg pulled his endorsement and formally endorsed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, highlighting Sanders' unwavering support of \\"racial, social and economic justice\\". Bamberg went on to undertake a role as one of Sanders' National Surrogates, appearing with Sanders at events across the country as well as on his behalf. On November 9, 2017, Our Revolution‚Äîa national, grassroots organization which spawned into existence in the wake of Senator Sanders historic Presidential run‚Äîannounced that Bamberg had been elected to its national board of directors. Bamberg has served as attorney for clients in some of the United States' most high-profile cases, particularly in regards to officer-involved incidents. In addition to the Walter Scott case, Bamberg has represented the families of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Bryant Heyward in Hollywood, South Carolina; and Keith Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina. Bamberg represented the family of 20-year old Kouren-Rodney Bernard Thomas of Raleigh, North Carolina, who was shot and killed by a neighbor when leaving a house party in August 2016 ‚Äì a shooting that drew comparisons to Trayvon Martin's death in Florida, and \\"Jane Doe,\\" an Orangeburg County, South Carolina woman who was allegedly coerced into performing a sex act by an on- duty deputy sheriff. In 2017, Bamberg resolved the civil case against the Orangeburg County Sheriff's Office pre-suit for $350,000, stating at the time: \\"Most officers and the departments in which they serve are amazing, and we should be grateful that they have dedicated their lives to serving and protecting us all; however, we must continue to fight against any abuse of power. And we will play an important role in addressing that issue.\\" Bamberg again found himself in the civil rights spotlight when an officer with the Town of Kingstree tasered an unarmed, 86-year-old man after a traffic stop in rural, South Carolina. The police department reported that the elderly man had failed to stop for blue lights and on exiting his vehicle, was tasered by the officers \\"for his own safety.\\" In less than one month, Bamberg had negotiated a $900,000 legal settlement on behalf of the grandfather for civil rights violations, representing one of the quickest and most substantial pre-suit legal settlements in an officer involved taser case in the history of South Carolina. During the same time period, Bamberg undertook representing the mother of Del'Quan Seagers, a minor who died in 2015 while in the custody of the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice and residing at a wilderness camp operated by AMIKids, Inc., a national non-profit organization operating juvenile wilderness camps and alternative school across the United States. On January 27, 2017, the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice and the wilderness camps operated by AMIKids came under tremendous scrutiny after a thorough review and scathing report was issued by the South Carolina Legislative Audit Council, which found numerous failures by the department and company in the operations of the camps for detained juveniles. A day after the report was released, then SCDJJ Director Sylvia Murray resigned. Bamberg's representation helped prompt national discussions on alternative placement facilities for juveniles in the United States. In addition to his civil rights trial work, Bamberg has successfully represented individuals in personal injury and wrongful death matters, such as the fatal tractor trailer accident that claimed the life of a Bamberg City Councilwoman in 2015, and a Duke University Hospital employee who was sexually assaulted by an unknown assailant while on the job. In January 2017, news arose that Kamiyah Mobley, who was abducted from a Jacksonville, Florida hospital in 1998 at eight hours old, had been found in Walterboro, South Carolina, having been raised by her abductor under the name Alexis Manigo. Then eighteen, Mobley retained attorney Bamberg to represent her interests, such as working to obtain identification and a Social Security card. Bamberg was noted in August 2017 to have been \\"exploring\\" a possible run for governor in the State of South Carolina, the same stirring conversation on the possibility of the state having its first Democratic governor in over a decade. In April 2019, Bamberg endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.https://apnews.com/feac565e4c374585a8d7a46cdca152da endorses == References == Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:African- American state legislators in South Carolina Category:Members of the South Carolina House of Representatives Category:South Carolina Democrats Category:University of South Carolina School of Law alumni Category:21st- century American politicians Category:South Carolina lawyers Category:21st- century American lawyers Category:African-American lawyers Category:People from Bamberg, South Carolina ","title":"Justin Bamberg"},{"id":"46348186","text":"Trofeo Edil C is an annual one-day cycling race held in Italy.

Outlaw calls his music \\"SoCal country\\", country music refashioned with a Southern California vibe of the classic honky-tonk and troubadour pop. ==Early life== Outlaw was born in Aberdeen, South Dakota as Sam Morgan. At the age of 10, his family moved to southern California. He grew up in a conservative Christian home and was limited by his parents as to what kind of music he could listen to. He did however, note the influence of Western Swing band Asleep at the Wheel and how their all-star tribute albums to Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys acted as \\"country music in a bottle\\" for him. The Beatles were also a huge influence on Outlaw. As a young adult, he had a musical revelation when he heard the classic country voices of Emmylou Harris and George Jones. Outlaw notes that George Jones' music inspired him to get more serious about playing the guitar and writing songs. In \\"his late 20s ... both his parents‚Äô and his own marriage simultaneously crumbled.\\" When Outlaw decided to actively pursue a music career, he borrowed his mother's maiden name, Outlaw, for a stage moniker. His mother has since died and he honors her by continuing to use the family name. ==Career== Sam Outlaw had a successful advertising career in Southern California; however, on his thirtieth birthday he switched gears to pursue his passion for music. Outlaw self-released an EP in 2014. It immediately created a buzz and he secured performance slots at the Stagecoach Festival and AmericanaFest produced by the Americana Music Association. CMT featured his music video, Cry For Me, in 2014. While enlisting a crack group of backing musicians to record Angeleno, Outlaw‚Äôs first LP, he began working with musician and record producer, Ry Cooder. Outlaw wrote all of the songs on Angeleno. Ry Cooder and his son, drummer Joachim Cooder, co-produced and played on the album. Other musicians on the album include Bo Koster, Taylor Goldsmith, Gabe Witcher and vocalist Arnold McCuller. On March 3, 2015, Outlaw was signed to the reputable Six Shooter Records as its first US act. Outlaw was featured in Rolling Stone as one of the top country music artists to see at SXSW in 2015. Outlaw's second studio album Tenderheart was released on April 14 and debuted at number 3 on the UK Country Albums Chart and garnered two award nominations from the British Country Music Association. On May 3, 2019 - the same night he made his debut on the Grand Ole Opry - Outlaw released an EP called Hat Acts. At the time of its release, he wrote on his website: ‚ÄúI wanted to do something different with this album. Hat Acts is inspired by honky tonk scenes, hip-hop skits and of course ‚Äî real life. This is a bit of a ‚Äòconcept album‚Äô and I had a lot of fun putting it together.‚Äù Later that Summer, he released a duet with Sarah Darling called \\"Forever & Always\\" across streaming platforms and was also a radio single in the United Kingdom. As Producer September 27, 2019 saw the release of Outlaw's first project as a producer when Michaela Anne released Desert Dove on Yep Roc. He co-produced the album with longtime friend, collaborator and member of Delta Spirit, Kelly Winrich. Rolling Stone described the album as, \\"is a shimmering sonic statement of purpose that cements the 33-year-old artist as a nuanced songwriter with a penchant for telling difficult stories.\\" The album garnered critical acclaim from outlets including Rolling Stone (#10), Stereogum (#9), and Entertainment Focus (#10) who included the record on each of their respective end of year \\"Best of 2019\\" lists. ==Discography== Studio albums { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:8em;\\" Title ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Details ! colspan=\\"3\\" Peak positions ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:8em;\\" Sales - style=\\"font-size:smaller;\\" ! width=\\"65\\" US Heat ! width=\\"65\\" US Indie ! width=\\"65\\" UK Country - ! scope=\\"row\\" Angeleno  * Release date: June 9, 2015 * Label: Six Shooter Records  22  ‚Äî  4  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Tenderheart  * Release date: April 14, 2017 * Label: Six Shooter Records  17  42  3  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" Hat Acts (EP)  * Release date: May 3, 2019 * Label: Black Hills Recordings  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî -  colspan=\\"7\\" style=\\"font-size:8pt\\" \\"‚Äî\\" denotes releases that did not chart - } Promotional Singles { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"width:21em;\\" Title ! rowspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Details - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Love Is On A Roll\\"  * Release date: March 29, 2019 * Label: Black Hills Recordings - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Forever and Always\\" (Duet with Sarah Darling)  * Release date: July 26, 2019 * Label: Black Hills Recordings - } Music videos { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - !

Its foliage is covered with soft, silky hairs giving the leaves a silvery-grey appearance and even the filaments of the stamens are hairy. ==Description== Melaleuca lasiandra is a large shrub or small tree growing to high with white or grey papery bark. The leaves have a narrow oval shape, a small pointed end and are long and wide. They are also very densely covered with fine hairs so that they appear silvery-grey. The flowers are yellowish green or white, and are arranged in heads at the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering, as well as in the upper leaf axils. Each head contains between 2 and 11 groups of flowers in threes and is up to in diameter. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 6 to 20 stamens which have hairy stalks. Flowering occurs intermittently throughout the year but mostly in winter. The fruit which follow are woody capsules with the sepals forming teeth at first but are eroded later to undulations around the edge of the cup-shaped capsules. The capsules are long and form loose clusters along the branches. ==Taxonomy and naming== Melaleuca lasiandra was first formally described in 1862 by Ferdinand von Mueller in \\"Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae\\". The specific epithet (lasiandra) is derived from the ancient Greek lasios (ŒªŒ¨œÉŒπŒøœÇ), \\"hairy\\", \\"woolly\\", and anƒìr, genitive andros (·ºÄŒΩŒÆœÅ, genitive ·ºÄŒΩŒ¥œÅœåœÇ), \\"male\\",Backer, C.A.

It grows in a variety of soils and vegetation associations but is common in the depressions between sand dunes. ==Conservation status== Melaleuca lasiandra is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. ==Use in horticulture== Melaleuca lasiandra is a hardy shrub for arid areas, requiring full sun and good drainage. ==References== lasiandra Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Flora of the Northern Territory Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Flora of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1862 Category:Taxa named by Ferdinand von Mueller ","title":"Melaleuca lasiandra"},{"id":"46348317","text":"Cresswell Downs Station often referred to as Cresswell Downs is a pastoral lease that operates as a cattle station in the Northern Territory. It is situated about east of Elliott and south of Borroloola. Cresswell Downs is surrounded by other properties including Mallapunyah to the north west, Walhallow to the west, Kiana to the north, Calvert Hills Station to the north east, Benmarra to the west, Brunette Downs to the south and Anthony Lagoon to the south west. Several watercourses pass through the property including Cresswell Creek, Coanjula Creek and Puzzle Creek. The traditional owners of the area are the Wambaia. The first European to visit the area was the explorer Frank Hann in 1881. The station was established later the same year and was named after Sir William Rooke Creswell, the name was retained despite the error in spelling. It was selected by Ernest Favenc who had joined an expedition to the area to claim new pastoral lands for himself and his partner, Mr Brodie. A share in the property was sold by in 1881 to the De Salis brothers by Kilgour and Woodhouse. The property occupied an area of and was unstocked at the time. By 1883 Ernest Favenc sold his quarter share of the property now stocked with 2000 head of cattle to Brodie and De Salis. In 1895 Sidney North Innes in partnership with Mr. T.A. Perry purchased Cresswell Downs. Perry was killed by the Indigenous Australians who were employed on the station shortly afterward. Innes carried on for the next several years on his own. On one of the trips Innes was in pursuit of a buyer of a large mob of heifers for over a thousand miles. The drought of the early 1900s depleted the herd and in 1904 the owner completed the sale of what were left, about 3000 head and returned to Oxforshire in England for the first time in 25 years. He returned in 1905 and the property. William Naughton acquired the property at some time prior to 1917 when he was overlanding small herds to butchers in Cloncurry. By 1923 Cresswell was owned by Naughton and Peter Nalty. By 1929 the pair had a falling out which ended up in the supreme court with Naughton claiming Nalty owed him ¬£10,000 and 650 cattle and Nalty claiming Naughton owed him ¬£7500, six years' salary and ¬£5834 for a share in the property. Nalty was awarded ¬£7,000 for back-pay but was not given a share of the property. By 1932 Naughton's sons, Tom and Frank were running Cresswell while their father concentrated on his other pastoral interests. Currently Cresswell Downs is owned by the Paraway Pastoral Company and run in conjunction with Walhallow Station. ==See also== *List of ranches and stations ==References== Category:Stations (Australian agriculture) Category:Pastoral leases in the Northern Territory ","title":"Cresswell Downs"},{"id":"46348335","text":"Donald Clifford Johnson (born September 14, 1920) is a former American football center and linebacker who played one season with the Cleveland Rams.

The modern definition, the auditory portion of the inner ear, originated in the late 17th century. Within the mammalian cochlea exists the organ of Corti, which contains hair cells that are responsible for translating the vibrations it receives from surrounding fluid-filled ducts into electrical impulses that are sent to the brain to process sound. This spiral-shaped cochlea is estimated to have originated during the early Cretaceous Period, around 120 million years ago. Further, the auditory innervation of the spiral-shaped cochlea also traces back to the Cretaceous period. The evolution of the human cochlea is a major area of scientific interest because of its favourable representation in the fossil record. During the last century, many scientists such as evolutionary biologists and paleontologists strove to develop new methods and techniques to overcome the many obstacles associated with working with ancient, delicate artifacts. In the past, scientists were limited in their ability to fully examine specimens without causing damage to them. In more recent times, technologies such as micro-CT scanning became available. These technologies allow for the visual differentiation between fossilized animal materials and other sedimentary remains. With the use of X-ray technologies, it is possible to ascertain some information about the auditory capabilities of extinct creatures, giving insight to human ancestors as well as their contemporary species. == Comparative anatomy == While the basic structure of the inner ear in lepidosaurs (lizards and snakes), archosaurs (birds and crocodilians) and mammals is similar, and the organs are considered to be homologous, each group has a unique type of auditory organ. The hearing organ arose within the lagenar duct of stem reptiles, lying between the saccular and lagenar epithelia. In lepidosaurs, the hearing organ, the basilar papilla, is generally small, with at most 2000 hair cells, whereas in archosaurs the basilar papilla can be much longer (>10mm in owls) and contain many more hair cells that show two typical size extremes, the short and the tall hair cells. In mammals, the structure is known as the organ of Corti and shows a unique arrangement of hair cells and supporting cells. All mammalian organs of Corti contain a supporting tunnel made up of pillar cells, on the inner side of which there are inner hair cells and outer hair cells on the outer side. The definitive mammalian middle ear and the elongated cochlea allows for better sensitivity for higher frequencies.  Lepidosaurs  As in all lepidosaurs and archosaurs, the single-ossicle (columellar) middle ear transmits sound to the footplate of the columella, which sends a pressure wave through the inner ear. In snakes, the basilar papilla is roughly 1mm long and only responds to frequencies below about 1 kHz. In contrast, lizards tend to have two areas of hair cells, one responding below and the other above 1 kHz. The upper frequency limit in most lizards is roughly 5‚Äì8 kHz. The longest lizard papillae are about 2mm long and contain 2000 hair cells and their afferent innervating fibers can be very sharply tuned to frequency.  Archosaurs  In birds and crocodilians, the similarity of the structure of the basilar papilla betrays their close evolutionary relationship. The basilar papilla is up to about 10mm long and contains up to 16,500 hair cells. While most birds have an upper hearing limit of only about 6 kHz, the barn owl can hear up to 12 kHz and thus close to the human upper limit.  Mammals  Egg-laying mammals, the monotremes (echidna and platypus), do not have a spiral cochlea, but one shaped more like a banana, up to about 7 mm long. Like in lepidosaurs and archosaurs, it contains a lagena, a vestibular sensory epithelium, at its tip. Only in therian mammals (marsupials and placentals) is the cochlea truly coiled 1.5 to 3.5 times. Whereas in monotremes there are many rows of both inner and outer hair cells in the organ of Corti, in therian (marsupial and placental) mammals the number of inner hair-cell rows is one, and there are generally only three rows of outer hair cells.  Amphibians  Amphibians have unique inner ear structures. There are two sensory papillae involved in hearing, the basilar (higher frequency) and amphibian (lower frequency) papillae, but it is uncertain whether either is homologous to the hearing organs of lepidosaurs, archosaurs and mammals and we have no idea when they arose.  Fish  Fish have no dedicated auditory epithelium, but use various vestibular sensory organs that respond to sound. In most teleost fishes it is the saccular macula that responds to sound. In some, such as goldfishes, there is also a special bony connection to the gas bladder that increases sensitivity allowing hearing up to about 4 kHz.  Neanderthals to modern humans  The size of cochlea has been measured throughout its evolution based on the fossil record. In one study, the basal turn of the cochlea was measured, and it was hypothesized that cochlear size correlates with body mass. The size of the basal turn of the cochlea was not different in Neanderthals and Holocene humans, however it became larger in early modern humans and Upper Paleolithic humans. Furthermore, the position and orientation of the cochlea is similar between Neanderthals and Holocene humans, relative to plane of the lateral canal, whereas early modern and upper Paleolithic humans have a more superiorly placed cochlea than Holocene humans. When comparing hominins of the Middle Pleistocene, Neanderthals and Holocene humans, the apex of the cochlea faces more inferiorly in the hominins than the latter two groups. Finally, the cochlea of European middle Pleistocene hominins faces more inferiorly than Neanderthals, modern humans, and Homo erectus. Human beings, along with apes, are the only mammals that do not have high frequency (>32 kHz) hearing. Humans have long cochleae, but the space devoted to each frequency range is quite large (2.5mm per octave), resulting in a comparatively reduced upper frequency limit. The human cochlea has approximately 2.5 turns around the modiolus (the axis). Humans, like many mammals and birds, are able to perceive auditory signals that displace the eardrum by a mere picometre. == The ear == Because of its prominence and preserved state in the fossil record, until recently, the ear had been used to determine phylogeny. The ear itself contains different portions, including the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear and all of these show evolutionary changes that are often unique to each lineage [14]. It was the independent evolution of a tympanic middle ear in the Triassic period that produced strong selection pressures towards improved hearing organs in the separate lineages of land vertebrates.  Evolutionary perspective  The cochlea is the tri-chambered auditory detection portion of the ear, consisting of the scala media, the scala tympani, and the scala vestibuli. Regarding mammals, placental and marsupial cochleae have similar cochlear responses to auditory stimulation as well as DC resting potentials. This leads to the investigation of the relationship between these therian mammals and researching their ancestral species to trace the origin of the cochlea. This spiral-shaped cochlea that is in both marsupial and placental mammals is traced back to approximately 120 million years ago. The development of the most basic basilar papilla (the auditory organ that later evolved into the Organ of Corti in mammals) happened at the same time as the water-to-land transition of vertebrates, approximately 380 million years ago. The actual coiling or spiral nature of the cochlea occurred to save space inside the skull. The longer the cochlea, the higher is the potential resolution of sound frequencies given the same hearing range. The oldest of the truly coiled mammalian cochleae were approximately 4 mm in length. The earliest evidence available for primates depicts a short cochlea with prominent laminae, suggesting that they had good high-frequency sensitivity as opposed to low- frequency sensitivity. After this, over a period of around 60 million years, evidence suggests that primates developed longer cochleae and less prominent laminae, which means that they had an improvement in low-frequency sensitivity and a decrease in high-frequency sensitivity. By the early Miocene period, the cycle of the elongation of the cochleae and the deterioration of the laminae was completed. Evidence shows that primates have had an increasing cochlear volume to body mass ratio over time. These changes in the cochlear labyrinth volume negatively affect the highest and lowest audible frequencies, causing a downward shift. Non-primates appear to have smaller cochlear labyrinth volumes overall when compared to primates. Some evidence also suggests that selective forces for the larger cochlear labyrinth may have started after the basal primate node. Mammals are the subject of a substantial amount of research not only because of the potential knowledge to be gained regarding humans, but also because of their rich and abundant representation in the fossil record. The spiral shape of the cochlea evolved later on in the evolutionary pathway of mammals than previously believed, just before the therians split into the two lineages marsupials and placentals, about 120 million years ago.  The evolution of prestin  Parallel to the evolution of the cochlea, prestin shows an increased rate of evolution in therian mammals. Prestin is the motor protein of the outer hair cells of the inner ear of the mammalian cochlea. It is are found in the hair cells of all vertebrates, including fish, but are thought to have initially been membrane transporter molecules. A high concentration of prestin are found only in the lateral membranes of therian outer hair cells (there is uncertainty with regard to concentrations in monotremes). This high concentration is not found in inner hair cells, and is also lacking in all hair cell types of non-mammals. Prestin also has a role in motility, which evolved a greater importance in the motor function in land vertebrates, but this developed vastly differently in different lineages. In certain birds and mammals, prestin function as both transporters and motors, but the strongest evolution to robust motor dynamics only evolved in therian mammals. It is hypothesized that this motor system is significant to the therian cochlea at high frequencies because of the distinctive cellular and bony composition of the organ of Corti that allows prestin to intensify the movements of the whole structure. Modern ultra-sound echolocating species such as bats and toothed whales show highly evolved prestin, and this prestin shows identical sequence alterations over time. Unusually, the sequences thus apparently evolved independent from each other during different time periods. Furthermore, the evolution of neurotransmitter receptor systems (acetylcholine) that regulate the motor feedback of the outer hair cells coincides with prestin evolution in therians. This suggests that there was a parallel evolution of a control system and a motor system in the inner ear of therian mammals.  Homoplasies (convergent evolution)  Land vertebrates evolved middle ears independently in each major lineage, and are thus the result of parallel evolution. The configurations of the middle ears of monotreme and therian mammals can thus be interpreted as convergent evolution or homoplasy. Thus evidence from fossils demonstrate homoplasies for the detachment of the ear from the jaw. Furthermore, it is apparent that the land- based eardrum, or tympanic membrane, and connecting structures such as the Eustachian tube evolved convergently in multiple different settings as opposed to being a defining morphology. ==References== Cochlea Category:Auditory system ","title":"Evolution of the cochlea"},{"id":"46348503","text":"Yizhivtsi (; ) is a commune (selsoviet) in Storozhynets Raion, Chernivtsi Oblast, Ukraine.
