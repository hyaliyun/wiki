Coventry, (2006) The Castles of Scotland, p. 604. Fourth Edition, Birlinn Limited. Among the finds in the broch was a decorative pin from the 8th century and a Norse pin and rivets, dating from the 11th or 12th century. Located near the broch are the remains of a rectangular building in the Norse style. ==Construction== Tirefour Castle has an almost circular floor plan. The lower floor has a solid, dry stone wall.J.N.G. Ritchie, (1998) Brochs of Scotland, p. 45. Shire Archaeology, This walls are 4.5 m thick. and the internal diameter is approximately 12.2 metres.F. A. Walker, (2000) The Buildings of Scotland - Argyll and Bute, p. 368. Yale University Press. The wall is on average 3 metres high and survives to a maximum height of 4.9 metres in the southeast corner. The entrance to the broch is located on the southwest side and is 1.4 metres wide. There are no indications of an intramural room (guard cell) at the entrance. A supporting (scarcement) ledge is evident in the interior of the broch.D. Christison, (1889) The duns and forts of Lorne, Nether Lochaber, and the neighbourhood p. 368-432. Proc. Soc. Ant. Scot., 1888-89; vol. 23 It is located 2.5 metres above the original ground level. The ledge is 60 centimetres wide and is intact for about three quarters of the inner circumference. Intramural gallery On the northwestern and eastern sides, at a height of 2.5 metres above the original ground level, intramural galleries can be seen. The gallery is 61 centimetres wide and 107 centimetres high. On the west side the gallery is 7 metres long. The ceiling of the gallery is formed by large, flat stones. The interior of the broch is partly filled with earth to a height of at least 1 metre. In 2010, beneath the earth on the north side, a 1 metre wide opening was found, which probably gave access to an intramural room or staircase. Surrounding the broch can be seen traces of two walls, which offered additional protection to the northeast and southwest sides. In the southern wall is an opening which is aligned with the entrance to the broch. ==References * Category:Archaeological sites in Argyll and Bute Category:Brochs Category:Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Argyll and Bute Category:Lismore, Scotland ","title":"Tirefour Castle"},{"id":"41999802","text":"Beacon Street, also known as the former New Hampshire State Prison Warehouse, is a historic commercial building at Beacon Street in Concord, New Hampshire. Built in 1860 and enlarged in 1868, it is the only major surviving element of New Hampshire's first state prison complex, which was mostly torn down in the 1890s. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. ==Description and history== Beacon Street is located on the west side of downtown Concord, extending north-south on the west side of a block bounded by Beacon, Tremont, and Crosby Streets. It is a two-story brick building, in length, with a single-story projection on the west side, facing Crosby Street. The long facade is basically divided into 15 bays articulated by brick pilasters. Each bay is filled with a combination of windows or doors and windows, originally with some regularity, but with many subsequent alterations. Original window openings were rectangular, with granite sills and lintels, but several have been altered to accommodate doors, and some bays now have large garage-style doors on the ground floor. The building was built in 1860, with an addition on the north side added in 1868. Its original function was to provide a workshop for prisoners in the adjacent correctional facility. It served in this capacity until the entire prison complex was closed and sold by the state in 1880. In the 1890s the bulk of the prison was demolished by the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company, which used its finished stone elements for construction projects in Manchester. This building remained, and thereafter served a variety of commercial and industrial uses before being converted to office space. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Merrimack County, New Hampshire ==References== Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1860 Category:Buildings and structures in Concord, New Hampshire Category:National Register of Historic Places in Concord, New Hampshire ","title":"2¬Ω Beacon Street"},{"id":"41999808","text":"Martin Greeley (March 16, 1814 - September 4, 1899) was an American farmer and politician.

A self-taught cook, Lewis began filming recipe attempts online from his home in Weston Super Mare in 2010 after he saw Jamie Oliver on a television show. After being signed up by Oliver to appear on his YouTube channel, Lewis attracted media coverage. His cookbook, Dinner's On, was published in May 2014 and a second, My Virgin Kitchen ‚Äì Delicious Recipes You Can Make Every Day, in August 2017. In January 2019, the My Virgin Kitchen YouTube channel was renamed to Barry Lewis. ==Career== Lewis set up My Virgin Kitchen as a way to inspire himself to learn to cook. He was working at the time as a quantity surveyor for Wates Group and would make recipe videos in the evenings in an attempt to gain confidence in the kitchen. Each video consists of Lewis cooking a recipe for the first time to inspire others to do the same; hence the name 'virgin kitchen.' Over time his reluctance to cook slowly began to turn into a passion, and a broad range of cooking videos were uploaded including simple dinners, cooking with kids and stunts such as cooking using hair straighteners. Eventually, Lewis was discovered online by the man who originally inspired him, Jamie Oliver. Lewis decided to take a sabbatical from his job to take his cooking passion further as a career. Lewis also started making videos with fellow YouTube personality Stuart Ashen, with most videos being Ashen's food specials, which are either reviewing foods of certain themes, or looking at (and sometimes eating) out-of-date food. In February 2016, Ashen and Lewis created a joint channel called Barshens. Lewis has written two cookbooks, and has appeared on television shows including Channel 5's The Gadget Show testing barbecues, and ABC's Nightline, as well as appearances at food festivals. ==Bibliography== *Dinner's On, HarperCollins, 2014 *My Virgin Kitchen-Delicious Recipes You Can Make Every Day, HarperCollins, 2017 ==Personal life== Lewis is married to Rebecca, and has two daughters. ==References * Barry Lewis website Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:British chefs ","title":"Barry Lewis (cook)"},{"id":"41999821","text":"Seh Chahan (, also Romanized as Seh ChƒÅhƒÅn) is a village in Esmailabad Rural District, in the Central District of Khash County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

Public Schools Board of Trustees, and as a member and president of the D.C. Board of Commissioners. == Personal life == Born in Lewistown, Illinois, on June 23, 1841, John W. Ross was the oldest son of Hon. Lewis W. Ross and Frances M. (Simms) Ross, and a grandson of Ossian M. Ross and Mary (Winans) Ross. His father Lewis Ross was a prominent lawyer and United States Congressman from Illinois. His grandfather Ossian Ross was a pioneer settler in Illinois, and founder of the towns of Lewistown and Havana. John Ross was married in June 1870 to Emma Brown Tenney, daughter of Franklin Tenney, who was for many years the proprietor of the National Hotel in Washington, D.C. John and Emma Ross had five children: three sons and two daughters. Their oldest son, Col. Tenney Ross, served as U.S. Army Chief of Staff, 79th Division, in World War I. Emma Ross died on January 31, 1879.Ancestry.com. New Hampshire, Death and Burial Records Index, 1654-1949 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2011. John Ross then married Isabella Toner, widow of Henry L. McCullough, on September 24, 1888.Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania County Marriages, 1852-1973; County: Allegheny; Year Range: 1888 -1889; Roll Number: 549755. == Education == Ross received his early education in private schools and then attended the Lewistown Seminary from 1853 to 1856. In the fall of 1856, Ross enrolled as a student at the Illinois College in Jacksonville, Illinois. However, he and three other students were denied their diplomas in 1862 due to a dispute between students and faculty regarding freedom of speech during their commencement orations. The dispute concerned the students' freedom to address issues related to the American Civil War. Despite the lack of a diploma, Ross attended Harvard Law School in 1864 and 1865. Ross and the other three Illinois College students were eventually restored to their class and granted their diplomas in 1891. == Career == John Ross was admitted to the bar in Springfield, Illinois, in January 1866 and practiced law in Lewistown until 1873. From 1868 to 1872, he was also a member of the Illinois House of Representatives, representing Fulton County. In April 1873, Ross was admitted to the bar of the U.S. Supreme Court and he then practiced law in Washington, D.C., for several years. In October 1883, Ross was appointed as a lecturer at Georgetown University on subjects of common law, torts, and domestic relations. He was honored by the university with an LL.D. degree in 1885. Ross served as D.C. postmaster from 1888 to September 30, 1890. While in that position, he doubled the number of branch post offices and increased their efficiency; increased the clerical force and regulated their work hours more equally; and abolished Sunday afternoon mail delivery, to the relief of the mail carriers. Ross also served as president of the D.C. Public Schools Board of Trustees from 1888 to 1892. On September 11, 1890, he was appointed as a member of the D.C. Board of Commissioners by President Benjamin Harrison, and he was reappointed to that position in 1894 by President Grover Cleveland and again in 1897 and 1890 by President William McKinley. From 1893 to 1898 he served as president of the Board (a position equivalent to mayor). By virtue of his position as commissioner as well as president of the Public Schools Board of Trustees, John Ross engaged in correspondence with Booker T. Washington in 1900 concerning recommendations for the position of Superintendent of Colored Schools in the District of Columbia. One of the persons under consideration was W. E. B. Du Bois, although ultimately the position was eliminated by Congressional action in mid-1900, in favor of a system of one superintendent and two assistant superintendents, one of whom was to be black. In 1898, Ross was invited by Alexander Graham Bell to give an oral presentation at the Hubbard Memorial Meeting of the National Geographic Society, in honor of the late president of the society, Gardiner Greene Hubbard. Ross was also involved in negotiations with Andrew Carnegie in 1901 regarding funding for the Lewistown Carnegie Public Library, which was finally completed in 1906.250x250px == Political views == John W. Ross was a member of the Democratic Party, as was his father, Hon. Lewis W. Ross. In the political campaign of 1896, John Ross broke ranks with the main Democratic Party and supported the cause of the \\"gold Democrats\\", who advocated against the \\"free silver\\" policies of William Jennings Bryan. In general, however, Ross' conservative administration of the affairs of the District of Columbia received support from members of both political parties. == Death and funeral == Ross died of a heart attack in his home in Washington, D.C., on July 29, 1902. His funeral was attended by a large number of Washington, D.C., officials and employees, as well as representatives of the national government and the business world; President Theodore Roosevelt donated a large wreath to the funeral. John Ross was interred in Oak Hill Cemetery in Lewistown, Illinois, in a region of the cemetery devoted to members of the Ross family. The death of John Ross was a major blow to his mother, who died in October, 1902, as a consequence of an illness dating from his death. == Legacy == John W. Ross was \\"one of the most universally popular men that has ever been a member of the District's governing triumvirate,\\" highly regarded for his kind heart, great integrity, dedicated service, and respect for D.C. residents. As a tribute, the Ross Elementary School, currently located at 1730 R Street, N.W., in Washington, D.C., was named in his honor.

An associated record label was launched in 2010. ==History== Bucketfull of Brains was founded by Nigel Cross in 1979, and has been published in the UK continuously since that time, on an irregular schedule. Since 1996, the magazine has been edited and published by Nick West, and more recently by the editorial team of Nick West and Terry Hermon. Editorial interest, over the years, has included \\"an affection for songs with guitars and thus bands like the Barracudas, the Flamin' Groovies, the Dream Syndicate, the Long Ryders and the Green Pajamas hold a special place in its affections.\\" Until early 2003 (issue #64), the front cover of the magazine included a logo with a sub-title that listed the musical genres on which it focused: \\"rock 'n' roll, pop, psych, garage, punk, r'n'b, country, folk.\\" An earlier version of the subtitle read \\"rock, garage, psych, folk-rock, pop, rock'n'roll\\". Bucketfull of Brains has been acknowledged by Trouser Press as a source of \\"essential discographical and background information.\\" According to American music writer John M. Borack, the magazine has earned a reputation as a \\"quality, focused publication\\" in both Great Britain and the United States by \\"championing worthy artists big and small\\". In 1989, founder and editor Nigel Cross received an unusual honour from members of the band R.E.M. During R.E.M.'s tour for their album Green, members of R.E.M. combined with Robyn Hitchcock and Peter Holsapple to form a band that they called Nigel and the Crosses, which played two concerts during periods between R.E.M.'s shows. Nigel and the Crosses debuted on March 8, 1989 with a show in Minneapolis, and in London on May 28, 1989, Nigel and the Crosses played a 90-minute show in Soho at the Borderline Club, which BoB reviewer Jon Storey called \\"enough fine music ... to satisfy anyone.\\" Nigel and the Crosses also recorded a version of the song \\"Wild Mountain Thyme\\" for the 1989 album Time Between ‚Äì A Tribute to The Byrds, and a live 7\\" single that was distributed with BoB #34. In addition to publishing the magazine and associated blogs, in 2010 Bucketfull of Brains launched a record label, which is distributed by Proper Music Distribution. Its recording artists include Benjamin Folke Thomas, Trent Miller, and John Murry. ==ReferencesBlog (dated April 4, 2008 to August 23, 2013) * Blog (dated March 5, 2012 to April 13, 2013) * Bucketfull of Brains Records Category:Magazines established in 1979 Category:Music magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Magazines published in London Category:1979 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Irregularly published magazines published in the United Kingdom ","title":"Bucketfull of Brains"},{"id":"42000022","text":"Chah-e Shafi Mohammad (, also Romanized as ChƒÅh-e Shafƒ´ ø Mo·∏©ammad) is a village in Kuh Sefid Rural District, in the Central District of Khash County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

In 1907, the Central South African Railways acquired a single self-contained railmotor for the low-volume railmotor passenger service which had been introduced the previous year. The predecessor vehicle was a railmotor engine which consisted of a single 19 Tonner 0-4-2T locomotive that was modified and semi-permanently coupled to a modified 3rd Class side-door passenger coach. On the new railmotor, the passenger coach was an integral part of the locomotive itself.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1945). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VI - Imperial Military Railways and C.S.A.R. (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, March 1945. pp. 184-185.CSAR General Manager's Reports, Extracts from the CSAR General Manager's Reports for 1906, 1907, 1908 & 1909.19 Tonner Information supplied by John Nicholas Middleton ==Railmotor service== In January 1905 an order was placed by the Central South African Railways (CSAR) with Kitson & Co for two self-contained railmotors. By the end of 1905, it was reported by CSAR Chief Locomotive Superintendent L.S. Smart that a great delay had occurred in the delivery of the two railmotors and that delivery was not expected for months. To avoid further delay with the implementing of the new railmotor service, it was decided to construct a railmotor engine at the Pretoria Works, consisting of a light 19 Tonner 0-4-2 tank locomotive and a 52-seat side-door 3rd Class suburban coach. The locomotive was modified and semi-permanently coupled to the coach, which was modified to contain a driving cab at the rear end with the controls arranged so that the push-pull unit could be driven from either vehicle. The locomotive was reclassified as a Railmotor Engine and renumbered M1. The CSAR railmotor service was put into operation in April 1906 and operated between Rissik in Johannesburg and Wonderboom in Pretoria. ==Manufacturer== Side view drawing of Railmotor no. M2 Only one new Kitson- built railmotor was eventually delivered in August 1907 and was numbered M2. It was a self-contained motor-coach with a 56-seat capacity in which the engine, boiler and coach were embodied in a single vehicle. While the engine part of the vehicle was built by Kitson, the long coach part was constructed by Metropolitan Amalgamated Railway Carriage & Wagon. To negotiate curves and points, the power unit could pivot like a bogie. The railmotor was erected at the Salt River shops of the Cape Government Railways (CGR) in Cape Town and entered service on the CSAR on 10 August 1907.CSAR no. 2 Motor Coach diagram ==Characteristics== The engine's cylinders were arranged outside the plate frames and the piston valves, arranged above the cylinders, were actuated by Walschaerts valve gear. The coach was fitted throughout with Stone system electric lights. ==ServiceCentral South African Railways=== Railmotor no. M2 initially worked out of Germiston on the Elsburg-Germiston-Rietfontein Mine route, but the service was extended on 8 September 1907 to include the Germiston-Jupiter section. The route of the home-built railmotor engine no. M1 was also extended, to Hatherley-Rissik-Pretoria-Wonderboom. In service, the new railmotor no. M2 was found to be less satisfactory than the home-built railmotor engine no. M1, which was considered to be superior in aspects like design, passenger comfort, economy in running and convenience in working. With one end of the railmotor's passenger coach carried on the engine frame, the type of springs necessary for a locomotive caused unsatisfactory riding qualities in the vehicle. Since the imported railmotor was a single vehicle, the carriage was unusable while the engine had to be withdrawn for service or repairs. The Pretoria-built coach, on the other hand, was still readily detachable from the locomotive and both engine and coach were still complete units which could be used independently of each other. The purchase cost of railmotor no. M2 was ¬£4,654, while the cost to convert the first 19 Tonner and a coach to a railmotor engine had been ¬£5,827. Given the advantages of the home-built vehicle over the imported railmotor and the fact that several 19 Tonner locomotives were standing idle and considered unusable for any other purpose, no more railmotors were ordered and another two 19 Tonners were converted to railmotor engines in 1908, at a cost of ¬£2,485 each. During 1909, orders were placed with the shops for another seven railmotor engines. These nine vehicles were renumbered in the range from M3 to M11. 19 Tonner Railmotor Engine no. M1 Between 1906 and 1909, steam railmotor services were expanded to operate on four routes: * Hatherley-Pretoria-Wonderboom. * Elsburg-Germiston- Rietfontein Mine. * Luipaardsvlei-Krugersdorp-Randfontein. * Germiston-Geduld. ===South African Railways=== When the Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910, the three Colonial government railways (Cape Government Railways, Natal Government Railways and CSAR) were united under a single administration to control and administer the railways, ports and harbours of the Union. Although the South African Railways and Harbours came into existence in 1910, the actual classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways were only implemented with effect from 1 January 1912.The South African Railways - Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978. In 1912, the railmotor, along with the ten railmotor engines, were taken onto the SAR roster as unclassified locomotives since they were considered obsolete. Since they were excluded from the SAR renumbering schedules, they retained their CSAR engine numbers.Classification of S.A.R. Engines with Renumbering Lists, issued by the Chief Mechanical Engineer‚Äôs Office, Pretoria, January 1912, p. 2 (Reprinted in April 1987 by SATS Museum, R.3125-6/9/11-1000) At some stage, the railmotor's boiler was allocated SAR boiler no. 4001. The railmotor was withdrawn from service by 1921. ==References== 0500 0500 Category:Kitson locomotives Category:0-4-0+4 locomotives Category:B-2 locomotives Category:B2 locomotives Category:Cape gauge railway locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1907 Category:Scrapped locomotives ","title":"CSAR Railmotor"},{"id":"42000165","text":"The 1963 Star World Championships were held in Chicago, Illinois in 1963. ==ResultsReferences== * * Category:Star World Championships Category:1963 in sailing Category:Star World Championships in the United States ","title":"1963 Star World Championships"},{"id":"42000167","text":"Hasanabad-e Dastgerd (, also Romanized as ·∏®asanƒÅbƒÅd-e Dastgerd; also known as ·∏®oseynƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Poshtkuh Rural District, in the Central District of Khash County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

Their work has been recognized by being named ‚Äúgrand masters‚Äù by the Fomento Cultural Banamex. Euan is noted for hammocks and its one of its main sources of income. Most people in this area sleep on beds only in the winter. While most hammocks in the world are made industrially, some are still made by hand. The latter are made with henequen or sisal, which used to be highly in demand for making rope. The family‚Äôs production focuses on Elena Manzano de Villajuana and her daughters and daughters-in-law. All began this work as children and the males in the family help as well. They are noted for making hammocks so large that they resemble fishing nets. They envelope the occupant completely, including those meant for two people. They netting is light to let air pass but close enough to act as a mosquito net. They made hammocks of both sisal and industrial cotton thread. The most traditional are made of sisal, a type of agave. The process of creating fiber from the agave leaves is called ‚Äúcorchado‚Äù and has its origins in the pre Hispanic period. It is difficult work but it results in fine and study products. Elena learned to create the sisal fiber the traditional way, but her husband invented a kind of spinning wheel to create the fiber based on a bicycle wheel, which the family still uses. Creating the fiber is generally done early in the morning or in the evening when the fiber is the moistest. The weaving of the hammocks is done on special wooden frames, and created by making a series of knots at regular intervals. When the center area is finished, the two ends are gathered, to allow it to be hung. They use natural dyes to create a variety of colors and patterns. These include traditional ones as well as some of their own invention. ==References== Category:Mexican artists Category:Mexican families Category:Artists from Yucat√°n (state) ","title":"Villajuana family"},{"id":"42000180","text":"The 1964 Star World Championships were held in Boston, USA in 1964. == Results  References == * * Category:Star World Championships Category:1964 in sailing Category:Star World Championships in the United States ","title":"1964 Star World Championships"},{"id":"42000184","text":"Kashtag-e Dastgerd (, also Romanized as KƒÅshtƒÅg-e Dastgerd) is a village in Poshtkuh Rural District, in the Central District of Khash County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

Padilla was the Senate Majority Whip from his second year in office until being stripped of the position by his Senate colleagues due to resurfaced sexual harassment allegations against him. He briefly ran for lieutenant governor after withdrawing under pressure due to the same allegations. == Early life and education == Padilla grew up in Los Padillas, a rural farming community that his family helped settle over 150 years ago, and is located inside of the district he represents. He is the youngest of five children. Padilla and his siblings grew up in the All Faiths Receiving Home for Homeless Children and with various family members because his parents were unable to raise them. Padilla graduated from the University of New Mexico and University of Phoenix. == Career == Before beginning his legislative career, Padilla had been involved in the Democratic Party of New Mexico as a precinct chairman, ward chairman, county central member, and state central committee member. He also served on numerous boards and commissions prior to becoming a senator, including Youth Development Incorporated, Special Olympics New Mexico, Junior Achievement of New Mexico, Association of Commerce and Industry of New Mexico, and the New Mexico Workforce Development Board. Padilla founded Altivus CRM Solutions, a contact center and consulting firm, which specializes in building call centers and providing a number of operational consulting services. He says the company has created over 3,000 jobs in the past sixteen years. Padilla still serves as Chairman and CEO of the company. Padilla also overhauled the 311 Citizen Contact Center concept at the City of Albuquerque. Mayor Martin Chavez said Padilla \\"just did a marvelous job, he put the best call center together in the country.\\" However, a 2007 investigation by the city determined Padilla repeatedly asked an employee out on dates and made sexist comments to other women. Padilla's primary focuses as a legislator are early childhood education, jobs and economic growth, water management and conservation, science and technology deployment, and child safety and protective services. Padilla serves on nine legislative committees. He is the vice chair of the interim Science, Technology, and Telecommunications Committee and is the Senate Majority Whip. Padilla introduced the \\"Hunger-Free Students' Bill of Rights Act\\" during the 2017 regular legislative session, which prohibits any kind of humiliation, discrimination, or punishment of children whose parents did not pay the school lunch fees. The bill was signed into law by Governor Susana Martinez. Padilla explained that when he was child, he had to scrub the floor and work in the school kitchen to compensate the school for his parents' debts. He claimed he was shocked that children were still being humiliated in school cafeterias 30 years later. According to him, the new laws shift all responsibility to the parents who did not pay and will protect children from \\"lunch-shaming\\" in New Mexico schools. Padilla announced he was running in 2018 for the lieutenant governor position being vacated by John Sanchez, who was term-limited. === Sexual harassment allegations === In 2010, a group of 911 center employees sued the City of Albuquerque in federal court, alleging that Padilla, who at the time was tasked with improving the center's operations, sexually harassed employees and created a hostile work environment. Other suits were filed claiming violation of civil rights, discrimination, and retaliation. Padilla allegedly told women in his office that \\"it may be 2007 out there, but in my house it is the 1950s and women stay home, make tortillas and have babies.\\" After they complained, the women said they were retaliated against and demoted. The plaintiffs also argued the city was negligent by not uncovering other sexual harassment allegations against Padilla at former workplaces. According to The Albuquerque Journal, two women settled for $149,000. A third won a federal civil rights lawsuit that cost the city $102,200 for legal fees and counseling for the woman. Padilla maintained that he was innocent and said he had been \\"railroaded\\" by the employees. Sexual harassment claims against Padilla became an issue in the 2012 Democratic Primary when one of his opponents sent a mailer to voters that references Padilla's \\"sordid history.\\" Padilla's Democratic senate colleagues voted to remove him from his leadership position as minority whip due to the allegations, although he remained a member of the senate. ==Elections== *2016 Padilla had no opposition in the general election and received 9,668 votes. *2012 Redistricted to District 14, and with incumbent Senator Eric Griego leaving the Legislature and leaving the seat open, Padilla ran in the three-way June 5, 2012 Democratic Primary, winning with 1,065 votes (40.4%) ahead of Representative Eleanor Chavez and former Senator James Taylor; Padilla won the November 6, 2012 General election with 8,258 votes (70.7%) against Independent nominee Robert Schiller. ==References *Official page at the New Mexico Legislature *Campaign site * *Michael Padilla at Ballotpedia *Michael Padilla at the National Institute on Money in State Politics Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:New Mexico Democrats Category:New Mexico state senators Category:Politicians from Albuquerque, New Mexico Category:University of New Mexico alumni Category:University of Phoenix alumni Category:21st- century American politicians ","title":"Michael Padilla"},{"id":"42000253","text":"The 1967 Star World Championships were held in Skovshoved, Copenhagen, Denmark in 1967. ==ResultsReferences== * * Category:Star World Championships Category:1967 in sailing Category:Sailing competitions in Denmark ","title":"1967 Star World Championships"},{"id":"42000277","text":"Nasrabad-e Rutak (, also Romanized as NƒÅ≈ürƒÅbƒÅd-e R≈´tak) is a village in Poshtkuh Rural District, in the Central District of Khash County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

In 1912, Saint John Berchmans Church was opened next to St Michael's College.Info from St Michel College, retrieved 20 February 2014 Starting in the late 1930s, a shift in language was made which would result in St John Berchmans College speaking Dutch and English and the French-speaking section of the college being transferred to St Michael's College.Cegesoma.be retrieved 20 February 2014 ==Notable former students== Former students of the college include: * Henri Carton de Wiart * Pieter De Crem * Paul De Grauwe * Lorenzo Gatto * Jan Grauls * Felix De Laet, also known as Lost Frequencies * Bart Laeremans * Hubert Pierlot * Prince Amedeo of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este * Princess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant * Prince Emmanuel of Belgium * Prince Gabriel of Belgium * Princess El√©onore of Belgium * Prince Joachim of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este * Princess Maria Laura of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este * Princess Laetitia Maria of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este * Princess Luisa Maria of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este * Eric Van Rompuy * Herman Van Rompuy * Piet Van Waeyenberge * Youri Tielemans ==See also== * St Michael College, Brussels * Saint John Berchmans Church, Brussels * Society of Jesus ==References * St John Berchmans College site Category:Secondary schools in Brussels Category:Jesuit secondary schools in Belgium ","title":"St John Berchmans College, Brussels"},{"id":"42000308","text":"Sabz Gaz-e Olya (, also Romanized as Sabz Gaz-e ‚ÄòOlyƒÅ; also known as Sabs Gaz-e BƒÅlƒÅ and Sabz Gaz-e Mƒ´ƒÅnƒ´) is a village in Poshtkuh Rural District, in the Central District of Khash County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

He has an extensive criminal history and had several stints in prison through his early teens to early twenties before making a life change through music, business, and charitable acts. Hunter is based out of the South Bay of Los Angeles with his wife. He is best known for the radio single \\"Want it with us\\" and the YouTube video for the song \\"When you come home\\". == Early life == Suspended several times throughout his early high school years, Beard eventually dropped out of high school in the 10th grade and later earned a GED while incarcerated at Cummins Penitentiary. === Criminal past === Beard has an extensive criminal record, including fourteen felony counts ranging from robbery to drugs. At thirteen, he began selling drugs. This began a near decade of bad decisions and issues with the law. Four years later, at 17, Hunter was sentenced to his first of three prison terms for robbery. == Music career  Beginnings === During his last stint in prison, Beard dictated lyrics on a handheld voice recorder. Knowing he needed to avoid falling back into old habits once he was released, hip-hop became an obsession. A prison guard who heard his recordings approached him about what he planned to do after he was released. She said that she could help connect him with the music promoter Flipside Entertainment. After listening to his recordings, the promoter offered him the chance to open for Chris Brown. Unfortunately, Beard was not released in time. Yet, with validation of his skill in hand, he persevered through the remainder of his sentence with a new found drive to exit prison with a positive focus and to create music. In 2006, Beard met fellow Little Rock rapper Big Kennedy and formed The Definition. The two began recording the album \\"Music for the Def\\". From that album, the song \\"Want it with us\\" became the first single airing on both Arkansas radio station Hot 96.5 and Power 92. Power 92 called Hunter on air to play the song on the \\"Pump It or Dump it\\". The song was unanimously voted to stay with 100% of the votes in favor. The song then spread across the states of Oklahoma, Alabama, Louisiana and Florida. === Move to Los Angeles (2008‚Äì2012) === Upon moving to Los Angeles, Beard began building a fan base by playing at the many notable venues of the Hollywood Boulevard and Sunset Strip like Whiskey A Go Go and The Viper Room. He set up a clothing line and married his long-time girlfriend. L.A. Weekly took notice and writer Rebecca Haithcoat dubbed Beard a born hustler. From there Beard and his business partner Keddy Mac started to put out videos like \\"All I Know\\" and \\"No Hope for The Man\\". In 2011, Anonymous Talent interviewed Beard. He discussed how his music has multiple styles and tries to avoid sticking to one song type and instead try new things. It was during this time a fan created a video for the song \\"When You Come Home\\", which has become Beard's most popular video on YouTube. The video and song drove to the heart of those loved ones away at war. In an interview with the web series Discover, Beard tells how the song was quick to be written as it came from his real life experience of being apart from his wife while in prison. Though the similarities are vast, he felt it could be related to the experience of a family separated by war. == Discography  Studio albums === * Scars (2007) ‚Äì Released Exclusively Online * Music for the Def by The Definition (2008) ‚Äì Hunter Beard & Big Kennedy * Solar Bipolar (2011) === Appears on === * \\"Get Hypnotized\\" Music Hustle 3 featuring Lil‚Äô Wayne, Too Short & Ying-Yang Twins == References == Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:American people convicted of drug offenses Category:American people convicted of robbery Category:Rappers from Arkansas Category:21st- century American rappers ","title":"Hunter Beard"},{"id":"42000426","text":"Alpujarra is the twelfth station on Medell√≠n Metro from north to south.

At the age of 24 he was ordained priest by Archbishop Vincenzo Labini and in 1796 he became canon of the Mdina Cathedral chapter. During the French occupation of Malta Canon Caruana was made a member of the Commission de gouvernement (Government commission) but resigned some time later when he saw that he could not prevent the French from establishing unjust laws and when they started stealing precious artifices from the Maltese churches. Canon Caruana played a prominent role in the Maltese uprising against the French and in bringing the British to Malta. During the revolt, he was the commander of the battalions of ≈ªebbuƒ° and Siƒ°ƒ°iewi. Tas-Samra camp and battery fell under his overall command. In 1822 Caruana was nominated as the cathedral archdeacon and in 1829 he was appointed diocesan administrator upon the death of Bishop Ferdinando Mattei. Two years later, Pope Gregory XVI appointed him as the successor of Mattei and he was consecrated on 15 May 1831 by Publio Maria Sant, who would eventually become his successor in 1847.

Certain semiconductors have multiple \\"valleys\\" in the electronic band structure of the first Brillouin zone, and are known as multivalley semiconductors. Valleytronics is the technology of control over the valley degree of freedom, a local maximum/minimum on the valence/conduction band, of such multivalley semiconductors. The term was coined in analogy to spintronics. While in spintronics the internal degree of freedom of spin is harnessed to store, manipulate and read out bits of information, the proposal for valleytronics is to perform similar tasks using the multiple extrema of the band structure, so that the information of 0s and 1s would be stored as different discrete values of the crystal momentum.

Lori Rackl of Chicago Sun-Times gave the episode a 4 star rating (out of 4 stars), calling it \\"a sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking story about an L.A.-based self-help author\\" and added that the first two episodes \\"reveal a much more nuanced, poignant tale, punctuated by some genuinely funny scenes.\\" LaToya Ferguson of The A.V. Club gave the series a grade of \\"A-\\", calling it \\"a very solid drama\\" that should be on HBO or Showtime. Ferguson also praised the characters and the series's messiness, writing \\"Visually, it's almost flawless (there's one obvious green-screen moment in the pilot, but it's not Ringer level), but every character here is deeply flawed.\\" Los Angeles Timess Mary McNamara lauded the series' cast's portrayal of the characters and deemed the series \\"smartly acted, crisply written and willing to address all manner of issues ‚Äî marriage, betrayal, family economics, friendship, even the pitfalls of public domesticity ‚Äî in gratifyingly complex ways.\\" Brian Lowry, writing for Variety, applauded the series' cast and material, noting how it sticks to the network's demographic while maintaining a level of quality.

The Championship is the second-tier rugby league competition in the United Kingdom. The 2014 season started on 16 February and ends on 5 October with the Grand Final at a venue to be announced. 2014 is the second and final season to consist of a 14-team division, with the league being reduced to 12 teams in 2015 as part of the Rugby Football League's reform of the leagues. The 2014 season consists of two stages. The regular season was played over 26 round-robin fixtures, in which each of the fourteen teams involved in the competition played each other once at home and once away. In the Championship, a win was worth three points in the table, a draw worth two points apiece, and a loss by less than 12 points during the game earned one bonus point. Defeats by more than 12 points yielded no points. The Championship will be decided through the second stage of the season, the play-offs, which has been re-structured following the expansion. The play-offs now adopts the 8-team play-off, similar to what is used in the Super League with the top eight teams in the table contest to play in the Grand Final, the winners of which will be crowned champions. A decision whether to use the club-call system, as used in Super League, will be taken during the regular season. ==Regular seasonRound 1=== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border-collapse:collapse; font- size:80%; text-align:center; width:100%;\\" - c1d8ff;\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:19%;\\"Home ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:6%;\\"Score ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:19%;\\"Away !colspan=6Match Information - ccc;\\" !width=17%Date and Time !width=19%Venue !width=13%Referee !width=7%Attendance - f5faff;\\" align=left  22px North Wales Crusaders 34 - 16 align=left  Barrow Raiders 16 February, 14:30 GMT Racecourse Ground Gareth Hewer 1,118 - f5faff;\\" align=left  Dewsbury Rams 11 - 10 align=left  Featherstone Rovers 16 February, 15:00 GMT Tetley's Stadium Chris Leatherbarrow 2,096 - f5faff;\\" align=left  Halifax 28 - 18 align=left  Swinton Lions 16 February, 15:00 GMT The Shay Joe Cobb 1,750 - f5faff;\\" align=left  Keighley Cougars 36 - 14 align=left  Whitehaven 16 February, 15:00 GMT Cougar Park George Stokes 1,061 - f5faff;\\" align=left  Leigh Centurions 52 - 12 align=left  Batley Bulldogs 16 February, 15:00 GMT Leigh Sports Village Matt Thomason  - f5faff;\\" align=left  Sheffield Eagles P - P align=left  Rochdale Hornets TBA Owlerton Stadium   - f5faff;\\" align=left  Workington Town 12 - 22 align=left  Doncaster 16 February, 15:00 GMT Derwent Park Jamie Bloem 895 - c1d8ff;\\" ! colspan=12  Source: } ===Round 2=== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:80%; text-align:center; width:100%;\\" - c1d8ff;\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:19%;\\"Home ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:6%;\\"Score ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:19%;\\"Away !colspan=6Match Information - ccc;\\" !width=17%Date and Time !width=19%Venue !width=13%Referee !width=7%Attendance - f5faff;\\" align=left  Barrow Raiders 8 - 52 align=left  Leigh Centurions 23 February, 14:00 GMT Craven Park C Leatherbarrow 1,252 - f5faff;\\" align=left  Batley Bulldogs - align=left  Keighley Cougars 23 February, 14:00 GMT Mount Pleasant   - f5faff;\\" align=left  Doncaster 30 - 12 align=left  Keighley Cougars 23 February, 15:00 GMT Keepmoat Stadium G Hewer 647 - f5faff;\\" align=left  Featherstone Rovers 28 - 20 align=left  Halifax 23 February, 15:00 GMT Bigfellas Stadium M Thomason 2,583 - f5faff;\\" align=left  Rochdale Hornets 12 - 42 align=left  Dewsbury Rams 23 February, 15:00 GMT Spotland Stadium J Bloem 817 - f5faff;\\" align=left  Swinton Lions 16 - 30 align=left  Workington Town 23 February, 15:00 GMT Leigh Sports Village W Turley 548 - f5faff;\\" align=left  Whitehaven - align=left  22px North Wales Crusaders 27 April, 15:00 GMT Recreation Ground   - c1d8ff;\\" ! colspan=12  Source: } ===Notes=== A.

Felipa learned these designs from her grandmother. Frond collection is done by the entire family, cut while young and unopened to keep their shine. The leaves are then separated and left to dry, then they are bleached using sulfur. Many of the leaves are then dyed with plants such as \\"chackxin\\" traditionally in reds and ochre. Weaving is done with the hands only and no frames. Designs are woven into the pieces using two or more colors, and/or undyed fronds and can be intricate, forming various geometric forms.

His father is Mehmet Tevfik Mataracƒ±. He finished his primary and secondary education in his hometown. After graduating from high school in Trabzon, Mataracƒ± started to study law at the university. However, he dropped out and discontinued his education after a while. He then studied at a civil engineering college, and obtained a certificate as a construction technician. Mataracƒ± served as manager of Village Public Works Services in Rize Province before he became an executive of the Tea Planters' Cooperation and later head of Province Physical Education Directorate. ==Politician career== Tuncay Mataracƒ± entered politics and was elected deputy of Rize Province from Justice Party at the 1977 general election. With the forming of a coalition cabinet by B√ºlent Ecevit, he was appointed Minister of Customs and Monopolies in the 42nd government on January 5, 1978. Responsible also for state monopoly of tea trade in Turkey and proficient in tea processing from his former employment, Mataracƒ± changed the tea leaf picking policy which was rigorously enforced. The picking of tea leaves was allowed to be done only by hand in Turkey in order to achieve a good quality tea product. However, hand picking did not allow reasonable profit for the tea planters in Rize due to the high labor costs. Mataracƒ± lifted the ban on tea leaf picking by tool, and this was much welcomed in his hometown. On November 12, 1979 the cabinet dissolved, and Mataracƒ±'s term as a minister ended. ==Conviction== On April 27, 1981, the National Security Council (, MGK), the military junta, which had staged the 1980 military coup on September 12, put Tuncay Mataracƒ± on trial at the Supreme Court (). The trial began on June 15, 1981. Mataracƒ± was accused of bribery and abuse of power during his office term as government minister along with 21 co-defendants, among them former Minister of Public Works, ≈ûerafettin El√ßi, and a mobster, Abuzer Uƒüurlu. On March 16, 1982, the Supreme Court sentenced Mataracƒ± to 36 years of aggravated imprisonment, a fine of 787,386,166 Turkish lira, life banishment from government office and driver's license revocation for six-years. Of the co-defendants, only ≈ûerafettin El√ßi was acquitted while all others were convicted to various terms of imprisonment between ten months and six years. Mataracƒ±'s punishment was the most severe of any government minister in Turkey. Mataracƒ± was incarcerated in Kayseri Prison. Upon the Law #4616 on Parole enacted in 1991, he was released from the prison. The high amount of fine, which he did not pay in the beginning vanished into thin air. When he paid the fine in 1993, it had lost value due to high inflation rate. In an interview made with a local daily in Rize in March 2013, he stated that he is the only banned politician left, and the ban would terminate at the end of 2013. ==References== Category:1935 births Category:People from Rize Category:Justice Party (Turkey) politicians Category:20th-century Turkish politicians Category:Deputies of Rize Category:Government ministers of Turkey Category:Prisoners and detainees of Turkey Category:Living people Category:Ministers of Customs and Trade of Turkey Category:Turkish politicians convicted of corruption Category:Members of the 42nd government of Turkey ","title":"Tuncay Mataracƒ±"},{"id":"42000637","text":"Lauri Kivari (born 23 March 1996) is a Finnish freestyle skier.

He served as a model for Jaggers, the Charles Dickens character from Great Expectations. James Harmer appears in a series of historical financial crime novels written by Susan Grossey: Fatal Forgery, The Man in the Canary Waistcoat, and Worm in the Blossom. James Harmer ==Early life== Harmer was the son of a Spitalfields weaver, and was left an orphan at age 10. He was articled to an attorney in 1792, but left his office on making an early marriage. He was afterwards transferred to Messrs. Fletcher & Wright of Bloomsbury, and practised for himself in 1799. ==Legal reformer== Harmer's practice was mainly in the criminal courts, and experience there made him an advocate of reform in criminal procedure. He came across police conspiracies to commit perjury, to secure convictions. In 1816 he was one of those who exposed the thief-taking scandal, and the corruption of the system of rewards. Title page of James Harmer's 1807 work claiming a miscarriage of justice in the case of John Holloway and Owen Haggerty The parliamentary committee for the reform of the criminal law took Harmer's evidence; and Sir James Mackintosh said it was as telling as any they had heard. He exposed the delinquency of witnesses, and especially the mode of obtaining evidence against Holloway and Haggerty, who were executed in 1807 for the murder of Steele. He took much trouble in investigating cases where he considered that prisoners had been wrongly committed. But into the 1830s, leading Old Bailey barrister, such as Charles Law and Charles Phillips, opposed the reforms Harmer was pressing, such as the right of defence counsel to make speeches. ==Radical causes== In the aftermath of the Invasion of Isle de France in 1810, Henry Brougham acted as defence barrister for some British prisoners who had joined the French. Harmer was their choice of solicitor. In 1819 Harmer represented Samuel Bamford after the Peterloo massacre. In the Peterloo aftermath Harmer, and Henry Dennison of Liverpool, represented the family of John Lees of Oldham, fatally wounded, at an extended inquest starting 8 September 1819. Dennison, Harmer and Charles Pearson were thanked by the \\"Report on the Metropolitan and Central Committee, Appointed for the Relief of the Manchester Sufferers\\" for their investigations.Report of the Metropolitan and Central Committee appointed for the relief of the Manchester sufferers: with an appendix, containing the names of the sufferers and the nature and extent of their injuries: also, an account of the distribution of the funds and other documents, Hume Tracts (1820), at p. 12.

Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/60204293 William Hone's book The Whole Proceedings before the Coroner's Court at Oldham, which exposed the use of force at Peterloo, relied heavily on Harmer's work with witness testimony. In 1820 Harmer took on the defence of Cato Street conspirators. In 1820, also, he was brought in by the defence at the treason trial of James Wilson in Glasgow. ==Later life== In 1833 Harmer was elected alderman of the ward of Farringdon Without, which he had represented since 1826 in the common council, and gave up his lucrative legal practice. He was sheriff of London in 1834. He resigned his alderman's gown in 1840, when his election to the mayoralty was successfully opposed on the ground of his being proprietor of the Weekly Dispatch, which then advocated radical religious and political views. Harmer took a leading part in establishing the Royal Free Hospital. He lived at Greenhithe, Kent, where he built Ingress Abbey, mainly of stone procured from old London Bridge on its demolition. He died on 12 June 1853 and was buried on the 16th in Kensal Green cemetery. He left a large fortune to his granddaughter. ==Works== Harmer wrote pamphlets on behalf of Holloway and Haggerty in 1807, on the case of George Mathews in 1819, and in 1825 on behalf of Edward Harris. ==References== ;Attribution Category:1777 births Category:1853 deaths Category:English solicitors Category:People from Spitalfields ","title":"James Harmer"},{"id":"42000748","text":"William Baldwin O'Neill is an American politician and a Democratic member of the New Mexico Senate representing District 13 since January 15, 2013.

It existed in several versions - with different stars on different networks in different years. Hood was an importer in San Francisco who dealt in rare items. John Dunning summarized the show's premise as follows: \\"With his sidekick Sanderson ('Sandy') Taylor, Hood traveled the world seeking artifacts for his import house. Each item found by Hood had an intriguing history and was inevitably linked to some present-day mystery.\\"Dunning, John. (1976). Tune in Yesterday: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, 1925-1976. Prentice-Hall, Inc. . P. 116. The character of Hood was based on real-life importer Richard Gump, who lived in San Francisco. Gump also was a consultant for the program. Hood was a character with a multi-faceted personality. One website devoted to old-time radio wrote about him as follows: > Gregory Hood was also an accomplished pianist and composer, a self-taught > forensics expert, spoke several languages fluently, was an expert in ancient > and modern armament, had a military intelligence background, was a wine > expert with an extensive rare wine cellar, and was an acknowledged expert in > oriental tapestry. He lived in a penthouse on San Francisco's Nob Hill and > employed a Chinese valet, Fong. On June 3, 1946, The Casebook of Gregory Hood began on the Mutual Broadcasting System, replacing The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes for the summer. Although intended to be just a summer replacement, it continued in the fall, sponsored by Petri Wine. Jeffrey Marks, in his biography of co-creator Anthony Boucher, explained, \\"The show had originally been planned as a summer replacement for The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes in 1946, but continued for the next year when the radio network had difficulty in reaching an agreement with the Conan Doyle estate.\\"Marks, Jeffrey. (2008). Anthony Boucher. McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 86. The program had another full- season run on ABC in 1949-50 and also \\"resurfaced periodically in summer slots.\\" The show was written by Boucher and Denis Green, who also teamed to write the Holmes show. Marks provided this background: > Boucher and Green did such a good job for the Holmes show that they were > asked about writing an original series for Mutual Radio. Radio shows relied > on new episodes. Just as TV airs re-runs during the summer, radio shows gave > their actors a summer hiatus of 13 weeks. Networks frequently ran original > short-run programming during the summer. Boucher and Green came up with \\"The > Casebook of Gregory Hood\\" a San Francisco-based antiquities expert who > seemed to find current day crimes in the artifacts that he dealt with. The > Casebook of Gregory Hood was nearly identical to The New Adventures of > Sherlock Holmes in its opening: same sponsor, same announcement, same > narrator frame for storytelling, and the same music. The narrator stopped by > to visit Gregory either in his office or home, and the story was told by > Hood. Hood's own Watson, Sandy Taylor, accompanied him. Taylor was Hood's > lawyer and friend.Marks, Jeffrey. (2008). Anthony Boucher. McFarland & > Company, Inc. . P. 85. Book reviewer Bertil Falk noted that the technique Boucher and Green used had deep roots in storytelling. He wrote: \\"The structure was of a very ancient kind, a frame story where Gregory Hood and his friend tell Harry Bartell a story from the casebook of Gregory Hood. It is a literary method well known from The Arabian Nights and much older than that, since it was used in the Sanskrit work Panchatantra more than two thousand years ago. Gale Gordon played Gregory Hood in the initial version of the program. Others who had the leading role later were Elliott Lewis, Jackson Beck, Paul McGrath, Martin Gabel and George Petrie.Buxton, Frank and Owen, Bill (1972). The Big Broadcast: 1920-1950. The Viking Press. SBN 670-16240-x. P.47. Sidekick Sanderson Taylor was portrayed at various times by Art Gilmore, Carl Harbord, William Bakewell and Howard McNear. Changes in stars, time slots and networks undoubtedly hindered the show's success. Marks wrote: \\"The show suffered from a constantly rotating cast. ... Boucher grew increasingly annoyed with the lack of support for the series.\\" Boucher indicated his dissatisfaction in some personal correspondence: \\"As to myself and the contest -- the excellent idea you proposed of entering a Gregory Hood short story no longer appeals to me. My relations with the agency controlling the Hood program have become so unsatisfactory that I have no desire to build up their property for them, nor to associate myself too closely with it.\\" In 2009, Crippen & Landru Publishers produced a volume of their Lost Classic Series devoted to The Casebook of Gregory Hood. The book contains 14 scripts from the series. ==References * Ten streaming episodes available from archive.org.

In 1836, he went to study in Vienna, where he supported himself (and found inspiration) working for a landscaper. He remained there until 1840, when his father's illness forced him to return home. After his father died, Hugo took over his position at the art school and remained there the rest of his life. Among his most prominent students were Izidor Kr≈°njavi and Adolf Waldinger. In addition to the school, he maintained his own private art studio where he specialized in landscapes with peasants, soldiers and animals. In 1864, forty-two of his pencil drawings, depicting the ancient ruins and forests of Slavonia, were displayed at a major exhibition in Zagreb.

He was part of the youth team that reached the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup in 2012, eventually losing to rivals Blackburn Rovers. In May 2012, Evans signed a professional one-year contract following the completion of his scholarship. In September 2012, Evans joined Conference North side Droylsden on an initial one-month loan. He made his debut for the club in a 2‚Äì1 league defeat to Worcester City. His first goal for the club, a superb shot from outside the box, earned the Bloods three points against Gloucester City in a 1‚Äì0 win. His loan was later extended, with Evans playing his final game for Droylsden in December in a 5‚Äì1 defeat to Boston United. He made a total of six appearances for the club in all competitions, scoring once. In May 2013, Evans was released by Burnley due to the expiry of his contract. In June 2013, he joined Scottish Premiership side Inverness Caledonian Thistle on a free transfer. His professional debut for the club came in January 2014, in a 1‚Äì0 away win at Aberdeen, where he replaced Billy McKay as a substitute. Though not included in the first team, Evans would spend his playing time at the club's reserve, making an impressive display. Evans was released by Inverness at the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season. After returning home, Evans immediately joined Bohemians in the League of Ireland Premier Division where he spent 2 years before making the short move to northside rivals Shelbourne in July 2016. Following two-and-a-half seasons with Shels, Evans moved to Longford Town in November 2018 ahead of the 2019 season. ==International career== Evans has represented the Republic of Ireland at under-15, under-16 and under-19 level.

The art center reaches its local and international publics in person, through printed matter, and on the Internet. The current programme consists of simultaneous and overlapping solo exhibitions, which are presented at differing physical and temporal scales, and with correspondingly different mediation, as well as events, off-site projects, and publications. The director is given autonomy over the programme by the board of directors, and a new director is hired every four years. ==History== Objectif Exhibitions (originally typeset as \\"objectif_exhibitions\\") was founded in 1999 by Philippe Pirotte, Win Van den Abbeele, and Patrick Van Rossem. Pirotte served as its first director from 1999 to 2004. When Pirotte became director of Kunsthalle Bern, Van den Abbeele became the second director of Objectif Exhibitions. In 2007, Mai Abu ElDahab became the new director, and shifted the programmatic focus to one-person exhibitions, as well as publications and events. Chris Fitzpatrick is the current director, and was hired in 2012. Objectif Exhibitions is currently located at Kleine Markt 7-9, and was moved to its current space in 2007 by ElDahab.

Her first restaurant, Karyn's Raw Bistro, is the longest- standing gourmet raw food restaurant in the United States. == Early life == Calabrese grew up in Hyde Park, a South Side neighborhood of Chicago. Calabrese worked as a professional model in her teens and into her twenties, and was featured in national magazine and television commercials. == Career == Calabrese became a raw foodist with the impression that eating uncooked foods improves health. In the early 1980s, she hosted a support group at her home, and within six months, the group grew from six to 90 people. Calabrese decided to transition careers from modeling to cooking and consulting about the raw and vegan lifestyle. Calabrese has opened three restaurants (Karyn's Raw Bistro, Karyn's Cooked, and Karyn's On Green), a market (Karyn's Fresh Corner), a meal program (Karyn's At Home), a holistic therapy center (Karyn's Inner Beauty Center and O2 Day Spa), a branded line of food, a cookbook, a cleanse guide, and a natural make-up and skin care line. Karyn also teaches workshops and promotes raw foodism, holistic therapies, and natural longevity. Calabrese began having financial problems in 2012 after her restaurant in Lincoln Park burned down and business at her other locations stifled; in 2015 and 2016 she had been sued four times, for failing to meet accessibility standards for disabled persons at her restaurants, not paying rent for the spaces of her restaurants, and not paying condominium fees where she lived. She started a GoFundMe campaign to help keep her business afloat, but faced accusations of fraud and unsanitary practices. In 2017, her flagship restaurant in Lincoln Park also closed down. == Restaurants == Karyn and Beyonc√© at Karyn's Cooked in December 2013 Calabrese owns and manages three restaurants in Chicago: === Karyn's On Green === According to the 2014 Zagat Survey, Karyn's On Green is the top-rated vegan restaurant in Chicago and the most formal of Karyn's restaurants.

In 1966, he caused considerable controversy in both the Catholic and Anglican communities by publicly leaving the Roman Catholic Church on the basis of what he said at the time was an \\"intellectual rejection of the Papacy.\\" == Background == Davis was born in Swindon to Charles Lionel Davis (1893‚Äì1968), a sign painter, and Agatha Ellen Lapham (1893‚Äì1979). He was raised as a Catholic and went to school at St. Brendan's Grammar School in Bristol (now St. Brendan's Sixth Form College). Davis was ordained in 1946 and then had two years of graduate studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He taught at the seminary in St Edmund's Seminary, Ware from 1952 to 1965 and was the first Catholic to give the F. D. Maurice Lectures at King's College London, which were published in 1966 as God's Grace in History. He was also editor of Clergy Review (now The Pastoral Review). He received an appointment to Heythrop College, University of London, in 1965, where he remained for only 16 months. == Defection from the Church == Davis announced that he was leaving the Roman Catholic Church on 21 December 1966. The decision was widely publicised and caused the Observer to describe his actions as leaving a \\"crisis of authority\\" in the Church. The Catholic Herald described his defection from the Church as \\"a cause for sadness, not only for the church, the man himself, and those who admired him and his work, but because of the inevitable bitterness that invariably follows such a step,\\" before suggesting that it would have been preferable if Davis had been quieter in his exit. In an article circulated by Davis at the time of his public exit, he states that the Church had become too powerful and too dehumanising ‚Äì \\"a vast, impersonal, unfree, and inhuman system,\\" that it had been compromised by its connection with the Nazi regime. The article also argued that orthodoxy had limited Davis' intellectual horizons: \\"I have had to remove a mountain of ecclesiastical rubble in order to produce a few tiny plants of creative thought.\\" Davis's exit from the Church was included in an autobiography published the following year titled A Question of Conscience. In 1967, Davis married Florence Henderson (not to be confused with the actress), a Brooklyn-born Catholic theology student and member of The Grail, a Catholic women's movement. In 2006, their daughter, Claire Henderson Davis stated that her father left the priesthood to marry her mother.Davis, Claire Henderson. \\"Life with my father, the rebel priest\\", The Guardian, March 18, 2006 The theologian Herbert McCabe published a critique ‚Äì albeit a sympathetic one ‚Äì in the journal New Blackfriars. McCabe's editorial argued that leaving the Church because it was corrupt was unreasonable since the Church had always been corrupt. Davis's leaving the Church has been described as having the same effect on the Catholic Church in Britain as the publication of John A. T. Robinson's Honest to God had on Anglicanism.The philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe wrote to Davis letting him know that she was glad that he had left the Church, as she regarded his beliefs about the Eucharist as being contrary to Catholic teaching. == After defection == He became Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. In 1970 he moved to Concordia University in Montreal to chair the Department of Religious Studies. He became the President of the Canadian Society for the Study of Religion. In 1978, Davis gave the Hulsean Lectures at Cambridge University, which were published in 1980 as Theology and Political Society, which reflected his interest in the relation between religion and sociology. In 1995 a collection of essays titled The Promise of Critical Theology was published in Davis' honour. In 1991, Davis retired and moved back to Britain, living in Edinburgh. In the last several years of his life he returned to the Catholic fold and received communion at Mass in Edinburgh and Cambridge. He suffered from Parkinson's disease and died in 1999. == Subsequent publications== In 1974, Davis published Temptations of Religion which identifies four temptations unique to religion. He calls these lust for certitude, pride of history, cosmic vanity, and anger of morality. In 1986, he published What is living, what is dead in Christianity today?: breaking the liberal-conservative deadlock. == References == Category:1923 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Theologians ","title":"Charles Davis (theologian)"},{"id":"42001053","text":"Mowtowr-e Qalandar () is a village in Gowhar Kuh Rural District, Nukabad District, Khash County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

The present county of St. Lucie was founded in 1905 and covers a small part of the same area. After Andrew Jackson received authority to take possession of the Florida Territory, ceded by Spain in 1821, he divided the whole territory into two counties, along the Suwannee River. All of the area west formed Escambia, and all of it east formed St. Johns County. In 1824, St Johns was further divided into Mosquito County. In 1844, Mosquito County was further divided into several counties, including St. Lucie. In 1855, St. Lucie County was renamed Brevard County. However, subsequent changes in boundaries make the present Brevard County contain very little of the original St. Lucie County. The name \\"St. Lucie\\" is originally derived from the name of a settlement near Jupiter Inlet which was founded on St. Lucia's day in 1566. Due to map making and map reading errors, the name later came to be associated with the present day city of St. Lucie, Florida. After \\"La Florida\\" and \\"St. Augustine,\\" it is the oldest place name in the United States. == See also == * Mills O. Burnham * Ossian B. Hart * John Heermans * William H. Peck * William F.

From mid October 2011 until 3 December 2011 15:00 UT the small dim asteroid had an elongation less than 60 degrees from the Sun. (While less than 18 degrees from the Sun any dim asteroid can be lost in astronomical twilight, and many observatories can not see below ~40 degrees from the horizon.) On 3 December 2011 at 15:20 UT the asteroid passed from Earth and at 16:20 UT passed from the Moon. The asteroid was then discovered on 8 December 2011 by Lincoln Near- Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) at an apparent magnitude of 19 using a reflecting telescope. At the time of discovery the asteroid was near opposition to the Sun. It has an observation arc of 22 days with an uncertainty parameter of 7. Virtual clones of the asteroid that fit the uncertainty region in the known trajectory show a 1 in 455,000 chance that the asteroid will impact Earth on 2 December 2056. With a 2056 Palermo Technical Scale of ‚àí4.35, the odds of impact by in 2056 are about 22387 times less than the background hazard level of Earth impacts which is defined as the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact. Using the nominal orbit, JPL Horizons shows that the asteroid will be from Earth on 2 December 2056. {class=\\" collapsible collapsed sortable\\" +H < 24 asteroids passing less than 1 LD from Earth !Asteroid !Date !Nominal approach distance (LD) !Min. distance (LD) !Max. distance (LD) !Absolute magnitude (H) !Size (meters) -bgcolor=#c2c2c2   1914-12-31  0.606  0.604  0.608  19.4  279‚Äì900 -bgcolor=#c2c2c2   1918-09-17  0.911  0.909  0.913  17.9  556‚Äì1795 -bgcolor=#c2c2c2   1925-08-30  0.903  0.901  0.905  18.5  443‚Äì477 -bgcolor=#c2c2c2   1936-01-06  0.553  0.553  0.553  23.2  48‚Äì156 -bgcolor=#c2c2c2   1971-04-11  0.616  0.587  0.651  21.2  122‚Äì393 -bgcolor=#c2c2c2   1976-10-17  0.854  0.853  0.855  22.3  73‚Äì237 -bgcolor=#c2c2c2   1981-11-04  0.818  0.813  0.823  21.4  111‚Äì358 -bgcolor=#c2c2c2   1991-04-08  0.847  0.676  1.027  23.3  46‚Äì149 -bgcolor=#c2c2c2   2001-11-08  0.454  0.318  3.436  20.7  153‚Äì494 - 2002 MN  2002-06-14  0.312  0.312  0.312  23.6  40‚Äì130 -   2011-11-08  0.845  0.845  0.845  21.9  320‚Äì400 - '  2011-12-03  0.904  0.901  0.907  23.2  48‚Äì156' - 2018 AH  2018-01-02  0.773  0.772  0.773  22.5  67‚Äì216 -   2018-04-15  0.502  0.501  0.503  23.7  35‚Äì135 -bgcolor=#e2e2e2   2028-06-26  0.647  0.647  0.647  18.2  921‚Äì943 -bgcolor=#e2e2e2 99942 Apophis  2029-04-13  0.0981  0.0963  0.1000  19.7  310‚Äì340 -bgcolor=#e2e2e2   2041-04-08  0.283  0.274  0.354  23.3  46‚Äì149 -bgcolor=#e2e2e2   2047-06-06  0.789  0.251  38.135  22.4  70‚Äì226 -bgcolor=#e2e2e2   2058-09-22  0.918  0.917  0.919  23.8  37‚Äì119 -bgcolor=#e2e2e2   2065-05-28  0.865  0.856  0.874  20.7  153‚Äì494 -bgcolor=#e2e2e2   2075-11-08  0.592  0.499  0.752  21.9  320‚Äì400 -bgcolor=#e2e2e2   2101-01-02  0.621  0.615  0.628  21.0  133‚Äì431 -bgcolor=#e2e2e2   2129-10-19  0.239  0.155  0.381  22.7  61‚Äì197 -bgcolor=#e2e2e2 101955 Bennu  2135-09-25  0.780  0.308  1.406  20.19  472‚Äì512 -bgcolor=#e2e2e2   2140-12-01  0.634  0.631  0.637  19.3  427‚Äì593 -bgcolor=#e2e2e2   2146-03-23  0.896  0.744  1.288  22.8  58‚Äì188 -bgcolor=#e2e2e2   2148-01-22  0.771  0.770  0.771  21.1  127‚Äì411 -bgcolor=#e2e2e2   2156-02-13  0.685  0.652  6.856  22.9  56‚Äì179 -bgcolor=#e2e2e2   2156-12-16  0.998  0.955  1.215  21.6  101‚Äì327 } ==References External links == * * * # Category:Minor planet object articles (unnumbered) 20111203 20111208 ","title":"2011 XC2"},{"id":"42001091","text":"Shurabad-e Fandaq (, also Romanized as Sh≈´rƒÅbƒÅd-e Fandaq; also known as Sh≈´rƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Gowhar Kuh Rural District, Nukabad District, Khash County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

Over the following 90 years, its campus grew in size to accommodate the increasing student population. In 1935, a new school was built on a 22-acre site on the outskirts of the city. In 1941, this was expanded and in 1958 a new primary school was built. Originally, it only taught Greek and Latin.

Remodeled in the summer of 2005, the facility features four (4) NHL-sized ice rinks (the Spartans play on the North Rink, which has a listed seating capacity of approximately 550, but is routinely packed with upwards of 1000 fans on game nights), as well as a full-service Pro Shop, a full-service Food Court, and meeting space for up to 500 guests. Additionally, Stanley's Sports Bar & Grill, opened in January 2006, features food, beer, and wine. In 1995, the arena hosted the Women's Pacific Rim Championship ice hockey tournament. A proposed expansion would add another two rink surfaces and more than double the size of the facility, but would displace the San Jose Municipal Firing Range. If the expansion is approved, it would begin construction in 2020 and finish in December 2021. ==References * Category:Indoor ice hockey venues in California Category:San Jose Sharks arenas Category:Sports venues in San Jose, California Category:Sports venues in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Sports venues completed in 2005 Category:Year of establishment missing Category:College ice hockey venues in the United States Category:National Hockey League practice facilities ","title":"Solar4America Ice"},{"id":"42001109","text":"Vali Mohammadabad (, also Romanized as Valƒ´ Mo·∏©ammadƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Gowhar Kuh Rural District, Nukabad District, Khash County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

Kebodeaux, 570 U.S. 387 (2013), was a recent case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Sex Offender Notification and Registration Act (SORNA) was constitutional under the Necessary and Proper Clause.. ==Background== The Sex Offender Notification and Registration Act (SORNA) is a federal law () requiring federal sex offenders to register in the States where they reside, study, and/or work. The respondent, Anthony Kebodeaux, was convicted by a court-martial of a federal sex offense. After dishonorable discharge from the Air Force, Kebodeaux moved to Texas, where he registered with state authorities as a sex offender. When he moved within Texas, he failed to update his registration and was prosecuted under SORNA. The District Court convicted. He later appealed to the Fifth Circuit, which overturned his conviction under the Wetterling Act, as SORNA had not been passed at the time of his conviction.Syllabus, p. 1 ==ArgumentsPetitioner's argument (U.S.)=== Congress has the power to subject a federal sex offender to criminal penalties for failing to register or update said registration (). The appeals court's decision to reverse Kebodeaux's SORNA conviction was based on a mistake in applying pre-SORNA law. Contrary to the court's decision, Kebodeaux could be prosecuted under the Wetterling Act.Petitioner's brief, p.p. 14-15 is constitutional under the Necessary and Proper Clause as a \\"legitimate\\" consequence of the conviction under Smith v. Doe.Petitioner's brief, p. 15 ===Respondent's argument (Kebodeaux)=== SORNA was an unlawful expansion of federal authority as it infringed on the states' police power. Kebodeaux's conviction violated limits set by United States v. Comstock.Respondent's brief, p.p. 16-17 Additionally, the Attorney General did not adopt a regulations applying SORNA to pre-enactment offenders until after Kebodeaux's SORNA-related sentence expired.Respondent's brief, p. 18 ==DecisionMajority opinion=== The majority opinion, written by Justice Breyer, ruled that SORNA was constitutional under the Necessary and Proper Clause.Opinion, p. 2 Despite his release before SORNA's enactment, the release was unconditional, as opposed to what the Fifth Circuit said. Additionally, he was still subject to the Wetterling Act, which had similar requirements.Opinion, p.p. 3-4 This was because the crime he committed under the Uniform Code of Military Justice had been designated by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to fall under the Wetterling Act.Opinion, p. 4 Congress had the power under the Military Regulation and the Necessary and Proper Clauses to apply civil consequences to the UCMJ crime.Opinion, p. 8 ===Concurrences=== Roberts Chief Justice Roberts wrote a concurrence where he argued that the Court's opinion, with its discussion of the public safety concerns addressed by SORNA, could lead \\"incautious readers\\" to surmise the Court was endorsing a non-existent federal police power, citing United States v. Morrison.Roberts, C.J., concurring in judgment, p.p. 3-4 Alito Justice Alito also wrote a concurrence. In it, he argued that the fact that sex offenses under the UCMJ are usually only tried by military tribunals, a convicted offender possibly might not register with the State in which he/she resides.Alito, J., concurring in judgment, p. 2 ===Dissenting opinions=== Scalia Justice Scalia joined in Parts I, II, and III-B of Justice Thomas's dissent, but not Part III-A. He stated this was because he did not believe that what is necessary and proper to enforce a statute under an enumerated power is not necessary and proper to the execution of that power citing Gonzales v. Raich. Scalia stated that the Opinion did not declare that the Wetterling Act, on which they based their application to Kebodeaux, was necessary and proper, or that SORNA was designed to execute the preceding act.Scalia, J., dissenting Thomas Justice Thomas wrote the main dissent. He argued that SORNA was an unconstitutional usurpation of State police power.Thomas, J., dissenting, p. 1 This was because SORNA failed the legitimate use test Chief Justice John Marshall set forth in McCulloch v. Maryland.Thomas, J., dissenting, p. 4 Additionally, since Kebodeaux had completed his sentence, he was exempt from coverage under the Military Regulation Clause.Thomas, J., dissenting, p. 6 Thomas further argued that the decision in this case violated the precedent set by United States v. Comstock.Thomas, J., dissenting, p. 14 ==Subsequent history== The Fifth Circuit affirmed the conviction per curiam. ==NotesReferences== *Petitioner's brief *Respondent's brief ==External links== * *United States v.

One of these students, studying in France, brought the first football in Pristina in 1919. The ball was a present from a French doctor. After the arrival of the first ball in Pristina, it was mostly youngsters who kicked it around, unorganized and with no institutional support. During that time, only friendly matches were played. The city of Pristina was a small town of 16,000 citizens when in 1922, the first ‚Äúblue‚Äù club named Kosova‚Äù was founded. The club consisted mainly of Pristina Garrison soldiers and did not participate in official competition due to not being registered. The oldest club of Kosovo was not competing in official levels, but was playing friendly matches with other teams, domestic and from the region. In 1926, Bashkimi football club was also founded in Pristina and consisted mainly of craftsmen. With the advantage of strong material consolidation in comparison to KF Kosova, Bashkimi was registered in the Sub league of football in Banovina, Skopje. In 1945, Bashkimi won the championship title in Kosovo, a success which they also repeated a year after. Following World War II, KF Bashkimi and KF Kosova continued to be active in the football field and they were joined by other clubs, such as Milicioneri, Bratsvo and Radni√ßki. In 1947, KF Bashkimi and KF Kosova merged into one club by the name of Proleter. This change uplifted the team, and their biggest success was being placed in the quarterfinals of State Championship in Yugoslavia, where they lost 2:0 to Partizan. Proleter changed its name to Jedinstvo in the 1948/1949. Jedinstvo which was strong in both economic and organizational aspect merged with Bratsvo from Pristina and Zheleznicari from Fushe Kosove. The new team named Kosova became leader in state championship by winning in two consecutive seasons during 1951/52 and 1953/54 Since 1960 the club has won 19 championship titles, including the last season of 2012/2013. During this period, KF Prishtina has become the only Kosovar football club to win the Kosovar Superliga and Kosovar Cup trophies in one season (2012/13). Their fan club is called Plisat. Some of the most notable players of this club who found their success in international clubs later on include Debatik Curri, Fadil Vokrri, Armend Dallku, Ardian Kozniku, Kushtrim Shala, Goran Dorovic, Zoran Batrovic. ===Basketball=== KB Trep√ßa - KB Prishtina game Marko Simonoviƒá won Olympic and World Cup silver medals for Serbia Sigal Prishtina is the most successful basketball club in Pristina and in Kosovo and is now part of the Balkan League, their first non-local competition. Joining it in the Superleague is another team from Pristina, RTV 21.

This victory coincided with Streetball Kosovo's acceptance in the FIBA. Dardan Berisha from KB Sigal Prishtina was the best male athlete of 2013 according to Grupi Koha, following the success he had with the club throughout the season. ===Handball=== Handball activities in Pristina date back as far as 1948 where we see the emerging of the first teams such as Kosova e Prishtin√´s, along with Trepca e Mitrovic√´s, Partizani and Milicionari. Xhavit Spahiu formed the first club of handball, Normalisti i Prishtin√´s. The team established themselves as the first champion team of the country. From 1954 to 1959 they triumphed by becoming champions six times in a row. From 1981 and on because of the political situation in Kosovo, handball was in a difficult position and only recovered in 1999. They were accepted in the International Handball Federation (IHF) and European Handball Federation (EHF). The national team held matches in Bosnia, Turkey, Bulgaria and other Balkan nations. On 28 November 2001 Pristina hosted a match against Kelecolu, a Turkish team and this marked the beginning of continual friendly matches of Kosovo against other nations not only in the Balkans but as far as Great Britain, Scotland, Egypt etc. KH Prishtina (Handball club of Pristina) with their main playing stadium in the Palace of Youth and Sport have won the Kosovo's cup in April 2013 against Vushtrri, establishing themselves as the champions of Kosovo for the fourth time. KHF Prishtina (Handball club of females in Pristina) has won ten championships in a row and are currently holding their fall championship title for 2012/13. Because of their continual successes at home, they have been qualified for the European league for the second time in their history. Oltion Beshiri is one of the most successful handball players for Pristina's Handball Team. He has been awarded with the Athlete of the Year award for the 2013 season from the fans of the capital, Plisat. During 2008-2009 he scored 229 goals during half a season, and was also part of the Bundesliga for several months when he was 15‚Äì16 years of age. ===Volleyball=== Volleyball in Pristina was first played in the gyms of high schools during 1936. In 1948, Pristina was the host city of the first volleyball championship, which was organized as a competition between 6 teams. Ten years later, another championship was organized and the winners, the men's team of Pristina, qualified to play in the League of Serbia and the Second Federative League in Yugoslavia. The women's team, called the University of Prishtina, only made it that far after 1975. In 1991, volleyball in Pristina was no longer organised within the Yugoslavian regulations. Milena Ra≈°iƒá is a World and European champion and Olympic silver medalist The men's team competed in the first tournament organised independently that year, whereas the women's team competed two years later in the first tournament organised as part of the women's league. Pristina's volleyball teams, although with changes in names and chairpersons, have competed consistently in championships organised since the sport began its independent activity in 1991 Pristina women's volleyball club are current defending champions in the 2013/2014 season. Another women's club from Pristina, University AAB won the Cup of Kosovo 2012 by beating Pristina in the final. Despite being the current best team in the women's Superleague, Pristina's team is going through financial obstacles, causing problems in organising matches in their homecourt. Pristina's Volleyball Club was elected the most successful club in the women's category for the 2012/2013 season Volleyball in Pristina continues to struggle along with the Volleyball Federation of Kosovo, considering that they are not accepted in the International Volleyball Federation and as a result, Pristina and other clubs cannot compete in international tournaments. Shemsije Asllanaj was elected the best volleyball athlete in the women's category by the Kosovar Volleyball Federation in 2012. In this year the club she plays for, KV Prishtina won the Super Cup. She repeated the success in 2013 along with the club she plays for, KV Prishtina as they were awarded with the highest honors from the Kosovar Volleyball Federation. ==Infrastructure== The Stadium of Pristina is the home ground of FC Prishtina since 17 May 1953. Nowadays, due to renovations, the capacity of the stadium is 16,200 seats. The Stadium of Pristina Apart from inserting new seats which were a donation from Football Federation of Sweden, the stadium has also been subject to a number of other architectural interventions, including a roof top in the western wing which would enable spectators shelter during rain, and a fence in the north-eastern wing . The Youth Palace which is located in the centre of Pristina, is the home of many sports played indoors in the city including basketball, volleyball, table tennis and futsal. The Palace constructed in 1977 was financed from the voluntary contributions of the citizens of Pristina. Its first director was Kemajl Hashimi, while from 2008 and on this institution is under the management of the Kosovar Agency of Privatization. The Youth Palace has an area of 8136 m2. During the year of 2013, Sigal Prishtina has invested in the renovation of the Palace in order to get prepared for the matches against the teams of Balkan League in Basketball. Another football stadium located in Pristina is the Stadium of Flamurtari, which is home ground to Flamurtari Football Club and Kosova e Prishtin√´s Football Club.

These two hard surface courts are also equipped with proper lightning that enable play during night. Two of the biggest tournaments organised in Kosovo take place in these courts, Pristina Open and Dielli Open. Apart from tournaments, Pristina's tennis grounds have also been utilized for junior tennis camps organized by Pristina Tennis Club. The sport infrastructure is an issue of current debate. The reasons for the lack of or poor quality of Pristina's sport venues include the consequences of the last war (1999),the lack of investments in the past 25‚Äì30 years, and the difficult economic situation of the country. ==Other sports== Table tennis is another active sport in Pristina, since the acceptance of the Kosovar Table Tennis Federation in the International Table Tennis Federation in 2003. Two players from the KP Prishtina (Table-tennis Club Pristina), Vlona Maloku and Linor √áitaku were elected table tennis players of the year 2013, following their acclaimed titles and placement on top of the national ranking table.

He reached his peak as an eight-year-old in the spring of 2006 when he won two of the season's most important two mile steeplechases: the Queen Mother Champion Chase in England and the Kerrygold Champion Chase in Ireland. In his early career he showed promise as a novice hurdler winning the Royal Bond Novice Hurdle, Barry & Sandra Kelly Novice Hurdle and Johnstown Novice Hurdle. When switched to chasing he won the Paddy Fitpatrick Memorial Novice Chase and Kinloch Brae Chase before recording his most important victories. His later career was less successful although he did win the Red Mills Trial Hurdle in the autumn of 2006 and the Kinloch Brae Chase for a second time as a twelve-year-old in 2010. ==Background== Newmill was a dark brown horse with a small white star, bred in Ireland by Veronica O'Farrell. He was the best horse sired by Norwich, a horse who showed his best racing form over seven furlongs (winning the Hungerford Stakes), but who had his greatest stud success as a sire of National Hunt performers. His dam, Lady Kas, won one hurdle race and was a daughter of Lady Dikler, a sister of the Cheltenham Gold Cup winner The Dikler. In June 2001, the three-year-old gelding was consigned by the Bishopstown Stud to the Tattersalls Ireland sale but attracted no bids and was led out of the auction ring unsold. A year later, he was sent back to the sales at Goffs where he was sold for ‚Ç¨24,000 to Mary Hayes. Newmill was sent into training with Thomas Gerard O'Leary at Clonakilty, County Cork. ==Racing career2003/2004 National Hunt season: National Hunt Flat races and Novice Hurdles=== Newmill began his racing career in National Hunt Flat races, also known as \\"bumpers\\", beginning at Fairyhouse Racecourse on 22 April in a race confined to horses sold at Goffs. He started at odds of 10/1 and won easily by three and a half lengths from seventeen opponents. The prize included a new Land Rover Discovery for the vendor of the winner, with the keys to the vehicle being presented to Veronica O'Farrell after the race. The gelding returned in autumn and ran poorly in a bumper at Tipperary Racecourse before being switched to compete in novice hurdle races. At Wexford Racecourse on 25 October he was ridden by Barry Geraghty he made a successful debut over obstacles a he won easily by seven lengths from Definite Best. The gelding was moved up in class for a Grade III race at Navan Racecourse and finished second to Accordion Etoile and was then stepped up again for the Grade I Royal Bond Novice Hurdle at Fairhouse on 30 November. Ridden by Garrett Cotter he started at odds of 13/2 in a field which included Accordion Etoile and the Jessica Harrington-trained favourite Strike Back. He led from the start, opened up a big lead, and held on in the closing stages to win by three quarters of a length from the mare Mariah Rollins. Two weeks later at Navan, Newmill was moved up in distance for the Grade II Barry & Sandra Kelly Novice Hurdle (now the Grade I Navan Novice Hurdle over two and a half miles. Ridden by Geraghty, and starting the 5/2 second favourite, he took the lead approaching the second last hurdle before drawing away to win by eight lengths from Kildare, to whom he was conceding seven pounds. On his final appearance of 2003, Newmill finished second when attempting to concede thirteen pounds to Mariah Rollins in the Future Champions Novice Hurdle at Leopardstown Racecourse on 27 December. Newmill and Mariah Rollins met for the third time in the Deloitte Novice Hurdle at Leopardstown on 8 February. He led the field at the second last hurdle but was caught 100 yards from the finish and beaten three quarters of a length by Brave Inca, with Mariah Rollins five lengths back in third. Two weeks later, Newmill started 1/2 favourite for the Grade II Johnstown Novice Hurdle at Naas and won by four and a half lengths. ===2004/2005 National Hunt season: Novice Chases=== In the following season, Newmill was moved up to compete in steeplechases with mixed results. He finished fifth behind the mare Like-A-Butterfly at Naas on 20 November and then started 4/6 favourite for a minor event at Clonmel Racecourse, in which he led from the start and won by thirteen lengths. On 26 December he was moved back up to Grade I level for the Durkan New Homes Novice Chase over two miles and a furlong at Leopardstown, but after opening up a clear lead, he faded over the last two fences and finished fifth, thirty-five lengths behind the winner Mariah Rollins. On 9 January he was back at Leopardtsown for the Grade II Paddy Fitzpatrick Memorial Novice Chase and recorded his most important win of the season as he took the lead at the second last fence and won by two lengths from Strong Project. The gelding showed little worthwhile form in his three remaining races: he was pulled up before the last in the Grade I Dr P. J. Moriarty Novice Chase on 6 February and was well beaten when unplaced in both the Nas Na Riogh Novice Chase at Naas and the Grade I Swordlestown Cup Novice Chase at Punchestown in April. Before the last of these race he was transferred to the stable of John Joseph Murphy at Upton, County Cork: his owners' refused to comment on the reason for the switch. ===2005/2006 National Hunt season=== Newmill returned to hurdling in the early part of the 2005/2006 season. He started a 50/1 outsider when finishing fourth behind Brave Inca in the Morgiana Hurdle and then ran third at odds of 40/1 behind Brave Inca and Harchibald (ahead of Macs Joy) in the December Festival Hurdle. In both of these races he was ridden by Andrew McNamara. On 9 January, Newmill started at odds of 5/1 for the Kinloch Brae Chase over two and a half miles at Thurles Racecourse, in which his opponents included Strong Project, Hi Cloy and Native Upmanship. Ridden by Robbie Power he was restrained in the early stages before moving up in to third place with six fences left to jump. He took the lead at the second last and stayed on to win by four lengths from Mossy Green. Murphy, who had been considering a run in the Champion Hurdle, announced that the gelding was now more likely to run in the Queen Mother Champion Chase, commenting and commented \\"people have said he is soft in the past, he is actually as tough as nails\\". Newmill was sent to race in Britain for the first time when he contested the Grade I Queen Mother Champion Chase over two miles at the Cheltenham Festival and started a 16/1 outsider in a field which included Kauto Star and Moscow Flyer. He had been available at odds of 33/1 on the morning of the race but attracted support after he was identified by the Racing Posts \\"Pricewise\\" column as a serious contender and \\"a horse of the highest class\\". Ridden by McNamara, he made a slight mistake at the first fence but soon took the lead. He went clear of the field approaching the final fence and stayed on strongly in the closing stages to win by nine lengths from Fota Island in a time of 3:51.50. Jim McGrath, writing in the Daily Telegraph described the performance as \\"a revelation\\". After the race, McNamara said \\"That was amazing, I can't believe how well he travelled all the way. I thought we could be in trouble but he got his breath back and down the hill he really started to travel with me again\\", while Murphy commented \\"Thank goodness it's over. Everything went right. I got a bit frightened when I saw Central House appear as I thought he might take him on and buzz him up but Andrew did everything correct and was top drawer\\". Some commentators, however, felt that the falls of several leading contenders, including Kauto Star, meant that Newmill was a rather lucky winner. On 25 April, Newmill started the 5/4 favourite for the Grade I Kerrygold Champion Chase at the Punchestown Festival. He led from the start, and despite several jumping errors he was never seriously challenged, winning easily by fifteen lengths from Fota Island, with Mariah Rollins finishing fifth of the six runners. Immediately after the race Murphy suggested that the gelding might be moved up in distance in the next season saying; \\"We'll play it by ear but we may step him up in trip next season and he could well go to the King George\\". ===2006/2007 National Hunt season=== Newmill again began his season in a hurdle race, but after leading for most of the way in the Morgiana Hurdle, he dropped back quickly from the second last to finish tailed-off last of the four runners. Murphy attributed his poor run to \\"a combination of testing ground and lack of fitness\\". He returned to steeplechasing at Punchestown in February, but fell four fences from the finish in the Tied Cottage Chase. Two weeks later at Gowran Park he was matched against the leading hurdlers Macs Joy and Harchibald in the Grade II Red Mills Trial Hurdle. Starting at odds of 7/1, he took the lead from the start and went clear of the opposition approaching the last flight to win \\"comfortably\\" by eight lengths from Macs Joy. A day after the race, Murphy reported that the gelding was in \\"sparkling form\\" and said \\"he's definitely a better horse this year and they just couldn't stay with him at that relentless gallop\\". At Cheltenham in March, Newmill started the 4/1 second favourite as he attempted to repeat his 2006 success in the Queen Mother Champion Chase. He disputed the lead with Ashley Brook for much of the race but weakened after the second last fence and finished fourth, nine lengths behind the winner Voy Por Ustedes. The gelding started 13/8 favourite for the Kerrygold Champion Chase on 24 April but again faded in the closing stages to finish fifth of the even runners. ===Later career=== Newmill remained in training for a further four seasons, but failed to recapture his previous success. In the 2007/2008 National Hunt season he failed to win in seven races. He earned some prize money when last of three in the Normans Grove Chase at Gowran, and when finishing a distant fourth to Voy Por Ustedes in the Melling Chase. In his attempt to regain his Champion Chase title at Cheltenham he started a 40/1 outsider and finished more than forty lengths behind the winner Master Minded. In the following season he failed to reach the first three in six attempts. His best efforts came at Cheltenham, when, as a 100/1 outsider, he finished fourth behind Master Minded, Well Chief and Petit Robin in the Champion Chase and at Killarney Racecourse in May where he was beaten a neck by Snowy Morning. Newmill ran only three times in the 2009/2010 National Hunt season, but showed some good form. In October he was beaten three quarters of a lengths when carrying top weight of 161 pounds in a handicap chase at Cork and in the Connaught Chase at Cheltenham a month later he was only five lengths behind the winner when fourth to Well Chief, Mahogany Blaze and Master Minded. In January at Thurles, Newmill started 11/2 third favourite for the Kinloch Brae Chase, a race he had won four years earlier. Ridden by Eddie Power, he was restrained in the early stages before moving up to take the lead at the eighth fence. He stayed on strongly under pressure in the closing stages to record his first steeplechase win in four years, beating Snowy Morning by three lengths. After the race, Murphy said \\"Eddie gave him a super ride, making the gallop when no-one else would. Age is against him for the top races now, so we'll have to see where he goes\\". He missed the remainder of the season after sustaining an injury shortly before the Cheltenham Festival. For his final competitive season, Newmill was moved to the stable of James Daniel Dullea at Bandon. He ran five times as a thirteen- year-old in the early part of 2011, producing his best effort on his seasonal debut in January, when he ran the former Champion Hurdler Sublimity to half a length in a hurdle race at Cork. After three further defeats he ended his racing career in a hurdle race at Downpatrick Racecourse in March in which he finished third of the five runners behind Fosters Cross. ==Pedigree== *Newmill was inbred 4 x 4 to Hethersett, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. ==References== Category:1998 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Cheltenham Festival winners Category:Thoroughbred family 19-c ","title":"Newmill (horse)"},{"id":"42001322","text":"Patmati (, also Romanized as Patmatƒ´) is a village in Nazil Rural District, Nukabad District, Khash County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

It premiered on BBC2 on 19 February 2014. The episode was based on a play that Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith had written while living together prior to the development of their series The League of Gentlemen. While the play had originally been around two hours in length, the episode was only half an hour. \\"Tom & Gerri\\" follows a difficult period in the life of Tom (Shearsmith), a primary school teacher and aspiring writer, and his girlfriend Gerri (Gemma Arterton), a struggling actress, after Tom invites the homeless Migg (Pemberton) into his home. Conleth Hill stars as Stevie, a man worried about the mental health of his friend Tom. The entire episode takes place inside Tom's flat. Reviewers generally agreed that \\"Tom & Gerri\\" was significantly darker but less funny than previous episodes of Inside No. 9. Nonetheless, the response to the episode as a whole was very positive. Critics disagreed about the presentation of Tom's mental illness in the episode, with one journalist suggesting that the episode's ending \\"set back public awareness of mental health at least half an hour\\", but another saying that the story presented \\"a fine ‚Äì if cartoonish ‚Äì take on mental illness\\". ==Production== Writers Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, who had previously worked together on The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville, took inspiration for Inside No. 9 from \\"David and Maureen\\", episode 4 of the first series of Psychoville. This episode, in turn, was inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. \\"David and Maureen\\" took place entirely in a single room, and was filmed in only two shots. At the same time, the concept of Inside No. 9 was a \\"reaction\\" to Psychoville, with Shearsmith saying that \\"We'd been so involved with labyrinthine over-arcing, we thought it would be nice to do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week. That's appealing, because as a viewer you might not like this story, but you've got a different one next week.\\" As an anthology series with horror themes, Inside No. 9 also pays homage to Tales of the Unexpected, The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. The \\"loose story\\" of \\"Tom and Gerri\\" was written originally as a two-hour play while Shearsmith and Pemberton were on the dole and sharing a flat, prior to the production of League of Gentlemen. The story was inspired by their experiences in this environment. The character of Tom has his \\"life energy\\" drained in the same way that, the writers suggest, is experienced by jobhunters. The \\"sinister\\" atmosphere of the episode is meant to evoke the feeling that a person has when they \\"can't quite manage to leave the flat\\" and they \\"can't be bothered to tidy up\\". \\"Tom & Gerri\\" ended up \\"quite different\\" from the play, which featured a character much like Pauline from The League of Gentlemen. Pemberton described the feel of the episode as Pinteresque, comparing it to Harold Pinter's A Slight Ache. This sentiment was echoed by critic Gareth Lightfoot, writing in Teesside's Evening Gazette. As the format of Inside No. 9 requires new characters each week, the writers were able to attract actors who may have been unwilling to commit to an entire series. In addition to the writers, \\"Tom & Gerri\\" starred Gemma Arterton and Conleth Hill. The flat in which the episode was filmed, with its boardgames and \\"misery\\", was, for Shearsmith, similar to the flat once shared by the writers. The episode was filmed in winter, and Pemberton described a \\"grim\\" atmosphere during filming. He also said that he hated the wig and beard he wore to play Migg, which irritated his skin. David Chater, writing in The Times, said that the hair meant Migg \\"has an eerie resemblance to the Cowardly Lion from the Wizard of Oz - only not nearly as benign\\". Considering the title of \\"Tom & Gerri\\", critic Bruce Dessau suggested that it was likely not a reference to the Tom and Jerry of 1970s sitcom The Good Life, as the life of Tom and Gerri is \\"anything but good\\". Instead, he suggested, the reference was more likely to cartoon characters Tom and Jerry, saying that there \\"is definitely a hint of cat and mouse\\" in the plot. Metro critics Larushka Ivan-Zadeh and Carol Carter concurred, saying that the plot consisted of \\"a game of cat and mouse\\". ==Plot== The episode begins with Tom (Shearsmith), a primary school teacher, apathetically marking work while chatting to his girlfriend Gerri (Arterton), who is going to audition for a part in a play. Tom complains about a tramp begging outside their house. Later in the evening, Tom is home alone and Migg (Pemberton), knocks at his door to return Tom's wallet. He introduces himself, and Tom rewards him with ¬£40 from his wallet. Migg comes back later with a bottle of whiskey for Tom. Reluctantly, Tom invites Migg inside for a drink. Migg says he knew Charles Bukowski, whose literary work Tom idolises, and Tom warms to Migg as they drink. Tom awakes the next morning on his sofa. Gerri is alarmed to see him there, as he should be at work, and then gets angry that Migg was invited in. Migg emerges from the bathroom as Gerri leaves the house, and encourages Tom to phone in sick. It is revealed that Tom had promised Migg some of his clothes, and Migg makes breakfast. Later, Migg and Tom play Risk and drink wine. Tom is concerned that Gerri has not called. When Tom heads out to buy cigarettes and wine, Migg hides Tom's mobile phone and deletes an answerphone message left by Tom's colleague Stevie (Hill). A week later, Tom lies in bed, smoking and writing. Gerri enters the room, and it is revealed that Tom has quit his job as a teacher. She has been rehearsing in Portsmouth and says she left him dozens of messages, but Tom thinks he's lost his phone. The pair fight over Migg, who is still living with Tom. Later still, the flat is a mess, and Tom is unkempt and drinking heavily. He has no messages on his phone and no post. He sits down to play Scrabble with Migg, and it is revealed that it is Tom's birthday. The two argue about washing up, and Migg says that Tom has \\"no right\\" to judge him. Tom storms out of the room, and Migg flicks through birthday cards he has hidden from Tom, saying \\"Thank you, Grandma!\\" and taking the ¬£10 that Tom's grandmother sent him. The house and Tom have deteriorated further when Stevie comes to visit. He has brought Tom vouchers for The Body Shop. Stevie invites Tom out for dinner, but he declines. Stevie leaves, and Tom settles down with Migg on the sofa. Tom's electricity supply is cut off due to the bills not being paid, and he weeps. A shaven Migg, wearing clean clothes, enters the house. He has started a job, working with children, and gives Tom ¬£40 because Tom has \\"done so much\\" for Migg. Migg wants to take over the tenancy on the flat until Tom's benefits come in. He walks into the bathroom to get into the bath as Gerri walks in and comforts Tom, who asks her not to leave. Gerri tells Tom that he has invented Migg to cope with what has been happening. She says Tom is depressed and has had a nervous breakdown. The pair head into the bathroom, but there is no Migg. Gerri tells Tom to \\"get this Migg out of [his] head once and for all\\". She leaves, and Migg emerges from a hiding place; he asks if everything is alright. Things apparently get better: the flat is tidy, Tom is smartly dressed and clean-shaven. Gerri is happily chatting to him. Tom answers the door to Stevie, who asks Tom to come back to work. He is alarmed to see Tom call Gerri; Stevie says that Gerri was killed in a car accident, and that Tom went back to work too soon. Stevie heads to the bathroom to get Tom's medication, but freezes when he sees the corpse of Migg in the bath. Tom tells him not to worry, and that Migg is not real. He invites Stevie to stay for coffee, saying Gerri is just boiling the kettle. ==Reception== Reviewers generally agreed that the episode was darker than previous episodes, but not as funny. However, Will Dean, writing in The Independent, said that his observation that the episode \\"wasn't really in the slightest bit funny\\" was \\"no complaint\\". The critical response to \\"Tom & Gerri\\" was overwhelmingly positive; Dean was \\"moved by its sad brilliance\\", while Gerald Gilbert, also writing in The Independent, called it \\"another finely worked playlet\\". Bruce Dessau said viewers would be \\"totally immersed from start to finish\\". Critics disagreed on how \\"Tom & Gerri\\" compared to previous episodes of Inside No. 9. Writing in The Guardian, Mark Jones said that \\"Tom & Gerri\\" was the \\"highlight of the series so far, with Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton on top form\\". Pat Stacey, of the Evening Herald, agreed, though considered the previous episodes weak. By contrast, an anonymous reviewer in the Liverpool Echo thought \\"Sardines\\" was stronger, but said \\"Tom & Gerri\\" was \\"definitely the creepiest\\" of the first three, and Chater also disagreed with Jones and Stacey; while he praised the episode as \\"a sinister tale about the fragile nature of sanity performed by actors who are frighteningly good\\", he felt that it was not as strong as earlier installments. Like Chater, Dessau stressed the quality of the acting, praising the performances of both Shearsmith and Pemberton, especially the latter. There was further disagreement on the episode's approach to mental illness. Andrew Billen, writing in The Times, said he initially thought Mind may be able to use \\"Tom & Gerri\\" as a teaching aid, but he said that the ending \\"set back public awareness of mental health at least half an hour\\". By contrast, Dean considered the character of Tom to be \\"a fine ‚Äì if cartoonish ‚Äì take on mental illness\\". Several themes present in \\"Tom & Gerri\\", including mental illness, were revisited in Inside No. 9 third series with \\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\\". Billen called the episode \\"distressing comedy to watch\\", but said that \\"the acting, the scripting, the satisfactions of one- act resolution and the laughter it generated\\" were redeeming qualities, and gave the episode four out of a possible five stars. Dessau felt that parts of the script were predictable, but some twists \\"catch you completely unaware\\", while the ending \\"may haunt [viewers] for days\\". Jack Seale, of the Radio Times, suggested that viewers will believe that they have guessed the plot by the half-way point in the episode. However, he said that the writers \\"give their story of how we're all one slip away from the gutter a chilling sense of rising dread\\" which counteracts this. \\"Nobody\\", he said, \\"plays wicked games with the audience more skilfully.\\" Larushka Ivan-Zadeh and Carol Carter, writing in Metro, suggested that viewers would want to rewatch the episode in an attempt to pick up clues to the plot twists that they originally missed. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== * * Category:2014 British television episodes Category:Homelessness in popular culture Category:Inside No. 9 episodes Category:Television episodes about mental illnesses Category:Television episodes about murder Category:Works about educators Category:Television episodes about death ","title":"Tom &amp; Gerri"},{"id":"42001402","text":"Euselasia is a genus of butterflies in the family Riodinidae. They are present only in the Neotropical realm. The genus was erected by Jacob H√ºbner in 1819. E. eugeon, the eugeon sombermark, on the Cristalino River, southern Amazon, Brazil ==Description== The wing veins are inconstant. Some species have two, others three, and one species (E. aurantiaca) even four subcostal branches. The genus is recognizable by the anterior radial vein either running directly in the elongation of the subcostal, or being connected with it by a very short anterior discocellular. The butterflies often have the appearance of small satyrids or Thecla species; as for instance Euselasia eutychus resembles (particularly beneath) exactly Euptychia helle flying in the same locality, or Thecla themathea; or Euselasia clithra resembles Euptychia chloris and so on. On the upper surface there is often a very bright reflection of a shining power otherwise not found in any lepidopteran and of a truly wonderful iridescence. The larvae are somewhat of the shape of a woodlouse, very brightly coloured, behind the head there are two points. The pupae are covered with fine, fluffy hairs like the larvae, green, held by a belt. The imagines are partly extraordinarily rare and belong to the few Riodinidae that fly to a considerable height. They also clap their wings together when at rest like other day butterflies, unlike most of the other Riodinidae which spread them out like the Geometridae.Seitz, A. (1916). \\"Family: Erycinidae\\". In A. Seitz (editor), Macrolepidoptera of the World, 5: 617‚Äì738. Stuttgart: Alfred Kernen == Taxonomy == This is one of the largest genera in the family Riodinidae.

Her vocal style includes both growling and clean vocals (singing). Although primarily associated with melodic death metal and metalcore, she has appeared as a guest vocalist for power metal, symphonic metal and deathcore bands, notably Kamelot, Delain and Carnifex and has performed live with Nightwish and Tarja Turunen. ==Early life== White-Gluz was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, as the second of three children. Her grandparents were prisoners in concentration camps during World War II and managed to escape. Their experiences in the camps would go on to inspire the Arch Enemy song, \\"First Day in Hell\\". She is the younger sister of Jasamine White-Gluz who leads the Montreal based shoegaze band No Joy. == Personal interests == White- Gluz is a fan of classical music as well as rock music. She enjoys 90s grunge music such as Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, and Soundgarden. \\"I know a lot of people hate it but I love the simplicity, the stripped-down, honest songs and the mistakes. On Nirvana‚Äôs live album for example I love hearing the fuck-ups, out-of-tune guitars and the cracks in the voice,\\" says White-Gluz in an interview with Metal Hammer. Alissa has been a vegan for 20 years. ==CareerThe Agonist (2004‚Äì2014)=== Alissa White-Gluz performing with The Agonist in July 2012 In 2004, White-Gluz formed the Agonist (then known as \\"Tempest\\") with fellow band members Danny Marino and Chris Kells in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

The PVPA gives breeders up to 25 years of exclusive control over new, distinct, uniform, and stable sexually reproduced or tuber propagated plant varieties. A major expression of plant breeders' rights in the United States, the PVPA grants protection similar to that available through patents, but these legal schemes differ in critical respects. The PVPA should not be confused with plant patents, which are limited to asexually reproduced plants (not including tuber propagated plants). ==Basic provisions== The PVPA confers a limited period of legal control to breeders of sexually reproduced or tuber propagated plant varieties. In order to be eligible for a certificate under the PVPA, a plant variety must satisfy four requirements. First, it must be new, in the sense that propagating or harvested material has not been sold or otherwise disposed of for purposes of exploitation for more than one year in the United States, or more than four years in any foreign jurisdiction (or six years in the case of a tree or vine). Second, the variety must be distinct‚Äîthat is, clearly distinguishable from any other publicly known variety. Distinctness may be based on one or more identifiable morphological, physiological, or other characteristics, including commercially valuable characteristics affecting activities such as milling and baking (in the case of wheat). Third, the variety must be uniform, in the sense that any variations are describable, predictable, and commercially acceptable. Finally, the variety must be stable, in the sense that the variety, when reproduced, will remain unchanged with regard to its essential and distinctive characteristics within a reasonable degree of commercial reliability. A plant variety certificate gives the breeder the right to exclude others from selling the variety, or offering it for sale, or reproducing it, or importing it, or exporting it, or using it in producing (as distinguished from developing) a hybrid or different variety. The term of protection runs 20 years from the certificate's date of issue, or 25 years in the case of a tree or vine. ==Exemptions== Unlike the Patent Act of 1952, the PVPA contains three exemptions that significantly limit the scope of the plant breeder's exclusive right. First, the PVPA's provision safeguarding the \\"public interest in wide usage\\" allows the United States Department of Agriculture to declare an otherwise protected variety open on the basis of equitable remuneration to the owner, upon a finding that no more than two years of compulsory licensing of a protected variety is necessary in order to insure an adequate supply of fiber, food, or feed and that the owner is unwilling or unable to meet public demand at a price which may reasonably be deemed fair. Second, the PVPA's \\"research exemption\\" declares that the use and reproduction of a protected variety for plant breeding or other bona fide research shall not constitute infringement. The PVPA's third exemption permits a farmer to save seed from protected varieties and to use such saved seed in the production of a crop without infringement. Prior to 1994, this exemption also allowed farmers to sell such saved seed to others without infringement. Asgrow Seed Company sued Denny and Becky Winterboer over the scope of this exemption. Asgrow won at District Court, and then lost at the Court of Appeals. The scope of the exemption to sell seeds was confirmed and defined by the 1995 Supreme Court decision in Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U.S. 179 (1995). In 1994, legislation to bring the PVPA into compliance with the 1991 Act of the UPOV Convention also included amendments that eliminated the exemption for sales, but continued to allow farmers to save and replant seed on their own farms without infringement. ==Contrasting plant variety certificates, plant patents, and utility patents== Plant variety certificates should not be confused with plant patents. The Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA) and the Plant Patent Act of 1930 provide protection based on different types of plant reproductive strategies. The PVPA, which authorizes plant variety protection certificates, protects sexually reproduced and tuber propagated plants, whereas the Plant Patent Act, which authorizes plant patents, is limited to asexually reproduced plants, excluding tuber propagated plants. However, the same plant may be protected under both the Plant Variety Protection Act and the Plant Patent Act of 1930. The most appropriate means of protection may be decided by the applicant based on the applicant's business requirements. A plant may also be eligible for protection under the Patent Act of 1952, as long as patentability requirements are met. Additionally, the same plant may be protected by a utility patent as well as a plant variety protection certificate and/or a plant patent. The landmark Supreme Court decision of Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980), suggested the possibility of securing utility patents on plants previously thought eligible solely for protection under the PVPA. Two decades later, in the 2001 decision of J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., 534 U.S. 124 (2001), the Court conclusively held that sexually reproduced plants eligible for protection under the PVPA are also eligible for utility patents. ==The PVPA and international law== The Plant Variety Protection Act represents the United States' effort to comply with the Union pour la Protection des Obtentions V√©g√©tales (also known as UPOV or the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants), an international treaty concerning plant breeders' rights. The PVPA likewise constitutes part of the United States' compliance with the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights annex of the World Trade Organization treaty, also known as TRIPs. ==See also== * Intellectual property * Patents * Plant breeders' rights * Plant Patent Act of 1930 * International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) * Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) * List of United States federal legislation ==Further readingReferences * Plant Variety Protection Office (a division of the United States Department of Agriculture) * Text of the PVPA in .pdf format * Text of the Plant Variety Protection Act in HTML * * * Category:Agronomy Category:United States federal intellectual property legislation Category:Biotechnology law ","title":"Plant Variety Protection Act of 1970"},{"id":"42001697","text":"Ricardo Kishna (born 4 January 1995) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays as a forward for ADO Den Haag.https://int.soccerway.com/players/ricardo- kishna/271394/ ==Club careerAjax=== Born in The Hague, Kishna joined Ajax in 2010 from ADO Den Haag at 15 years old, where he had been active in the youth ranks from the age of 9 laying the foundation for his professional career.

Its United States operations were named the Central Maine & Qu√©bec Railway US Incorporated with offices in New York, NY, and were registered with the Surface Transportation Board on February 14, 2014. Its Canadian operations were named the Central Maine and Qu√©bec Railway Canada Incorporated with offices in Sherbrooke, QC, and were registered with Revenue Qu√©bec on February 14, 2014. ==History== Locomotive The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway , itself a product of the 2002 Iron Road Railways bankruptcy, filed for bankruptcy in the United States and Canada on August 7, 2013, following the fiery Lac-M√©gantic rail disaster, in which a runaway crude oil train killed forty-seven people and caused an estimated $200 million in property damage to downtown Lac-M√©gantic, Quebec. The company received protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act in Canada to oversee the sale of assets. In December 2013, Fortress Investment Group, LLC, through its subsidiary Railroad Acquisition Holdings, LLC (RAH) placed a stalking horse bid on the operating rail lines, which was accepted by the bankruptcy trustee in January 2014. In February 2014 RAH announced that it had formed the CMQ to become the operating entity of the rail lines and that the sale would be concluded in March 2014. CM&Q received its certificate of fitness from the Canadian Transportation Agency on June 24, 2014. In March 2014, John E. Giles of RAH drove the length of the line, visiting communities and industries served by the railway and inspecting the condition of tracks and installations. He estimated a $10‚Äì20 million investment would be needed over three years to repair the rail line, then in poor condition and not safe for the transport of oil or dangerous goods.Le futur propri√©taire de MMA veut maintenir un lien de confiance , R√©mi Tremblay, L'Echo de Frontenac (March 20, 2014) In the same year, the CMQR acquired 10 GMD SD40-2Fs from Canadian Pacific Railway. The company planned to resume transport of crude oil by rail in January 2016; however, this did not happen due to petroleum market conditions. On November 20, 2019, it was announced that Canadian Pacific Railway would purchase CMQ.

On June 4, 2020, CP officially finalized its acquisition of CMQ. ==Rockland Branch Operation== In September 2015, CMQ was selected by the Maine Department of Transportation to operate the state-owned Rockland Branch rail line between Brunswick and Rockland, taking over the line from previous operator Maine Eastern Railroad on January 1, 2016.

Drower, 'Petrie' Sir (William Matthew) Flinders (1853‚Äì1942)', Oxford Dictionary of national Biography, OUP, 2004; online edn, May 2012 accessed 25 Feb 2014 the father of scientific archaeology. Having studied geology, she was hired by Flinders Petrie at age 25 as an artist, which led to their marriage and a working partnership that endured for their lifetimes. Hilda travelled and worked with Flinders Petrie to excavate and record numerous sites in Egypt, and later in Palestine. This included directing some excavations herself, and working in often difficult and dangerous conditions to produce copies of tomb hieroglyphs and plans, and to record the work for reports to the Egypt Exploration Fund. When the British School of Archaeology in Egypt was founded in 1905 in London by Flinders Petrie, she worked as its secretary and fundraiser to secure support for the school and their continued excavations. Hilda took part in archaeological excavations and surveys throughout her married life, except for a period while their two children were young. Her work was published, and she also gave public lectures in London and elsewhere. ==Education and family life== Hilda Mary Isabel Urlin was born in Dublin in 1871, the youngest of five daughters of an English couple long resident in Ireland, (Richard) Denny Urlin and Mary Elizabeth (n√©e Addis) Urlin. When Petrie was four years old her family moved back to London and she was educated by a governess along with other children of similar age. As she grew older she often went on bicycling expeditions with her friend Beatrice Orme. Together, they explored the countryside, visiting and sketching ancient churches, and making brass rubbings. Another of her childhood friends was Philippa Fawcett whose mother, Dame Millicent Fawcett, was a leader in the women's suffrage movement. Philippa later went to Cambridge to read mathematics and was to become the first woman Senior Wrangler. Petrie preferred the country life and initially disliked London, but as she grew older she enjoyed visiting its museums and art galleries. During her teens she was regarded as an attractive red-headed girl and she sat for the painter Henry Holiday at his studio in Hampstead, modelling for the figure of a young girl in two of his much-exhibited paintings. She studied at King's College for Women, where she took Professor Seeley's geology course, and would go on field trips equipped with a notebook and hammer. She also took courses in facsimile drawing, for which she displayed a considerable talent. When she was twenty-five, she was introduced by Henry Holiday to Egyptology Professor Flinders Petrie at University College London, who needed to employ someone with the accurate copying skills Hilda had by then acquired. This introduction led to their marriage on 26 November 1896, with the couple leaving for Egypt the following day. The Petries had two children, John (1907‚Äì1972) and Ann (1909‚Äì1989), and lived in Hampstead, where an English Heritage blue plaque now stands at 5 Cannon Place, where they lived. Their son was John Flinders Petrie, the mathematician, who gave his name to the Petrie polygon. In 1957 Hilda died of a stroke in University College Hospital, on the opposite side of the road to where she and her husband had worked to found and to fund what was England's first training school for archaeologists. ==Archaeological career== Petrie and Urlin in 1897 === Egypt === Hilda left for Egypt for the first time on 25 November 1896,'Breaking Ground: Women in Old World Archaeology', Sharp, M. S. and Lesko, B. S. (eds) and was thereafter to accompany her husband into the field every year except for a period when their son and daughter were young. After a few days spent at Cairo, and including a visit to Giza, the Petries travelled to Upper Egypt as part of an expedition to dig on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund in the cemetery area behind the temple of Dendera, 70 km north of Luxor. During this expedition, Hilda worked in the deep shafts of the tombs that were being excavated, climbing down a rope ladder to copy the scenes and inscriptions found deep underground. One large sarcophagus had some 20,000 hieroglyphs to record, and Hilda spent days lying on the ground to copy them. Her record work also included drawing the profiles of the pots, beads, scarabs and other small finds of the excavation, and sometimes writing the daily journal that was sent weekly to report progress to the Committee, and assisting Flinders Petrie to write the excavation reports. Her role did not include running the domestic side of the expedition, which was undertaken by Flinders Petrie as it had been done for many years, with excavators expected to live on canned food and ship's biscuits. In the 1898 excavation of the cemetery sites of Abadiyeh and Hu, Hilda helped to survey the site. She used the Naquada plates to identify the shape of pots, slates and flints and, once Flinders had entered these finds onto the plan, Hilda was responsible for writing on each find the number of the grave in which it had been found. Her work was noted by Flinders Petrie in the introduction to the excavation report of that year: \\"My wife was with me all the time, helping in the surveying, cataloguing, and marking of the objects, and also drawing all the tomb plans here published.\\"Petrie, W.M.F. (1900), Dendereh 1898: The Seventeenth Memoir of the Egypt Exploration Fund, London, UK Her work at the site continued into 1898‚Äì9, and she drew almost all of the pottery marks and arranged the plates, as well as undertaking the continual work to register and attend to the pottery, and to number the skeletons.Petrie, W.M.F. (1901) Diospolis Parva, The Cemeteries of Abadiyeh and Hu 1898-9: Special Extra Publication of the Egypt Exploration Fund, London, UK A plan of a fort was made at this time by both Petries. In the winter of 1902, the last season spent excavating at Abydos, Hilda was given control of an excavation of her own. The team comprised Margaret Murray, and Miss Hansard, an artist, as well as Hilda, and attempted a difficult and hazardous excavation after the discovery the previous year of what appeared to be the approach to a huge underground tomb discovered in an area at the back of the temple of Seti I. The deep excavation was in constant danger of caving in and, when the wind blew, loose sand and shifting stone blocks threatened the workers below; the work was ultimately abandoned. The report of that year to the Egypt Exploration fund sums up Hilda Petrie's contributions to the work thus: ‚ÄúMy wife was closely occupied with drawing nearly all of the season; especially on the tedious figuring of nearly 400 flints, and the exact facsimile copies of inscriptions.‚ÄùPetrie, W.M.F. (1902) Abydos Part.1., 1902: The Twenty-Second Memoir of the Egypt Exploration Fund, London, UK In 1904, Hilda Petrie was involved in the work at Ehnasya, contributing almost half of the plates of the resultant volume, and visiting Buto.Petrie, W.M.F. (1905) Ehnasya 1904: Twenty-sixth memoir of the Egypt Exploration Fund, London, UK The following year she remained at Saqqara to copy reliefs in some of the Old Kingdom Tombs, as Margaret Murray had the year before. She went from Saqqara to join Flinders Petrie and Lina Eckenstein at a temple site on a hilltop at Serabit el-Khadim, where there were large numbers of inscribed stones, statues and stelae. Some of these were in a hitherto unknown script, which was dubbed Sinaitic, and her work as a copyist was welcomed. Hilda and the 48 year old polymath Lina Eckenstein took a journey across Sinai accompanied by a single guide. Eckenstein was to write several books about her time in Sinai.Sybil Oldfield, ‚ÄòEckenstein, Lina Dorina Johanna (1857‚Äì1931)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2014 accessed 1 October 2015 === Work at the British School of Archaeology in Egypt === When the British School of Archaeology in Egypt was founded in 1905 in London by Flinders Petrie, Hilda worked there as a secretary to raise funds and recruit new subscribers, and it was during this time that both her children were born. In particular she wrote to the prominent and the wealthy to canvass support for Flinders Petrie's work, and oversaw its publication, and gave public lectures in London and elsewhere in the UK. === Further work in Egypt === She left for Egypt again in January 1913 to rejoin Flinders Petrie at Kafr Ammar; three painted Twelfth Dynasty tombs had been found a few miles away at Riqqeh and urgently needed recording. The work was again difficult and dangerous, but it was possible and she published a chapter within the final report about the tombs and including her plans and her copies of the wall paintings and coffins. === During the First World War === When war broke out in 1914, Hilda turned her attention to several women's organisations, including using her fundraising expertise as Honorary Secretary of the Scottish Women's Hospitals, which maintained hospital services for the Serbian division of the Russian army; she was later awarded the Serbian order of St Sava. The Petries also at this time surveyed prehistoric carvings cut in the Downland chalk in the UK. In 1919 Hilda and Flinders resumed excavations in Egypt, and in the season of 1921, Hilda excavated a Coptic hermit's cell in the Western hills at Abydos, with her plans and drawings of the cave being published in the excavation report for that year, along with her description of the cave and its painted decorations. === Excavations around Palestine and Jerusalem === The focus of the Petries' excavations shifted in 1926 to the frontier fortresses in Palestine, following the restrictions placed on excavating bodies in Egypt and the exportations of antiquities after the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922. Hilda arrived in Gaza on 26 November 1926, where she supervised, registered, and paid the excavation workers,Petrie. W.M.F. (1928) Gerar, The British School of Archaeology in Egypt, London although she spent most of the next three years in England seeking to raise funds for the work, which, unfortunately, did not have the same appeal to her supporters as had the work in Egypt. The last of the Petries' excavation seasons in Gaza was in 1931 with the huge mound called Tell el Ajull anticipated to furnish work for some years. However, this was not to be and tensions over the excavations caused their excavation work to cease. By 1933 the Petries had moved to Jerusalem where, for two seasons between 1935 and 1937, they excavated the mound of Sheikh Zoweyd, which had been a frontier fortress between Egypt and Asia. A planned excavation in 1939 was called off when bandits attacked and looted their camp. === Second World War onwards: editing and final publications === Flinders Petrie died on 29 July 1942, and Hilda Petrie saw out the rest of the war living at the American School of Palestine while editing his papers, which she had determined to send to the newly formed library of the Department of Antiquities at Khartoum. In 1947 Hilda returned to Hampstead, England where she wound up the affairs of the British School and was in 1952 at last able to publish the tomb reliefs that she had copied in 1905 at Saqqara, before her death in 1957. == Published works == * Egyptian Hieroglyphs of the first and second dynasties, drawn by Hilda Petrie, Quaritch, London 1927 * Seven Memphite tomb chapels, Inscriptions by Margaret A[lice] Murray.

(August 20, 1919 ‚Äì May 14, 1997) was an American- born Catholic missionary and bishop. As a member of the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America (Maryknoll) he was assigned to missions in Bolivia. He served as the Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Santa Cruz from 1957 to 1997. ==Early life and education== Charles Brown was born in the Highbridge section of the Bronx, New York to James and Mary Jane (Sullivan) Brown and was one of 11 children. He was educated at Sacred Heart School and Cathedral College, a minor seminary for the Archdiocese of New York. He entered Maryknoll following graduation and entered Venard Apostolic College in Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania. He completed his studies for the priesthood at Maryknoll Seminary in New York before being ordained a priest on June 9, 1946. ==Priesthood== Brown spent his entire career in the Maryknoll Mission in Bolivia. He did pastoral work in Cochabamba before being the named the National Director of Vocations by the Bolivian bishops in 1953. In the fall of the same year, he became pastor at St. Peter's parish in La Paz. Brown also held Maryknoll leadership positions in South America. ==Episcopacy== Pope Pius XII appointed Brown as the Titular Bishop of Vallis and Auxiliary Bishop of Santa Cruz on November 29, 1956. He was consecrated a bishop by Cardinal Francis Spellman at St. Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral in New York on February 27, 1957. The principal co-consecrators were New York Auxiliary Bishop Joseph Flannelly and Coadjutor Bishop Luis An√≠bal Rodr√≠guez Pardo of Santa Cruz. He attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). He served the diocese, and later, Archdiocese of Santa Cruz as vicar general and helped to organize a pre-seminary. He remained as the auxiliary bishop until his resignation was accepted by Pope John Paul II in August 1995. ==Later life and death== Bishop Brown continued to reside in Santa Cruz, but because his health was declining he was only able to provide limited ministry. He went to Rome in 1996 at the invitation of Pope John Paul II to celebrate a special Golden Jubilee Mass of thanksgiving at St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica for all priests, who like the pope, were ordained in 1946. Brown was unable to take part in the Mass as he was taken ill. His need for medical treatment became more urgent upon his return to Santa Cruz and he returned to New York. He was treated at New York University Medical Center before moving to St. Teresa‚Äôs Residence at Maryknoll. He spent a few days there before he was hospitalized again and he died on May 14, 1997 at Phelps Memorial Hospital in Tarrytown, New York. His funeral was celebrated by Cardinal John O'Connor of New York at Our Lady Queen of Apostles Chapel in the Maryknoll Center. He had another funeral in Santa Cruz and was laid to rest in the Cathedral-Basilica of San Lorenzo. ==See alsoReferences== Category:1919 births Category:1997 deaths Category:People from the Bronx Category:American Roman Catholic clergy of Irish descent Category:American Roman Catholic missionaries Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in Bolivia Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:American titular bishops Category:Bolivian Roman Catholic bishops Category:Maryknoll Seminary alumni Category:Maryknoll bishops Category:Participants in the Second Vatican Council Category:American expatriates in Bolivia Category:Catholics from New York (state) ","title":"Charles Arthur Brown"},{"id":"42002148","text":"Rub√©n Dar√≠o Enrique Scatolaro (born February 3, 1957 in Chajar√≠ (Entre R√≠os), Argentina) is a retired Argentine footballer who played for clubs of Argentina, Chile and Spain. ==Teams== * Boca Juniors 1979 * Real Murcia 1979-1980 * Real Oviedo 1980-1981 * Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata 1982-1983 * Deportes La Serena 1984 * Magallanes 1985 * O'Higgins 1986-1988 * San Luis de Quillota 1989-1990 * San Marcos de Arica 1991 * Coquimbo Unido 1992-1994 * Magallanes 1995 ==External links== * Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine footballers Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata footballers Category:Boca Juniors footballers Category:Real Murcia players Category:Real Oviedo players Category:Coquimbo Unido footballers Category:Deportes La Serena footballers Category:Magallanes footballers Category:San Marcos de Arica footballers Category:San Luis de Quillota footballers Category:O'Higgins F.C. footballers Category:Chilean Primera Divisi√≥n players Category:Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n players Category:Expatriate footballers in Chile Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Association footballers not categorized by position ","title":"Dar√≠o Scatolaro"},{"id":"42002176","text":"√ñzel T√ºrkba≈ü (September 1, 1938 - July 22, 2012) was a Turkish-born actress, model, singer and belly dancer, who helped popularize belly dancing in the US and recorded traditional music aimed at a western audience, including the successful 1969 album Bellydance with √ñzel T√ºrkba≈ü: How to Make Your Husband a Sultan. ==Life and career== She was born in Manisa, Turkey, and moved to Ankara as a child; her mother was a professional dancer.

The sources for Scottish Medieval music are extremely limited due to factors including a turbulent political history, the destructive practices of the Scottish Reformation, the climate and the relatively late arrival of music printing. In the early Middle Ages, ecclesiastical music was dominated by monophonic plainchant, which led to the development of a distinct form of liturgical Celtic chant. It was superseded from the eleventh century by more complex Gregorian chant. In the High Middle Ages, the need for large numbers of singing priests to fulfill the obligations of church services led to the foundation of a system of song schools, to train boys as choristers and priests. From the thirteenth century, Scottish church music was increasingly influenced by continental developments. Monophony was replaced from the fourteenth century by the Ars Nova consisting of complex polyphony. Survivals of works from the first half of the sixteenth century indicate the quality and scope of music that was undertaken at the end of the Medieval period. The outstanding Scottish composer of the first half of the sixteenth century was Robert Carver, who produced complex polyphonic music. The Reformation had a severe impact on church music. The song schools of the abbeys, cathedrals and collegiate churches were closed down, choirs disbanded, music books and manuscripts destroyed and organs removed from churches. The Lutheranism that influenced the early Scottish Reformation attempted to accommodate Catholic musical traditions into worship. Later the Calvinism that came to dominate was much more hostile to Catholic musical tradition and popular music, placing an emphasis on what was biblical, which meant the Psalms and most church compositions were confined to homophonic settings. James VI attempted to revive the song schools, however, the triumph of the Presbyterians in the National Covenant of 1638 led to and end of polyphony. In the eighteenth century Evangelicals tended to believe only the Psalms of the 1650 Psalter should be used in the services in the church, while the Moderates attempted to expand psalmody in the Church of Scotland to include hymns the singing of other scriptural paraphrases. Lining out began to be abandoned in favour of singing stanza by stanza. In the second half of the eighteenth century these innovations became linked to a choir movement that included the setting up of schools to teach new tunes and singing in four parts. More tune books appeared and the repertory further expanded. The nineteenth century saw the reintroduction of accompanied music into the Church of Scotland, influenced by the Oxford Movement. Organs began to be added to churches from the mid- nineteenth century, but they remained controversial and were never placed in some churches. Hymns were also adopted by the main denominations. The American Evangelists Ira D. Sankey and Dwight L. Moody helped popularise accompanied church music in Scotland. In the Scottish Episcopal Church, the Oxford Movement and links with the Anglican Church led to the introduction of more traditional services and by 1900 surpliced choirs and musical services were the norm. In Episcopalian cathedrals and churches that maintain a choral tradition, the repertoire of Anglican church music continues to play an important part of worship. In the twentieth century ecumenical movements including the Iona Community and the Dunblane Consultations on church music, were highly influential on church music throughout Britain and the United States and there was a return to the composition of choral music. ==Middle Ages== Detail from the \\"Trinity Altarpiece\\" by Hugo van der Goes. ===Sources=== The sources for Scottish Medieval music are extremely limited. These limitations are the result of factors including a turbulent political history, the destructive practices of the Scottish Reformation, the climate and the relatively late arrival of music printing. What survives are occasional indications that there was a flourishing musical culture. There are no major musical manuscripts for Scotland from before the twelfth century.J. R. Baxter, \\"Music, ecclesiastical\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 431‚Äì2. Neither does Scottish music have an equivalent of the Bannatyne Manuscript in poetry, giving a large and representative sample of Medieval work.J. R. Baxter, \\"Culture: Renaissance and Reformation (1460‚Äì1560)\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 130‚Äì33. The oldest extant piece of Church music written in Scotland is in the Inchcolm Fragment.C. R. Borland, A Descriptive Catalogue of The Western Medieval Manuscripts in Edinburgh University Library (University of Edinburgh Press, 1916), p. xv. Musicologist John Purser has suggested that the services dedicated to St. Columba in this manuscript and the similar service in the Sprouston Breviary, dedicated to St. Kentigern, may preserve some of this earlier tradition of plain chant. Other early manuscripts include the Dunkeld Music Book and the Scone Antiphoner. The most important collection is the mid- thirteenth century Wolfenb√ºttel 677 or W1 manuscript, which survives only because it was appropriated from St Andrews Cathedral Priory and taken to the continent in the 1550s. Other sources include occasional written references in accounts and in literature and visual representations of musicians and instruments. The limitations on the survival of Medieval musical manuscripts is partly because of the relatively late development of printing in Scotland, which would mean that only from the mid-sixteenth century do large numbers of printed works survive. ===Early Middle Ages=== In the early Middle Ages, ecclesiastical music was dominated by monophonic plainchant.R. McKitterick, C. T. Allmand, T. Reuter, D. Abulafia, P. Fouracre, J. Simon, C. Riley-Smith, M. Jones, eds, The New Cambridge Medieval History: C. 1415- C. 1500 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), , pp. 319‚Äì25. The development of British Christianity, separate from the direct influence of Rome until the eighth century, with its flourishing monastic culture, led to the development of a distinct form of liturgical Celtic chant.D. O. Croinin, ed., Prehistoric and Early Ireland: Prehistoric and Early Ireland, vol I (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), , p. 798. Although no notations of this music survive, later sources suggest distinctive melodic patterns. Celtic chant is thought have been superseded from the eleventh century, as elsewhere in Europe, by more complex Gregorian chant.D. Hiley, Western Plainchant: a Handbook (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995), , p. 483. The version of this chant linked to the liturgy as used in the Diocese of Salisbury, the Sarum Use, first recorded from the thirteenth century, became dominant in EnglandE. Foley, M. Paul Bangert, Worship Music: a Concise Dictionary (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 2000), , p. 273. and was the basis for most surviving chant in Scotland. It was closely related to Gregorian chant, but it was more elaborate and with some unique local features. The Sarum rite continued to be the basis of Scottish liturgical music in Scotland until the Reformation and where choirs were available, which was probably limited to the great cathedrals, collegiate churches and the wealthier parish churches it would have been used in the main ingredient of divine offices of vespers, compline, matins, lauds, mass and the canonical hours. ===High Middle Ages=== The Chapel Royal, Stirling Castle, a major focus for liturgical music In the High Middle Ages, the need for large numbers of singing priests to fulfill the obligations of church services led to the foundation of a system of song schools, to train boys as choristers and priests, often attached to Cathedrals, wealthy monasteries and collegiate churches. The proliferation of collegiate churches and requiem masses in the later Middle Ages would have necessitated the training of large numbers of choristers, marking a considerable expansion of the song school system. Over 100 collegiate churches of secular priests were founded in Scotland between 1450 and the Reformation.J. P. Foggie, Renaissance Religion in Urban Scotland: The Dominican Order, 1450‚Äì1560 (BRILL, 2003), , p. 101. They were designed to provide masses for their founders and their families, who included the nobility and the emerging orders of the Lords of Parliament and the wealthy merchants of the developing burghs. From the thirteenth century, Scottish church music was increasingly influenced by continental developments, with figures like the musical theorist Simon Tailler studying in Paris, before returned to Scotland where he introduced several reforms of church music.K. Elliott and F. Rimmer, A History of Scottish Music (London: British Broadcasting Corporation, 1973), , pp. 8‚Äì12. The Wolfenb√ºttel 677 manuscript contains a large number of French compositions, particularly from Notre Dame de Paris, beside inventive pieces by unknown Scottish composers. ===Late Middle Ages=== Monophony was replaced from the fourteenth century by the Ars Nova, a movement that developed in France and then Italy, replacing the restrictive styles of Gregorian plainchant with complex polyphony.W. Lovelock, A Concise History of Music (New York NY: Frederick Ungar, 1953), p. 57. The tradition was well established in England by the fifteenth century. The distinctive English version of polyphony, known as the Contenance Angloise (English manner), used full, rich harmonies based on the third and sixth, which was highly influential in the fashionable Burgundian court of Philip the Good, where the Burgundian School associated with Guillaume Dufay developed.R. H. Fritze and W. B. Robison, Historical Dictionary of Late Medieval England, 1272‚Äì1485 (Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2002), , p. 363. In the late fifteenth century a series of Scottish musicians trained in the Netherlands before returning home, including John Broune, Thomas Inglis and John Fety, the last of whom became master of the song school in Aberdeen and then Edinburgh, introducing the new five-fingered organ playing technique.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 58 and 118. Survivals of works from the first half of the sixteenth century from St. Andrews and St. Giles, Edinburgh, and post-Reformation works from composers that were trained in this era from the abbeys of Dunfermline and Holyrood, and from the priory at St. Andrews, indicate the quality and scope of music that was undertaken at the end of the Medieval period. ===Renaissance=== The outstanding Scottish composer of the first half of the sixteenth century was Robert Carver (c. 1488‚Äì1558), a canon of Scone Abbey. His complex polyphonic music could only have been performed by a large and highly trained choir such as the one employed in the Scottish Chapel Royal. James V was also a patron to figures including David Peebles (c. 1510‚Äì79?), whose best known work \\"Si quis diligit me\\" (text from John 14:23), is a motet for four voices. These were probably only two of many accomplished composers from this era, whose work has largely only survived in fragments.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488‚Äì1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 118. Much of what survives of church music from the first half of the sixteenth century is due to the diligent work of Thomas Wode (d. 1590), vicar of St Andrews, who compiled a part book from now lost sources, which was continued by unknown hands after his death.J. R. Baxter, \\"Culture: Renaissance and Reformation (1460‚Äì1560)\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 130‚Äì2. ==Impact of the Reformation== A reprint of the 1600 cover of The Gude and Godlie Ballatis The Reformation had a severe impact on church music. The song schools of the abbeys, cathedrals and collegiate churches were closed down, choirs disbanded, music books and manuscripts destroyed and organs removed from churches.A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , pp. 198‚Äì9. The Lutheranism that influenced the early Scottish Reformation attempted to accommodate Catholic musical traditions into worship, drawing on Latin hymns and vernacular songs. The most important product of this tradition in Scotland was The Gude and Godlie Ballatis (1567), which were spiritual satires on popular ballads composed by the brothers James, John and Robert Wedderburn. Never adopted by the kirk, they nevertheless remained popular and were reprinted from the 1540s to the 1620s. Later the Calvinism that came to dominate the Scottish Reformation was much more hostile to Catholic musical tradition and popular music, placing an emphasis on what was biblical, which meant the Psalms. The Scottish Psalter of 1564 was commissioned by the Assembly of the Church. It drew on the work of French musician Cl√©ment Marot, Calvin's contributions to the Strasbourg Psalter of 1539 and English writers, particularly the 1561 edition of the Psalter produced by William Whittingham for the English congregation in Geneva. The intention was to produce individual tunes for each psalm, but of 150 psalms 105 had proper tunes and in the seventeenth century, common tunes, which could be used for psalms with the same metre, became more frequent. Because whole congregations would now sing these psalms, unlike the trained choirs who had sung the many parts of polyphonic hymns, there was a need for simplicity and most church compositions were confined to homophonic settings.A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 198. During his personal reign James VI attempted to revive the song schools, with an act of parliament passed in 1579, demanding that councils of the largest burghs set up \\"ane sang scuill with ane maister sufficient and able for insturctioun of the yowth in the said science of musik\\". Five new schools were opened within four years of the act and by 1633 there were at least twenty-five. Most of those without song schools made provision within their grammar schools.G. Munro, \\"'Sang schools' and 'music schools': music education in Scotland 1560‚Äì1650\\", in S. F. Weiss, R. E. Murray, Jr., and C. J. Cyrus, eds, Music Education in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance (Indiana University Press, 2010), , p. 67. Polyphony was incorporated into editions of the Psalter from 1625, but usually with the congregation singing the melody and trained singers the contra-tenor, treble and bass parts.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 187‚Äì90. However, the triumph of the Presbyterians in the National Covenant of 1638 led to the end of polyphony and a new psalter in common metre, but without tunes, was published in 1650. In 1666 The Twelve Tunes for the Church of Scotland, composed in Four Parts, which actually contained 14 tunes and was designed for use with the 1650 Psalter, was first published in Aberdeen. It would go through five editions by 1720. By the late seventeenth century these two works had become the basic corpus of the tunes sung in the kirk. ==Eighteenth century== Philip Doddridge, one of the English hymnodists that had a major impact on the development of Scottish church music in the eighteenth century In the eighteenth century there were growing divisions in the kirk between the Evangelicals and the Moderate Party.J. T. Koch, Celtic Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volumes 1‚Äì5 (London: ABC-CLIO, 2006), , pp. 416‚Äì7. While Evangelicals emphasised the authority of the Bible and the traditions and historical documents of the kirk, the Moderates tended to stress intellectualism in theology, the established hierarchy of the kirk and attempted to raise the social status of the clergy.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , pp. 303‚Äì4. In music the evangelicals tended to believe that only the Psalms of the 1650 Psalter should be used in the services in the church. In contrast the Moderates believed that Psalmody was in need of reform and expansion. This movement had its origins in the influence of English psalmondist and hymnodist Isaac Watts (1674‚Äì1748) and became and attempt to expand psalmondy in the Church of Scotland to include hymns the singing of other scriptural paraphrases.B. D. Spinks, A Communion Sunday in Scotland ca. 1780: Liturgies and Sermons (Scarecrow Press, 2009), , p. 28. From the late seventeenth century the common practice was lining out, by which the precentor sang or read out each line and it was then repeated by the congregation. From the second quarter of the eighteenth century it was argued that this should be abandoned in favour of the practice of singing stanza by stanza. This necessitated the use of practice verses and the pioneering work was Thomas Bruce's The Common Tunes, or, Scotland's Church Musick Made Plane (1726), which contained seven practice verses. The 30 tunes in this book marked the beginning of a renewal movement in Scottish Psalmody. New practices were introduced and the repertory was expanded, including both neglected sixteenth- century settings and new ones.B. D. Spinks, A Communion Sunday in Scotland ca. 1780: Liturgies and Sermons (Scarecrow Press, 2009), , pp. 143‚Äì4. In the second half of the eighteenth century these innovations became linked to a choir movement that included the setting up of schools to teach new tunes and singing in four parts.B. D. Spinks, A Communion Sunday in Scotland ca. 1780: Liturgies and Sermons (Scarecrow Press, 2009), , p. 26. More tune books appeared and the repertory further expanded, although there were still fewer than in counterpart churches in England and the US. More congregations abandoned lining out. In the period 1742‚Äì45 a committee of the General Assembly worked on a series of paraphrases, borrowing from Watts, Philip Doddridge (1702‚Äì51) and other Scottish and English writers, which were published as Translations and Paraphrases, in verse, of several passages of Sacred Scripture (1725). These were never formally adopted, as the Moderates, then dominant in the church, thought they were too evangelical. A corrected version was licensed for private use in 1751 and some individual congregations petitioned successful for their use in public worship and they were revised again and published 1781. These were formally adopted by the assembly, but there was considerable resistance to their introduction in some parishes.B. D. Spinks, A Communion Sunday in Scotland ca. 1780: Liturgies and Sermons (Scarecrow Press, 2009), , p. 32. After the Glorious Revolution episcopalianism retrained supporters, but they were divided between the \\"non- jurors\\", not subscribing to the right of William III and Mary II, and later the Hanoverians, to be monarchs,J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , pp. 252‚Äì3. and Qualified Chapels, where congregations, led by priests ordained by bishops of the Church of England or the Church of Ireland, were willing to pray for the Hanoverians.N. Yates, Eighteenth-Century Britain: Religion and Politics 1714‚Äì1815 (London: Pearson Education, 2008), , p. 49. Such chapels drew their congregations from English people living in Scotland and from Scottish Episcopalians who were not bound to the Jacobite cause and used the English Book of Common Prayer. They could worship openly and installed organs and hired musicians, following practice in English parish churches, singing in the liturgy as well as metrical psalms, while the non-jurors had to worship covertly and less elaborately. The two branches united in the 1790s after the death of the last Stuart heir in the main line and the repeal of the penal laws in 1792. The non-juring branch soon absorbed the musical and liturgical traditions of the qualified churches.R. M. Wilson, Anglican Chant and Chanting in England, Scotland, and America, 1660 to 1820 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), , p. 192. Catholicism had been reduced to the fringes of the country, particularly the Gaelic-speaking areas of the Highlands and Islands. Numbers probably reduced in the seventeenth century and organisation had deteriorated. Clergy entered the country secretly and although services were illegal they were maintained.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , pp. 298‚Äì9. The provisions of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791, which allowed freedom of worship for Catholics who took an oath of allegiance, were extended to Scotland in 1793 and provided some official toleration.T. Gallagher, Glasgow: The Uneasy Peace : Religious Tension in Modern Scotland, 1819‚Äì1914 (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1987), , p. 9. Worship, in chapels within the houses of members of the aristocracy or adapted buildings was deliberately low key. It typically involved an unsung Low Mass in Latin. Any form of musical accompaniment was prohibited by George Hay, who was vicar apostolic of the Lowland District in the period 1778 to 1805.N. Yates, Preaching, Word and Sacrament: Scottish Church Interiors 1560‚Äì1860 (A&C; Black, 2009), , p. 94. ==Nineteenth century== Ira D. Sankey, whose singing and compositions helped popularise accompanied church music in Scotland in the late nineteenth century The nineteenth century saw the reintroduction of accompanied music into the Church of Scotland. This was strongly influenced by the English Oxford Movement, which encouraged a return to Medieval forms of architecture and worship. The first organ to be installed by a Church of Scotland church after the Reformation was at St. Andrews, Glasgow in 1804, but it was not in the church building and was used only for weekly rehearsals. Two years later the city council was petitioned to allow it to be moved into the church, but they deferred to the local presbytery, who decided, after much deliberation, that they were illegal and prohibited their use within their jurisdiction. In 1828 the first organ was controversially installed in an Edinburgh church. Around the same time James Steven published his Harmonia Sacra: A Selection of the Most Approved Psalm and Hymn Tunes, provocatively printed a frontispiece showing a small organ.B. D. Spinks, A Communion Sunday in Scotland ca. 1780: Liturgies and Sermons (Scarecrow Press, 2009), , p. 149. The Church Service Society was founded in 1865 to promote liturgical study and reform and a year later organs were officially admitted to churches.R. W. Munro, \\"Churches: 2 1843‚Äì1929\\" in M. Lynch, ed., Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 91‚Äì2. They began to be added to churches in large numbers and by the end of the century roughly a third of Church of Scotland ministers were members of the society and over 80 per cent of kirks had both organs and choirs. However, they remained controversial, with considerable opposition among conservative elements within the churchS. J. Brown, \\"Scotland and the Oxford Movement\\", in S. J. Brown, Peter B. Nockles and Peter Benedict Nockles, eds, The Oxford Movement: Europe and the Wider World 1830‚Äì1930 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), , p. 73. and organs were never placed in some churches. Similarly, in the Episcopalian Church the influence of the Oxford Movement and links with the Anglican Church led to the introduction of more traditional services and by 1900 surpliced choirs and musical services were the norm.D. W. Bebbington, \\"Episcopalian community\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 234‚Äì5. A similar pattern occurred in the Catholic church, with music being introduced into services and organs being placed in churches in the early part of the century. By 1820 there were organs in churches in seven towns. The Free Church that broke away from the kirk in 1843 in the Great Disruption, was more conservative over music, and organs were not permitted until 1883.S. J. Brown, \\"Beliefs and religions\\" in T. Griffiths and G. Morton, A History of Everyday Life in Scotland, 1800 to 1900 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), , p. 122. Hymns were first introduced in the United Presbyterian Church in the 1850s. They became common in the Church of Scotland and Free Church in the 1870s. The Church of Scotland adopted a hymnal with 200 songs in 1870 and the Free Church followed suit in 1882. The visit of American Evangelists Ira D. Sankey (1840‚Äì1908), and Dwight L. Moody (1837‚Äì99) to Edinburgh and Glasgow in 1874‚Äì75 helped popularise accompanied church music in Scotland. The Moody-Sankey hymnbook remained a best seller into the twentieth century.P. Maloney, Scotland and the Music Hall, 1850‚Äì1914 (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2003), , p. 197. Sankey made the harmonium so popular that working-class mission congregations pleaded for the introduction of accompanied music.T. M. Devine, The Scottish Nation: A Modern History (London: Penguin, 2012), . ==Twentieth century== In the early twentieth century the Catholic Church in Scotland formalised the use of hymns, with the publication of The Book of Tunes and Hymns (1913), the Scottish equivalent of the Westminster Hymnal.T. E. Muir, Roman Catholic Church Music in England, 1791‚Äì1914: A Handmaid of the Liturgy? (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2013), . The foundation of the ecumenical Iona Community in 1938, on the island of Iona off the coast of Scotland, led to a highly influential form of music, which was used across Britain and the US. Leading musical figure John Bell (b. 1949) adapted folk tunes or created tunes in a folk style to fit lyrics that often emerged from the spiritual experience of the community.D. W. Music, Christian Hymnody in Twentieth-Century Britain and America: an Annotated Bibliography (London: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001), , p. 10. The Dunblane consultations, informal meetings at the ecumenical Scottish Church House in Dunblane in 1961‚Äì69, attempted to produce modern hymns that retained theological integrity. They resulted in the British \\"Hymn Explosion\\" of the 1960s, which produced multiple collections of new hymns.D. W. Music, Christian Hymnody in Twentieth-Century Britain and America: an Annotated Bibliography (London: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001), , p. 3. The growth of a tradition of classical music in Scotland also led to a renewed interest in choral works. Over 30 have been created by James MacMillan (b. 1959), including his St. Anne's Mass (1985), which calls for congregational participation and his Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis (2000) for orchestra and choir.M. P.

He was an assistant to John Ericsson and George Stephenson, and surveyed for many British railroad companies in the mid-19th century. He is also known for the 1850 Cheffins' Map of English & Scotch Railways and other maps. == Biography == Cheffins' Map of English & Scotch Railways, 1850. Cheffins was born in London, where his father was the manager of the New River Waterworks Company and supervised the manufacturing of wooden pipes used to supply water to the metropolis. Young Cheffins was admitted into Christ's Hospital as a scholar in July 1815. He remained there until 1822, diligently pursuing his studies, and received several gold medals for his proficiency in mathematics.\\"Memories of Charles Frederick Cheffins\\" in: Proc. ICE. Institution of Civil Engineers (Great Britain). Vol XXI. (1861/2). pp. 578-80 Upon completion of his education, he was apprenticed to Messrs. Newton and Son, patent agents and mechanical draughtsmen, where he became practiced in making drawings from specifications and from models of machinery. He remained as an employee with Messrs. Newton and Son for some time after completing his apprenticeship. From 1830 he was engaged by Captain John Ericsson to assist in making drawings for locomotive engines. The next year he became assistant to George Stephenson and prepared plans and sections of the projected Grand Junction Railway.Chrimes, Michael M. \\"Robert Stephenson and planning the construction of the London and Birmingham Railway.\\" Proceedings of the First International Congress on Construction History. Vol. 20. 2003. On the completion of the parliamentary submissions for the Grand Junction Railway, between 1832 and 1833, he set up his own cartographical and drawing business,Michael Reeves Bailey. Robert Stephenson-the Eminent Engineer. Ashgate. 2003. p. 81 and spent over two decades working as a surveyor for numerous railroad construction projects in the United Kingdom. In 1838, he published his first Map of the Grand Junction Railway and Adjacent Country; and the next year Cheffins's Official Map of the Railway from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool.Herapath's Railway Journal. Vol. 5. 1839. p. 389 In 1846, Cheffins commissioned John Cooke Bourne to write the History of the Great Western Railway.Benezit Dictionary of British Graphic Artists and Illustrators. Oxford University Press (2012) p. 154 Occasionally, Cheffins also published lithographical work by others. In the year 1848, he had been elected an Associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers and continued to take interest in all their proceedings. One year before his death in 1861, the partnership between Cheffins and his sons‚Äîas surveyors, draftsmen, and lithographers‚Äîwas dissolved by mutual consent. The business continued with Cheffins and his son Charles Richard Cheffins as partners.The London Gazette, 21 August 1860. Cheffins died suddenly from internal injuries on 23 October 1861, leaving his son Charles to complete the work which he commenced a month or two before his death. His death, at the age of fifty-four, was said to have greatly impacted his friends, colleagues, and assistants, who had served under him in the numerous parliamentary campaigns in which he had been engaged ‚Äì and to many of whom he had shown much kindness in recommending them to posts of trust and responsibility on the Indian railways. == Work  Locomotive design === Contemporary drawing of the Rainhill Trials from the Illustrated London News. Novelty, Braithwaite and Ericsson's entry for the Rainhill Trials. Illustration from The Mechanics Magazine, 1829. About the year 1830, he was engaged by Captain John Ericsson to assist in making the drawings for the Novelty locomotive engine, then about to be constructed by Messrs. Braithwaite and Ericsson, to compete against the Stephenson's Rocket and other locomotives on the Rainhill Trials on the Manchester and Liverpool Railway. The competition went against the Novelty, on account of the failure of its blast apparatus. Cheffins was present at the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, and remained some time longer with Captain Ericsson, making drawings for other inventions, among which was a steam fire-engine and a caloric engine ‚Äì machines which gained public attention, the former of which coming into general use. Cheffins's practical knowledge of machinery rendered him a valuable assistant in the preparation of the designs. === Testimony in patent-right lawsuits === In 1830, Cheffins reputation was such that he testified for the \\"defendants\\" in the patent infringement case of Lord Galloway and Alexander Cochrane versus John Braithwaite and John Ericsson, in the Court of Chancery, where it was alleged that the boilers of the Novelty locomotive were of a type too similar to a design of the plaintiffs and where the Lord Chancellor found for the defendants. Subsequently, Cheffins took the stand in court more often. In one 1847 case narrated in The Railway Record, \\"Charles F. Cheffins, engineer and surveyor, was called for the defence, proved that he had examined the plans and sections in question, and detected so many errors that the case became quite clear.\\"The Railway Record. Vol. 4 (1847). p. 670 === Grand Junction Railway === In 1831, Cheffins was introduced to railway pioneer George Stephenson by Stephenson's oldest associate and surveyor, a Mr. Padley. After the successful opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, Stephenson became prominently involved in numerous other schemes. Cheffins' first occupation under Stephenson was the preparation of the plans and sections of the projected Grand Junction Railway, which was to connect the towns of Birmingham and Liverpool; and his persevering industry was noticed by, among other eminent engineers, Joseph Locke, Frederick Swanwick, Daniel Gooch. === Lithograph of London Station === Entrance Front of the London Station by C.F. Cheffins, published 3 April 1837. In 1830, Cheffins started making lithographs, which were published in magazines such as an engraving representing the London Terminus of the London and Birmingham Railway, at Button Grove, in an 1837 issue of John Limbird's The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. The engraving was reduced from a drawing by Thomas Allom and lithographed by Cheffins. The structure was being erected at the time of the publication. The building was designed by Philip Hardwick, an architect of St. Katherine's Docks, Goldsmith's Hall, the City Clubhouse, and other buildings. The facade of the railway station would occupy about 300 feet towards Drummond Street, opposite a wide opening into Euston Square. The principal elevation consisted of a Grecian Doric portico, with two antae, and two lodges, one on each side, the latter to house the offices of the company; the spaces between the columns and antae of the portico, and also of the lodges, were enclosed by iron gates. === Other lithographic work === John Snow, drawn and printed by C.F.

Lee Lerner, Brenda Wilmoth Lerner (2006) Medicine, health, and bioethics: essential primary sources. p. xx. === Railroad surveys === On the completion of the parliamentary submissions for the Grand Junction Railway, Cheffins terminated his engagement with Stephenson. Foreseeing that railway schemes were only then in their infancy and that much work might be anticipated, Cheffins devoted himself exclusively to the surveying department of the profession and established himself in London, working independently, while retaining the patronage of those with whom he had been previously associated and adding other names to his list of friends. Robert Stephenson, the son of George, was among the latter, and under his direction and superintendence, Cheffins prepared many of the designs for the construction of the bridges on the London and Birmingham Railway. Cheffins was also engaged by Stephenson on other matters. Their friendship lasted until Stephenson's death, and Cheffins continued to hold him in high regard as someone crucial to his own success. In his further professional career, Cheffins completed numerous projects for the London and Blackwall Railway, the Great Eastern Railway (then the Eastern Counties Railway), the Trent Valley Line, and the North Staffordshire Railway‚Äîa few of which he lived to see to completion, although they were opposed in both houses of Parliament by other companies and large landed proprietors. In 1846, in recognition for Cheffins's services, a service of plate was presented to him by, among others, the leading engineers of the day. The last initiative Cheffins was a part of was the projected Great Eastern Northern Junction Railway Bill of 1860, (known familiarly as the \\"Coal Line\\"), which his friend George Parker Bidder had put in his hands, and in which he took an interest; but he died before its completion. == Selected publications == Cheffins published dozens of maps, most of railways.

Lone Mountain Las Vegas The area was named after a solitary hill that is detached from the Red Rock National Conservation Area, known as \\"Lone Mountain\\", which is an isolated, rocky butte northwest of central Las Vegas. The summit stands 560 feet above the surrounding area, giving great views of the city, the Spring Mountains, and Mt. Charleston. Lone Mountain itself is encircled by a 10-foot-wide, 3.2-mile perimeter trail for joggers, hikers, and horseback riders. It is the neighboring community immediately north of Summerlin and roughly bordered on the west by the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, on the south by Cheyenne Avenue, on the east by the 95 Freeway and on the north by West Lone Mountain Road. Within this area are some of the most desirable homes in Las Vegas. While there is a proliferation of affluent new construction at the western foothills, there are still a number of horse ranches and natural terrain and parks which remain. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department's Academy is located within Lone Mountain, as is the adjacent Police Memorial Park (dedicated in 2009). The park includes the Memorial Wall and two dedicated tree groves to memorialize Las Vegas Metropolitan police officers who have died in the line of duty. Two trees are dedicated to the Ten-13 retired New York Police Officers of the September 11, 2001 tragedy. The area enjoys a low crime rate, perhaps because of the numerous law enforcement officers and their families who reside in this community. There is an abundance of recreational areas within the area, including Lone Mountain Discovery Park, which is a green space with a roller hockey rink, basketball, tennis courts, and a picnic area. Majestic Park, a full-service softball facility with 12 playing fields. Trigono Hills Park, a 6.5 million dollar recreational facility, which opened in the spring of 2020 and is located Cliff Shadows Parkway at Gilmore Avenue. The homes of Lone Mountain range from the Spanish Colonial horse ranches, to luxury \\"mini-estates\\" by Blue Heron Homes, to the 3-story, mid-century modern revival homes at \\"Hillside\\", designed by William Ramsey. ==References * Category:Las Vegas Valley Category:Unincorporated communities in Clark County, Nevada Category:Unincorporated communities in Nevada ","title":"Lone Mountain, Nevada"},{"id":"42002761","text":"Taran (, also Romanized as ≈¢arƒÅn and TarƒÅn) is a village in Kahir Rural District, in the Central District of Konarak County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

Named after the first elected council Chief, Michel Callihoo, the band officially signed Treaty Number 6 by adhesion on September 3 of 1878. The Michel First Nation is composed primarily of Iroquois, Cree and M√©tis with over 700 current registered descendants. Numbered-Treaties-Map The Michel Reserve #132 was once located near the present-day town site of Villenevue, Alberta, described and surveyed in September 1880 by G.A. Simpson; \\"to a post on the right bank of the Sturgeon River and thence easterly along the said bank of the river to the point of beginning, containing an area of forty square miles more or less.\\" The entire band was illegally enfranchised by the Canadian Government on March 31, 1958 by Order in Council P.C. 375. The Michel First Nation is the only band in Canada during the 20th Century to be enfranchised. ==Iroquois History== The Michel Band emerged as a distinct cultural and kinship group during the North American fur tradeCanadian Fur Trade]. Garagonthie an Onondaga Sachem, Chief and Orator, first travelled North West from Onondaga territory Iroquois communities of Caughnawaga and St.Regis. Generations of Iroquois had been trapping furs for a living and had become proficient in the trading of goods to maintain a comfortable lifestyle in the St.Lawrence River and Great Lakes regions. File:Iroquois_western_goods.jpgthumbIroquois, with western goods 1722. The Iroquois were politically governed by the traditional customs and governance of the Great Law of Peace. In 1645 Iroquois headmen began treating the Frenchmen of Trois-Rivi√®res, the Hurons, and Algonquins. In their dealings with the French, Iroquois diplomats adapted the language and rituals of the Great Law of Peace to create the protocol for intercultural diplomacy. In 1654, Daniel Garakontie or \\"The Moving Sun\\" was the Great Sachem of the Iroquois Confederacy. > \\"Five whole Nations address thee through my mouth. I have in my heart the > sentiments of all the Iroquois Nations - and my tongue is faithful to my > heart.\\" -Garakontie Garakontie was known as Sagochiendagehte (\\"the name bearer\\") the Council name of the Onondaga - a status he occupied as its principal speaker. Garakontie was his family name and not his hereditary title, thus his status as speaker and chief diplomat was achieved, not ascribed by his membership into the Bear Clan. The first references to Garakonti√© reveal him struggling to preserve the general peace of 1653. While in Quebec Garakontie proclaimed his faith in Christianity. Garakonti√© was baptized in the Cathedral of Quebec. He announced he would no longer sponsor dream feasts and declared the Iroquois cosmology was a fable. Traditionalist Iroquois headmen maintained that Garakontie had become French and untrustworthy The Jesuits had not only created Catholic converts, but also strong Christian and Traditionalist factions that brought unprecedented disquiet to Iroquois communities. By the late 1660s Jesuit missionaries encouraged increasing numbers of Catholic Iroquois to desert their homes for the mission villages in Canada; by the mid 1670s over two- hundred had departed. The lack of pelts to trade and warfare created serious economic hardship in Iroquoia. In 1700, over 500 of their 2000 warriors had been killed, captured, or had deserted to Catholic missions. = Louis Kwarakwante = Fur traders in canada 1777Louis Kwarakwante (\\"The Sun Traveller\\") was born in 1782 near the Catholic Mission of Saul St. Louis of Caughnawaga. It is speculated that Louis was Mohawk. The name Kwarakwante appears to be an incorrect translation of Garakontie. Records list his surname variously as \\"Karaconti. Karaquienthe, Caraquanti.\\" Louis also went by the surname of Callihoo, which derived from \\"Karhioo\\" meaning \\"Tall Forest\\" in Iroquois. Many members of his family, especially those who went west with the Fur Trade, had the name Karakontie bestowed on them by the clergy. Louis Kwarakwante was likely a grandson of Daniel Garakontie.Canoe Manned by Voyageurs Passing a Waterfall As early as 1800, the North West Company began to employ Iroquois voyagers. Colin Robertson said he preferred the Iroquois voyageurs to French-Canadians in a rapid or dangerous river crossing \\"for their calmness and presence of mind which never forsakes them in the greatest danger.\\" This was still a common trend even up until 1872, when George Grant remarked: > \\"Our crews were chiefly Iroquois Indians from Caugh-naw-aga, near Montreal, > the best voyagers known, according to the testimony of everyone who has > tried them. The Iroquois made the engagement for the trip, and hired a few > Ojibways bear the Shebandowan and Fort Francis to make up the necessary > number. They were as fine-looking, clean-limbed men as one's eye could > desire to rest on, punctual, diligent, uncomplaining, and reserving their > chief affection for their canoes. As a jockey cherishes his horse and > shepherd his dog, so do they care for their canoe.\\" The NWC undoubtedly hired Iroquois from Caughnawaga not only for their experience, but also their familiarity with the Catholic clergy and the habitant seigneuries who had land holdings in the Missions. The Regardless, the bark longhouses still resembled those of in Mohawk Valley, and traditional agriculture was still practiced. In this Mission, Louis Callihoo learned his catechism and his prayers in his native tongue. He spoke French and later many other languages as well, which no doubt made his commercial dealings easier. He was contracted as a canoemen on November 23, 1800 by McTavish, Frobisher & Company, agents of the NWC. = Iroquois Freeman = Winter couriers of the North- West Fur Company A M√©tis man and his two wives, circa 1825-1826 == References == Category:First Nations history in the District of Alberta Category:M√©tis in Alberta * * * Category:Franco-Albertan culture Category:Government agencies disestablished in 1958 Category:1958 disestablishments in Canada Category:First Nations in Alberta * ","title":"Michel Band"},{"id":"42002837","text":"Simli (, also Romanized as Sƒ´mlƒ´) is a village in Zarabad-e Sharqi Rural District, Zarabad District, Konarak County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

He was named after his mother's former husband, Ivory Fenderson, who had died four years earlier. His parents were Asa and Mehitable (n√©e Milliken) Quinby. He had a brother and sister, named Rodney and Elizabeth. He came from an old New England family, who settled the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1638. At fifteen, he was enrolled at Waterville College. After graduating on August 3, 1836 with honors, Quinby moved to Parsonsfield, Maine, to live with his uncle Hosea Quinby, where he was employed by Parsonsfield Seminary, a Free Will Baptist academy, as an assistant teacher. Quinby left to study law in Saco under Judge Shepley. By the time he was twenty, he had decided to travel to Illinois, with all of his money, which was about $125.00. He arrived in Quincy, Illinois, in 1837, and met two men named John Mitchell and O.H. Browning, who advised that he move to Monmouth, Illinois, for the purpose of buying up land patents. The U.S. Government at the time granted land patents to veterans of the War of 1812, who rarely kept them. Instead, they sold the property to people like Quinby and a colleague of his, Elijah Winslow, who then resold the land to settlers.Merchant, Steve Elijah Winslow of Unity, Maine & Ivory Quinby of Illinois-Military Land Bounty Speculators Quinby and Mitchell walked fifteen miles from Oquawka, Illinois to Monmouth, and established a law firm. With his remaining savings, Quinby bought 8,000 acres in Warren County.State of Illinois, Illinois Public Land Records [Database on-line]. Provom UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 1999. (ancestry.com) ==Civil service career== In 1839, Mehitable, Rodney and Elizabeth Quinby moved to Monmouth, where Rodney studied law under both his brother and Abner Clark Harding, who was a partner in the firm Harding & Quinby.Monmouth Review Atlas, December 1887. In 1849, Quinby was elected to a probate court as a judge, where he served a single term from 1849 to 1853.Monmouth Review Atlas, October 29, 1869. p. 3 Column 1 During this time, Quinby was elected to the board of trustees of Monmouth, which governed the town before the more common single mayoral system was instated.City Council Minutes, 1836‚Äì1853, 252. On May 14, 1851, an election was held at the Monmouth courthouse. Charles Armsby, Hiram Baldwin, Chancy Hardin, James Thompson and Ivory Quinby were all elected to the Board. On March 28 of that year, Quinby was elected president of the board. Board of trustees meetings were held in the offices of Harding & Quinby at the time. While serving as president, Quinby and the board strengthened ordinances against drinking and disorderly conduct. When his term came to a close, Quinby was paid $5.00 for his time as president. In 1857, Quinby was elected mayor for a second time, running on the Democratic ticket. He won over his opponents, G.W. Savage and Samuel Wood, by 120 votes. As mayor, Quinby worked with Chancy Hardin, who had become an alderman, serving with James Neil, Theodore Cornell and Horatio Henry. On June 2, 1863, Quinby was elected to the board of health, again with Hardin and a health officer, Dr. J.R. Webster. Quinby also was one of the founders of the Monmouth Public Library, which he began in 1867 as a reading room, which could be utilized without charge. This eventually became the permanent library.Eckley, Ralph. Monmouth Review Atlas \\"City has Number of Quinby Houses\\". April 27, 1979. Since he owned acres of land around Monmouth, Quinby donated a section to the city, for the purpose of expansion, which he gifted in 1865. In 1867, after being elected mayor again, Quinby oversaw the placement of sidewalks in Monmouth. One parcel was set aside, and turned into a park, which takes up an entire block. It has remained a park, into the present day.Moffitt, Old Timers Columns, Volume A. p. 6. ==Business== Ivory Quinby was not only a respected politician, but a very successful businessman as well. He founded the Harding & Quinby law firm (as previously mentioned), and operated a mercantile in nearby Berwick from 1847‚Äì1851. He frequently bought and sold property in Monmouth, which generated a financially successful business. On February 27, 1851, prominent Monmouth citizens Abner Harding, Wyatt B. Stapp (after whom Wyatt Earp was named), Colonel J.W. Davidson, and James G. Madden held a public meeting to discuss a proposed measure, which would allow the Peoria and Oquawka Railroad Company to lay track through town. This was an idea that Quinby fervently supported. The public response was generally positive, so the project moved ahead. Quinby purchased land for the railroad to pass through, and he along with Chancy Hardin and Abner Harding formed a construction company, C. Hardin & Co., and began the task of laying track. Unfortunately, the citizens of Oquawka were not as enthusiastic, and refused to aid in the construction or funding. They did not see the railroad as a serious competitor of river traffic. The Peoria & Oquawka was forced to divert their planned route to Burlington, where the bankrupted Peoria & Warsaw Railroad had already begun work. Quinby's business sense greatly helped the Railroad, and made it very profitable. The railroad was eventually sold to the Central Military Tract Railroad in 1852, which eventually became the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy. This route is still used to this day, mostly traveled by coal trains and Amtrak. Through Quinby's foresight, Monmouth is today a transportation center.William, Urban. Ivory Quinby, The Burlington Railroad, and Monmouth College In 1856, Quinby decided to shift from practicing law to banking, and partnered with T.L. McCoy, founding the Warren County Bank, which was the first in town. The bank's success, coupled with his other business ventures, made Quinby a wealthy man.Warren County, Illinois: History and Families (Turner Publishing Company: Paducah, KY, 2003), 234. ==Monmouth College== Quinby highly valued education, and so when Monmouth College was founded in 1853, he became a member of their Board of Trustees, where he served as treasurer.Portrait and Biographical Album, 375. Quinby was one of the college's earliest benefactors, and donated a large amount of money, a sum which amounts to about $10,000. A metal plaque in Wallace Hall at Monmouth College describes Quinby as \\"One whose loyalty and benevolence helped make Monmouth College.\\" ==Personal life== Quinby married Jane Allen, who had moved from Oneida County, New York, with her father Benjamin Allen, in 1839.Monmouth Review Atlas, February 12, 1847. They had three children, Arthur, Henry and Willis, all of whom died before their father. Allen died of tuberculosis in 1847.Warren County Cemeteries, Volume 1, Book 9. Quinby moved to Berwick shortly after Allen's death to begin his mercantile business, and met Mary Pearce, whom he married in 1848. He had five more children, bringing the total to eight. In 1866, Quinby decided to build a larger home than the others he had owned in Monmouth. Quinby set aside a plot of land on the corner of East Euclid and North 6th Street, which he had surveyed as early as 1862. He contacted noted Chicago architect John C. Cochrane, who designed a large two-story Italianate-Greek Revival mansion, now known as the Ivory Quinby House. The Quinby family deeded the estate to Monmouth College in 1965, under the condition that it be returned if the college no longer sees use for it. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is currently the residence of the college President. ==References== * Genealogical History of the Quinby (Quimby) Family in England and America ‚Äì Henry Cole Quinby, Tuttle Company, Rutland, Vermont, 1915 * Railroads and Warren County ‚Äì Thomas Best, Warren County Historical Society, Page 15 ==External links== *Department.monm.edu Category:1817 births Category:1869 deaths Category:People from Buxton, Maine Category:Colby College alumni Category:19th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:Monmouth College Category:People from Monmouth, Illinois Category:Businesspeople from Illinois Category:Mayors of places in Illinois Category:Illinois city council members Category:Illinois state court judges ","title":"Ivory Quinby"},{"id":"42003061","text":"Arthur Ronald Marks (August 2, 1927 ‚Äì November 13, 2019) was an American film and television director, writer, producer and distributor best known for his work in the blaxploitation genre, directing films such as Bonnie's Kids, Detroit 9000, Friday Foster, Bucktown, The Monkey Hu$tle and J.

He worked as an assistant director on 15 episodes of Perry Mason, and, starting in the middle of the first season, began working as a director. He would go on to direct 76 episodes of the series, and eventually worked as the producer as well. Following the conclusion of Perry Mason, Marks began to move into feature films, beginning with 1970's independently distributed Togetherness starring George Hamilton and Peter Lawford. Following that film, he directed Bonnie's Kids, building on his previous model of independent distribution to turn the film into a lucrative drive-in success. Successful serial-killer films The Centerfold Girls (which he produced but did not direct) and The Roommates followed, as Marks began exploiting a lack of studio pictures and a strong market for more exploitation films in the drive-in circuit. In the 2010 documentary short, Arthur's Kids, Marks explains that major Hollywood Studios tended to dismiss the drive-in circuit and refused to allow their films to be shown there, creating an opportunity for smaller independent distributors to build a business model based on supplying the drive-ins with cheaply produced, titillating fare. To capitalize on this market, Marks formed GFC (General Film Corporation), an independent distributor through which he produced and distributed his own early films as well as other cult fare (including Guerdon Trueblood's The Candy Snatchers, among others).The Candy Snatchers (1974) Cast and Production. The New York Times His positive experience working with actor Alex Rocco on Bonnie's Kids led Marks to cast Rocco in Detroit 9000, a gritty crime story which also featured Hari Rhodes and Scatman Crothers. The film was written by Academy- Award Nominee Orville H. Hampton (who had worked with Marks previously on episodes of Perry Mason) and shot in Detroit, featuring numerous local personalities and landmarks. It was a financial success upon its release in 1973, but remained little-remembered until director Quentin Tarantino championed it decades later, re-releasing it theatrically through his short- lived Rolling Thunder Pictures in 1998, and on video in 1999.Staff report (April 9, 1999). New Video Releases. The New York Times Tarantino also incorporated a line of dialogue from the film into the soundtrack for his own Jackie Brown. Along with his theatrical output in 1973, Marks also made a return to television, directing two episodes of The New Perry Mason, a revival of the character Marks had begun his directorial career working with (now played by Monte Markham instead of Raymond Burr). The series was short-lived, ending mid-season after only 15 episodes. Marks's next film, 1975's Bucktown, starring Fred Williamson and Pam Grier, found considerable financial success and established Marks as a director in the Blaxploitation genre. It attracted the attention of James Nicholson and Samuel Arkoff's American International Pictures, which distributed the picture and subsequently distributed most of Mark's later films. Following the success of Bucktown, Marks acquired the rights to the comic strip Friday Foster, adapting it into a 1975 film starring Pam Grier. The script, co-written with Hampton, adds themes of black political unity into a more traditional mystery structure. He then moved on to the blaxploitation/horror film J.D.'s Revenge and the ensemble comedy The Monkey Hu$tle (which starred Yaphet Kotto and featured Rudy Ray Moore), both in 1976. Following his work in film, Marks moved back to television, directing numerous episodes of Mannix, Starsky & Hutch, The Dukes of Hazardand \\"I Spy\\", as well as working to develop several new TV series with CBS, none of which never came to fruition. Marks also was called upon to \\"Doctor\\" a number of feature films that needed a reshoot, or a rewrite or a professional approach. He died at his home in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles on November 13, 2019. ==Legacy== Quentin Tarantino's 1998 re-release of Detroit 9000 garnered positive reviews. The New York Times critic Lawrence Van Gelder claimed \\"In general release, Detroit 9000 illustrates the wisdom of the adage \\"better late than never,\\" and praised the film's complex racial politics,Van Gelder, Lawrence (October 9, 1998). FILM REVIEW; Detective Buddies and Racial Boundaries. The New York Times while the A.V. Club's Nathan Rabin opined that, while the film was flawed, it was also an \\"interesting, thoroughly watchable film, and considering its genre and origins, that's something of an achievement.\\" Marks's work in Blaxploitation has led several scholars of the genre to examine his films at length, including Mikel J. Koven in his 2010 book Blaxploitation Films and Yvonne D. Sims in her 2006 book Women of Blaxploitation: How the Black Action Film Heroine Changed American Popular Culture. Critic David W. Steece Jr. has noted that Marks's films are distinct from other Blaxploitation fare due to their unusual focus on character and frequent ensemble structure which seems to regard an entire community as the focus of the film, rather than a single main character. He points out that, a \\"lack of agency characterizes most of Marks‚Äôs leads. The people with the most screen time in his films are always at the whim of off-screen forces that are typically the real heart of the story.\\" Black Dynamite star and co-writer Michael Jai White has cited Marks's 1976 The Monkey Hu$tle as a major influence, telling the Los Angeles Times, \\"It was just brash, unlike anything I'd ever seen... I remember these bigger-than-life characters, who reminded me of my uncles, and it was the first time I saw anything familiar in my life on the big screen.\\" ==Filmography== *1970: Togetherness *1972: Class of '74 *1973: Bonnie's Kids *1973: The Roommates *1973: Detroit 9000 *1974: The Centerfold Girls *1975: Linda Lovelace for President (Executive Producer) *1975: Bucktown *1975: A Woman for All Men *1975: Friday Foster *1976: J.

Upon its release, it received positive reviews from music critics who praised the visuals included complete with the accompanying choreography.\\"Review: Versatile Friedman proves he deserves a following\\". TribLIVE.com.\\"Destiny‚Äôs Child - The Video Anthology\\". EDGE Atlanta, GA. However, one writer felt the album was incomplete and argued that many videos were omitted from the track listing. ==Background and release== The album was announced via a press release on Destiny's Child's website on April 16, 2013. It was released through Music World Entertainment, Columbia Records, and Legacy Recordings, and was the group's third record release with the latter. Destiny's Child Video Anthology contained sixteen music videos for fourteen songs filmed throughout the band's music career. It was produced by Akil Brown with members Beyonc√©, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams as well as their manager Mathew Knowles serving as executive producers. All the featured videos are presented in an aspect ratio ‚Äì 1.33:1.

For the release, Destiny's Child partnered with the website TheDrop.fm on May 21, 2013 which offered a prize pack to its readers featuring the album, two T-shirts and the group's tourbook. Jet magazine also organized a contest on its official website offering to give away five copies of the DVD. A similar contest was organized on Juicy magazines official website, offering five copies from the album to five of its readers. To further promote the album, the group was featured on the R&B; division of the Vevo channel at YouTube on June 4, 2013.

In Japan, Destiny's Child Video Anthology was released on June 26, 2013. ==Reception== Gregory Heaney from the website AllMusic positively reviewed the video album, writing, \\"[it] combines the group's considerable vocal talents with their amazing choreography, delivering the total Destiny's Child package as a video greatest-hits compilation\\". Jacob Rohn from the website Black Entertainment Television (BET) felt that \\"While each later became a star in their own right, Destiny's Child as a group was known for their edgy and visually magnetic videos\\". He further finished his review by writing, \\"Destiny's Child Video Anthology is a must-have for any DC fan and anyone that misses the time when music videos were at their peak.\\" A writer of ABC News Radio similarly noted that the album was created for \\"fans who studied all their moves\\" and remember the choreography. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly felt the album was the most \\"indulgent\\" memory trip to the period of the late-1990s and early-2000s memory lane. He further described the videos as \\"gaudy, stupid fun\\". However, a more mixed review came from The Morton Report writer Chaz Lipp who felt that the album was incomplete and noted that eight other videos from the group's videography were not released. He remarked that the unreleased videos for the songs, most notably the ones from the holiday album 8 Days of Christmas could have been included as bonus selections. Lipp concluded that Destiny's Child Video Anthology \\"hits its peak with the group's best single, the irresistibly funky 'Bootylicious'\\". == Track listing Credits and personnel== Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes. *A&R; ‚Äì Henry Towns *Art direction, design ‚Äì Rob Carter *Project direction ‚Äì Tara Master *Executive producer ‚Äì Beyonc√© Knowles, Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, Mathew Knowles *Authoring ‚Äì Mike Nack *Front cover photography ‚Äì Daniel Moss *Record producer ‚Äì Akil Brown *Product manager ‚Äì Tim Anderson *Featured artists ‚Äì Wyclef Jean, Missy Elliott, T.I., Lil Wayne ==NotesReferencesBibliography=== * ===Further reading=== * ==External links== *Destiny's Child Vevo page on YouTube featuring their music videos Category:2013 albums Category:2013 video albums Category:Destiny's Child video albums ","title":"Destiny's Child Video Anthology"},{"id":"42003425","text":"Jugin (, also Romanized as J≈´gƒ´n and Jowgƒ´n; also known as J≈´gan and Jowgan) is a village in Kahir Rural District, in the Central District of Konarak County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

She gained prominence reporting for the influential newspaper Ta Kung Pao during the Second Sino- Japanese War, and was considered one of the top four female journalists in China. After the Communist victory in China she served as Premier Zhou Enlai's secretary and later Deputy Chief Editor of the People's Daily. She committed suicide in October 1957, after being forced to persecute her colleagues during the Anti-Rightist Campaign, although the exact reason for her suicide remains undetermined. ==Early life and education== Yang was born in Pingxiang, Jiangxi province, one of 11 children in a family of Xiantao, Hubei ancestry. Her father was a high-ranking politician who served as governor of Jiangxi and Hubei provinces. Her name at birth was Yang Jizheng (). In 1922 Yang attended Baoling Girls' School in Nanchang, an American missionary school. In 1927 she entered Yenching University in Beijing, studying English literature. In Beijing she joined the Communist Party of China, and met Zheng Kan (), a student at Peking University. After graduating from university, Yang married Zheng Kan and gave birth to a daughter . She quit the Communist Party due to a dispute with her superior, but continued to participate in underground communist activities. ==Career== In 1933 Yang moved to Shanghai, where she joined the League of Left-Wing Writers and befriended American journalist Agnes Smedley. Later that year she returned to Yenching University at the invitation of Edgar Snow, who translated one of Yang's novels into English. In 1935 Yang Gang translated Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice into Chinese, which was published by the Commercial Press. In 1936, Yang and her husband worked together for the Popular Knowledge magazine () run by the historian Gu Jiegang. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937 and the Japanese invasion of China, Yang Gang rejoined the Communist Party and the anti-Japanese resistance. Due to differences between Yang and her husband, the couple divorced. Yang joined the influential newspaper Ta Kung Pao, which retreated south to Hong Kong, while Zheng Kan went to Fujian province. In 1943, Zheng was killed in a Japanese bombing raid in Yong'an, Fujian. In Hong Kong, Yang worked as a reporter for the Ta Kung Pao. After Hong Kong also fell to the Japanese in 1941, Yang evacuated with the newspaper to Guilin, Guangxi. In 1944 she was sent by the newspaper to the United States as its correspondent, until she returned to China in 1948. From 1945 to 1947 she enrolled at Radcliffe College of Harvard University, studying art. During her time in America she wrote an autobiographical novel called Daughter in English as well as creating reports on contemporary American life. These reports covered subjects including the search for undercover communists and racism, and were published as a collection in 1951. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Yang worked as Premier Zhou Enlai's secretary, and became Deputy Chief Editor of the People's Daily in 1955. ==Suicide== When the Anti-Rightist Campaign began in 1957, Yang Gang was appointed the number three leader of the \\"Anti-Rightist Leadership Group\\" of the People's Daily. She was forced to participate in the persecution of many of her colleagues and friends who had been labelled \\"rightists\\". On October 7, Yang committed suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills. The reason for her suicide is undetermined. According to Hu Qiaomu, it was because she lost a notebook where she recorded her thoughts which she feared would lead to her being sought by the anti-rightist campaign. According to John K. Fairbank, who knew her personally, she committed suicide because of a serious injury sustained in a car accident. This view is disputed by Yang's colleagues and personal friends Xiao Qian and Ye Yao, who noted that her suicide occurred two days after she took part in the criticism session of the famous woman writer Ding Ling, and that she had just been stripped of her status as a representative to the National People's Congress, along with Feng Xuefeng, which made headline news in October 1957. ==Legacy== A first draft of Yang Gang's autobiographical novel Daughter was published in 1988 by the Beijing Foreign Languages service in English and a Chinese translation by the People's Publishing House was published under the title Tiaozhan. ==References== Category:1905 births Category:1957 deaths Category:Chinese women journalists Category:Writers from Jiangxi Category:Suicides in the People's Republic of China Category:People from Pingxiang Category:Yenching University alumni Category:Radcliffe College alumni Category:Republic of China translators Category:People's Republic of China translators Category:Chinese women novelists Category:20th-century Chinese women writers Category:20th-century translators Category:20th-century novelists Category:Female suicides Category:Victims of the Anti-Rightist Campaign ","title":"Yang Gang (journalist)"},{"id":"42003659","text":"Arctostaphylos pringlei (common name Pringle manzanita) is a plant that grows at elevations between 4000 and 7000 ft in southern California, Arizona, and southwest Utah.

It had a population of 3903 in . ==Geography== The town is located on the south bank of the Pioneer River approximately west of Mackay. The river forms part of the northern boundary. In the east is Mount Vince which remains vegetated. Surrounding the town is farmland, mostly growing sugar cane, which is serviced by a network of rail lines. These lines lead to the Marian Mill which was constructed in 1885. ==History== The town name Marian comes from the name of the (now closed) Marian railway station, which in turn reportedly derived its name from a local property called Mary Ann. Marian Mill Post Office opened by 1 January 1909 (a receiving office had been open from 1886) and was renamed Marian in 1910. In December 1882, Helen Porter Mitchell (later Dame Nellie Melba) married Charles Armstrong, the manager of the Marian Sugar Mill. A house was built for them beside the mill. It was not a happy marriage as they separated in December 1883.

Nicknamed \\"The Arch of Dimes,\\" he has represented Italy in international competition. He attended Neshaminy High School, where he averaged 20.4 points and 5.6 rebounds per game as a junior to lead Neshaminy to the PIAA playoffs. As a freshman at Villanova, he was named to the Big East Conference All-Rookie Team. Arcidiacono, as a junior, was co- winner of the conference's Player of the Year award. As part of Villanova's 2016 National Championship team, Arcidiacono was awarded the Most Outstanding Player award and assisted on the game-winning basket to Kris Jenkins as time expired in the National Championship. ==Early life== Arcidiacono was born on March 26, 1994, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He has three older siblings, Sabrina, Nicole, Michael; and younger twin siblings, Christopher and Courtney. His parents, Joe and Patti Arcidiacono, met at Villanova University, where Joe was an offensive lineman on the football team. When he was young, his father installed a 6-foot plastic hoop in the family living room. Arcidiacono would often practice shooting jump shots and hitting layups on the small hoop before progressing to an actual basketball court. At one AAU game, Arcidiacono scored 50 points. At another, he hit eight three-pointers in a row. When he was in 7th grade at a basketball camp, Villanova coach Jay Wright said he would one day play for the Wildcats. Growing up, his favorite athletes were the 76ers' Allen Iverson and the Eagles' Brian Dawkins. In eighth grade, Arcidiacono trained with former Penn State player Ben Luber. ==High school career== Arcidiacono attended Neshaminy High School, where he was coached by Jerry Devine. Arcidiacono led the team to a PIAA Class AAAA tournament as a sophomore. In a playoff game against Bartram High School, he tallied a triple- double of 26 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists. He averaged 18 points per game and was named to the Class AAAA second team. At the end of his sophomore season, Arcidiacono travelled with his AAU team, the PA Playaz, to North Carolina for the Bob Gibbons Tournament of Champions. In the first game of the tournament, he crashed into the floor face-first, an injury that required eight stitches. Despite the advice of doctors, he decided to play in the following game, and responded with 35 points. He continued to score at the same pace for the remainder of the tournament, and major college programs took notice. Arcidiacono received recruiting offers from Syracuse, Florida, Texas, and Villanova, among others. In October 2010, after attending Villanova's Hoops Mania event, he committed to play for the Villanova Wildcats. As a junior, Arcidiacono guided Neshaminy to a 22‚Äì7 record while averaging 20.4 points, 5.6 rebounds, 5.0 assists, and 2.2 steals. He surpassed the 1,000 point mark in a game against Pennsbury, scoring 29 points in an 83‚Äì52 win. The Neshaminy Redskins reached the state quarterfinals in 2011 before losing to Penn Wood. At the conclusion of his junior season, he was named the Bucks County Courier Times player of the year. The Philadelphia Inquirer selected him to the first-team all-Southeastern Pennsylvania. He began to feel pain in his lower back shortly after the end of his junior season. In May 2011, while attending a basketball camp at the Deron Williams Academy in Chicago, Arcidiacono complained of poor mobility and soreness. He was diagnosed with a herniated disk in his back, forcing him to miss his senior season. Arcidiacono had surgery to repair the disk on December 21, and he could not leave his house for two weeks thereafter. Arcidiacono finished his career at Neshaminy High School as the program's all-time leading scorer. He tallied 1,498 points, 449 rebounds, 378 assists, 178 steals, and 160 three-pointers.

Arcidiacono garnered his first Big East rookie of the week honors on November 18, after an 18-point six-assist performance in an overtime win against Purdue. He was again named Big East rookie of the week on December 31 after a 17-point performance against NJIT. He had a career-high 32 points on January 2, 2013, to propel Villanova to a 98‚Äì86 overtime victory over St. John's. This performance earned Arcidiacono Big East rookie of the week honors for the week of January 6. In the January 26 contest against third-ranked Syracuse, Arcidiacono made a 3-pointer with 2.2 seconds remaining in regulation to tie the game at 61. The Wildcats ended up defeating Syracuse in overtime 75‚Äì71. Arcidiacono earned his fourth rookie of the week honors in the last week of the regular season.

Seven days later, he was acquired by the Austin Spurs of the NBA Development League as an affiliate of San Antonio. For the 2017‚Äì18 season, Arcidiacono originally signed with the Italian team Juvecaserta Basket. However, on July 14, 2017, it was announced that Juvecaserta would not be accepted in Serie A, as it was rejected by Com.Tec. (Commission of control on the companies' financial statements).

It used computer vision to enable mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to detect their position relative to the world around them without using GPS or other external signals. This allowed application developers to create user experiences that include indoor navigation, 3D mapping, physical space measurement, environmental recognition, augmented reality, and windows into a virtual world. The first product to emerge from ATAP, Tango was developed by a team led by computer scientist Johnny Lee, a core contributor to Microsoft's Kinect. In an interview in June 2015, Lee said, \\"We're developing the hardware and software technologies to help everything and everyone understand precisely where they are, anywhere.\\" Google produced two devices to demonstrate the Tango technology: the Peanut phone and the Yellowstone 7-inch tablet. More than 3,000 of these devices had been sold as of June 2015, chiefly to researchers and software developers interested in building applications for the platform. In the summer of 2015, Qualcomm and Intel both announced that they were developing Tango reference devices as models for device manufacturers who use their mobile chipsets. At CES, in January 2016, Google announced a partnership with Lenovo to release a consumer smartphone during the summer of 2016 to feature Tango technology marketed at consumers, noting a less than $500 price-point and a small form factor below 6.5 inches. At the same time, both companies also announced an application incubator to get applications developed to be on the device on launch. On 15 December 2017, Google announced that they would be ending support for Tango on March 1, 2018, in favor of ARCore. == Overview == Tango was different from other contemporary 3D-sensing computer vision products, in that it was designed to run on a standalone mobile phone or tablet and was chiefly concerned with determining the device's position and orientation within the environment. The software worked by integrating three types of functionality: * Motion-tracking: using visual features of the environment, in combination with accelerometer and gyroscope data, to closely track the device's movements in space * Area learning: storing environment data in a map that can be re-used later, shared with other Tango devices, and enhanced with metadata such as notes, instructions, or points of interest * Depth perception: detecting distances, sizes, and surfaces in the environment Together, these generate data about the device in \\"six degrees of freedom\\" (3 axes of orientation plus 3 axes of position) and detailed three-dimensional information about the environment. Project Tango was also the first project to graduate from Google X in 2012 Applications on mobile devices use Tango's C and Java APIs to access this data in real time. In addition, an API was also provided for integrating Tango with the Unity game engine; this enabled the conversion or creation of games that allow the user to interact and navigate in the game space by moving and rotating a Tango device in real space. These APIs were documented on the Google developer website.https://developers.google.com/project-tango/ Google developer website. == Applications == Tango enabled apps to track a device's position and orientation within a detailed 3D environment, and to recognize known environments. This allowed the creations of applications such as in- store navigation, visual measurement and mapping utilities, presentation and design tools, and a variety of immersive games. At Augmented World Expo 2015,http://augmentedworldexpo.com/ Augmented World Expo 2015 Johnny Lee demonstrated a construction game that builds a virtual structure in real space, an AR showroom app that allows users to view a full-size virtual automobile and customize its features, a hybrid Nerf gun with mounted Tango screen for dodging and shooting AR monsters superimposed on reality, and a multiplayer VR app that lets multiple players converse in a virtual space where their avatar movements match their real-life movements. Tango apps are distributed through Play. Google has encouraged the development of more apps with hackathons, an app contest, and promotional discounts on the development tablet. == Devices == As a platform for software developers and a model for device manufacturers, Google created two Tango devices. === The Peanut phone === \\"Peanut\\" was the first production Tango device, released in the first quarter of 2014. It was a small Android phone with a Qualcomm MSM8974 quad- core processor and additional special hardware including a fisheye motion camera, \\"RGB-IR\\" camera for color image and infrared depth detection, and Movidius Vision processing units. A high-performance accelerometer and gyroscope were added after testing several competing models in the MARS lab at the University of Minnesota. Several hundred Peanut devices were distributed to early-access partners including university researchers in computer vision and robotics, as well as application developers and technology startups. Google stopped supporting the Peanut device in September 2015, as by then the Tango software stack had evolved beyond the versions of Android that run on the device. === The Yellowstone tablet === Google's Project Tango tablet, 2014 \\"Yellowstone\\" was a 7-inch tablet with full Tango functionality, released in June 2014, and sold as the Project Tango Tablet Development Kit. It featured a 2.3 GHz quad-core Nvidia Tegra K1 processor, 128GB flash memory, 1920x1200-pixel touchscreen, 4MP color camera, fisheye-lens (motion-tracking) camera, an IR projector with RGB-IR camera for integrated depth sensing, and 4G LTE connectivity. As of May 27, 2017, the Tango tablet is considered officially unsupported by Google.  Testing by NASA  In May 2014, two Peanut phones were delivered to the International Space Station to be part of a NASA project to develop autonomous robots that navigate in a variety of environments, including outer space. The soccer-ball-sized, 18-sided polyhedral SPHERES robots were developed at the NASA Ames Research Center, adjacent to the Google campus in Mountain View, California. Andres Martinez, SPHERES manager at NASA, said \\"We are researching how effective [Tango's] vision-based navigation abilities are for performing localization and navigation of a mobile free flyer on ISS. === Intel RealSense smartphone === Announced at Intel's Developer Forum in August 2015, and offered to public through a Developer Kit since January 2016. It incorporated a RealSense ZR300 camera which had optical features required for Tango, such as the fisheye camera.Intel Realsense ZR300 Product Datasheet === Lenovo Phab 2 Pro === Lenovo Phab 2 Pro was the first commercial smartphone with the Tango Technology, the device was announced at the beginning of 2016, launched in August, and available for purchase in the US in November. The Phab 2 Pro had a 6.4 inch screen, a Snapdragon 652 processor, and 64 GB of internal storage, with a rear facing 16 Megapixels camera and 8 MP front camera. === Asus Zenfone AR === Asus Zenfone AR, announced at CES 2017,ASUS announcement at CES 2017 -YouTube was the second commercial smartphone with the Tango Technology. It ran Tango AR & Daydream VR on Snapdragon 821, with 6GB or 8GB of RAM and 128 or 256GB of internal memory depending on the configuration. == Collaborators and partners == In creating Project Tango, Google collaborated with developers in nine countries and several organizations including Bosch, Bsquare, CompalComm, ETH Zurich, Flyby Media, George Washington University, MMSolutions, Movidius, University of Minnesota MARS Lab,http://mars.cs.umn.edu/ University of Minnesota MARS Lab JPL Computer Vision Group,https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/groups/ComputerVision JPL Computer Vision Group OLogic, OmniVision, Open Source Robotics Foundation, Paracosm, Sunny Optical Technology, PMD Technologies, Mantis Vision, Prizmiq, Intermodalics and SagivTech.

Its chemical structure was determined by X-ray crystallography in 1979 and absolute stereochemistry by total synthesis. Two closely related derivatives, oudemansin B and X have also been isolated from other basidiomycetes. They are all biologically active against many filamentous fungi and yeasts but with insufficient potency and stability to become useful commercial products. However, their discovery, together with the strobilurins led to agricultural fungicides including azoxystrobin with the same mechanism of action. ==Isolation and Characterization== Oudemansins A, B and X O. mucida on a beech trunk Oudemansin A (initially known simply as oudemansin) with R1 = R2 = H was first described in 1979, after being isolated from mycelial fermentations of the basidiomycete fungus Oudemansiella mucida. Its structure, including the relative configuration of the methoxy and adjacent methyl groups, was established by both spectroscopic methods and single crystal X-ray analysis but its absolute stereochemistry was at that time undetermined. Later it was found in cultures of the basidiomycete fungi Mycena polygramma and Xerula melanotricha. The latter fungus also produces oudemansin B, with R1 = MeO and R2 = Cl. Oudemansin X, with R1 = H and R2 = MeO was isolated from Oudemansiella radicata. ==Chemical synthesis== The oudemansins have been targets for total synthesis and in 1983, the synthesis of (-)-oudemansin A established that all three compounds have the (9S,10S)-configuration. Routes to oudemansins B and X have also been reported. ==Mechanism of action as fungicides== The fungicidal effects were shown to stem from what was then a novel mode of action, QoI inhibition. This was related to the Œ≤-methoxyacrylic acid sub-structure which this and related natural products, the strobilurins have in common. Intensive research by several agrochemical companies led to the development of useful agricultural fungicides based on the same mode of action, of which azoxystrobin is a typical example. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * Category:Fungicides Category:Methyl esters Category:Respiratory toxins Category:Complex III inhibitors ","title":"Oudemansin A"},{"id":"42003951","text":"Translational neuroscience is the field of study which applies basic neuroscience research to translate or develop into clinical applications and novel therapies for nervous system disorders.Translational Neuroscience, University of Chicago Translational NeuroscienceDe Gruyter The field encompasses areas such as deep brain stimulation, brain machine interfaces, neurorehabilitation and the development of devices for the sensory nervous system such as the use of auditory implants, retinal implants, and electronic skins. == Classification == Translational neuroscience research is categorized into stages of research, which are classified using a five tier system (T0-T4), beginning with basic science research and ending with the public health applications of basic scientific discoveries. While once considered a linear progression from basic science to public health application, translational research, and translational neuroscience in particular, is now regarded as a cyclic, where public health needs inform basic science research, which then works to discover the mechanisms of public health issues and works towards clinical and public health implementation. The stages of translational neuroscience research are as follows: * T0: Basic science research * T1: Preclinical research * T2: Clinical research or Clinical neuroscience * T3: Clinical implementation * T4: Public health == Methods  Electrophysiology === Electrophysiology is used within translational neuroscience as a means of studying the electric properties of neurons in animal models as well as to investigate the properties of human neurological dysfunction. Techniques used in animal models, such as patch-clamp recordings, have been used to investigate how neurons respond to pharmacological agents. Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are both used to measure electrical activity in the human brain, and can be used in clinical settings to localize the source of neurological dysfunction in conditions such as epilepsy, and can also be used in a research setting to investigate the differences in electrical activity in the brain between normal and neurologically dysfunctional individuals. === Neuroimaging === An fMRI scanner. Neuroimaging comprises a variety of techniques used to observe the activity or the structures of, or within, the nervous system. Positron emission tomography (PET) has been used in animal models, such as non-human primate and rodent, to identify and target molecular mechanisms of neurological disease, and to study the neurological impact of pharmacological drug addiction. Similarly, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to investigate the neurological mechanisms of pharmacological drug addiction, the neurological mechanisms of mood and anxiety disorders in elderly populations, and the neurological mechanisms of disorders such as schizophrenia. === Gene therapy === Gene therapy is the delivery of nucleic acid as a treatment for a disorder. In translational neuroscience, gene therapy is the delivery of nucleic acid as a treatment for a neurological disorder. Gene therapy has been proven effective at treating a variety of disorders, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), in rodent and non-human primate models, and in humans, via the application of neurotrophic factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glial cell line- derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and via the application of enzymes such as glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), which commonly use adeno-associated viruses (AAV) as a vector. === Stem cells === Stem cells, particularly induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), are utilized in translational neuroscience research as not only a treatment for nervous system disorders, but also as the source for models of neural dysfunction. For example, due to the central nervous system's limited regenerative abilities, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), a type of pluripotent stem cell, has been used as a replacement for damaged neurons, a novel approach that involves the surgical transplantation of fetal stem cells == Applications  Neurodevelopmental disorders === Neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized as disorders where the development of the nervous system was disrupted, and encompasses disorders such as learning disabilities, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), epilepsy, and certain neuromuscular disorders. Translational neuroscience research involves efforts to uncover the molecular mechanisms for these disorders and work towards cures in patient populations. Additionally, translational neuroscience research has focused on elucidating the cause of neurodevelopmental disorders, whether it be genetic, environmental, or a combination of both, as well as tactics for prevention, if possible. === Neurodegenerative disorders === Neurodegenerative disorders are a result of neuronal loss of function over time which lead to cell death. Examples of neurodegenerative disorders include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. The focus of translational neuroscience research is to investigate the molecular mechanisms for these disorders, and to investigate the mechanisms of drug delivery to treat these disorders, including an investigation into the impact of the blood-brain barrier on drug delivery, and the role of the body's immune system in neurodegenerative disorders. == See also == * Translational medicine == References == Category:Neuroscience ","title":"Translational neuroscience"},{"id":"42003980","text":"Commelina polhillii is a plant species native to Tanzania, known only from the Iriniga and Mpanda Districts.

It employs \\"very smooth\\" side-scrolling (termed 'Scrollerama') and imperfect vertical scrolling. Play includes climbing ladders, which are sufficiently wide to simplify this aspect of gameplay. Various objects can be found and used to solve problems. These include everyday items, furniture, specialist equipment and valuables. Other characters include guards, animals, a witch and the wizard. Control is via the keyboard, with 13 keys having various uses, for example accessing the inventory of objects carried in the backpack, viewing off-screen to left/right. Play requires both dexterity and lateral thinking. A saved game facility is not provided. Scores are awarded based on progression through the game. Upon completion, additional rewards are given for remaining lives and a bonus is awarded according to elapsed time. An expert player may complete the game in \\"around seven minutes\\". == Development == The game was reported as being programmer Tony Sothcott's first machine code game. Its colours are achieved using , requiring more than half of total available RAM. The map is made up from screens comprising blocks, there being 13 different types of such block. Two adjacent blocks are stored as a single byte within the map data, which occupies in total. This technique was noted for its ingenuity. === Marketing === The game was marketed as \\"Probably the most challenging game ever devised for the BBC Micro.\\" The publishers offered small cash prizes to those completing the game within three months of purchase. They also announced a future competition between the four highest scorers, with a prize of computer equipment worth ¬£500. The game's retail price (cassette ¬£12.95, disk ¬£14.95) was noted as being \\"not cheap\\" but nevertheless worthy. Self-styled \\"marketing expert\\" Chris Payne (at that time a recent graduate employed by Micro Power as a marketing assistant) recalls his memory of Sothcott's game being \\"terrific\\". Micro Power did not commission the marketing from any of their usual agents, instead appointing new agency Kidd's of Leeds. This agency devised a \\"nicely done logo\\" on a simple black background. == Reception == The game was listed as a 'star game' in a 1985 review in Personal Computer News (PCN) and was featured in an illustrated double-page spread in the issue of Acorn User (AU). PCN Reviewer Bryan Skinner noted that the programmer had developed \\"something really special\\", with both publications noting the \\"clever\\" use of colourful graphics, but little use of sound, possibly due to lack of available RAM. AU reviewer Bruce Smith noted the hardware scrolling as being the \\"best ... yet\\" on the platform. Skinner was of the opinion that Castle Quest was \\"the best arcade game\\" on the BBC Micro and would qualify as \\"the best game\\" were it not for the existence of Elite. He called for readers to join him in demanding that Micro Power convert the game for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. The AU feature was justified (while acknowledging the earlier March review) by the opinion that the game represented a landmark in game development, both on the BBC Micro and other platforms. Micro Power's software development manager Alan Butcher tested and completed the game before release. Marketing assistant Chris Payne recalled that staff predicted the game to be a bestseller. == References == Category:1985 video games Category:BBC Micro and Acorn Electron games Category:BBC Micro and Acorn Electron-only games Category:Metroidvania games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"Castle Quest (1985 video game)"},{"id":"42004185","text":"Jefferson Lopes Faustino, commonly known as Jefferson (born 31 August 1988 in Rio de Janeiro) is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a centre back.

At , the park boasts a variety of trails for hikers, including easy, intermediate, and challenging. The trails are colour-coded and range from to . Bikes and dogs are allowed on select trails. Lynn Headwaters is also home to the BC Mills House, which is a small building near the entrance of the park. The BC Mills House offers information and visual depictions of the natural history and industrial history of the area, including kinds of animals that inhabit the forest and locations of previous mines and logging camps. ==Ecology== The park is covered in dense temperate rainforest that houses a wide array of organisms. Like the neighbouring Lynn Canyon Park, Lynn Headwaters is a second growth forest. Cedar stumps can be seen throughout the park, reminding visitors of old logging practices. Western red cedar stump Lynn Headwaters is situated in Lynn Valley Park on the North Shore of Vancouver. Lynn Headwaters sits between two peaks; on one side, the park area is closer to Mount Fromme, and on the other side is Mount Seymour. The temperate rainforest experiences moderate temperatures, plenty of rainfall, and a mild climate that is suitable for growth of large coniferous trees and shade-loving shrubs and ferns. On average per year, the park receives around of rain, which contributes to the forest's cool and moist quality. The most common coniferous trees in the forests are western red cedar, western hemlock, Douglas fir and sitka spruce. Red alder, black cottonwood, vine maple and broadleaf maple are deciduous trees that also inhabit the forest. Additionally, ground hugging flora are present, including some mosses and ferns, salmonberry, Oregon grape and salal. left Lynn Headwaters is the habitat for a diversity of fauna. Some mammals include squirrels, raccoons, mice, and deer. Amphibians and insects include the salamander, mayfly, caddisfly and stonefly. Also, some birds that are present are red-breasted sapsuckers, winter wrens, owls, crows, chickadees and northern flickers. ==History== Much of the original woody vegetation inhabiting the Lynn Headwaters area has been logged. In 1863, the first lumber mill began operation and cleared most of the old growth trees. Remnants of these giants can be found in old, sizeable stumps. After this logging, of cleared land was donated to the district of North Vancouver with the intention to encourage people to purchase real estate. The district also contributed to supplement the project. In 1991, the district again added of land to the park making it the largest in North Vancouver. ==Conservation== Lynn Headwaters is just off of the Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve (LSCR) area. The Rice Lake trail, which can be accessed from the Lynn Headwaters entrance runs through a part of the conservation reserve. The LSCR is and contains a diversity of landscapes: forested slopes, river flood plains and alpine meadows. Since 1908, the Seymour river has been used as a water supply. It has also been used by gold miners, hunters, farmers and fishermen. Until 1994 with the ceasing of logging, watershed land has since been used as a water treatment, storage, and delivery facility. Currently, it is used for educational purposes that emphasize environmentally notable land management practices. ==Trails== Lynn Valley Regional Park offers a variety of hiking trails ranging in difficulty. Near BC Mills House, a number of picnic tables are available and separate male and female outhouse washroom facilities. Across the bridge over the creek, an information board describes trail conditions and shows a map of the trails. From this place, hikers can access the Varley Trail, the Lynn Valley Loop Trail, and the Lynn Peak Trail. Other trails require walking along one of the previous hikes initially until a trail marker indicates another route option. Also accessible from the parking lot are the Baden Powell Trail towards Grouse Mountain and Rice Lake within the Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve. Signs guide hikers to be cautionary on certain trails left ===Varley Trail=== The Varley Trail takes hikers south along the creek . The trail is named after Frederick Varley, one of the famed Group of Seven (artists). This trail is only gently sloped in some sections and is deemed appropriate for all hiking levels. Dogs are allowed on this trail. ===Lynn Valley Loop Trail=== The Lynn Loop Trail is an estimated 1.5-hour trail, with a round trip distance of . This walk guides you along a slight incline adjacent to the fresh water creek, and through the mountains and forest of North Vancouver.

This path parallels the Lynn Creek waters for roughly two kilometers, then loops up into a deeper part the forest with varying steep sections. Nearing the end, the incline returns to normal, bringing hikers back to the bridge area. Halfway Mark at Lynn Roundabout ===Lynn Peak Trail=== The Lynn Peak Trail is a rigorous hike in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park with a distance of 9 km to the summit. The incline is comparable to the popular Grouse Grind up Grouse Mountain. ===Cedars Mill and Lynn Headwaters Trail Loop=== To access the Cedars Mill and Lynn Headwaters Trail Loop, hikers must first walk along the Lynn Valley Loop trail adjacent to the creek until the paths diverge. The trail is eight kilometres long and takes an estimated four hours as a round trip. ===Lynn Lake Trail=== A very challenging hike only recommended to experienced hikers, the Lynn Lake trail is only accessible during summer months when the lake levels are low.

Similar to Lynn Lake Trail, hikers will take the Lynn Valley Loop Trail, continuing onto the Cedars Mill Trail for . Continuing onto the Lynn Headwaters Trail, take a right at the junction for Coliseum Mountain Trail prior to Norvan Falls. This trail requires extensive knowledge of hiking safety and preparation for treacherous conditions. ===Hanes Valley Trail=== Probably the most difficult trail in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park, the Hanes Valley Trail should only be undertaken by experienced and fit hikers. It can be completed in a loop or point-to-point hike to the Grouse Mountain sky-ride (car-drop required). North Shore Rescue saves many people in this area, so be very well prepared on this strenuous route. ==Safety== The park makes efforts to ensure hikers are well prepared for the trails and signs on site offer information about current weather conditions, trail conditions, and proper gear. As well, there is a hiker registration box that allows visitors to sign in and out. Back country trails are much more rugged and are suggested only for the most experienced and prepared hikers. Certain trails are dog-friendly though biking is not allowed. In the summer months, BC Mills House is available to educate hikers on current weather and trail conditions. ==Access== Access to the Lynn Headwaters Park can be done by walking or driving to the end of Lynn Valley Road.

In 2014, he released the country music EP Outlier. ==Personal life== Briley was born in Gallatin, Tennessee to John R. Briley and Tribby Graves. Briley has a large extended family - from his grandparents down, he has around one-hundred- and-twenty relatives. Music has been an important aspect of his family for several generations, especially on his mother's side: his great-grandmother, Kitty Cora Cline, was one of the first female members of the Grand Ole Opry; her daughter, Gladys Cline Graves, wrote songs and poetry, but did not pursue a career, as she had eleven children and chose to focus on raising them instead. From 1975 to 1985, Briley's mother sang and played guitar on a morning T.V. show hosted by Ralph Emery. Several members of Briley's family on his father's side have played guitar, banjo, bass, and fiddle. Briley's father and grandfather, Wesley Briley, were both ministers, and Wesley also owned a farm. Growing up, Briley would often work on the farm with his grandfather, whom he greatly admired. Briley married his wife Courtney (who is a friend and former high school classmate of American Idol season 12 fifth place finalist Janelle Arthur) in June 2013 and was inspired by her to try out for American Idol. Briley began singing at a very young age - his first performance was at a family Christmas party when he was only three years old. He won several talent shows during grade school, and when he was eleven years old, he performed the National Anthem at a Vanderbilt University basketball game. In second grade, Briley was inspired by the devotion that he felt for his younger sister, Mary Meggan, to request that his school observe a special holiday for siblings. The school adopted his idea, and Brothers and Sisters Day spread throughout Tennessee. It was recognized by then-governor Don Sundquist and became an official holiday for the state. Al Gore, who was vice-president at the time, heard about it and told President Bill Clinton, who then designated the third week of November as National Family Week. Later, President George W. Bush also responded to the idea and declared June 2, 2001 as National Child's Day. Briley can play over twelve instruments, including the guitar, piano, banjo, harmonica, and dobro. His primary musical influence is Johnny Cash, and his style encompasses a wide variety of genres, including country, gospel, bluegrass, southern rock, R&B;, and blues. While attending Gallatin High School, Briley was elected student body president. He considered pursuing a career in politics. He joined a musical group called \\"The Performers\\" during high school, and sang with them at various school events, as well as for the Tennessee General Assembly. Although he is a devoted fan of the University of Tennessee's Tennessee Vols, Briley attended Middle Tennessee State University, where he served as an anchor for campus sports and received a degree in broadcasting, marketing, and public relations. He continued to pursue music during college, performing with multiple bands in coffee houses and joining a gospel group called \\"25 Drive\\". He released an album with this group and together, they participated in the National Quartet Convention. ==American Idol== { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !Episode !Theme !Song choice !Original artist !Order !Result - Audition Auditioner's Choice \\"Arms of a Woman\\" Amos Lee N/A Advanced - Hollywood Round, Part 1 A Capella \\"Stars\\" Grace Potter and the Nocturnals N/A Advanced - Hollywood Round, Part 2 Group Performance \\"I Want It That Way\\" with Dexter Roberts and Casey Thrasher Backstreet Boys N/A Advanced - Hollywood Round, Part 3 Solo \\"Stars\\" Grace Potter and the Nocturnals N/A Advanced -  Top 31 (10 Men) Personal Choice \\"Soulshine\\" The Allman Brothers Band 9 Advanced - Top 13 This Is Me \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" Johnny Cash 4 Safe - Top 12 Home \\"Turning Home\\" David Nail 11 Safe - Top 11 Songs from the Cinema \\"Bennie and the Jets\\" Elton John 5 Eliminated } ==Post-Idol career== After his participation on American Idol, Briley released an EP, titled, Outlier, in December 2014. ==DiscographyExtended plays=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" Title ! rowspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\" Details - style=\\"font-size:smaller;\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" Outlier  * Release date: December 11, 2014 * Label: Independent * Formats: CD, music download } ==External links== * Facebook * Twitter ==References== Category:1989 births Category:American male guitarists Category:21st-century American singers Category:American Idol participants Category:American male singers Category:Living people Category:21st-century American guitarists Category:21st-century male singers ","title":"Ben Briley"},{"id":"42004266","text":"This is a list of episodes from the seventh season of Barney Miller. ==Broadcast history== The season originally aired Thursdays at 9:00‚Äì9:30 pm (EST).TV Listings for October 30, 1980TV Listings for May 21, 1981 ==EpisodesReferences== Category:Barney Miller seasons Category:1980 American television seasons Category:1981 American television seasons ","title":"Barney Miller (season 7)"},{"id":"42004268","text":"Curtis \\"CJ\\" Harris (born January 28, 1991) is an American singer from Jasper, Alabama, who finished in sixth place on the thirteenth season of American Idol. His debut single, \\"In Love\\", was released in 2019. ==Early life and career== Raised in Jasper, Alabama, Harris spent his summers working for his grandfather, whom he credits as a mentor. At age eight, he started learning the guitar on a broken one gifted to him from his grandfather; it only had three strings. Harris also plays piano. His earliest music influences include Usher, Keith Sweat, and Darius Rucker. He has also cited Ray LaMontagne, The Allman Brothers Band, John Legend, John Mayer, and Keith Urban as some of his favorite music artists. Harris was in church choir growing up. His singing is mostly self-taught, and his own musical style has been described by AL.com as \\"Earthy roots rock, with blues and country influences.\\" Harris has said that he considers himself to have a style similar to The Civil Wars. The first American Idol audition Harris attended was in 2010. Before placing on the thirteenth season of the series in 2014, he auditioned unsuccessfully for The X-Factor and The Voice. Shortly after reaching the finals on American Idol, he reflected on his mindset going into the season 13 auditions, telling The Hollywood Reporter, \\"I saw they were doing the bus tour and they were going to be 30 minutes down the road from me. I said, 'You know what? I'm going to give it another chance. I've gotten so much better, my voice has matured and my playing has gotten so much better. I'm 23, before you know it I'll be 33 and I want to give it another chance.' \\" At the time of that audition, Harris worked at a barbecue restaurant and had already recorded an album titled Small Town Boy as an independent musician. His father died shortly before Harris made it onto American Idol. ==American Idol== Harris attended the bus tour auditions for American Idols thirteenth season in Tuscaloosa. He then auditioned before the judges in Salt Lake City. His audition performance of \\"Soulshine\\" was well-received, and in response, Keith Urban, a judge that year, said of Harris, \\"You sing 'cause you have to sing, not 'cause you want to sing. And I mean that in the deepest way. And that's why it's so believable and real.\\" For the group rounds, Harris joined with the season's eventual winner, Caleb Johnson for a performance of Alex Clare's \\"Too Close\\". Before advancing to the semi-finals, Harris was one of a few contestants paired together for an impromptu sing-off. Harris was paired with Casey Thrasher, and the judges intended to only put one of them through to the next round. The judges were impressed with both performances however - Harris sang \\"Whipping Post\\" - and both contestants were put through. In the semi-finals, Harris failed to receive enough votes to automatically advance into the finals. He was kept in the competition when the judges chose him as a Wild Card. Critics noted that Harris struggled with pitch in some of his performances. Harris received mostly positive attention for his participation on the series though; Mary Colurso of AL.com wrote that Harris was well-liked on the series for his \\"real-deal authenticity and good-guy appeal\\", while Maura Johnston of Vulture called Harris \\"a blast of charisma and unexpected song choices\\". Harris reached the Top 10 alongside Dexter Roberts, a friend he had already known for several years from the Alabama music scene. The two of them auditioned together in Tuscaloosa. Harris borrowed Roberts' guitar for that audition, as his own guitar had broken a string during the wait in line. After finishing in sixth and seventh place respectively, Harris and Roberts returned to the American Idol stage for the season 13 finale, where they performed together alongside Darius Rucker. Common opinion among critics was that Harris gave his best performance on American Idol when he covered \\"Can't You See\\" by The Marshall Tucker Band. Michael Slezak of TVLine called that performance \\"gritty\\" and \\"emotionally-connected\\", Dave Holmes of Vulture called it \\"lived- in and emotional and warm\\", and Colurso described it as \\"Rough-edged and raspy, imbued with real-deal emotion.\\" Doug Gray, an original member of The Marshall Tucker Band, praised Harris' rendition of \\"Can't You See\\".

She was the runner-up of the thirteenth season of American Idol. Asciutto became the first female Wild Card contestant of the series to qualify into the finale, and became the second Wild Card contestant, after Clay Aiken in the second season, to make it into the finale. In April 2015, she signed a long-term recording deal with the independent Detroit label Original 1265 Recordings. Asciutto released her debut EP, Innocence, on April 22, 2016, which was followed by her debut album, Cold Fame. ==Early life== Jena Irene Asciutto was born in Farmington Hills, Michigan, on July 13, 1996 to George Asciutto and Julie (n√©e Loiselle.) She graduated from North Farmington High School on June 8, 2014.

For her American Idol audition, Asciutto sang \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" by Adele. During the audition process, production continually called her \\"Jena Irene,\\" possibly due to a mistake she made when writing down her name, as \\"Irene\\" is not her surname, but rather her middle name. Although she initially made attempts to correct her name, she eventually decided to keep the name professionally. During the group round, she sang \\"Too Close\\" by Alex Clare, alongside Sikenya Thomson, Allie Odom, and Mufarid Zaidi. She made it into the third part of Hollywood week by singing an original song called \\"Unbreakable Me,\\" which has since been released on iTunes.

Prior to appearing on the series, he was the front man for the band Elijah Hooker. After American Idol, Johnson released his debut solo album, Testify, through Interscope Records. After leaving his label, he formed another group, Caleb Johnson and the Ramblin' Saints, and in 2019, the group self-released its first album, Born from Southern Ground. == Early life == Caleb Johnson was born on April 23, 1991 to David and Tamra Johnson in Asheville, North Carolina. His mother works as an accountant, his father is a former football coach and works for the Parks and Recreation Department of Buncombe County, North Carolina, but both have backgrounds in music. He attended Clyde A. Erwin High School in Asheville and graduated in 2009. He played some sports in high school, joined the drama club and chorus, and did some mission work and some volunteering at his church, Calvary Baptist. Johnson became interested in singing around age 17 when Josh Sawyer, who had a band in his high school, asked him to be the lead singer. The first song he performed in public in his high school was \\"Fortunate Son\\" by Creedence Clearwater Revival. He took part in a talent show while in high school with a band called Gorgon. (audio) He considers Chris Cornell to be his biggest musical influence, and that Rush is his favorite band. ==Music career2010: Elijah Hooker === After graduating Erwin High School in Asheville, North Carolina, on June 30, 2009, Caleb Johnson first joined a band called Rock Bottom as its lead singer. A year later, he joined his friend Josh Sawyer in rock band called Elijah Hooker and became its lead vocalist. Sawyer is the lead guitarist of the band; the other members of the band included Brian Turner on Keyboard, Shawn Foerst on bass, and Colten Emery on drums. Elijah Hooker released its self-titled debut album Elijah Hooker in June 2013. The 10-track album featured \\"Happiest Man\\" as its lead track. ===2011-14: American Idol=== Johnson performing with Jena Irene Asciutto during the Season 13 American Idol tour. Johnson auditioned for American Idol three times in four years. He first auditioned for the tenth season of American Idol in 2011. He was put through to Hollywood Week and was in a Hollywood group with James Durbin. In 2012, Johnson auditioned for the eleventh season and made it to the Top 42. He had difficulties in his performance of \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" and was cut at the Top 24 selection. He took the following year off from auditioning to improve on his stage presence. Johnson auditioned again in 2014 for the thirteenth season and made it to the top 20. In the semifinal round, he was voted by America into the top five male contestants, giving him a spot in the season's top 13. Johnson got positive feedback from the judges every week, had strong performances, and became the only finalist in the season to never land in the bottom 3 prior to reaching the finale. That season, Johnson was declared the winner.

It is the quickest an American Idol winner has released a debut album. After parting ways with his record label in late 2015, Johnson began working on his second album independently. The album was set to be released in 2016 but failed to. The lead single, \\"Holding On,\\" was released on February 9, 2016. Johnson is now self-releasing as Big Johnson Records. A second single, \\"Hanging with the Band,\\" was released on April 7, 2016. After a Pledge Music campaign, Johnson released a new EP, \\"Born from Southern Ground\\".

The YCL of Persia conducted agitation and propaganda activities and organized armed actions against the followers of Kuchik Khan. The organization was crushed after the defeat of the Gilan soviet. In 1927 different communist youth groups merged, recreating the YCL of Persia. It was a section of the Young Communist International.

Some examples familiar to English speakers include the zodiacal Year of the Monkey, the Monkey King Sun Wukong in the novel Journey to the West, and Monkey Kung Fu. ==Terminology== The Chinese language has numerous words meaning \\"simian; monkey; ape\\", some of which have diachronically changed meanings in reference to different simians. For instance, Chinese xingxing Áå©Áå© originally named \\"a mythical creature with a human face and pig body\\", and became the modern name for the \\"orangutan\\". Within the classification of Chinese characters, almost all \\"monkey; ape\\" words ‚Äì with the exceptions of nao Â§í and yu Á¶∫ that were originally monkey pictographs ‚Äì are written with radical-phonetic compound characters. These characters combine a radical or classifier that roughly indicates semantic field, usually the \\"dog/quadruped radical\\" Áä≠ for simians, and a phonetic element that suggests pronunciation. For instance, this animal classifier is a graphic component in hou Áå¥ (with a hou ‰æØ \\"marquis\\" phonetic) \\"macaque; monkey\\" and yuan Áåø (with yuan Ë¢Å \\"long robe\\") \\"gibbon; monkey\\". Note that the following discussion of \\"monkey; ape\\" terminology will cite three fundamental sources. The oldest extant Chinese dictionary, the (c. 3rd century BCE) Erya (Chapter 18, ÈáãÁç∏ \\"Explaining Wild Animals\\") glosses seven names for monkeys and monkey- like creatures in the ÂØìÂ±¨ \\"Monkey/Wild Animal\\" taxonomy. The first Chinese character dictionary, the (121 CE) Shuowen Jiezi defines many names of simians, primarily under the (Áä¨ÈÉ® \\"dog/quadruped\\" radical) in Chapter 11. The classic Chinese pharmacopoeia, Li Shizhen's (1597) Bencao Gangmu (Áç∏‰πãÂõõ \\"Animals No. 4\\" chapter) lists medical uses for five Yu ÂØì \\"monkeys\\" and three Kuai ÊÄ™ \\"supernatural beings\\". The latter are wangliang È≠çÈ≠é \\"a demon that eats the livers of corpses\\", penghou ÂΩ≠‰æØ \\"a tree spirit that resembles a black tailless dog\\", and feng Â∞Å \\"an edible monster that resembles a two-eyed lump of flesh\\". Li Shizhen distinguishes 11 varieties of monkeys: > A small one with a short tail is called Hou ([Áå¥] monkey). If it looks like a > monkey but has a prominent moustache, then it is called Ju [Áãô]. If it looks > like a monkey but is bigger, then it is Jue [Ë≤ú]. A monkey that is big, with > red eyes and a long tail, is called Yu [Á¶∫]. A monkey that is small but has a > long tail and an upright nose is called You [Áãñ]. A monkey that is similar to > You but is bigger is called Guoran [ÊûúÁÑ∂]. A monkey that is similar to You but > smaller is called Mengsong [ËíôÈ†å]. A monkey that is similar to You but jumps a > lot is called Canhu [ÁçëÁå¢]. A monkey that has long arms is called Yuan ([Áåø] > ape). A monkey that is similar to Yuan but has a golden tail is called Rong > [Áã®]. A monkey that is similar to Yuan but bigger, and can eat apes and > monkeys, is called Du [Áç®]. (s.v. Jue, tr. Luo 2003: 4124, cf. Read 1931: no. > 400B) ===Nao=== Oracle script for nao Â§í \\"a monkey\\" bronze script for nao Â§í \\"a monkey\\" Seal script for nao Â§í \\"a monkey\\" Seal script for kui Â§î \\"a demon\\" Nao Â§í was the first \\"monkey\\" term recorded in the historical corpus of written Chinese, and frequently appeared in (14th‚Äì11th centuries BCE) Shang dynasty oracle bone inscriptions. This oracle pictograph of \\"a monkey\\" showed its head, arms, legs, and short tail; which were convergented as ÁõÆ/È†Å (\\"head\\"/\\"eye\\"), Âèà/Áà™ (\\"hand\\"/\\"claw\\") and later Ê≠¢ (\\"foot\\", which was a corruption from Áà™ in this character), Â∑≤/Â∑≥ (\\"finished\\"/\\"foetus\\", which was corrupt from the tail) not later than the end of (6th century BCE) Spring and Autumn Period bronze script. Compare the seal character for kui Â§î \\"a legendary demon with a human face and body of a monkey/dragon\\", which resembles the seal character for nao with the addition of what appears to be long hair on its head. This graphically complex character nao Â§í \\"monkey\\" had an early variant nao Áçø (with the \\"quadruped\\" radical and nao phonetic), and a simpler replacement nao Áå± \\"monkey\\" (same radical and a rou Êüî phonetic), which is common in modern usage. The etymology of nao < *n√ª Â§í or Áå± \\"monkey\\" (Schuessler 2007:397) \\"is elusive\\", and may be connected with Proto-Mon‚ÄìKhmer *knuuy \\"macaque; monkey\\" or Proto-Tibeto-Burman *mruk; compare *≈ãoh Á¶∫ next. The first Chinese character dictionary, the (121 CE) Shuowen Jiezi defines nao Â§í as \\"a greedy animal, generally said to be a muhou \\"monkey\\" resembling a person\\" (Ë≤™Áç∏‰πü‰∏ÄÊõ∞ÊØçÁå¥‰ºº‰∫∫); see muhou below. The poet Li Bai alludes to nao (Áå±) populating the Taihang Mountains, in the north of China, near the capital city Chang'an, in the poem \\"ÁôΩÈ¶¨ÁØá\\": it should be duly noted that this literary source contextually suggests a temporal location of the West Han era (Sun 1982:82‚Äì85). ===Yu=== Yu Á¶∫ \\"monkey\\" appeared on (11th‚Äì3rd centuries BCE) Zhou dynasty Chinese ritual bronzes as a pictograph showing a head, arms, and a tail. Yu \\"forenoon, 9 to 11 AM\\" is the second of five daily divisions (Êõ¥) in the traditional Chinese calendar. Banyu Áï™Á¶∫ was \\"a district in Guangzhou\\". In modern Chinese scientific usage, yu Á¶∫ refers to the Central and South American \\"spider monkey\\". The etymology of yu < *≈ãoh Á¶∫ \\"monkey\\" (Schuessler 2007:589-590) links with Kukish *≈ãa:w \\"ape\\" > Lushai ≈ãau \\"grey monkey\\"; compare *n√ª Â§í above. The Shuowen Jiezi defines yu Á¶∫ as \\"a kind of muhou \\"monkey\\" with a head resembling a gui \\"ghost\\"\\" (ÊØçÁå¥Â±¨È†≠‰ººÈ¨º). Compare the above definition of nao as a muhou \\"monkey\\" resembling a person. Yu Á¶∫ has a graphic variant yu ÂØì (with the \\"roof radical\\") \\"reside; imply\\". The Erya (18) lists monkey definitions under a yushu ÂØìÂ±¨ \\"wild animal category\\". Guo Pu's commentary explains yu ÂØì inclusively means all shou Áç∏ \\"wild animals\\", and van Gulik (1967:38) says it means \\"primates in general\\". The Shanhaijing (tr. Birrell 1999:3) uses yu Á¶∫ to describe the xingxing, \\"There is an animal on the mountain which looks like a long-tailed ape, but it has white ears. It crouches as it moves along and it runs like a human. Its name is the live- lively. If you eat it, you'll be a good runner\\". The Shanhaijing records a mythical yugu Á¶∫Ë∞∑ \\"monkey valley\\", the place where the sun sets, which suggests that \\"the monkey is a kind of guardian of the approaches to the nether World\\" (van Gulik 1967:38). Kuafu Á¶∫Ë∞∑ \\"Boast Father raced with the sun and ran with the setting sun\\", but died of thirst on the way (tr. Birrell 1999:123). Yugu is also written as yu Ëôû \\"predict; deceive\\" or ou ÂÅ∂ \\"human image; mate\\". ===Hou and Muhou=== Hou Áå¥ \\"monkey; macaque\\" is a common name for simians. For instance, houzi Áå¥Â≠ê means \\"monkey\\" or \\"clever/glib person\\". Muhou ÊØçÁå¥ \\"macaque; rhesus monkey\\" compounds mu \\"mother\\" and hou \\"monkey\\", and can also mean \\"female monkey\\" in modern usage. Van Gulik (1967:35) says that muhou is a phonetic rendering of a non-Chinese term\\" because mu- occurs in four variants: ÊØç and Ê≤ê \\"wash one's hair\\" in Zhou texts, and Á±≥ \\"rice\\" or Áçº in Han texts. In modern Chinese usage, mihou ÁçºÁå¥ means \\"macaque; rhesus monkey\\". The etymology of hou < Old Chinese *g√¥ Áå¥ \\"monkey\\" (Schuessler 2007:279) probably derives from Sino-Tibetan * î-ko. The first syllable in muhou < *m√¥ î-g√¥ ÊØçÁå¥ or muhou < *m√¥k-g√¥ Ê≤êÁå¥ \\"macaque\\" may perhaps be a \\"pre-initial\\" supported by the Lolo- Burmese mjo kh≈ì < *mjok \\"monkey\\", which might have been the source of Proto- Tocharian *moko. Lu Ji, who was from the southern state of Wu, noted muhou was a Chu word (tr. Van Gulik 1967:35): \\"The nao is the macaque [mihou], called by the people of Chu [muhou]. After a macaque has grown old, he becomes a que [Ë≤ú]. Macaques with long arms are called gibbons (yuan). Gibbons with a white waist are called [chan Áçë].\\" Van Gulik explains the legendary que with the grey whiskers of mature macaques, and associates the chan with the rhesus macaque, or huchan ËÉ°Áçë, found in present day Yunnan. The Shuowen jiezi defines hou as nao, and defines nao Â§í, yu Á¶∫, jue ÁéÉ, and wei Ëúº as muhou. The Bencao gangmu lists mihou synonyms of: muhou Ê≤êÁå¥, weihou ÁÇ∫Áå¥, husun ËÉ°Â≠´, wangsun ÁéãÂ≠´, maliu È¶¨Áïô, and ju Áãô; and Li Shizhen explains the names. > The book Baihu Tongyi by Ban Gu: Hou means \\"wait\\" [hou ÂÄô, n.b., hou Áå¥ does > not occur in the received text]. When it sees a man put some food in a trap, > it will stay in a higher position and look at the food for a long time. It > is an animal that is good at waiting. The macaque likes to wash its face by > rubbing, so it is called Mu [Ê≤ê \\"washing\\"]. The character was later distorted > to Mu ([ÊØç] meaning \\"mother\\"), which is even further from the original > meaning. The book Shuowen Jiezi (Book of Philology by Xu Shen): The > character Hou looks like Muhou (monkey), but it is not a female monkey. As > macaque looks like a person from the Hu region (the north and west of China > where non-Han ethnic groups lived in ancient times), it is called Husun > [ËÉ°Â≠´]. In the book Zhuang Zi, it is called Ju [Áãô]. People raise macaques in > stables. In this way, horses will not be attacked by disease. So it is > colloquially called Maliu ([È¶¨Áïô] meaning \\"maintaining the horses\\") in the Hu > region (the north and west of China where non-Han ethnic groups lived in > ancient times). In Sanskrit books it is called Mosizha [Êë©ÊñØÂí§] > (transliteration [of marka≈£a]). (tr. Luo 2003:4124, cf. Van Gulik 1967:35) Bernard E. Read (1931: no. 400) notes, \\"The menstrual discharge of the monkey [Áå¥Á∂ì] is said to give immunity to the horse against infectious disease\\", and suggests the Sanskrit name \\"is not so remote from the genus name Macacus\\". Husun \\"macaque; monkey\\" is also written Áå¢Áåª, as punned in the surname of Sun Wukong Â≠´ÊÇüÁ©∫ \\"descendent/monkey awakened to emptiness\\". Maliu È¶¨Áïô (lit. \\"horse keep\\") compares with the Cantonese maB2l…êuA1 \\"monkey\\" word (Schuessler 2007:580). ===Yuan and naoyuan=== Yuan Áåø \\"ape; monkey\\" is used in Chinese terms such as yuanren Áåø‰∫∫ \\"ape-man; Hominidae\\" and Beijing yuanren Âåó‰∫¨Áåø‰∫∫ \\"Peking Man\\". The etymology of yuan < *wan Áåø \\"monkey\\" (Schuessler 2007:593-59) could be linked with Proto-Tibeto-Burman *(b)woy or Proto-Mon‚ÄìKhmer *swaa î \\"monkey\\". Yuanhou ÁåøÁå¥ \\"apes and monkeys\\", according to Van Gulik (1967:33), originally meant only \\"gibbons and macaques\\" but in the last few centuries, it has been widely used in Chinese literature as a comprehensive term for \\"monkeys\\". The Japanese language word enk≈ç ÁåøÁå¥ is likewise means \\"monkey\\" in general. Naoyuan Áå±ËùØ compounds the nao Â§í variant Áå± with yuan ËùØ (combining the \\"insect radical\\" Ëô´ and yuan Áà∞ phonetic). Yuan has graphic variants of Áå® and Áåø. The Erya defines \\"The naoyuan is good at climbing\\" (Áå±ËùØÂñÑÊè¥), based upon a pun between yuan ËùØ \\"monkey\\" and yuan Êè¥ \\"pull up; climb\\" (both characters written with the same phonetic element). Nao Áå± occurs once in the Classic of Poetry, \\"Do not teach a monkey to climb trees\\" (ÊØãÊïôÁå±ÂçáÊú®). Lu Ji's 3rd-century commentary says \\"The nao is the macaque [mihou], the people of Chu call it muhou (see above). In disagreement, Van Gulik (1967:32) gives reasons why nao Áå± means \\"gibbon\\" not \\"macaque\\". First, the Erya stresses \\"climbing\\" as the simian's main characteristic. Second, Zhou dynasty texts record the nao as \\"a typical tree- ape\\". Third, numerous early literary sources use naoyuan or yuannao as a binomial compound. Van Gulik distinguishes nao Áå± \\"gibbon\\" from the homonym nao Áç∂ \\"monkey\\" (with a you ÊÜÇ phonetic replacing the uncommon Â§í in nao Áçø) The term nao Áçø occurs in the Record of Music chapter of the Book of Rites criticizing vulgar pantomimes (tr. Van Gulik 1967:32), \\"Actors take part therein, and dwarfs who resemble nao, men and women mix, and the difference between parents and children is not observed\\"; \\"here nao clearly means a macaque, familiar through the popular monkey-shows.\\" Van Gulik (1967:33) suggests that Chinese yuan \\"gibbon\\" was a loanword from the language of Chu, the southernmost state of the Zhou realm. Qu Yuan's (c. 3rd-century) Chuci uses the term yuanyou ÁåøÁãñ three times (in Nine Pieces); for instance (tr. Hawkes 1985:160), \\"Amid the deep woods there, in the twilight gloom, are the haunts where monkeys live.\\" This text also uses yuan Áåø once (Nine Songs), yuan ËùØ once (in Nine Laments), and houyuan Áå¥Áåø once (in Nine Longings). If yuanyou was Qu Yuan's (or another Chuci author's) rendering of a Chu word for \\"gibbon\\", then naoyuan can be understood as a compound of the native Chinese word nao \\"monkey in general\\" and the sinified loanword yuan \\"gibbon\\"; and gradually, \\"nao Áå± came to mean \\"gibbon\\", whereas nao Áç∂ remained reserved for monkeys.\\" You Áãñ was (Van Gulik 1967:31) a Zhou synonym for \\"gibbon\\". > During the first centuries of our era, the binoms naoyuan or yuannao were > superseded as words for \\"gibbon\\" by the single term yuan Áå®, written with the > classifier \\"quadruped\\" instead of that for \\"insect\\" Ëô´; and one prefers the > phonetic Ë¢Å to Áà∞ (rarely Âì°). This character yuan Áåø has remained the exclusive > term for the Hylobatidae as long as the Chinese in general were familiar > with the gibbon. However, when in the course of the centuries more and more > mountainous regions were brought under cultivation, and as the deforestation > increased accordingly, the habitat of the gibbon shrank to the less > accessible mountain forests in the south and south-west, and the Chinese had > few opportunities for seeing actual specimens. Until about the 14th century > A.D. one may assume with confidence that when a Chinese writer employs the > word yuan Áåø, he means indeed a gibbon. Thereafter, however, the majority of > Chinese writers knowing about the gibbon only by hearsay, they began to > confuse him with the macaque or other Cynopithecoids ‚Äì a confusion which has > lasted till the present day. (1967:33) The Bencao gangmu (tr. Van Gulik 1967:33) notes that, \\"the gibbon's meat may be taken as medicine against hemorrhoids, which may be cured also by always using a gibbon's skin as seat-cover. The fat used as ointment is said to be a wonderful cure for itching sores.\\" ===Rong=== Rong Áã® was \\"a long-haired monkey with golden fur that was highly prized\\". Read (1931:401) suggests it is the \\"lar gibbon, Hylobates entelloides\\", and Luo (2003: 4125) identifies it as the golden snub-nosed monkey Rhinopitheeus roxellana. In addition to meaning \\"golden snub-nosed monkey\\", Van Gulik (1967:36) and notes that in modern Chinese zoological terminology, rong denotes the Callitrichidae (or Hapalidae) family including marmosets and tamarins. The Bencao gangmu entry for the rong Áã® explains the synonym nao Áå± signifies this monkey's rou Êüî \\"soft; supple\\" hair. > The hair of the golden monkey is long and soft. So it is called Rong > (meaning \\"fine hair\\"). Nao is a character meaning \\"soft.\\" Another > explanation says that the animal is found in the western Rong region > [Sichuan], so it is thus named. There is a kind of long-hair dog that is > also called Nao. ... The book Tan Yuan [Ë´áËãë] by Yang Yi (Ê•äÂÑÑ): The golden > monkey is found in the deep mountains in Sichuan and Shaanxi. It looks like > an ape. It has a long tail of golden color. So it is colloquially called > Jinsirong [ÈáëÁµ≤Áã®] (meaning \\"golden thread monkey\\"). It is quick at climbing > trees. It loves its tail dearly. When shot by a poisonous arrow, it will > bite off its own tail when poisoned. During the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279), > only officials of the administration and military of the third rank and > above were allowed to use seats and bedding made of golden monkey hide. (tr. > Luo 2003: 4126, cf. Read 1931: no. 401) This entry has two subheadings: the yuan Áå® or changbeihou Èï∑ËáÇÁå¥ \\"gibbon, Hylobates agilis\\" and the du Áç® (below). > The ape is good at climbing trees. It is found in the deep mountains in the > Chuan and Guang regions. It looks like a monkey, but has very long arms. It > is an animal that can practice [Daoist] qi (Vital Energy), so it lives a > long life. Some say it has one arm stretching from one side to the other. > This is not correct. Its arm bone can be made into a flute that sounds very > clear and resonant. Apes come in different colors: blue-green, white, black, > yellow and crimson. It is a kind and quiet animal, and likes to eat fruits. > It lives in forests and can jump over a distance of several dozen chi. But > when it falls and drops onto the ground, it may suffer from excessive > diarrhea and then die. Treatment is the drinking of juice of Fuzi/radix > aconiti lateralis/daughter root of common monkshood. Apes live in groups. > The male cries a lot. It makes three cries consecutively. The cry sounds > miserable and is penetrating. The book Guihai Zhi [Ê°ÇÊµ∑Âøó] by Fan Chengda: > There are three varieties of apes: Yellow ones with golden thread; black > ones with jade faces; and black ones with black faces. Some say the pure > black one is the male, and the golden thread one is the female. A male one > shouts and a female does not. The book Rixun Ji [Êó•Ë©¢Ë®ò] by Wang Ji: People in > the Guang region say that when an ape is born, it is black and male, When it > gets old, it turns yellow and its genitals become ulcerous, and then it > turns into a female. Then it mates with the black one. After another several > hundred years, the yellow ape will evolve into a white one. (tr. Luo 2003: > 4126, cf. Read 1931 no. 401A) ===Jue and Juefu=== Juefu Ë≤úÁà∂ \\"a large monkey\\" compounds jue \\"an ape\\" and fu \\"father\\". The character jue Ë≤ú combines the \\"cat/beast radical\\" Ë±∏ and a jue Áüç \\"look startled\\" phonetic (with two ÁõÆ \\"eyes\\"); compare the graphic variants of ÁéÉ and Ë†º. Based upon this phonetic element, the Erya (tr. Van Gulik 1967:25) glosses: \\"Juefu, good at looking.\\" (Ë≤úÁà∂ÂñÑÈ°ß). The juefu is also called jueyuan ÁéÉÁåø, which is known as Kakuen in Japanese mythology. The fulu ÈôÑÈåÑ \\"appendix\\" to the Bencao gangmu entry for mihou \\"macaque\\" adds the jue ÁéÉ \\"A species of large ape or hoolock, found in Western China, and said to be six feet high, it probably denotes the great gibbon, Hylobates\\", the \\"northern gray gibbon, Hylobates muelleri funereus\\" (viz., M√ºller's Bornean gibbon) (Read 1931: no. 400A); and the ju Ë±¶ (graphically \\"tiger\\" and \\"pig\\") \\"wild boar; a yellow and black monkey\\" or jufu ËàâÁà∂ \\"lift/raise father\\", the \\"lion-tailed macaque, Macaca/Inuus silenus\\" (Read 1931: no. 400B). The jue entry says: > It is a kind of old monkey. It lives in the mountains in western Sichuan. It > looks like a monkey. But it is bigger and is gray and black. It can walk > like a human. It robs things from humans, and looks around its surrounding > from time to time. There are only male ones and no female ones, so it is > also called Juefu (father monkey) or Jiajue. It may kidnap a girl and marry > her to have children. The book Shenyi Jing: There is a kind of animal called > Zhou in the west that is as big as a donkey but looks like a monkey. It can > climb trees. There are only female ones and no males. They block the road in > the mountains and kidnap men who happen to pass on the road. The men are > then forced to mate with then. This is the way the animal gets offspring. It > is also a kind of Jue, but a female one. (tr. Luo 2003: 4124‚Äì4125, cf. Van > Gulik 1967:26) This all-female zhou monkey is written with a non-Unicode character, combining the Ë±∏ radical and zhou Âë® phonetic. Li Shizhen describes the ju(fu): > It is found in the mountains in Jianping. It is the size of a dog but looks > like a monkey. It is black and yellow, and covered with a big beard and > bristles. It may throw stones to strike humans. The book Xishan Jing: There > is a kind of animal in Chongwu Mountain. It looks like Yu but has long arms. > It is good at throwing stones. It is called Jufu. (tr. Luo 2003: 4125, cf. > Read 1931: no. 400B) ===Ju=== Ju Áãô originally meant \\"macaque; monkey\\" and came to mean \\"spy; watch for\\" (e.g., juji ÁãôÊìä \\"attack from ambush). The Shuowen jiezi defines ju as \\"a kind of [jue] monkey, also said to mean a dog that briefly bites a person\\" (ÁéÉÂ±¨‰∏ÄÊõ∞ÁãôÁä¨‰πüÊö´ÈΩß‰∫∫ËÄÖ). The (c. 4th‚Äì3rd centuries BCE) Zhuangzi was the oldest Chinese classic to use ju. For instance, it has two versions of a quote from Laozi (called Lao Dan ËÄÅËÅÉ, lit. \\"old helixless-ears\\") using the term yuanzu ÁåøÁãô \\"gibbon and macaque; monkey\\" to exemplify someone who is not a Daoist sage. > \\"Compared to the sages,\\" said Old Longears \\"he would be like a clerk at his > labors or a craftsman tied to his work, toiling his body and vexing his > mind. Furthermore, it is the patterned pelt of the tiger and the leopard > that bring forth the hunter, it is the nimbleness of the gibbon and the > monkey that bring forth the trainer with his leash. Can such as these be > compared with enlightened kings?\\" (7, tr. Mair 1994:68, cf. 12 1994:109) The Shanhaijing mentions two mythological animals named with ju. First, the xieju Áå≤Áãô (with xie or he \\"short-muzzled dog\\"): > There is an animal on this mountain which looks like a wolf, but it has a > scarlet head and rat eyes. It makes a noise like a piglet. Its name is the > snubnose-dogwolf. It eats humans. (4, tr. Birrell 1999:62‚Äì63) Second, the zhuru ÁãôÂ¶Ç (with ru \\"be like\\"): > There is an animal on this mountain which looks like a white-eared rat; it > has white ears and white jaws. Its name is the monkey-like. Whenever it > appears, that kingdom will have a great war. (5, tr. Birrell 1999:96) ===Xingxing=== A sh≈çj≈ç illustration from the 1712 Wakan Sansai Zue Xingxing Áå©Áå© or shengsheng ÁãåÁãå\\"a monkey; orangutan\\" reduplicates xing, which graphically combines the \\"quadruped radical\\" with a xing Êòü \\"star\\" phonetic, or with sheng Áîü \\"life\\" in the variant xing or sheng Áãå. The name is used for foreign simians in modern terminology, xingxing means \\"orangutan\\", heixingxing with hei- Èªë \\"black\\" means \\"chimpanzee\\", and daxingxing with da- Èªë \\"large\\" means \\"gorilla\\". The Erya says, \\"The [xingxing] is small, and likes to cry.\\" (Áå©Áå©Â∞èËÄåÂ•ΩÂïº). Guo Pu's commentary (tr. Van Gulik 1967:26) notes, \\"The Shanhaijing says: It has a human face and the body of a pig, and it is able to speak. At present it is found in [Jiaoji] and the [Fengxi] district (i.e. North Indo-China). The [xingxing] resembles a [huan Áçæ] (badger) or small pig. Its call resembles the crying of a small child.\\" Fengxi Â∞ÅË∞ø corresponds to modern B·∫Øc Ninh Province in Vietnam. The Huainanzi (tr. Major et al. 2010:508) says, \\"The orangutan knows the past but does not know the future; the male goose knows the future but does not know the past.\\"; Gao You's commentary (tr. Van Gulik 1967:26) says, \\"The [xingxing] has a human face but the body of a beast, and its colour is yellow. It is fond of wine.\\" The Bencao gangmu entry for the xingxing or shengsheng, which Read (1931: no. 403) identifies as the \\"orangutan, Simia satyrus\\", records, > Li Shizhen: An orangutan can talk and knows about the future. Xingxing [Áå©Áå©] > means [xingxing ÊÉ∫ÊÉ∫] \\"intelligent\\". The orangutan was recorded in books like > Er Ya and Yi Zhou Shu several dozen times. The following explanation is a > summary: It is found in the mountain valleys in the Ailaoyi area and Fengxi > County in Jiaozhi. It looks like a dog or a macaque. Its yellow hair > resembles that of an ape, and its white ears resemble those of a pig. Its > face looks human, and its legs are similar to those of a man. It has long > hair and a good-looking face and head. It cries in the same way as a baby > cries, or as a dog barks. They flock together and move covertly. Ruan Qian: > Local people in Fengxi catch the animal in the following way: They place > some wine and straw sandals on the roadside. Orangutans will come to the > spot and call out the names of the ancestors of the people who placed the > things. Then they leave temporarily and come back shortly afterwards. They > drink the wine and try the sandals on. While the orangutans are enjoying > themselves, people catch them and then keep them in cages. When one of them > is to be killed, the fattest one will be chosen. It weeps sadly. People in > the Xihu area use its blood to dye a kind of woolen fabric, which will > maintain its bright color for a long time. After a puncture is made in the > orangutan to let out blood, the person will flog the animal and ask it for > the number of beatings. The flogging will stop after one dou of blood has > been collected. The book Li Ji (Record of Rites) said that the orangutan > could speak. The book Guang Zhi by Guo Yigong said that the orangutan could > not speak. The book Shanhai Jing also said that the orangutan could speak. > [Li Shizhen comments]: The orangutan is a kind of animal that looks like a > human being. It looks like an ape or a monkey and can speak simple words > like a parrot. It may not be the same as what Ruan Qian said. The book Er Ya > Yi by Luo Yuan: In ancient books, the orangutan was described as similar to > a pig, dog or monkey. But now it is recorded that the animal looks like a > baboon. It looks like a naked bare-foot woman with long hair hanging from > the head. They do not seem to have knees, and they travel in a group. When > they encounter human beings, they cover their bodies with their hands. > People say this is a kind of savage human. According to what Luo Yuan said, > it seems such a creature is actually a Yen√º (meaning \\"wild girl\\") or Yepo > (meaning \\"wild woman\\"). Are they the same? (tr. Luo 2003: 4128, cf. Read > 1931: no. 403) The subentry for the yen√º ÈáéÂ•≥ \\"wild women\\" or ÈáéÂ©Ü \\"wild wife\\" says, > The book Bowu Zhi [ÂçöÁâ©Âøó] by Tang Meng: In the Rinan area there is a kind of > creature called the Yen√º (meaning \\"wild girl\\") that travels in group. No > male ones are to be found. They are white and crystal-like, wearing no > clothes. The book Qidong Yeyu by Zhou Mi [Âë®ÂØÜ]: Yepo (meaning \\"wild woman\\") > is found in Nandanzhou. It has yellow hair shaped into coils. It is naked > and wears no shoes. It looks like a very old woman. All of them are female > and there are no male ones. They climb up and down the mountain as fast as > golden monkeys. Under their waists are pieces of leather covering their > bodies. When they encounter a man, they will carry him away and force him to > mate. It is reported once that such a creature was killed by a strong man. > It protected its waist even when it was being killed. After dissecting the > animal, a piece of seal chip was found that was similar to a piece of gray > jade with inscriptions on it. Li Shizhen: According to what Ruan Qian and > Luo Yuan said above, it seems that this Yen√º is actually an orangutan. As to > the seal chip found in the animal, it is similar to the case that the testes > of a male mouse are said to have seal characters [fuzhuan Á¨¶ÁØÜ \\"symbolic seal > script\\"] on them, and the case that under the wing of a bird a seal of > mirror has been found. Such things are still unclear to us. (tr. Luo > 2003:4128, cf. Read 1931: no. 403A) The bright scarlet dye known as xingxingxue Áå©Áå©Ë°Ä \\"gibbon's blood\\" was not used by the Chinese, but observed in imported Western textiles. Although the source for this tradition of the bloody dye remains untraced, Edward H. Schafer (1963:210) notes a Western analogue in \\"St. John's blood\\", a variety of the red dye kermes, which derives from the insect kermes. The Tang dynasty chancellor Pei Yan wrote, > The hu [\\"barbarians\\"] of the Western countries take its blood for dyeing > their woolen rugs; its color is clean and will not turn black. Some say that > when you prick it for its blood, if you ask, \\"How much will you give me?\\" > the [xingxing] will say, \\"Would two pints be truly enough?\\" In order to add > to this amount, you thrash it with a whip before asking and it will go along > with an increase, so that you can obtain up to a gallon. (Quan Tangwen ÂÖ®ÂîêÊñá, > tr. Schafer 1963:209) Edward H. Schafer quotes a Tang story. > A number of the beasts were captured and put in a pen, to be cooked for the > magistrate of a Tonkinese town. They picked the fattest of their number and > thrust it weeping forth, to await the magistrate's pleasure in a covered > cage: \\"The Commandant asked what thing this was, and the [xingxing] spoke > from within the cage, and said, 'Only your servant and a jug of wine!' The > Commandant laughed, and cherished it.\\" Of course the clever, winebibbing > animal became a treasured pet. (1963:209) The Chinese belief that gibbons enjoyed drinking wine has parallels in Classical antiquity, \\"monkeys were reputed to be overfond of wine, as Aristotle, Aelian, and Pliny observed, and their drunkenness made them easy to capture.\\" Chinese stories about the xingxing liking wine appealed to the Japanese. In Japanese mythology, the Sh≈çj≈ç Áå©Áå© was a god of wine with a red face and long, red hair, who was always drunk and dancing merrily. Compare the drunken monkey hypothesis that the human attraction to ethanol may have a genetic basis. ===Feifei=== Feifei ÁãíÁãí \\"monkey; baboon\\" reduplicates fei, written with the \\"dog/quadruped radical\\" Áä≠with a fu Âºó phonetic. Van Gulik (1967:29) says Chinese zoologists have adopted feifei as a convenient modern rendering of \\"baboon\\". The Erya glosses, \\"The feifei resembles a person; it has long hair hanging down on its back; it runs quickly and devours people.\\" (ÁãíÁãíÂ¶Ç‰∫∫Ë¢´È´ÆËøÖËµ∞È£ü‰∫∫). Guo Pu's commentary says, > This is the [xiaoyang Ê¢üÁæä] \\"owl-goat\\". The [Shanhaijing] says: As to its > shape it has a human face, with long lips; its body is black, with hair > hanging down to its heels. When meeting with people it laughs. This animal > occurs in N[orth] Indo-China, [Guangxi], and [Guangdong]. The large ones are > over ten feet tall. Locally the animal is called [shandu Â±±ÈÉΩ]. (tr. Van Gulik > 1967:28) Xiaoyang Ê¢üÁæä is a variant of the mythic xiaoyang Ê¢üÊ•ä \\"owl-poplar\\", which David Hawkes (1985:268) describes as \\"an anthropoid monster whose upper lip covers his face when he laughs. His laughter was sinister, it was said, being an indication that he was about to eat human flesh.\\" The Shuowen Jiezi (Liu 2003: 4129) writes feifei •ùã•ùã with an obsolete pictograph, and Xu Shen says: \\"People in the north call it Tulou [ÂúüËûª \\"earth cricket\\"]. Now people call it Renxiong [‰∫∫ÁÜä \\"man bear\\"].\\" The (c. 9th century) Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang describes the feifei. > If one drinks its blood one can see ghosts. Its strength equals ten-thousand > catties. When it laughs, it curls up its upper lip which then covers its > forehead. It has the shape of a macaque and it is capable of human speech, > which sounds like the twitter of birds. It can foretell births and deaths. > Its blood can be used as a purple dye and its hair for making wigs. An old > tradition says that its feet are reversed. Hunters say it has no knees, so > that when sleeping it has always to lean against some support. In the early > Liu Song dynasty period (420 to 479 A.D.), Guangxi sent a pair of [feifei] > as tribute. (tr. Van Gulik 1967:28) Regarding this widely copied fanzhong ÂèçË∏µ \\"reversed feet\\" description, Van Gulik reasons that a copyist misread the ji Âèä \\"extend; down to\\" in Guo Pu's ÂèäË∏µ \\"hair hanging down to its heels\\" comment as fan Âèç \\"reverse; opposite\\". He further (1967:29) suggests that the human face, long lips, and long red hair description of the feifei could apply to the orangutan. The Bencao gangmu entry for feifei, identified as the \\"golden snub-nosed monkey, Rhinopithecus roxellanae\\" and \\"baboon\\" Papio hamadryas (Liu 2003: 4129), lists other synonyms of xiaoyang Ê¢üÁæä \\"owl goat\\", yeren Èáé‰∫∫ \\"wild man; savage\\" (see Yeren), and shandu Â±±ÈÉΩ \\"mountain capital\\". > Chen Cangqi: The baboon is found in the Yi areas in the southwest. The book > Er Ya: The baboon is in the shape of a human being with disheveled hair. It > runs very fast and may eat humans. The book Shanhai Jing: Xiaoyang has a > human-like face, long lips and a black body. It is covered with hair. It has > reversed heels. It laughs when it sees a human being, and when it laughs its > upper lip may cover its eyes. Guo Pu: In the Jiao and Guang regions and also > in the mountains in Nankangjun, such creatures can be found. A big one may > be as tall as 10 chi. It is colloquially called Shandu. In one of the years > of the Xiaojian reign of the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279), people from the > indigenous areas contributed a pair of baboons to the emperor, one male and > one female. The emperor asked Ding Luan, a representative from the tribe, > about the animal. Ding Luan answered: \\"The face of the animal looks like a > human being. It is covered with red hair like a macaque. It has a tail. It > can talk like a human being, but it sounds like the chirping of a bird. It > can predict life and death. It is very strong and can carry very heavy > things. It has reversed heels and seems to have no knees. When it sleeps, it > leans against something. When it catches a human being, it first laughs and > then eats him. A hunter can catch the animal by using this trick. He puts > one arm through a bamboo tube to lure the animal. When the animal laughs > heartily, the person uses a nail to try to pin its lip to its forehead. Then > the animal will run around wildly and die shortly afterwards. It has very > long hair, which can be used to make wigs. Its blood can be added in the > dyeing of boots or silk fabrics. If one drinks its blood, one will be able > to see ghosts.\\" After this explanation, the emperor ordered a painter to do > a portrait of the animal. Li Shizhen: The book Fangyu Zhi: The baboon can > also be found in the mountains in western Sichuan and Chuzhou. It is also > called Renxiong. People catch it, and eat its paws and peel off its hide. In > the You Mountains of Shaxian County in Fujian, the animal is also found. It > is more than 10 chi tall and laughs when it encounters a human being. It is > also called Shandaren, Yeren, or Shanxiao. The book Nankang Ji by Deng > Deming: Shandu looks like a wild man from Kunlun Mountain. Its body is > covered with hair. When it encounters a human being, it closes its eyes and > opens its mouth, seeming to laugh. It turns stones in mountain streams to > find crabs for food. (tr. Luo 2003: 4129, cf. Read 1931: no. 404) The Bencao gangmu supplement lists four other monkey-like creatures under feifei. Shandu Â±±ÈÉΩ, which Read identifies as the \\"chacma baboon, Cynocephalus porcarius\\": > Li Shizhen: The book Shuyi Ji [Ëø∞Áï∞Ë®ò] by Ren Fang: There is a kind of spirit > in Nankang that is called Shandu. It looks like a human being and is just > over two chi tall. It is black with red eyes and yellow hair. It makes its > nest in a tree in the deep mountains. Its nest looks like bird nest over > three chi tall. These nests are bright and lustrous inside, and are light > and quite empty. Usually two such nests are placed together on a mattress > made of bird feathers. The upper one is for the male and the lower one is > for the female. Shandu may appear in different forms and can even become > invisible. It is very difficult to find such a creature. It is similar to > Muke and Shanxiao. (tr. Luo 2003: 4130, Read 1931: no 404A) Shanhui Â±±§ü§: > Li Shizhen: The book Beishan Jing: Shanhui looks like a dog but has a human- > like face. It is good at throwing stones.

The etymology of wei < *wih or *rui î (< *r-wi î) Ëúº \\"kind of monkey-like animal\\" (Schuessler 2007:513) is hypothetically connected with Palaung-Wa *r…ôyol \\"white-handed gibbon\\" or the -i in wei could be a diminutive suffix added to the you < *wu Áå∂ \\"monkey\\" word. The Erya glosses, \\"The wei has an upturned nose and a long tail. It is good at climbing mountain peaks.\\" (ËúºÂç¨ÈºªËÄåÈï∑Â∞æÊôÇÂñÑ‰πòÈ†ò). Guo Pu (tr. Van Gulik 1967:29) says, \\"The wei resembles the macaque but is larger. Its colour is yellowish- black, its tail several feet long, resembling an otter's tail, forked at the tip. Its nostrils are tilted upward; when it rains the wei hangs from a tree and covers its nostrils with its tail, or with two fingers. The people east of the (Yangtse) River catch and raise it. It is swift and strong.\\" Based on this description, Van Gulik identifies wei as the golden snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana), which is \\"a smaller monkey with a long tail, and a pronounced upturned nose; it has a blue-black face, and long, fluffy golden fur.\\" ===You=== You Áå∂ \\"a monkey\\" has an uncertain etymology and meaning. Schuessler (2007:580) notes you < *ju < Proto-Chinese *wu Áå∂ \\"a kind of monkey\\" has comparative linguistics similarities with Proto-Tibeto-Burman *myuk or *mruk > Burmese myok and Mru yuk \\"monkey\\". You < *ju phonologically resembles two Old Chinese \\"monkey\\" words: yu < *≈ãoh Á¶∫ and hou < *g√¥ Áå¥. The characterÁå∂, with the \\"quadruped radical\\" and a qiu ÈÖã phonetic, originally denoted a simian, but became a common Chinese phonetic loan character for you \\"still; yet\\". The Erya glosses you as \\"Like a muntjac and good at climbing trees\\" (Â¶ÇÈ∫ÇÂñÑÁôªÊú®). Hao Yixing ÈÉùÊáøË°å's 19th-century sub-commentary says, \\"The wild animal you is a kind of monkey, shaped like a muntjac, which resembles a hornless deer with feet like a dog.\\" The you is also called youhu Áå∂Áå¢ and identified as the husun Áå¢Áåª. The Shuowen jiezi defines you as \\"a kind of jue \\"large monkey\\", you is also said to be the Longxi [modern Tianshui region] word for \\"puppy\\" (ÁéÉÂ±¨‰∏ÄÊõ∞Èö¥Ë•øË¨ÇÁä¨Â≠êÁÇ∫Áå∑). ===Du=== Du Áç® (lit. \\"alone\\") named \\"a larger monkey\\", which was interpreted as a monkey with \\"solitary habits\\", based on the word's literal meaning (Van Gulik 1967:36). Read (1931: no. 401B) identifies it as \\"a species of baboon or mandrill\\". The Bencao gangmu rong Áã® entry notes the du Áç®. > Du looks like an ape but is bigger. It stays alone and gives a single cry at > a time. It eats apes and monkeys. So there is an idiom saying that when a Du > cries, all apes will disperse. The term \\"dufu\\" (Áç®Â§´, a lone man, or a > \\"dictator.\\") has its origin in this animal. Some say this animal is actually > the Huangyao [ÈªÑËÖ∞ \\"yellow waist\\"]. Also see explanations in the class of Hu > (tiger). (tr. Luo 2003: 4126, cf. Read 1931: no. 401B) The Bencao gangmu entry for hu Ëôé \\"tiger\\" lists huangyao among animals that are strong enough to kill and eat tigers. ===Guoran=== Guoran ÊûúÁÑ∂ (lit. \\"indeed; really\\") or ÁåìÁÑ∂ is described as \\"a timid monkey with a long tail\\". Van Gulik (1967:36) tentatively associates guoran with the surili monkeys of the genus Presbytis found in Southeast Asia. The Bencao gangmu entry for the Guoran ÊûúÁÑ∂, which Read identifies as the \\"proboscis monkey, Nasalis larvatus\\", lists synonyms of Yu Á¶∫, You Áãñ, Lei or Wei Ëúº, and Xianhou ‰ªôÁå¥ \\"transcendent monkey\\". > Guo Pu: Guoran is an animal that cries in a way as if it is calling its own > name. Luo Yuan (ÁæÖÈ°ò): If one of them is caught, a whole group of them will > cry and attack. Even when some are being killed, others will stay by. So it > is called Guoran. The term means \\"assured,\\" meaning when one is endangered, > it can be assured that the others will come to its rescue. A big one is > called Ran, or Yu. A small one is called You or Lei. People in the south > call it Xianhou [‰ªôÁå¥]. Chen Cangqi [Èô≥ËóèÂô®]: The book Nanzhou Yiwu Zhi: In the > area of Jiaozhou there is a kind of animal called Guoran. It is bigger than > an ape. Its body is no more than three chi long, but its tail may rise above > its head when erect. Its nostrils open upward. At times of rain, it will > hang itself on a tree with its tail stuffed into its nostrils. Its hair is > long, soft, fine and slippery. It is white with black stripes, resembling > the colored feathers of a gray duck. Its hide and fur can be made into very > warm fur coats and quilts. The book Er Ya recorded an animal with \\"upward > nostrils and long tail,\\" which is really this animal. Li Shizhen: Guoran is > an animal that is kind. They are found in the mountains in the south-west. > They live in trees. Guoran looks like an ape. It has a white face with black > cheeks. It has a big moustache and multicolored hair. Its tail is long and > forked at the tip. When it rains, Guoran stuffs the forked tips of its tail > into its nostrils. They like to travel together, the aged ones in the front > and the young ones at the back. When they find food, each gives the chance > to others to eat first. They live together harmoniously and love each other > dearly. When one is endangered, all the others will come to its rescue. As > Liu Zongyuan [Êü≥Â≠ê] noted, it is an animal that is benevolent, polite, filial > and kindhearted. In ancient times, the animal was painted as an image of > politeness, filial piety and wisdom. However, it is an animal that is very > suspicious. When they see a man coming they will climb up a tree and change > positions many times. Sometimes they will run wildly, breaking their heads > or legs. That is why people say that if a person is so suspicious, he can be > compared to this animal. (tr. Luo 2003: 4127, cf. Read 1931: no. 402) This guoran heading has two subheadings. Mengsong ËíôÈ†å or Menggui ËíôË≤¥ (see below). Chanhu ÁçëÁå¢, which the Shuowen writes with the \\"rat radical\\" Èº† as zhanhu shu Êñ¨™ïÆÈº†, is described by Li Shizhen > It is a kind of Guoran. It is black with a white stripe on the waist like a > belt. Its hands are covered with long white hair. They are held in a manner > as if clutching a piece of board. The book Shudi Zhi [ËúÄÂú∞Âøó]: The Canhu looks > like a monkey. It moves very fast and stays in the trees all the time, > jumping from one tree to another like a bird. (tr. Luo 2003: 4127, cf. Read > 1931: no. 402B) ===Mengsong=== Mengsong ËíôÈ†å or menggui ËíôË≤¥ (lit. \\"cover praise\\" or \\"cover expensive\\") \\"a dark monkey, a skillful rat-catcher\\" is an obscure ancient name. Read (1931: no. 402A) suggests mengsong was the \\"mongoose, Herpestidae mungo\\". The Erya succinctly defines mengsong as \\"shaped like a [nao] monkey\\" (ËíôÈ†åÁå±ÁãÄ). Since the Erya dictionary, which glosses words from the Chinese classics, has the oldest textual usage of mengsong, the name presumably comes from a lost pre-Qin classic. Guo Pu's commentary gives the synonym menggui and says (tr. Read 1931: no. 402A), \\"An animal like a small [wei] proboscis monkey, purple black in color, from Yunnan (‰∫§Ë∂æ \\"Annam\\"). They are reared as rat catchers better than cats.\\" Guo says these monkeys came from present-day central Vietnam, specifically Jiuzhen ‰πùÁúü and Rinan Êó•Âçó, modern Kh√°nh H√≤a Province and Ngh·ªá An Province. The Tang author Duan Chengshi's (853) Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang says, \\"Cats are also named menggui or wuyuan ÁÉèÂì° [lit. \\"crow member\\"].\\" The Bencao gangmu subsumes mengsong under the guoran \\"monkey\\" entry (tr. Luo 2003: 4127): \\"Mengsong is also called Menggui. It is small Guoran. Purple and black, it is found in Jiaozhi. It is raised in houses. It catches mice even better than a cat or a leopard.\\" ==Taxonomy== Fran√ßois' langur The simians (higher primates) of China include two families of Old World monkeys (Cercopithecidae) and lesser apes or gibbons (Hylobatidae, lit. \\"wood walkers\\"), listed with modern Chinese nomenclature: *Family: Cercopithecidae (ËàäÂ§ßÈô∏Áå¥Áßë) **Genus: Macaca (ÁçºÁå¥Â±¨) *** Stump-tailed macaque Macaca arctoides (Áü≠Â∞æÁå¥) *** Assam macaque Macaca assamensis (ÁÜäÁå¥,ÈòøËñ©ÂßÜÁå¥) *** Rhesus macaque Macaca mulatta (È¶¨È®Æ) *** Tibetan macaque Macaca thibetana (ËóèÈÖãÁå¥) **Genus: Semnopithecus (Èï∑Â∞æËëâÁå¥Â±¨) *** Gray langur Semnopithecus entellus (ÁÅ∞ËëâÁå¥) **Genus: Trachypithecus (ÁÉèËëâÁå¥Â±¨) *** Fran√ßois' langur Trachypithecus francoisi (ÈªëËëâÁå¥) *** Bonneted langur Trachypithecus pileatus (Êà¥Â∏ΩËëâÁå¥) *** White- headed langur Trachypithecus poliocephalus (ÁôΩÈ†≠ËëâÁå¥) **Genus: Rhinopithecus (‰ª∞ÈºªÁå¥Â±¨) *** Black snub-nosed monkey Rhinopithecus bieti (ÊªáÈáëÁµ≤Áå¥) *** Gray snub- nosed monkey Rhinopithecus brelichi (ÈªîÈáëÁµ≤Áå¥) *** Golden snub-nosed monkey Rhinopithecus roxellana (Â∑ùÈáëÁµ≤Áå¥) *Family: Hylobatidae (Èï∑ËáÇÁåøÁßë) **Genus: Bunopithecus (ÁôΩÁúâÈï∑ËáÇÁåøÂ±¨) *** Hoolock gibbon Bunopithecus hoolock (ÁôΩÁúâÈï∑ËáÇÁåø) **Genus: Hylobates (Èï∑ËáÇÁåøÂ±¨) *** Lar gibbon Hylobates lar (ÁôΩÊéåÈï∑ËáÇÁåø) **Genus: Nomascus (ÈªëÂÜ†Èï∑ËáÇÁåøÂ±¨) *** Black crested gibbon Nomascus concolor (ÁôΩÈ†∞Èï∑ËáÇÁåø) *** White-cheeked crested gibbon Nomascus leucogenys (ÁôΩËÉ∏Èï∑ËáÇÁåø) *** Eastern black crested gibbon Nomascus nasutus (Êù±ÊñπÈªëÂÜ†Èï∑ËáÇÁåø) ==Zodiac== The Monkey is the ninth of the twelve- year animal cycle in the \\"Chinese zodiac\\". The Year of the Monkey is associated with ninth Earthly Branch symbol shen Áî≥ denoting the southwest direction and seventh lunar month. For example, one Year of the Monkey begins February 8, 2016. ==Mythology== Sun Wukong fighting a wind demon. Several mythical or semi-mythical monkeys are mentioned above in the Terminology section. Early texts treat the juefu Ë≤úÁà∂ (cf. Japanese kakuen) as both a factual \\"large ape found in western mountains\\" and a mythological \\"single-sex species that abducts and mates with humans\\"; said to be either all males (viz. fu Áà∂ \\"father\\") who rape women (Soushenji) or all females who rape men (Bencao gangmu, cf. xingxing). The early pictographs for nao Â§í \\"monkey\\" and kui Â§î \\"a legendary demon with a human face and body of a monkey/dragon\\" were nearly identical. Chinese legends say that foreign textiles used xingxing Áå©Áå© blood as a scarlet dye. Many Chinese mythological creatures are said to resemble monkeys or apes. For instance, the xiao ÂõÇ is described as \\"a long-armed ape\\" and the shanxiao Â±±È≠à \\"mountain imp\\" supposedly had a human face and a monkey's body. The lake-dwelling shuihouzi Ê∞¥Áå¥Â≠ê \\"water monkey\\" is said to like drowning people. Based on the data for the juefu, xingxing, and feifei, Van Gulik concluded that, > [E]ach of these three \\"monstrosities of the mountains\\" is a composite > figure: a combination of two entirely different creatures, as observed by > those ancient Chinese ‚Äì hunters, travelers and soldiers ‚Äì who ventured into > the virgin mountain forests of the south-west. In the first place, glimpses > caught of some larger simioid. In the case of the [feifei], the \\"human\\" > face, long lips, and long red hair could apply to the orangutan. I leave it > to zoologists to decide whether it is at all possible that two thousand > years ago the habitat of the orangutan could have reached as far north as > Indo-China. Second, Chinese impressions gathered during encounters with the > aborigines. In this direction point the \\"nearly human speech\\", the pelting > with stones, and the killing and/or abducting of man and women. Ever since > during the Han dynasty the southwest was brought into the orbit of Chinese > administration, these mountain tribes have succeeded in retaining their > identity ‚Äì even though Chinese rule was oppressive, and punitive expeditions > against them launched as late as the end of the nineteenth century. > Relations between the tribes and the Chinese were always uneasy, and Chinese > tales about the aborigines often mention their killing and abducting Chinese > citizens. The theory that [juefu], [xingxing], and [feifei] are the combined > result of such observations is also supported by the fact that in the oldest > pictures preserved, the human features prevail over the simian. (1967:28‚Äì29) Like the Indian monkey-god Hanuman in Hindu mythology, Chinese deities sometimes appear in the guise of monkeys. The best-known of these is Sun Wukong, the main protagonist in Wu Cheng'en's picaresque novel Journey to the West, also known as Monkey. In the southern regions of China, many temples were built to the monkey-god who is worshipped as the Qitian dasheng ÈΩäÂ§©Â§ßËÅñ \\"great saint equal to heaven\\", which was a name of Sun Wukong. Wolfram Eberhard (2003:192) explains, \\"It is not only in Indian mythology that the monkey plays a leading part; it is also found in South Chinese and in Tibetan legend. Several varieties of monkey are native to South China; and according to one Tibetan myth, the Tibetan people are descended from a monkey\\", namely Pha Trelgen Changchup Sempa. \\"Tales of women who have been abducted and ravished by monkeys and who have then given birth to children, are common in South China, and several Chinese 'clans' attribute their origins to such a union.\\" Eberhard (1968:53) calls Yang Ê•ä the \\"Monkey Clan\\", citing the totemistic myth recorded in the Soushenji and Fayuan Zhulin that the Yangs living in southwestern Shu (state) (modern Sichuan) were descendants of monkeys. The Soushenji (12, tr. Eberhard 1968:52) \\"reported that in the southwest of Shu there were monkey-like animals whose names were [jiaguo Áå≥Âúã], [mahua È¶¨Âåñ], or [jueyuan ÁéÉÁåø, see \\"Jue and Juefu\\"]. These animals abducted women and sent them back when they became pregnant. If the baby were not accepted, the woman would have to die. Therefore these children were raised and they received the clan name Yang. For this reason this clan occurred quite frequently in Southwest Shu.\\" According to orally transmitted accounts collected from the Miao ethnic group of China, at first there were no people, but rather the ancestors of modern humans were monkeys. One day the monkeys went to play in a cave, where a divine dragon resided. The dragon blew upon the monkeys its divine breath, which caused them to be transformed into modern human beings. (Yang 2007:105) ==Religious significance== Gibbon reaching for the moon's reflection, Ohara Koson, 1926. Chinese religions use monkeys and apes as metaphors for people. In Chinese folk religion, some shape-shifting monkeys were said to be human ancestors. In Daoism, monkeys, particularly gibbons, were believed have longevity like a xian \\"transcendent; immortal\\". In Chinese Buddhism, on the one hand, monkeys symbolized restless and foolish humans, and on the other hand, Gautama Buddha was supposedly a benevolent monkey king in an earlier incarnation. ===Folk religion=== Chinese traditional folk religion regards monkeys as supernatural beings. Eberhard (1968:50) cites early reports that monkeys \\"could talk\\", \\"knew the past\\", and \\"were like men\\". Jan Jakob Maria de Groot's classic study of Chinese religions (1908:202) distinguishes \\"monkey demons\\" and \\"were-monkeys\\", both of which could shape shift between a monkey and a human. While a monkey demon \\"often acts as a dangerous devil\\" (frequently transforming in order to have sex with a human), a were-monkey was usually virtuous (e.g., the monkey who takes human shape in order to become a Buddhist monk, Xuanshizhi ÂÆ£ÂÆ§Âøó). \\"Monkey demons\\" could assume both male and female forms. De Groot (1908:603) describes them as either \\"a lewd fornicator of wives and maids\\" or \\"a seductress, in beautiful female forms, of adults and inexperienced youths, whose senses it bewitches at the detriment of their health\\". For instance, the (4th century) In Search of the Supernatural records a monkey-demon story from the era of Emperor Xiaowu of Jin. > In the [Taiyuan] period (376‚Äì396) of the [Jin] dynasty they kept a monkey in > the back palace of [Dizhao Êò≠Áøü], prince of [Dingling], in front of the > chambers of his concubines. These women once upon a time simultaneously got > in the family way, and each of them gave birth to three children that danced > and hopped while discharging from the bowels. [Zhao] thus being convinced > that the monkey was the culprit, killed the beast and the children; which > made the women burst out all at once into wailing. He interrogated them, and > they avowed they had seen a young man dressed with a yellow silk robe and a > white gauze cap, a most lovely personage, jesting and chatting quite like a > man (tr. de Groot 1908:603-4) Legends about monkey-human interbreeding are common, as noted above Jue ape- men copulate with women and Zhou monkey-women copulate with men. The Youyang zazu (tr. Eberhard 1968:51) tells a legend that the Chinese peoples were descendants of simians: \\"a monkey married the female servant of a daughter of heaven and thus became ancestor of the [Ji]; another monkey also married the servant of a daughter of heaven and became founder of the [Cheng]\\" ‚Äì using Ji Âß¨ (lit. \\"imperial concubine\\") as \\"a general term for southern peoples\\" and Cheng ÂÇñ (or cang ÂÇñ \\"coarse; vulgar\\") as \\"an insulting word for North Chinese who had migrated to the south\\". The Baopuzi lists ways to protect oneself from mountain demons associated with different astronomical days (chap. 17, tr. Ware 1967:288), including \\"On a day shen [Áî≥ \\"Monkey\\"], a man calling himself a lord is a monkey [Áå¥]; a [day jiuqing ‰πùÂçø], an ape [Áåø].\\" \\"Were-monkeys\\" (named in analogy with werewolf) were frequently older monkeys that transformed into humans. The (c. 1st century) Wu Yue Chunqiu (De Groot 1908:201) tells a story about King Goujian of Yue (r. 496‚Äì465 BCE) wanting to improve his army's military skill. One of his ministers suggested: > I have recently heard about a virgin girl in [Yue] who has come from the > southern forest. The people of that country praise her (martial skill). I > request you to summon her, and grant her an interview at once.\\" The king of > [Yue] sent envoys to summon her to be questioned about the art of fighting > with sword and halberd. When the virgin set out for the north for an > audience with the king; she met on her way an old man. He said his name was > Mr. [Yuan] and addressed her \\"I have heard that you are skilled in > swordsmanship, I wish you would show me!\\" The girl replied \\"Your handmaid > would not dare to conceal anything from you. You just test me!\\" Thereupon > Mr. [Yuan] swept his walking staff over a cluster of bamboo trees, and (in > that one sweep) laid all the twigs and branches bare. Before the falling > leaves had reached the ground, however, the girl had caught them all (on her > sword), Mr. [Yuan] then flew up into a tree, and changed into a white > gibbon. (tr. van Gulik 1967:40) Mr. Yuan is named Yuan Gong Ë¢ÅÂÖ¨, a wordplay upon yuan Áåø \\"gibbon; monkey\\". Noting that this \\"monkey-man\\" called himself a member of the Yuan Ë¢Å (\\"monkey\\") clan, De Groot says, \\"In subsequent ages it continues a feature of monkey-myth to represent were-monkeys as persons bearing that tribal name, just as man- foxes were ‚Ä¶ often believed to be members of the Hu tribe.\\"‚Äîreferring to the pun between hu Áãê \\"fox\\" and the Hu ËÉ° (\\"barbarian\\") clan (see de Groot 1908:195). Baiyuan \\"White Gibbon\\" painting by Jesuit lay brother Giuseppe Castiglione, 18th century Baiyuan ÁôΩÁå® \\"white gibbons\\" like \\"Mr. Yuan\\" were considered to be spiritually powerful. The (c. 239 BCE) L√ºshi Chunqiu has a \\"knack story\\" about the legendary archer Yang Youji È§äÁî±Âü∫ and a shen baiyuan \\"supernatural white gibbon\\" that instinctively knew the intentions of humans. > Yang Youji and Yin Ru were both men of highly refined skills. In the > courtyard of the palace of Chu there was a magical white ape, which even the > best archers could not hit, and so the king of Chu asked Yang Youji to try. > Yang Youji picked up his bow and arrows and went to try. Before shooting, he > had already pinned it with his arrows; with a single shot, the ape fell. > Thus, Yang Youji had the ability to hit his target before actually hitting > his target. (chap. 24, tr. Knoblock and Riegel 2000:619) The (121 BCE) Huainanzi tells a simpler version of this story. > The king of Chu had a white ape. When the king himself shot at it, the ape > grabbed his arrows to show off. He ordered Yang Youji to shoot it. When > [Yang] began to draw the bow and aim the arrow, [even] before he shot, the > ape hugged a tree and shrieked. This is hitting the target before hitting > the target. (16, tr. Major 2010:648) ===Daoism=== Daoism, like Buddhism, paradoxically treats monkeys as both foolish and wise animals. The (c. 4th‚Äì3rd centuries BCE) Daoist Zhuangzi illustrates the gibbon/macaque distinction (see Symbolism section). The first story is about a jugong ÁãôÂÖ¨ \\"macaque/monkey trainer\\". > To weary the spiritual intelligence by trying to unify things without > knowing that they are already identical is called \\"three in the morning.\\" > Why is this called \\"three in the morning\\"? Once upon a time, there was a > monkey keeper who was feeding little chestnuts to his charges. \\"I'll give > you three in the morning and four in the evening,\\" he told them. All the > monkeys were angry. \\"All right, then,\\" said the keeper, \\"I'll give you four > in the morning and three in the evening.\\" All the monkeys were happy with > this arrangement. Without adversely affecting either the name or the reality > of the amount that he fed them, the keeper acted in accordance with the > feelings of the monkeys. He too recognized the mutual dependence of \\"this\\" > and \\" that.\\" Consequently, the sage harmonizes the right and wrong of things > and rests at the center of the celestial potter's wheel. This is called > \\"dual procession.\\" (chap. 2, tr. Mair 1994:16‚Äì17) Zhuangzi tells a yuan Áåø \\"gibbon\\" parable to the King of Wei. > Master Chuang passed by the King of Wei wearing patched clothing made of > coarse cloth and shoes tied together with twine. \\"How come you're so > wretched, master?\\" asked the King of Wei. \\"It's poverty,\\" said Master > Chuang, \\"not wretchedness. When a scholar possesses the Way and integrity > but cannot put them into practice, he is wretched. When his clothing is > tattered and his shoes have holes in them, he is poor, not wretched. This is > called, 'not having met with the right time': Has your majesty not seen the > high-climbing gibbon? When it is on a nanmu, catalpa, or camphor tree [all > tall, straight trees], the gibbon grasps the branches with its hands and > feet or wraps around them with its tail, moving nimbly among them. Even Yi > and P'engmeng [the famous mythical archers Houyi and his disciple] would not > be able to take accurate aim at it. When, however, the gibbon is on a > silkworm thorn, ramosissimus, thorny limebush, or matrimony vine [all short, > thorny bushes], it moves furtively and glances sideways, shaking and > trembling all the while. This is not because the gibbon's sinews and bones > have become stiff and lost their suppleness, but because it finds itself in > an inconvenient situation and cannot show off its ability. Now, if I am > situated under a benighted ruler and confused ministers, and still wish not > to be wretched, how could I be so?\\" (20, tr. Mair 1994:194) The Daoist discipline of daoyin \\"guide and pull\\" is based on the notion that circulating and absorbing qi \\"breath; life force\\" in the body can lead to longevity or even immortality. Long-limbed animals were believed to be innately adept at absorbing qi and thus acquire \\"occult powers, including the ability to assume human shape, and to prolong their life to several hundred years\\" (van Gulik1967:38). For example, the (c. 4th century) Chunqiu Fanlu (tr. Van Gulik) says, \\"The gibbon resembles the macaque, but he is larger, and his colour is black. His forearms being long, he lives eight hundred years, because he is expert in controlling his breathing.\\" The Baopuzi lists animals associated with longevity, including (chap. 3, tr. Luo 2003:4124, cf. Ware 1967:56), \\"A macaque may evolve into an ape after 800 years. After another 500 years it evolves into Jue, and Jue will evolve into Chanchu (toad) after 1,000 years.\\" Guanyin, gibbon, and crane scrolls, Muqi Fachang, 13th century Another animal associated with longevity was the he È∂¥ \\"crane\\", whose long neck and legs supposedly enabled the bird to absorb qi and live up to a thousand years. The pair of yuanhe ÁåøÈ∂¥ \\"gibbon and crane\\", both of which were famous for their graceful movements, became a literary and artistic trope for a \\"long life\\". The (624) Yiwen Leiju encyclopedia quotes a Baopuzi story, not found in the received text, about King Mu of Zhou (r. 976‚Äì922 BCE). \\"When King Mu of the [Zhou] dynasty made his expedition to the south, his entire (routed) army was transformed. The \\"gentlemen\\" [ÂêõÂ≠ê] among his troops changed into gibbons or cranes, the \\"small men\\" [Â∞è‰∫∫] into insects or grains of sand.\\" (tr. Van Gulik 1967:39), noting that this widely quoted passage \\"sets up the gibbon as the gentleman among the primates ‚Äì a position he has kept till the present day.\\" ===Buddhism=== A monkey offering honey to help feed the Buddha. When Buddhism was first transmitted into China circa the 2nd century CE, monkeys were already an ancient tradition in Buddhist texts. Sutras frequently quote the Buddha to use \\"monkey\\" similes. The Dhammapada (334, tr. Buddharakkhita 1990:102) says: \\"The craving of a person given to heedless living grows like a creeper. Like the monkey seeking fruits in the forest, he leaps from life to life (tasting the fruits of his kamma).\\" The Samyutta Nikaya (12.61, tr. Bodhi 2000:595) says: \\"Just as a monkey roaming through a forest grabs hold of one branch, lets that go and grabs another, then lets that go and grabs still another, so too that which is called 'mind' and 'mentality' and 'consciousness' arises as one thing and ceases as another by day and by night.\\" Several of the Jataka tales describe the Buddha's past lives as a monkey or an ape (see the Four harmonious animals). For example, the Mahakapi Jataka or Great Monkey King. > In the heart of a Himavat there was a large tree, which bore excellent > fruits even bigger than the palmyra nuts having exceedingly sweet flavor; > lovely hue and fragrance, which no man had ever seen or noticed before. This > tree was also the abode of several monkeys; and the Bodhisatta was born as > the king of those monkeys. He was much larger in size than his followers; > and was more compassionate and virtuous than others. One day, the monkey > king noticed that a branch of the tree had grown just over the stream. It > alarmed him, because some of the fruits might drop in the stream, which then > might get carried away to the man‚Äôs world; and the men would then certainly > come to have all the fruits for themselves. So, he instructed the monkeys > not to let any fruit grow on that branch if they wished to enjoy the fruits > for a longer period. ‚Ä¶ [However, one piece of fruit fell and floated > downstream, where it came into the hands of a king who] tasted it, and then > remarked, \\"Nothing could surpass the flavor of this fruit\\". He then ordered > his men to hunt for the tree in and around the river-bank which bore the > fruit. Soon the king‚Äôs men found out the tree laden with such luscious and > delicious fruits. When they saw the monkeys enjoying those fruits, which > their king wanted to have so eagerly, they attacked the monkeys mercilessly > with volleys of arrows. Witnessing the approaching attacking royal soldiers > the Bodhisatta jumped on a mountain peak, which the other monkeys were not > likely to copy. There, in order to save his friends he seized a strong > rooted tall cane with his legs and bending it towards the tree jumped back > and caught hold of the branch of the tree. He then called upon the other > monkeys to use him as a bridge to jump upon the mountain peak. Taking > advantage of the situation all the monkeys jumped on the mountain and darted > away quickly. The monkey king was, however, terribly bruised and injured by > being trampled by his mates when acting as a bridge for them. Soon he > swooned. The king watched the flight of the monkeys; and also the plight of > the monkey king. He was greatly moved by the exemplification of such > insight; courage; valor; and sacrifice, which an animal had just displayed > to save the lives of his subjects. The king then ordered his men to > delicately bring down the unconscious ape and gently place him on a couch > and to render the best possible first aid. When the great monkey regained > his consciousness the king asked him to explain as to why did he endangered > his life to save his subjects, who were rather meant to serve or sacrifice. > Like a guru, he then said, \\"O King! Verily my body is broken but my mind is > still sound; I uplifted only those over whom I exercised my royal powers for > so long.\\" And before the king could utter some words of praise for the great > monkey; he found him dead. (tr. Varma 1999) Chinese Buddhists adapted and expanded upon these traditional \\"monkey\\" metaphors for human qualities. A famous Chan Buddhist example is the Chinese xinyuan \\"mind monkey\\", which is a Buddhist psychological metaphor describing \\"unsettled; restless; inconstant\\" mentality. The word xinyuan ÂøÉÁåø \\"heart-/mind- monkey\\" is frequently combined with yima ÊÑèÈ¶¨ \\"thought-/will-horse\\" in the four character idiom xinyuan yima or yima xinyuan, reflecting the previously mentioned association between monkeys and horses (and a major motif in the Journey to the West). ==Literature== Monkeys are a traditional theme in Chinese literature. Besides the prominent \\"Monkey King\\" Sun Wukong mentioned above, gibbons and macaques are popular images in Chinese poetry. Van Gulik (1957:51) says nearly every Chinese poet who wrote from the 3rd to 7th centuries referred to the \\"graceful movements of the gibbon and his saddening calls\\". For instance, the Tang poet Li Bai wrote poems about gibbons ÁôΩÁåø in the Qiupu ÁßãÊµ¶ region (in south-central modern Anhui Province). :In [Qiupu] there are many white gibbons, :Swirling through the trees as so many snow flakes. :Pulling their young with them along the thin branches, :Drinking they play with the reflected moon in the water. (tr. Van Gulik 1967:61) A modern example is Robert van Gulik's Judge Dee story \\"The Morning of the Monkey\\", published in The Monkey and the Tiger. ==Symbolism== Method of Writing, a scribe with an ink brush and a monkey with paper, from Athanasius Kircher's 1667 China Illustrata Reflecting the simial likenesses among humans, monkeys, and apes, many languages symbolically use \\"monkey; ape\\" words in reference to people. English monkey, for instance, can mean a \\"mischievous child\\", \\"person with minimal intelligence and/or bad looks\\", or \\"menial employee who does a repetitive job\\"; and ape can mean \\"uncivilized person\\", \\"wild; crazy\\", or \\"imitate; mimic\\". Compare the Chinese words houzi Áå¥Â≠ê \\"monkey; mischievous/glib person\\", hour Áå¥ÂÑø \\"monkey; endearing term for a child\\", and houjing Áå¥Á≤æ \\"monkey spirit; clever and roguish person\\". Zhou dynasty culture symbolically contrasted the gibbon as \\"gentleman; sage\\" (junzi ÂêõÂ≠ê or sheng ËÅñ) and the macaque as \\"commoner; petty person\\" (xiaoren Â∞è‰∫∫). > A sharp distinction was drawn ‚Ä¶ between the superior gibbon and the inferior > macaque. The macaque, frequently coming down to inhabited areas to forage, > and therefore often seen and easily caught, became a familiar sight in daily > life. Trained macaques formed part of the performances of travelling > showmen, amusing young and old alike by their clever tricks. The gibbon, on > the contrary, inhabiting as it did the upper canopy of the primeval forest, > rarely seen and extremely difficult to catch, was regarded as a denizen of > the inscrutable, forbidding world of the high mountains and deep valleys, > peopled by fairies and goblins. Accordingly, the macaque was the symbol of > human astute trickery but also of human credulity and general foolishness; > and the gibbon the symbol of the world of the supernatural, mysterious and > remote from man's daily life. (van Gulik 1967:37) See the Zhuangzi stories (under \\"Daoism\\"). Eberhard (1968:52) describes a traditional Chinese literary motif that monkeys will sometimes seduce and impregnate women, who give birth to either a monkey-child or a monkey spirit. Thus, in the \\"popular mind\\", says Eberhard (1986:192), a monkey can also symbolize an adulterer. ==Art== Two gibbons in an oak tree by the Song dynasty painter Yi Yuanji. Tri-Color Glazed figure of a monkey riding a horse, Tang dynasty. The earliest Chinese monkey-shaped objects (Geissemann 2008:1), believed to have been belt hooks, date from the late Eastern Zhou period (4th‚Äì3rd centuries BCE) and depict a gibbon with outstretched arms and hook- shaped hands. The oldest extant painting of a monkey is attributed to the Buddhist monk and artist Guanxiu (832‚Äì912). It shows a gibbon offering peaches to a Luohan ÁæÖÊº¢ \\"arhat\\", which (Geissemann 2008:6) says \\"firmly establishes this painting in a Buddhistic context\\". Gibbons became a popular subject for Chinese painters (for example, Yi Yuanji, fl. 1050‚Äì1075) during the Northern Song dynasty, and then again from the Southern Song dynasty into the Yuan dynasty, especially for the Chan Buddhist monk Muqi Fachang (1210?‚Äì1269?) (Geissemann 2008:6‚Äì7). Monkeys are a frequent motif in modern Chinese art. Several examples (Eberhard 2003:193) are based on a visual pun between hou ‰æØ \\"marquis; count\\" and hou Áå¥ \\"monkey\\". Since mashang È¶¨‰∏ä literally means \\"on horseback\\" or figuratively \\"immediately\\", an image of a monkey riding a horse is called mashang fenghouÈ¶¨‰∏äÂ∞Å‰æØ \\"May you immediately be conferred the rank of marquis\\", which is a Chinese gift of congratulations for gaining promotion. Another visual pun showing one monkey crouching on the bei ËÉå \\"back\\" of another bei Ëæà \\"generation\\" can be interpreted as \\"May you rank as marquis from generation to generation\\"; and a painting of two monkeys in a tree has the same signification. Another frequent image is a monkey holding a peach, as in the 16th-century novel Fengshen Yanyi, which refers to a legend that a monkey stole the peaches of Immortality from the garden of Xi Wangmu \\"Queen Mother of the West\\". The familiar three wise monkeys are a Japanese, rather than Chinese, pictorial maxim to \\"see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\\". See Monkeys in Japanese culture for more information. ==Pharmacology== Simians have played a role in traditional Chinese medicine, \\"which maintains that the meat, bones and livers of monkeys have various curative effects, ranging from detoxification to improving sex drive\\" (Chen 2007). Chinese state-owned medicine companies buy about 2 tons of monkey bones annually, estimated as \\"taken from at least 1,500 primates.\\" The (1597) Bencao gangmu lists pharmacological uses for four monkeys. The mihou \\"monkey; macaque\\" (Read 1931: no. 400B) is the most versatile. *rou ËÇâ \\"meat\\": \\"Pickled in wine it is good for chronic malaria, and all kinds of lassitude. It is prophylactic against malaria. In the south it is considered a delicacy smoked or salted.\\" *tougu È†≠È™® \\"skull\\": \\"Ashed and given with wine for malaria. Boiled in water it is used as a bath for children in convulsions, and for feverish chills.\\" *shou Êâã \\"paw\\": \\"For children in convulsions.\\" *shi Â±é \\"feces\\": \\"Applied to spider bites. Ashed and given with honey to children in convulsions, and for colic.\\" *pi ÁöÆ \\"skin\\": \\"To treat infectious diseases in horses. A female monkey kept in the stable of a horse is most effective. The menstrual fluid [houjing Áå¥Á∂ì] shed on to the straw is eaten by the horse and the latter gets a lasting immunity against infectious disease.\\" The meat and blood of a rong Áã® \\"gibbon\\" (1931: no. 401B) are used for anal fistula, and the fat for scabies. Read notes \\"The placenta, liver, and bile of the gibbon are used in Japanese Domestic medicine.\\" The meat of a guoran ÊûúÁÑ∂ monkey (Read 1931: no. 402) is prescribed for malaria and chills. The meat of a xingxing Áå©Áå© monkey (1931: no. 403) supposedly \\"cures drowsiness and hunger, and desire for a cereal diet, it allows an exhausted man to travel well, and old age will not tell on him\\". This refers to the Daoist bigu \\"avoiding grains\\" fasting technique associated with achieving xian \\"transcendence; immortality\\". ==Cuisine== Simulated monkey brains displayed at the Tao Heung Foods of Mankind Museum as part of a Manchu Han Imperial Feast Monkey meat, as mentioned above in the Bencao gangmu, was traditionally considered both a medicine and a delicacy in Chinese cuisine. Several Chinese classics record the practice. The L√ºshi chunqiu (tr. Knoblock and Reigel 2000:310) lists roast \\"lips of the xingxing ape\\" among the five finest meats. The Yiwuzhi (tr. Eberhard 1968:51) records a \\"special soup made of monkey head was typical for southern peoples.\\" The Huainanzi (19, tr. Major et al 2010:784) has a story about eating monkeys: \\"A man from Chu had some boiled monkey meat that he gave to his neighbors. They thought it was dog meat and found its flavor pleasing. Later, when they heard it was monkey, they knelt down and vomited all they had eaten. This was a case of not even beginning to know about flavor.\\" Eating monkey brains, hounao Áå¥ËÖ¶, is a controversial practice. Qing emperors ate monkey brains during feasts known as the Manchu Han Imperial banquet (Gayley 2017: 42). According to Stephen Chen, the son of chef Joyce Chen, Qing emperors \\"were partial to scooping out the brain of a living monkey for a tasty treat, and the practice continues to this day, particularly in some southern provinces\\" (2007). Modern day official Chinese policy with regards to the procurement of certain monkeys for food makes their consumption illegal, with sentences of up to 10 years in prison for violators (Li 2016: 76‚Äì77, 80). ==Martial arts== Monkey Kung Fu, or houquan Áå¥Êã≥ \\"Monkey Fist\\", refers to several Chinese martial arts techniques utilizing monkey-like movements. Modern Chinese movies have popularized the Drunken Monkey style. The monkey is a secondary animal style, besides the basic Five Animals, or wuxing ‰∫îÂΩ¢ \\"Five Forms\\", of Tiger, Crane, Leopard, Snake, and Dragon. The Huainanzi (7, tr. Major et al 2010:250) criticized yogic practices like the yuanjue ËùØË∫© \\"gibbon leap\\": \\"If you huff and puff, exhale and inhale, blow out the old and pull in the new, practice the Bear Hang, the Bird Stretch, the Duck Splash, the Ape Leap, the Owl Gaze, and the Tiger Stare: This is what is practiced by those who nurture the body. They are not the practices of those who polish the mind [e.g., the Perfected].\\" ==Pets== The history of pet monkeys in China goes back at least to the Spring and Autumn period (771‚Äì476 BCE). The scholar Robert van Gulik, who was a great fancier of gibbons, wrote (1967:14), \\"there is only one objection to keeping a gibbon as pet, namely that one is liable to become too fond of it, and cannot bear to part after one's pet has reached maturity.\\" The Huainanzi (2, tr. Major et al 2010:107) mentions caging a gibbon, \\"If you put an ape in a cage, it will be just like a pig. It is not that it is no longer clever or agile but that it has nowhere to give free rein to its ability.\\" The text (16, tr. Major et al 2010:639) also mentions a beloved pet gibbon, \\"The king of Chu lost his [pet] ape, and [to recapture it] he destroyed every tree in the forest.\\" This was likely King Gong of Chu (r. 590‚Äì560 BCE) who is identified with a related story (16.89, tr. Major 2010:648) concerning \\"The king of Chu had a white ape\\" that could catch arrows shot by archers. ==Other== Traditional Chinese holidays include the Monkey King Festival celebrated on the 16th day of the 8th lunar month, and the Birthday of the Monkey God, celebrated in Singapore on the 16th day of the 1st lunar month. Nanwan Monkey Island is a nature reserve in Hainan, China. \\"Monkey\\" is also a popular name for foodstuffs including Chinese teas: *Baimao Hou ÁôΩÊØõÁå¥ \\"white-haired monkey\\" is a type of green tea originating from the Wuyi Mountains in Fujian Province *Houkui tea Áå¥È≠Å \\"monkey chief\\" is a type of green tea originating from Taiping County in Anhui Province *Golden Monkey tea or jinhou cha ÈáëÁå¥Ëå∂ is a type of black tea originating from the Fujian and Yunnan Provinces ==See also== *\\"Autumn Day in Kui Prefecture\\", a poem by Du Fu mentioning macaque monkeys hanging in chains. *Monkeys in Japanese culture *Simians (Chinese poetry) *Vanara, monkey-like humanoids in the Ramayana ==References== *Bodhi, Bhikku, tr.

After spending several years as an unsigned musician, she finished in fourth place on the thirteenth season of American Idol. Her debut album, What's So Hard About Bein' a Man, was self- released in 2011, three years before she gained national exposure on reality television. While competing on American Idol, she became the first person in the history of the series to perform an original song during the finals. Her second album, Halfhearted, was released on August 3, 2018, through Warrior Records. ==Early life and education== Meuse was born in Round Rock, Texas, on October 19, 1990 to Charles Edward and Sheila Arlene (Strobel) Meuse. Her mother's government job led to the family moving several times when Meuse was a child. As a way to be more outgoing as a pre-teen, she recorded CDs and gave them to friends. While living in Zephyrhills, Florida in 2002, she attended St. Anthony Catholic School in nearby San Antonio, Florida. It was there, at the school's talent show, that she acknowledges performing publicly for the first time. When she was in the seventh grade, she moved to Slapout, Alabama, where she joined the Montgomery Youth Orchestra, eventually becoming principal second violin. She also played shows of her own at various festivals, fundraisers, schools, and public events. In addition to the violin, she plays both guitar and piano. She attended Auburn University at Montgomery, where she majored in liberal arts. ==Musical influences== Meuse states she is, \\"influenced by virtually every genre of music.\\" More specifically though, she has called her style \\"a blend of southern rock with alternative and rock n‚Äô roll.\\" Mary Colurso of AL.com has described it as \\"rock...infused with country and metal.\\" Meuse's musical influences include Coldplay, Miranda Lambert, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Stevie Nicks, Death Cab for Cutie, Bruno Mars, and Shinedown. ==Music careerCareer beginnings and What's So Hard About Bein' a Man (2008-2014)=== Meuse began writing music at age eighteen. Her first song was called \\"What's So Hard About Bein' a Man\\". She went on to self- release a CD by the same name in 2011 and had already written around sixty original songs by the time of her American Idol audition. In October 2010, Meuse won the Stars of Alabama Artist Showcase, a statewide music competition that was judged by professionals from Montgomery, Atlanta and Nashville. In October 2013, Meuse was featured by the Alabama Media Group in the Birmingham Sessions, an online showcase for musicians around the Birmingham, Alabama area. She auditioned for The Voice before her American Idol run, but did not pass the initial blind audition. ===American Idol (2014)=== While participating as a musical act in Vans Warped Tour, Meuse was encouraged by friends to audition for the thirteenth season of American Idol in Atlanta, Georgia. She performed an original song called \\"Blue-Eyed Lie\\" and was accepted by all three judges. For her final Hollywood week performance, Meuse chose another original song called \\"Done.\\" The judges were initially undecided between putting Meuse or Jesse Roach through to the top 30. To decide, the judges had Meuse and Roach do an impromptu sing-off. Meuse's performance of \\"Simple Man\\" (by Lynyrd Skynyrd) advanced her to the Top 30. All of the contestants reprised their audition songs for top 8 week, giving Meuse the opportunity to sing \\"Blue Eyed Lie\\" again. This made her the first contestant in the history of American Idol to sing an original song during the finals. For top 4 week, Meuse was originally going to sing another original song, called \\"The Hell You Put Me Through\\" - all of the contestants were going to sing originals for one of their performances that week. However, the producers changed their minds late in the week and gave the contestants a short amount of time to choose a replacement from a very limited list of songs. Meuse chose Pinks's \\"So What.\\" Meuse's fan base is known as \\"The Meuse Mafia.\\" She has jokingly referred to her experience on the show as being like the Hunger Games, and in one episode, she braided her hair in the same style as Katniss Everdeen. Several reviewers and journalists felt that Meuse was unfairly treated by the show, such as Annie Barrett, who wrote for TVLine that the judges were \\"just blatantly not rooting for her at all. Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo! Music concurred, writing that \\"it seemed like the judges and producers were doing their best\\" to get Meuse eliminated from the competition. Parker further wrote that Meuse received \\"harsh critique\\" for praise-worthy performances, even as the judges overlooked significant flaws in other contestants. BuddyTV writer Jeff Dodge opined that Meuse was being held to an unfair \\"double standard.\\" Writing for TV Guide, Liz Raftery assessed fan opinion as being \\"frustrat[ed]\\" with the judges, over their poor treatment of Meuse. Meuse was never among the \\"Bottom 3\\", until top 7 week, when the \\"Bottom 2\\" was composed of her and the eliminated contestant, Dexter Roberts. The following week, Meuse was again in the \\"Bottom 2\\", but C.J. Harris was eliminated. There was no bottom 2 for top 5 week. The contestants were offered a choice - if they agreed unanimously, that week's results would be discarded and all five of them would move on to perform again. Two of them would then be eliminated the following week. Although Meuse voted in favor of this idea, the vote was not unanimous, and Sam Woolf was eliminated. Meuse herself was eliminated the following week. She came in fourth place and reprised \\"Blue Eyed Lie\\" as her exit song. Meuse performing with C.J. Harris during the American Idol season 13 tour. { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !Episode !Theme !Song choice !Original artist !Order !Result - Audition Auditioner's Choice  \\"Blue-Eyed Lie\\"  Jessica Meuse N/A Advanced - Hollywood Round, Part 1 A Capella Not aired Not aired N/A Advanced - Hollywood Round, Part 2 Group Performance  \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" with Stephanie Hanvey, Nica Nashae, and Cara Watson  Beyonc√© N/A Advanced - Hollywood Round, Part 3 Solo  \\"Done\\"  Jessica Meuse N/A  Advanced -  Top 31 (10 Women) Personal Choice  \\"Drink a Beer\\"  Luke Bryan 7 Advanced - Top 13 This is Me \\"The Crow & the Butterfly\\" Shinedown 10 Safe - Top 12 Home \\"White Flag\\" Dido 3 Safe - Top 11 Songs from the Cinema \\"The Sound of Silence\\" Simon & Garfunkel 2 Safe - Top 10 Billboard Top 10 \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" Foster the People 8 Safe - Top 9 I'm with the Band! \\"Rhiannon\\" Fleetwood Mac 6 Safe - rowspan=2Top 8 rowspan=2Back to the Start Solo \\"Blue-Eyed Lie\\" Jessica Meuse 1 rowspan=2Safe - Duet \\"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\\" with Caleb Johnson Stevie Nicks & Tom Petty 5 - rowspan=2Top 8 rowspan=2Songs from the 1980s Solo \\"Call Me\\" Blondie 6 rowspan=2Safe - Duet \\"Islands in the Stream\\" with Dexter Roberts Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton 10 - rowspan=2Top 7 rowspan=2Competitors' Choice Solo \\"Gunpowder & Lead\\" Miranda Lambert 2 rowspan=2Bottom 2 - Trio \\"Compass\\" with C.J.

She had already gained positive attention for the song in Alabama a year earlier after performing it for an artist showcase held by the Alabama Media Group. At that time, Mary Colurso of AL.com commented on the song, calling it \\"confident and gritty\\". \\"Blue-Eyed Lie\\" was further lauded by the press after Meuse performed it on American Idol. Jennifer Still of Digital Spy wrote that the song \\"absolutely rocks - literally and figuratively. It sounds like a song you could hear on the radio tomorrow\\", Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo! Music called Meuse's performance of the song \\"stellar\\", and Brian Mansfield of USA Today praised the song's \\"'60s garage-rock\\" sound. Michael Slezak of TVLine, who praised the song for its gritty vocals and \\"stinging lyrics\\", went on to rank Meuse's live performance of \\"Blue-Eyed Lie\\" as one of the thirty greatest moments in the history of American Idol. ===Post-Idol and Halfhearted (2014-present)=== Meuse returned to the American Idol stage for the season 13 finale, where she performed with Jennifer Nettles. She then performed in the American Idol summer tour, which began on June 24, 2014 and went through August 23. Following the tour, Meuse went back to performing shows mostly in Alabama and Georgia, although she also played occasionally in California and Tennessee. In early 2015, she told The Hollywood Reporter that she had intentions of moving to Los Angeles. Her debut single, \\"Done,\\" was released independently on April 21, 2015, and her second single, \\"Rio Grande\\", was released on January 5, 2016. Although Meuse expressed on Twitter in late 2016 that she considered Los Angeles to be her \\"second home\\", she continued to reside primarily in Slapout until the end of that year, when she moved to Houston, Texas for a position with the Lone Survivor Foundation. Around that same time, she announced that she had an EP in production. Within a few months, the EP had been expanded into a full album. Titled Halfhearted, it was released through Warrior Records on August 3, 2018 as Meuse's first post-Idol album. Four songs from Halfhearted were released as singles leading up to the album's release: \\"Love Her Better\\" on June 1; \\"High\\" on June 15; \\"California Dream\\" on June 29; and \\"Thank God It Didn't Work\\" on July 13. \\"Thank God It Didn't Work\\" was released to country radio, and Taste of Country praised the song, calling it, \\"a full- throated vocal showcase that demands your attention.\\" Meuse departed from Warrior Records in 2019. Among the tracks on Halfhearted is \\"Without You\\", a duet between Meuse and Bo Bice. In June 2020, Fred Bronson of Billboard praised \\"Without You\\" as an \\"overlooked gem\\". ==Personal life== Meuse has called herself a \\"very spiritual person\\" and has said that she is driven by her faith. She has over eight tattoos and designed at least seven of them herself. She has two on her right arm - one of a phoenix and one of a dove surrounded by three stars. She has said that these represent spiritual rebirth and the Holy Trinity. On her left arm, she has a tattoo of the word \\"Faith\\". After she and Jena Irene Asciutto participated in American Idols thirteenth season together, they got matching tattoos of the Roman numeral XIII. Meuse loves animals and has many pets that were rescued from shelters, as well as several that she found abandoned. Meuse's mother, Sheila, worked as the assistant director of the Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System, where in 2014, she became a whistleblower exposing mismanagement in the VA. Her efforts, and the VA's subsequent retaliation against her, have been detailed by the Montgomery Advertiser and NPR. ==DiscographyAlbums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! style=\\"width:10em;\\" Title ! style=\\"width:18em;\\" Details - ! scope=\\"row\\" What's So Hard About Bein' a Man  * Release date: 2011 * Label: Independent * Formats: CD * Recorded and mixed by Tony Buenger at Guest House Studios - Eclectic, Alabama * Mastered by John Scrip at MASSIVE Mastering - Schaumburg, IL - ! scope=\\"row\\" Halfhearted  * Release date: August 3, 2018 * Label: Warrior Records } ===Singles=== {  - !

James plays a sheriff in a small town who has a dark past that he can not remember, only to have to confront it when his ex-partners show up looking for stolen money they believe he has. == Plot == Five masked robbers steal $10 million from a Las Vegas casino. All but one, who is shot in the head and assumed dead, are captured, but the money goes missing. Ten years later, Cole, the leader, is broken out of jail by the rest of his gang: Stillman, Boyd, and Cole's half-brother Kane. From a boastful mechanic, they learn that their former partner apparently survived and escaped with the money due to the intervention of a local physician. They track the physician to Baker, a small, isolated town with many secrets. They find Doc, the physician, at a local bar and, from him and other patrons, learn that the sheriff mysteriously appeared ten years ago. Curious, they start a bar fight in order to draw out the sheriff, who they realize is Pike, the partner who escaped. Pike now calls himself Bishop and claims to suffer from amnesia and migraines from the bullet fragments lodged in his head. Cole saves Bishop's life during the bar fight, and Bishop runs a belligerent biker gang out of town. Later, Boyd and Kane suggest that they raze the town in search of the loot. Stillman objects, and Kane suggests that Stillman has gone soft. Cole is able to smooth things over and decides to instead probe Bishop to see how much he remembers. The two men discuss the town, and Cole drops a few hints about Bishop's past. Cole asks Bishop to call a coin toss, but Bishop declines and says that it is meaningless, as a man will do what he wants regardless of the result. Cole, who was holding a gun on Bishop under the table, holsters his weapon and does not interfere when Bishop leaves. Meanwhile, Bishop experiences trouble with his step-daughter, London, whose mother, Carmen, has a past with Cole. Unknown to Bishop, Cole and Carmen were once lovers, and she moved to Baker to escape her previous life. Cole attempts to rekindle their romance, but she refuses. Boyd fatally injures Doc while researching Bishop, and Bishop learns more about his past from Doc's notes. As he dies, Doc explains that he was the one who treated Bishop. Spurred on by the information in Doc's notes, Bishop begins to remember bits of his past, though he still does not know where the money is. Boyd and Kane become restless and start trouble in the town. After a fight with her boyfriend, London makes out with Kane. When she refuses to have sex, Kane rapes her. At the local diner, Boyd attempts to force himself on the waitress which attracts the attention of the deputy. Boyd engages in a draw with the town's deputy, an award-winning sharpshooter, and wins, only to be shot down by Bishop, who is faster. Stillman, outraged that Kane would rape a teenage girl, confronts Kane and is killed by him. Bishop and Cole meet at the town's church, and Cole reveals that he has recruited the biker gang to replace his fallen men. Cole reveals Bishop's criminal background to the populace and gives them until sunrise to find the missing money. At the local diner, Cole takes London hostage in order to ensure Bishop's cooperation. Disarmed and without the support of the townspeople, Bishop is close to giving up when Carmen reveals that she knew about Bishop's past the whole time and still accepted him. She recovers a hidden pistol and gives it to Bishop, who then goes to the diner to confront Cole. Kane uses London as human shield, to the disgust of all the others. The biker gang leaves in protest, and Cole shoots Kane dead himself, to the surprise of Bishop. As Cole leaves the diner, Bishop stops him and says that they still must settle their issues. The two have a duel, and Bishop kills Cole. Concerned that his criminal background has now become commonly known, Bishop prepares to go on the run. However, the townspeople rally behind him and offer to cover up the recent events. Bishop stays on the town's sheriff, and an aerial shot reveals the spot where the money is hidden. == Cast == * Lennie James as Bishop * Grant Bowler as Cole * Jean-Claude Van Damme as Stillman * Josh Henderson as Boyd * Brad Carter as Mechanic * Daniele Favilli as Kane, Cole's half-brother * Alfred Molina as Doc, the town's physician * Catalina Sandino as Carmen * Freya Tingley as London, Carmen's daughter * Rene Napoli photo double for Jean-Claude Van Damme Abby Miller, Guy Wilson, Courtney Hope, Peter Vack, Arie Verveen, Richard Whiten, Dawn Lewis, and Tracey Walter appear as townspeople. == Production == Exchange Peaks Film Capital financed the production.

Shortly after his participation on the series, he released the EP Pretend, which reached the top ten on Billboards Heatseekers chart. Since then, he has released several non-album singles. ==Early life== Sam Woolf was born on April 19, 1996 in West Bloomfield, Michigan to Mary and Scott Woolf. His great-grandfather, Sammy Woolf, was a well-known Detroit bandleader, his uncle is composer Randall Woolf, and pianist Kathleen Supov√© is his aunt (by marriage). His great-uncle, Mickey Woolf, was a musician prominent in Detroit's Jewish community. Woolf was a student at the Scotch Elementary School in West Bloomfield, but moved to North Port, Florida in 2006 when he was 9. When he was 13, his mother remarried and moved to another city in Florida, and Woolf and his older sister Emily remained in North Port with their father. Woolf and his father moved to Bradenton just prior to his sophomore year of high school, where he attended Braden River High School. At the beginning of his junior year, he moved in with his grandparents who also live in Bradenton. Woolf's first live public performance was at his sixth grade talent show where he performed The Beatles' \\"Hey Jude.\\" Woolf later became interested in music as a career, took singing lessons from an opera teacher, Bob Lischetti, and performed locally in Bradenton. He also was mentored at the Del Couch Music Education Foundation and went to Interlochen Arts Camp in Michigan for four weeks the summer after his sophomore year of high school. In the summer of 2013, Woolf completed a five-week program at the Berklee College of Music and was selected as one of the top four songwriters for their singer showcase, where he performed an original song, \\"The Same.\\" While he was in Boston, the audition for the thirteenth season of American Idol was held near Berklee College of Music and at his mother's suggestion, he decided to attend the audition.

The campus is located in the southern tip of Barangay Fatima in the municipality of Ubay in the province of Bohol. The school is duly administered by the Department of Education. It is the second science high school in Bohol, next to Tagbilaran City. ==History== The school was established through the collaborative efforts of education heads and political officials who dreamed to provide quality education for the students of Ubay and beyond. A year later after the success of creating a science high school in Tagbilaran City, the former Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) - Region VII approved the establishment of the school in 1996, through the joined hands of then schools district supervisor Clarita V. Alesna, 2nd District Congressman Erico B. Aumentado and former municipal mayor Manuel B. Alesna. On July 1, 1996, the school was formally opened wherein top elementary graduates of the municipality were enrolled to form the pioneer batch. The institution was first named Ubay Science and Laboratory High School. At first, students and faculty members utilized the multi-purpose building in Ubay Central Elementary in Poblacion as their temporary shelter. Although the building was considerably small, the organization found a way to maximize the facility. It was later subdivided into five small rooms, which houses the a single classroom, faculty room, small library, computer room and a mini-theater. The first set of faculty members were Clarita V. Alesna, Reynita Haduc, Ricarlena Catacutan and Arlene Ocdenaria. Mrs. Reynita Haduc was the first school principal and led the campus on its first 7 years. The campus produced its first batch of graduates in 2000. ==The Campus== The present-day two-storey school building was built in 1998 to accommodate the growing population of the institution. It was formally inaugurated on June 1998. The site of school building was donated by the philanthropist Eutiquio del Valle, a grandson of former Bohol governor, Eutiquio Boyles. The institution changed its name to Ubay Science High School, when the class opened on June 1998. It was later changed to Ubay National Science High School through the Republic Act No. 10034 in 2001 during the third regular session of the 14th Congress. ==ClassesAdmission=== A prospective student must pass the competitive and screening examination in order to be admitted to the school. Students are ranked according to their results, in which top passers are guaranteed slots in the campus. In case a student doesn't want to enter the school, or wants to enrol to another campus, students from the waiting list are called up to be enrolled in the institution in order to complete the slots allotted for the batch. Students from other science high school campuses may apply for transfer to the institution. However, they must meet a grade requirement. ===Curriculum=== The school offers a science and mathematics-oriented curriculum called Engineering and Science Education Program (ESEP). Department of Education devised this type of curriculum for specialized high schools in the Philippines. {  - ! SUBJECT ! Grade 7 ! Grade 8 ! Grade 9 !

It was opened on 31 May 1827 to replace two previous chapels, one run by the secular clergy and the other by the Jesuits. It is also the home of the Durham University Catholic Chaplaincy and Catholic Society. From 2012 to 2016 the parish was entrusted, along with the chaplaincy, to the Dominican Order, and its congregation has since maintained the Dominicans' influence.History from StCuthberts-Durham.org retrieved 20 February 2014 The church is a protected building, being part of the Elvet Green Conservation Area.Durham: St Cuthbert's RC Church safe for generations to come from Independent Catholic News retrieved 20 February 2014 It is named for St Cuthbert of Lindisfarne, the 7th century bishop, healer and patron of Northern England. ==History== Distribution of English Recusant Catholics 1715-1720. County Durham is the second down on the north-east coast. Although the establishment of the church goes back to 1827, the building has served a community of Durham and Northumberland Catholics that is continuous from the beginning of Catholic persecution at the English Reformation. While the Church of England became the official and only public Church for many centuries, English Catholic communities remained in the North ‚Äì St Cuthbert's was founded by such a Catholic community in Durham. In 1569, Durham was the theatre for the Rising of the North. Promoted by the Catholic Percys and Nevilles, respectively the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, Northern English nobles rose against Elizabeth I to bring the Catholic Church back to England in a rebellion that climaxed with the Catholic Mass revived and celebrated at Durham Cathedral. The following year, the priest who celebrated at this Mass, Thomas Plumtree, was drawn and quartered in the market place. Plumtree was beatified by Pope Leo XIII in 1886, and St Cuthbert's maintains relics of his arm and hand. === Catholics in Old Elvet, Durham === By the early 17th century, there were Jesuit priests serving the Catholic community based at 33 and later 45 Old Elvet, operating a chapel that was later destroyed by a mob celebrating the Glorious Revolution of 1688 which ousted the Catholic King James II. From the 1660s to the late 18th century, Catholic landed gentry, of which there were many in the Durham/Northumberland region, began to buy up property in Old Elvet region in order to be close to the concealed Catholic worship. Votive Masses are still said at St Cuthbert's for the noble Catholic families. One Such family, the Salvins of nearby Croxdale, remain patrons of the congregation and can trace their patronage back to the 16th century. The Salvin coat of arms can be seen among those of other northern Catholic families on the wooden rood-screen behind the high altar. The 18th century saw degrees of toleration gained, except for the Jacobite rising of 1745. The Catholic Relief Act of 1791 saw the legality of Catholic public worship, and a permanent chapel was built in Elvet along with a residence for a Vicar Apostolic, a Catholic bishop, for Northern England. Interior of St Cuthbert's with the high altar and heraldic rood screen. === Catholic Emancipation and Erection of the Current Building === The Vicar Apostolic of the Northern District from 1790 to 1821 was Bishop William Gibson, who lived and regularly celebrated Mass there. The current building was built in 1827, two years before the Catholic Emancipation of 1829, which saw a restoration of civil and religious rights. The church was designed by Ignatius Bonomi, and while made to reflect the English gothic style, was built relatively level with other Old Elvet buildings and without a tower in order for the Catholics to remain somewhat discreet. In 1869, the tower was added to the church and in 1910 it was finally consecrated on 20 July. === Modern History === From 2012 to 2016, the Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle entrusted the parish to the Dominican Order who would also provide Catholic chaplains to Durham University with Fr Benjamin Earl, O.P. as prior, parish priest and chaplain. In 2013, a seven- month ¬£300,000 refurbishment program was initiated and was completed in February 2014. Since 2012, St Cuthbert's has seen growth, especially in the student body. The incorporation of Dominican customs and liturgy ‚Äì much of which has been maintained after the Dominicans left, is helped by the current parish priest, Fr Andrew Downie. ==Parish== St Cuthbert's is one of the largest Catholic parishes in the diocese of Hexham and Newcastle. It has a parish choir and a student choir. They sing a variety of repertoire, including Gregorian chant, Taiz√©, polyphony and Anglican music.

The 2014 Daraa offensive (also known as the Battle of Geneva Houran) was a campaign during the Syrian Civil War launched by rebel forces, including the Free Syrian Army and the Islamic Front and Al-Nusra Front, to push back government forces in the Daraa Governorate, Quneitra Governorate, and As-Suwayda Governorate, in southwestern Syria, and thus opening the road to Damascus. The offensive was launched on 3 February 2014 and declared after a meeting between FSA battalions and Islamic factions, which established a joint operations room. It was also reported that the FSA operations rooms in Daraa, Damascus and Quneitra were incorporated in this joint operations room as well. Local rebel commanders stated that thousands of rebels who had western military training would be involved in the Daraa offensive. The Persian Gulf states had promised to send rebels in Daraa large amounts of weaponry, including anti tank weapons and air missiles. ==OffensiveStart of the offensive, Army counter-attack and stalemate=== In the first days of the offensive, it was reported that rebels captured the Atman checkpoint in Daraa, destroying another one and captured Army positions around the town of Atman. On 14 February 49 rebel groups affiliated with the FSA announced that they united under one armed entity called Southern Front. That same day a car bomb killed at least 33 people (including 12 rebel fighters) in the rebel-held village of Yabuda. Activists accused the Syrian government to be behind the attack. It was also reported that 22 people (including 19 civilians) were killed by air strikes on rebel-held areas in Daraa province.Syria warplanes hit Yabrud near Damascus On 16 February, Brigadier General Salim Idris was dismissed and replaced by Brigadier General Abdul-Ilah al-Bashir as FSA Chief of Staff. The same day, rebels captured an Army checkpoint in the village of Western Gharia, but lost it the next day.DARAA REBELS LOSE CHECKPOINT, KEEP SPOILS, 19 February 2014, Syria:direct On 18 February, rebels from the town of Busra al-Harir, in the eastern part of Daraa province attacked and captured the military outpost known as the Chemicals Battalion or Kimyaa Battalion, west of Dwera village, but the Syrian Army recaptured it hours later. During the fighting, 22 soldiers and dozens of rebels were killed or injured. In conjunction with the attack on the post, rebels attacked the city of Busra al-Sham, near Daraa's border with the southwest of Suwaida province. However, government forces were able to repulse the attack. For its part, the Army launched a surprise offensive during the morning using tanks and air strikes against the villages of al-Hajjeh, al-Dawayeh al-Kubra, al-Sughra, Bir Ajam and al-Buraika in the central and southern parts of al-Quneitra. On 19 February, the Syrian Air Force began heavy air raids on rebel positions in Daraa governorate, as rebel fighters were preparing for a major push towards Damascus in the following days. On 22 February, according to a military source, government forces captured the areas of Rasm al-Hour and Rasm al-Sad, south of the town of Quneitra. The SOHR confirmed troops were on the offensive, with the Air Force also taking part in the attack. On 23 February, nine rebel groups (including Jabhat Al-Nusra and Ahrar Al Sham) announced the start of a new battle focused on eight military zones belonging to the 61st Brigade in western Daraa countryside. On the night of 25 February, rebels, led by the Al-Nusra Front, made an attempt to capture the Tal al-Jabiyah military facility, which reportedly contained chemical weapons. International military commanders based in Jordan warned the rebels to leave the weapons alone and hand them over to them in the case they capture the bunker complex or an Israeli airstrike would be called in on the location. The rebels agreed. However, by the next day, rebels were still pushing to take control of Tal Al Jabiyeh. The Amman command centre than halted all weapons supplies to the assaulting forces, apparently in a successful effort to delay their advance on the bunker. Without supplies, the rebels were forced to consolidate their positions around the base and not seek to capture it. Over the next two days, government reinforcements arrived and by 1 March the military managed to push back the rebels. On 26 February, the Syrian Army tried to advance towards the towns of Inkhil and Nawa and reinforced their positions to the south of the village of Al-Nuaimeh the next day, while the rebels tightened the siege they had imposed on Army checkpoints in the area, in an attempt to block reinforcements from reaching government troops. On 11 March, the Syrian Air Force conducted seven airstrikes on rebel- held areas in southern Daraa province, while the district of Daraa Al-Balad was bombarded by the 285th battalion. On 19 March, the rebels took control of the central Gharaz prison in Daraa province after the Syrian Army retreated towards the grain silos. An opposition source stated that 294 prisoners were freed. Other sources stated that about 300 to 400 prisoners were freed and claimed that the vehicle training grounds to the south of the prison and a ‚Äúsecret facility‚Äù were also captured by the rebels. After the capture of the prison, the battlefront shifted towards the silos in an attempt by the rebels to take control of them. As of 20 March, rebels in Daraa were unable to progress north past the line of government-held towns at Nawa, Sheikh Maskeen and Izraa. The Army had also taken up defensive positions, but it could not attack from these positions. Overall, a stalemate ensued. The main reason for the lack of a rebel advance was said to be that no new weapons had arrived across the border from Jordan.Mohammed Ali al-Haj Ali and Elizabeth Parker- Magyar, THREE YEARS LATER, SOUTH SYRIA‚ÄôS DARAA PROVINCE LOCKED IN STALEMATE, 20 March 2014, Syria:direct On 21 March, rebels captured the grain silos and the Gharz gas station, located near the Daraa Gharaz prison. Rebels also claimed to have seized armoured vehicles after the fighting. After the capture of the silos, heavy clashes broke out on the perimeter of the Qussad military checkpoint, while the Syrian Air Force bombarded the Gharz area. The SOHR reported by the end of the day that the rebels also took the Qussad military checkpoint.A summary of events on Friday, 21/03/2014 ===Renewed rebel advance and FSA-Nusra tension=== On 7 April, rebels captured one of the twin military hills of Tulul al-Humur in Quneitra province after it was besieged for weeks. On 14 April, rebels advanced towards Tal al-Jabiyah hill, which is one of several that are part of the Brigade 61 Army base and is the main one protecting the base from the west, after capturing several bunker positions throughout the area earlier in the year. By 24 April, rebels captured Tal al- Jabiyah hill and the village of Al Sekkariyyi, near Nawa. The rebels seized two tanks and large caches of weapons.

The same day, the FSA- affiliated Southern Syrian Revolutionary Front was established, consisting of some 20 rebel groups. Three days later, several rebel commanders belonging to this front (including the commander: Colonel Ahmad Al-Na‚Äômeh) were arrested by the al-Nusra front. This incident evoked tension in Daraa, with some moderate rebels saying that they will attack al-Nusra Front if the commanders are not released from custody. A mediation committee had been set up to deal with the case, involving leading figures from both sides, as well as tribal sheikhs. Colonel Ahmad Al-Na‚Äômeh was forced to make a confession on video after four days of detainment. On 5 May, rebels announced the start of a new offensive called \\"Allahu Akbar‚Äù in the aim to capture the Matouq al-Kabir hill, Matouq al-Saghir hill and Kharbat Fadi area on the perimeter of Inkhil city.

Both hills were captured after three days of fighting. It was also reported that seven rebels were killed by a pipeline explosion between Nasib and the Gharz area, and that one of the previously arrested rebel leaders was released by the Al-Nusra Front. On 6 May, rebels captured the Syrian Colonel Mohammad Hassan Kanaan on the highway between Damascus and Daraa. Kanaan was one of the 24 people who nominated themselves to stand in the 3 June presidential election. It was also reported that an emir in the al-Nusra Front and his wife were assassinated by a car bomb. On 8 May, rebels launched a military operation against al-Qahtania, al-Hamedia, Quneitra Crossing and the al-Rawadi checkpoint in Quneitra province. The Army launched a counter-attack after rebels captured al-Qahtania village. On 15 May, rebels detonated a 'tunnel bomb' in the Al-Manshiyah district of Daraa city after announcing a new offensive. ===New Army counter-attack=== On 16 May 2014, the Army launched a counter-attack, firing 100 rockets and carrying out 15 air strikes on Nawa. The focus of the government offensive were Nawa, Inkhil, Jasem and Deraa city. The next day, the military recaptured Tal al-Jabiyah hill. The military was also attempting to advance towards western and eastern Tal al-Ahmar in an attempt to prevent rebels from advancing toward Quneitra. A deal was also reportedly reached under which 2,000 rebels would be granted safe passage to evacuate from Jassem, which overlooks southern Daraa. The deal was set to expire within 48 hours. The same day, the Iranian Fars news agency claimed government troops had captured Um Al-Awsaj, opening the road connecting al- Sanamein-Zamreen-Tal al-Hara. On 19 May, the Fars news agency reported that government troops had recaptured the headquarters of Battalion 74. The next day, the agency also claimed that government forces gained full control over the area of Old Sajna Neighborhood in Daraa al-Balad and completed the encirclement of Nawa, with the Army seizing control of the Eastern neighborhood and was moving towards the National Hospital on the north-west side of the city. On the same day, rebels blew up a building used by government forces, killing dozens On 20 May, it was confirmed the Army had entered Nawa from the west and east, with fighting raging in the city.

It is not verified who conducted the attack, but Ahmad Masalma, an opposition activist in Daraa, said rebels from the Free Syrian Army umbrella group fired a mortar shell at the tent in a government-held area after repeatedly warning civilians to stay away. On 23 May, according to the SOHR, rebels captured an Army checkpoint west of Tell Umm Hawran. Four days later, it was reported that Fauzi Ayub, a senior Hezbollah commander on the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list, was killed during fighting in Nawa. ==Aftermath== On 14 June, rebels captured the strategical al-Jomou' hill base, located between Tsil and Nawa, after a siege and captured 10 pro-government fighters during the fighting. On 15 July, several rebel formations announced the start of an operation against military installations in the Al-Shaykh Saad area. Later that day, according to the SOHR, rebels managed to capture the transportation battalion base, 26th Battalion base and the tank battalion base (all belonging to the Brigade 61 base complex) in Al-Shaykh Saad. The next day, 13 rebel groups announced the formation of a single operation room for Daraa province.

The cabinet was chaired by the UDF leader Ivan Kostov who shared the cabinet posts between his party and his allies. This was the largest margin of victory since the end of communism in 1990, to this day. Kostov's government was the first since 1990 to serve its entire four-year mandate. == Background == In the previous parliamentary election (1994) the Bulgarian Socialist Party won a majority of the seats and the UDF was reduced to 69 seats. Up to that point in time the UDF had formed government only once, under Philip Dimitrov, and governed for one year only (1991-1992). The tide turned on the socialists, however, after the economic meltdown during the winter of 1996-1997 and the government was forced to step down.Crampton, p235 After declaring their intentions to form a new government, the UDF and other opposition parties staged mass rallies demanding snap elections. Eventually the Socialists bowed to the pressure and agreed. After a caretaker government was appointed in February, early parliamentary elections were scheduled for April, two years before otherwise scheduled.

In the journey, they both come to know that they hail from the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh. When Sirisha asks Krishna about the details of his father, the scene shifts to the native place of Krishna where his father, a don fondly called as Anna (Mohan Babu) and as Annagaru with respect, punishing a teacher named Sankar Rao for harassing his pregnant wife for dowry on the complaint of the woman's father Rama Rao. Anna is a sexagenarian man who always thinks about the welfare of the people of Rayalaseema, and they too revere him equal to god. Anna is a very powerful and influential don who also controls the political affairs of that region. His friend Ananda Rao (Paruchuri Gopala Krishna), a ruling party politician, is his close friend, and he and the party extends their full support to Anna to stop the Nandavaram project whose happening would destroy 34 villages completely. On the other hand, a group of influential people working under a mysterious man tries to make the project to earn crores. The group consists of KR, Vedantham Murthy aka Vedam (Tanikella Bharani), Chandi (Jeeva), and Seshagiri, who is fond of cakes. Krishna visits his home when Anna kills his opponent Guruva Reddy (Banerjee) and appoints the dead man's henchmen as his henchmen by promising a little high salary. Then the family of Anna is introduced. Anna is survived by his wife Lakshmi (Jayasudha), elder son Bhushan (Kishore) and Krishna. Bhushan is married and has a kid, but he never loved them and hates them to the core. Unlike Anna and his dutiful and devoted brother Krishna, Bhushan is a spoiled brat, often terrorizing people in the name of Anna, creating fear in their hearts. When a young woman's brother warns Bhushan, Bhushan comes to their home, kidnaps the woman, and conducts a sexual assault on her in his farmhouse. Bhushan, also because of his anger on his father apart from greed for money, joins hands with KR's group for formation of Nandavaram project. Meanwhile, Krishna and Sirisha are deeply in love, and Anna's trusted henchmen Ramudu finds out that she is Gavarraju's daughter. Gavarraju was Anna's enemy who was killed by Anna at Tirupathi during an assassination attempt. Though Sirisha is aware of it, she has no objection to join his family, and Anna too respects Krishna's decision to marry her and accepts their alliance. Meanwhile, Sirisha informs Krishna in their regular meeting that her friend is kidnapped and kept in Anna's farmhouse by Bhushan, who trashed her brother recently. She also adds that none dared to convey the same to Anna because of Bhushan. Krishna tells the whole matter to Anna, and when he finds the woman assaulted there, he apologizes to her and tells Ramudu to drop her in her home. He also house arrests Bhushan there forever to ensure safety of the innocent people. But on the request of Lakshmi, he lets him enter his house again. Later, Ramulu invites Anna and Lakshmi for attending his daughter's wedding and they accept it happily. However, Sirisha 's brother reveals to Krishna that Anna is going to be fatally attacked in the way. At the time of execution, firing starts on Anna's vehicles, and in this confusion, Bhushan kills his wife and son and none knows that. Anna is severely injured and attacked by the rivals who are killed by Krishna. Anna is sent to the nearby hospital. Inspector Gogin Rao (Ravi Babu) asks Anna's men to get out of the hospital as the patients and their relatives are frightened seeing them carrying weapons. This results in a brawl between Krishna and Gogin Rao and the former is arrested for attacking a police officer on duty. However, it is later revealed that Gogin Rao is not as sincere as he appears and works for KR. Sirisha goes to police station and tells Krishna that Anna is going to be attacked again by the rivals' men. Krishna goes there and saves Anna from the goons. Later, as both the plans are failed, Bhushan goes to the hospital carrying oranges to hospital and leaves soon. He keeps explosives inside them so that Anna dies because of a blast as suggested by KR and Vedam. Unfortunately, Lakshmi cuts them, and the blast occurs. Anna, who was in the way to the room conducting medical tests, collapses and understands what happened then. After Lakshmi's funeral is conducted, Krishna meets Anna and tells that KR, Gogin Rao, Chandi, Vedam, Seshagiri, and Bhushan are the culprits and adds that he would kill all of them. First, he kills Gogin Rao by strangulating him with a thin wire. Next, he kills Seshagiri by feeding him a poisoned (possibly cyanide-infused) cake. Then, he kills Chandi by locking him in a car filled with gas leading to suffocation. Vedam is murdered brutally and is hanged from a tree to resemble suicide. KR is shot off screen, and is and dies when lit on fire by Krishna. Later Krishna meets Bhushan, narrates Bhushan's plans and deeds to Bhushan himself, and when he feels guilty, Krishna calls him a mad dog and shoots him. Finally, during Lakshmi's last rites, the main one behind the group is revealed as Ananda Rao. His close associates hold more than 50% stake in Nandavaram project, and with that money, he planned to shift to the opposition party and win the elections. Since Anna would oppose it, he wanted to murder him and joins hands with KR and his group. On Anna's request, Krishna himself murders Ananda Rao. The film ends with Anna conducting Lakshmi's death rituals and Krishna appointing Ananda Rao's gunmen as his henchmen promising a little higher salary like Anna did in the case of Guruva Reddy. == Cast == *Vishnu Manchu as Krishna *Mohan Babu as Anna *Jayasudha as Lakshmi *Shanvi Srivastav as Sirisha *Kishore as Bhushan *Paruchuri Gopala Krishna as Anand Rao *Tanikella Bharani as Vedantham Murthy aka Vedam *Ravi Babu as Gogin Rao *Jeeva as Chandi *Banerjee as Guruva Reddy *Kalicharan Sanjay (actor) == Production == In mid November 2013, it was reported that Ram Gopal Varma would direct Vishnu Manchu which was confirmed by the actor in an interaction to the press. In mid December 2013, the project materialized and it was also reported that Ram Gopal Varma wanted to recruit Regina Cassandra as the Heroine. In the end of December 2013, Mohan Babu was said to be a part of the film and the shooting started on 26 December 2013 after a simple launch event. The filming continued at an incredible pace and in early January 2014, a song on Mohan Babu and 2000 extras was shot at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad in which the people hailed him as their Supremo and God father. After their previous film Pandavulu Pandavulu Tummeda released and became a success at the box office, it was declared in early February that the film was titled Rowdy which was confirmed by Mohan Babu at his office contrary to the reports that the film was titled Ottu, Annagaru and Seema Lekka. At the same time, Shanvi Srivastav, who was well known for her performances in the films Lovely and Adda, was selected for a short yet essential role in the film and was paired with Vishnu. In the third week of February 2014, it was reported that the film's shoot is nearing completion at an incredible speed with a romantic song on Vishnu and Shanvi being shot in just two days. The filming finally ended on 21 February 2014 in just 30 Working Days. The producers said that they had a very tough time at the time of shooting of action sequences, because of RGV's insistence on reality. The producers spoke \\"Rowdy is a film, we were really passionate about\\". It was also reported that an 11-minute action episode on Mohan Babu and Vishnu by firmly focusing the camera on them. \\"The interval sequence is by far one of the best fights I have ever done. Entire Credit to RGV. He has captured great action timing and finely tuned aggression by the two lead actors in the film\\" said Vishnu. The producers also hailed Ram Gopal Varma regarding the handling of sentimental scenes in the film. They said \\"Though the director has included lots of action and drama in the film, we admired the sentimental scenes between Mohan Babu and Jayasudha. We never expected Ram Gopal Varma to add this element with such vigour. He surprised not only me but also the lead stars, with his neat direction of the sentimental sequences. The chemistry between Mohan Babu and Jayasudha that once fluttered the hearts of moviegoers has been captured well all over again with much more intensity\\" in a statement issued to the IANS. == Marketing == The film's first look was released on 21 February 2014 on the occasion of completion of shoot. The first look received unanimously positive response. The film's trailer released on 7 March 2014 by Vishnu himself from USA. The trailer received great positive response from all the corners though some opined that the film had shades of Ram Gopal Varma's Hindi film Sarkar. On 11 March 2014 Ram Gopal Varma unveiled the promo of the romantic song Nee Meeda Ottu. The teaser of 107 seconds, which portrayed on screen chemistry between the lead stars Vishnu Manchu and Shanvi Srivastav, garnered tremendous response in means of shares and views on social networking sites within few hours of its release. As a part of promotion, Ram Gopal Varma and Vishnu Manchu visited Visakhapatnam where they interacted with media and audiences at VMax Multiplex theater. The full videos of Nee Meeda Ottu and Seema Lekka along with an action sequence were shown to the media and audiences there. After receiving good response there, the team of the film including Ram Gopal Varma, Mohan Babu and Vishnu Manchu visited Mallikharjuna theatre in Hyderabad where the team interacted with media and the audiences at the theater and also projected about 10 mins of songs and scenes from the film there. == Soundtrack == Sai Karthik composed the music and the background score for the film. In mid March 2014, it was announced that the audio would release at Tirupathi on 20 March 2014. The audio launch event was done at Sree Vidyanikethan educational institutions in Tirupati on 20 March 2014 and the whole cast and crew of the film attended the event. The audio was released on Puri Sangeet label. In the end of March 2014, it was reported that an album named Cycle Rowdy would be released which was used in the film as a tribute to Ilaiyaraaja. The background score was also dedicated to him as a tribute. Ram Gopal Varma told to the media \\"I have been a huge fan of background scores ever since I became a film buff and one of my all time favorite of music piece is the cycle chase back ground score given by Ilaiyaraaja in my debut film Siva. I still can't forget the goose bumps I got back in 1989 when Ilaiyaraaja was scoring music for that sequence. I wanted to bring the attention to track number 17 in the album Rowdy whoever ever liked and remembered that cycle chase music in Siva, I am sure they will enjoy listening to this background track.\\" He added \\"As a huge fan of this legendary musician, my main interest is to bring back this composition to express the great idea of the genius Ilaiyaraaja's 1989 soundtrack (of Siva) to 2014. I asked Sai Karthik to do an integration of the brilliant cycle chase theme from Siva into the main theme of Rowdy and it turned out to be brilliant. This is my salute to Ilaiyaraaja.\\" On the same day i.e. on 29 March 2014 the soundtrack consisting of 22 Background tracks was released by 24 Frames Factory on YouTube and other social networking sites including the Cycle Rowdy track. All the lyrics were penned by Kasarla Shyam. == Release == In early March 2014, it was reported that the film would release worldwide on 28 March 2014 clashing with Nandamuri Balakrishna's Legend. On 19 March 2014 it was officially declared that the film would release on 4 April 2014 in India and a day before i.e. on 3 April 2014 in USA. It was also reported later that the film will release with English subtitles in major markets worldwide to take full advantage of RGV film's pull across India and in the global markets. However, the leaders of Uttarandhra Joint Action Committee launched a morcha in Visakhapatnam demanding to ban the release of the movie. Alleging that the movie promotes Rowdyism, the protesters stated that they will be filing a petition with the Election Commission to ban the film's release. The protesters contested that the episodes in the movie could be inflammatory. Meanwhile, the film was awarded an A certificate without any cuts from Central Board of Film Certification. ==Reception== The film received positive reviews from critics though they drew comparisons and similarities with Ram Gopal Varma's Sarkar. The Hindu gave a review stating \\"The film is helped hugely by good performances from Mohan Babu, Vishnu and Jayasudha. While Varma can be commended for channelising Mohan Babu‚Äôs aggression in an apt role, one wish he hadn‚Äôt made the actor say ‚Äòrespect‚Äô so many times that it becomes a joke. Rowdy is one of the better films from Varma is recent times but offers nothing new in content.\\" Oneindia Entertainment gave a review stating \\"Overall, Ram Gopal Varma has taken story from his Sarkar and weaved a different screenplay for Rowdy keeping Telugu audience in mind. He has also added a few commercial ingredients to it. It is good entertainer and will be a treat for action lovers. Must watch film for Mohan Babu fans\\" and rated the film 3/5. Deccan Chronicle gave a review stating \\"Varma‚Äôs films are always technically good and ‚ÄòRowdy‚Äô is no exception. The action sequences are well choreographed, especially the one where goons surround Mohan Babu. RGV, however, is still out of touch and most of the scenes and camera angles are mere repetitions of his earlier films. If you haven't seen ‚ÄòSarkar‚Äô, you can watch ‚ÄòRowdy‚Äô, especially for Mohan Babu's performance\\" and rated the film 2.5/5. 123telugu.com gave a review stating \\"‚ÄòRowdy‚Äô is an intense action thriller that makes for a good watch. If you have seen Godfather, the impact may be a little less. The movie's appeal might be limited to A centers alone. Watch the film for Mohan Babu\\" and rated the film 3.25/5. idlebrain.com gave a review stating \\"Mohan Babu is a superb actor. After M Dharmaraju MA and Rayalaseema Ramanna Chowdary, this is the most compelling character he has done in his career. It took a director of Ram Gopal Varma calibre to present Mohan Babu in natural avatar. Plus points of the film are Mohan Babu, Vishnu Manchu, and their characterizations. On the flipside a toned-down violence and a compelling second half would have made the movie more universal. On a whole, Rowdy is a special film that adds a feather to the cap of Mohan Babu\\" and rated the film 3/5. IndiaGlitz gave a review stating \\"If you wanted to see Mohan Babu do an Amitabh Bachchan while retaining his irreverent style, 'Rowdy' fulfills that urge. The discerning might lament it as a dumbed-down version of Sarkar, though\\" and rated the film 3.25/5. ==References * Category:2014 films Category:Indian films Category:Telugu-language films Category:Films directed by Ram Gopal Varma Category:Indian crime drama films Category:2010s Telugu-language films Category:Telugu remakes of Hindi films Category:Indian political thriller films Category:2014 crime drama films Category:2014 crime action films Category:Indian crime action films Category:Indian films about revenge Category:2014 drama films ","title":"Rowdy (2014 film)"},{"id":"42004657","text":"The Townsend House is a historic building on Embassy Row in Washington DC, home to the Cosmos Club since 1952.

At the center of the story is a homosexual relationship set in Africa. ==Plot== Philippe, a bisexual painter, is living through a crisis. He is torn between his love for his wife and his attraction for young men. In Ethiopia, he meets Frank, a young homosexual, falls in love with him and takes him in as his secretary, making him part of the family like he has done with other young men. In the end, he abandons Frank just as he has undergone a sex change. The young man's disappointment causes him to commit suicide by a bullet to his temple, with the aid of his sister, who - pressured by her macho husband - was not able to live with her brother's homosexuality. ==Cast== * Ivano Staccioli as Professor Philippe Stone * Andrea Traglia as Frank * Jane Avril as Philip's wife * Kara Donati as Jeanne * Debete Eshepete * Zawdit Asta * Peter Belphet * Gianni Basso ==Production== According to Marco Giusti, the story is inspired by a novel which appeared as part of the \\"edizioni 513\\". In a statement director Alberto Cavallone gave to the Italian journal \\"Nocturno\\", he said that he was interested in exploring this type of relationship that was considered taboo at the time. Above all, he wanted to do an African story in which Africa would only be a backdrop in order to make the protagonists closer to each other. In a decolonialised Africa, Cavallone said, the whites were like the soldiers of General Custer. The shooting in Ethiopia was riddled with problems. At one point, the director and the cameraman were put into a security prison cell. ==Reception== Director Cavallone himself was not very content about the choice of Ivano Staccioli as protagonist, but neither was he content with the film itself. He stated that it was not a film that could please the public, and that that was indeed what happened. == Bibliography == * ==External links== * Category:1973 films Category:1973 drama films Category:Italian films Category:Italian-language films Category:Italian drama films ","title":"Afrika (film)"},{"id":"42004722","text":"Robert Street AO FAA (16 December 1920 - 4 July 2013) was a British academic and academic administrator.

The route was replaced by SR 48 by 1927. ==SR 51 (1923‚Äì1934)== SR 51 was a route in western Ohio that existed between 1923 and 1934. Originally, the route ran from downtown Dayton to SR 54 (currently US 33) in Willshire. In 1932, it was briefly extended north to SR 17 (now US 224) west of Middlebury before being truncated to Greenville the next year having been replaced by SR 49. By 1935, the route was fully absorbed into SR 49. ==SR 52 (1923‚Äì1926)== SR 52 was a route in southwestern Ohio from 1923 through 1926. During its first three years in existence, the route ran from Middletown to Springfield. In 1926, the route was extended northeast to SR 55 north of Irwin. The route was replaced in the next year by SR 4 due to the inclusion of US 52 in Ohio. ==SR 59 (1923‚Äì1938)== SR 59 was a route through the northern portion of Ohio from 1923 until 1938. Its eastern terminus had always been in Elyria but its western terminus had been shifted numerous times throughout its history. From 1923 through 1928, the route began in Norwalk, traveled northeast to Berlinsville, and continued east to Elyria. In 1929, the route began in Milan but within the next year, it was extended west to Bellevue. By 1939, the route had been replaced by an extended SR 113. ==SR 62 (1923‚Äì1931)== SR 62 was a route that connected Galion and Oak Harbor via Bucyrus and Fremont. The route followed the same alignment for its entire history from 1923 through 1931 when it was renumbered to SR 19 in 1931 due to the addition of US 62 in Ohio. ==SR 63 (1923‚Äì1926)== SR 63 was a route across northwestern Ohio between Carey and Sylvania by way of Fostoria, Perrysburg, and Maumee. The route was in existence from 1923 until 1926. After 1926, the route south of Perrysburg by US 23, US 20 between Perrysburg and a point northwest of Ottawa Hills, and SR 263 north of there. ==SR 68 (1923‚Äì1932)== SR 68 was a route through central Ohio that existed between 1923 and 1931. For most of the route's history, the route traveled from Dawn to northwestern Delaware County. In 1930, the route was extended east to Waldo. By 1933, due to the presence of the newly created US 68 through the state, SR 68 was renumbered to SR 47. ==SR 69== SR 69 was a major route in west-central Ohio. The route was in existence from 1923 until 1968 when most of the route was renumbered to SR 235. ==SR 70 (1923‚Äì1962)== SR 70 was a route that currently makes up the northernmost portion of SR 41. Between 1923 and 1925, the route ran from Washington Court House to Covington, but was extended south in 1926 to a point near Cynthiana. In 1962, the entire route was renumbered as extensions of other routes due to the creation of I-70 through Ohio. The route south of Greenfield became a southern extension of SR 753 and the remainder became a northern extension of SR 41. ==SR 71 (1923‚Äì1962)== SR 71 was the route that is now the full length of SR 571 which runs from Union City to US 40 just north of Crystal Lakes. The route was created in 1923 running along numerous state highways created in the 1910s. The only deviation SR 71 made from the current SR 571 was near its eastern terminus prior to 1950; instead of turning sharply south east of New Carlisle, SR 71 continued east and ended at US 40 east of Donnelsville. The route's change in designation came about in 1962 due to the creation of I-71, the route was renumbered to SR 571. ==SR 74 (1923‚Äì1962)== SR 74 was the predecessor to SR 32 that existed from 1923 through 1962. Originally, the route ran from Cincinnati (near SR 32's current western terminus) to Wayne Township, Adams County at what was then SR 137 south of Seaman. Two years later, the route's eastern terminus was moved to just east of Peebles in Franklin Township. The route became SR 32 in 1962 upon the creation of I-74 west of Cincinnati. Most of what was SR 74 is no longer maintained as a state highway since SR 32 was largely moved onto newly constructed divided highways as a part of the construction of the Appalachian Highway. ==SR 75 (1923‚Äì1962)== SR 75 consisted of what is now SR 93 from Ironton to West Lafayette and the entirety of SR 751 from West Lafayette to Stone Creek. The route existed from 1923 through 1962. Except for different routings between Otsego and Isleta prior to 1930, the route largely remained unchanged throughout its history. The route became SR 93 and SR 751 in 1962 due to the creation of I-75 in the western part of the state. The 75 number continues to exist on a historic tunnel north of Ironton. The tunnel built in 1866 was bypassed in 1960 and currently serves as a tourist attraction and a haunted house around Halloween. External links *Ironton Tunnel (Formerly OH 75) - Bridges & Tunnels ==SR 76 (1923‚Äì1972)== SR 76 was a state route that existed from 1923 until 1972 when it was renumbered to two different highways, SR 83 and SR 339, due to the renumbering of Interstate 80S to I-76. At the time of its creation in 1923, SR 76 only ran from New Concord to Wooster and followed a more westerly alignment between Coshocton and Millersburg. By 1927, the route was moved to the modern-day SR 83 alignment between Coshocton and Millersburg and extended south to Beverly. In 1932, the southern terminus was moved to Vincent and to just west of Belpre in 1935. By 1937, the route was extended north to the Lake Erie shoreline at Avon Lake; SR 76 would remain at this alignment for nearly 35 years. When the 76 route number was reused for the Interstate highway in 1972, the portion of the route north of SR 60 near Beverly became SR 83 while the part south of Beverly became an extended SR 339. ==SR 77 (1923‚Äì1962)== SR 77 was a state route that ran from Marietta to just south of Shreve. When it was created in 1923, the route only ran from McConnelsville to Trinway. In 1934, the route took over what was SR 37 southeast of McConnelsville to end in Marietta. By 1938, SR 77 was extended north taking over all of SR 234 to end at SR 514 near Shreve. When the route was renumbered due to the addition of I-77 in the state, SR 77 south of SR 39 in Monroe Township, Holmes County became an extended SR 60 while the remaining became the new route SR 754. ==SR 80 (1923‚Äì1962)== SR 80 was a state route that existed from 1923 and 1962 and ran in eastern Ohio. At the time of its creation, the route ran from Minerva to Welshfield though by 1927, its southern terminus was moved to Sandyville and its northern terminus was moved to Burton in 1939. During this period, the alignment of SR 80 had changed many times between Alliance and Edinburg. In 1941, coinciding with the establishment of the Ravenna Arsenal, the segment of SR 80 between Charlestown and Freedom was deleted leaving two segments of the route. Within one year, the northern segment became SR 700 and the remaining section's northern terminus was truncated to Edinburg. SR 80 would remain on this alignment (except for a slight realignment near Limaville in 1948) until 1962 when the route was renumbered to SR 183 due to the addition of I-80 in the state. ==SR 81 (1923‚Äì1926)== SR 81 was a state route south of Cleveland that existed from 1923 through 1926. Originally, the route ran from its western terminus at Brentwood Lake between Grafton and Elyria to its eastern end in Twinsburg. In 1926, the route was extended slightly to the east to end at Aurora. Within the year, the entire route became a western extension of SR 82. ==SR 83 (1923‚Äì1957)== SR 83 was a short state route in the northeastern corner of Ohio. The route always had its western terminus in or around Ashtabula but the route had three different alignments throughout its history. Its first alignment, created in 1923 over the former route of SR 476 started just south of Ashtabula, headed east through Sheffield and ended at the Pennsylvania state line in Monroe Township. This alignment would last until 1927. The next year, SR 83 began by traveling northeast from the southern section of Ashtabula to Kingsville then headed southeast to Monroe Center to end at SR 7. This routing would remain in place until 1938 when SR 83 swapped routes with SR 84. The final routing of SR 83 started in southern Ashtabula and traveled east (on an alignment different than the 1923 route) to Kelloggsville before jogging south to Monroe Center ending at SR 7. By 1958, SR 83 was removed from the state highway system and the roads on which it traveled were transferred to Ashtabula County. ==SR 89 (1923‚Äì1926)== SR 89 was a state route that connected Canton and Aurora between 1923 and 1926. The route was absorbed into the longer SR 43 in 1927. ==SR 90 (1923‚Äì1962)== SR 90 was the former designation for the northernmost portion of modern-day SR 170 and SR 193. Created in 1923, it started at the Pennsylvania state line near Petersburg where the road continued as PA 351 and traveled north through Youngstown to its end in North Kingsville. The route did not undergo any changes until it was renumbered in 1962 due to the addition of I-90 in the state. Most of the route became a northern extension of SR 170 that year with the small portion between Petersburg and Pennsylvania becoming an extension of SR 617. In 1969, the portion of the former route north of Youngstown became SR 193. ==SR 92 (1923‚Äì1936)== SR 92 was a short connector route in the vicinity of Ghent. The route followed Ghent Road and served as a shortcut between Akron and Parma by bypassing Montrose. The route, which existed from 1923 through 1936, was replaced by SR 176 when it was extended south to Akron. Today, the road is no longer state-maintained, the section outside of the city of Fairlawn is Summit County Road 98. ==SR 95 (1923‚Äì1926)== SR 95 was a state highway that ran between SR 13 near Strasburg to Wooster and existed from 1923 through 1926. The route was replaced in 1926 by SR 6 and is now a part of US 250. ==SR 102 (1923‚Äì1939)== SR 102 was a state route in the northwest part of Ohio. From 1923 until 1926, the route traveled from the vicinity of Holland at SR 2 to a point south of Elmore at SR 2 and US 23, mostly along the route of modern-day US 20 but including a small portion of what became SR 223 and SR 326. In 1926, SR 102 was moved off of the route of the newly designated US 20 onto a route that followed the modern-day SR 51. This routing would last until 1939 when it was replaced by SR 120. In the Ohio state highway maps of 1946 through 1949, SR 102 appears on the route of SR 120 west of Toledo to the Michigan state line. Maps prior and following these years show the route as SR 120. ==SR 106 (1923‚Äì1937)== SR 106 was the route that traveled through west central Ohio from 1923 through 1937. At the time of its designation, the route ran from Delphos to Republic by way of Fort Jennings, Findlay, and Tiffin. Two years later, the two ends of the route were moved: The western terminus was moved to SR 5 (later US 30N) near Gomer and the eastern terminus was moved to SR 2 west of Bellevue. Finally, the route's eastern end was moved to Findlay in 1927. This routing would remain in place until 1937 when the route was replaced by an extended SR 12. ==SR 108 (1923‚Äì1935)== SR 108 was a former state route in northwestern Ohio. First designated in 1923, the route originally ran from Tully Township, Van Wert County at SR 5 (now US 30) to near Alvordton at SR 23 (current US 20). Within two years, the southern terminus was moved to Hicksville. By 1930, the route was extended at both ends to state lines; the southern terminus was moved to southwest of Hicksville at the Indiana state line (also the end of SR 18) and the northern terminus was moved to the Michigan state line northwest of Fayette. Within the next year, US 127 took over all of SR 108 north of Bryan. By 1936, the route was deleted and replaced by an extended SR 2. ==SR 109 (1923‚Äì1926)== SR 109 was a state highway in western Ohio that existed from 1923 to 1926. The route ran from the Indiana state line in Harrison Township, Van Wert County to Ottawa. In 1926, the entire route became a part of SR 17 and is now part of US 224. ==SR 112 (1923‚Äì1926)== SR 112 was a former section of the current SR 51 between Sylvania and Toledo. The route existed from 1923 until 1926. In 1926, the route became renumbered to US 127 but today is a part of SR 51. ==SR 112 (1926‚Äì1950)== SR 112 was a highway from Portsmouth to Waverly. It was renumbered from part of SR 104 in 1926 because US 23 replaced the middle section of SR 104. By 1951, this route became part of SR 104 again. ==SR 112 (1965‚Äì1973)== SR 112 was a cancelled freeway named the Downtown Distributor that would have run from Interstate 75 north of the current Anthony Wayne Trail terminus through downtown, along the banks of the Maumee River. On a county map from 1973,Lucas County Engineer County Map, 1973 ramps off I-75 were to have begun a freeway marked as State Route 112. It was planned to run to the Maumee River, through the historic St. Patrick's Catholic Church. This is why neither ODOT nor the city has built it. It would have ended at the Summit Street interchange on Interstate 280, and would have had a spur providing a freeway connection to the Anthony Wayne Bridge. ===Major intersections=SR 120 (1923‚Äì1939)== SR 120 was the route that now follows the general route of SR 185. The route ran from Brock at what was first designated SR 9, later US 127 to Piqua and existed from 1923 until 1939. ==SR 124 (1923‚Äì1926)== SR 124 was a state highway between Sharonville and Franklin that existed from 1923 through 1926.

The route existed from 1923 until 1926 when it was replaced by SR 63. ==SR 126 (1923‚Äì1926)== SR 126 was a state highway that ran from Hamilton to the Indiana state line in College Corner from 1923 to 1926. In 1926, the route was replaced by three different routes: SR 224 (now SR 177) from Hamilton to just northwest of the city, the entire length of SR 130, and US 27 from McGonigle to the state line. ==SR 127 (1923‚Äì1926)== SR 127 was a state route that ran from near the Indiana state line in Scipio to the northwestern portion of Hamilton. The route existed from 1923 until 1926 when it was renumbered due to the addition of US 127 in Ohio. The route number became SR 129 and has remained on this alignment since then. ==SR 129 (1923‚Äì1926)== SR 129 was a state highway between the Indiana state line and northwestern Cincinnati. The route headed southeast from the unincorporated community of Scipio through Venice and Dunlap before ending at SR 9 in Cincinnati. First created in 1923, the route existed for about three years. In 1926, the part of the route northwest of Venice became SR 126 while the remainder became US 27. ==SR 130 (1923‚Äì1926)== SR 130 was a state route in the southwest corner of Ohio.

Steele‚Äôs professional career spanned more than 70 years. It began in 1938 when he worked in a brucellosis testing laboratory for the Michigan State Department of Agriculture while studying veterinary medicine at Michigan State University. Brucellosis developed in many of his veterinary colleagues, and he wanted to learn how the causative pathogen and other pathogens were transmitted from animals to humans. This marked the beginning of his lifelong vocation of studying and controlling zoonotic diseases. In 1941, Steele received a doctorate of veterinary medicine from Michigan State University, and in 1942, he earned a master of public health degree from Harvard University. In 1943, he was commissioned as a sanitarian in the Public Health Service (PHS). He spent most of World War II in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where he coordinated milk and food sanitation programs, evaluated zoonotic threats to the islands, and conducted research on brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis, rabies, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis. == References == This article incorporates public domain text from the CDC as cited Category:American veterinarians Category:Male veterinarians Category:Harvard School of Public Health alumni Category:Michigan State University alumni Category:1913 births Category:2013 deaths ","title":"James Harlan Steele"},{"id":"42004796","text":"Mika Pieniniemi (born April 26, 1966) is a Finnish ice hockey coach.

Legal establishment came with the passing of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Act 2011 (ARENA Act). The legislation passed parliament in November 2011 with the support of the Australian Greens and the Liberal and National coalition opposition as well as the governing Labor Party. ARENA commenced operations on 1 July 2012. The agency resulted from negotiations within the Australian parliament under the Gillard Government, with the intention of providing more secure funding for renewable energy programs in the context of political changes. While ARENA was created as part of the Clean Energy Future package together with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, these are separate institutions. ARENA has consolidated various earlier renewable programs and research and development projects from the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy, the Australian Solar Institute and the former Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism. == Responsibilities == ARENA was established with a total funding allocation of $3.2 billion out to 2020. In the 2013 budget the Labor government deferred $370 million of the agency's funding, extending the timeline to 2022. The subsequent Abbott Government proposed to cut $435 million from ARENA's budget, followed by an additional $40 million, but has affirmed its support for the agency. == Operational activities  Investment priorities === ARENA supports the companies and institutions that are building Australia's future energy system. ARENA's funding and investment plan lists its three investment priorities and addresses key areas that can help create a smooth transition to renewable energy. Investment priorities - * Priority 1. Integrating renewables into the electricity system * Priority 2. Accelerating hydrogen * Priority 3. Supporting industry to reduce emissions === Funding programs === ARENA carries out its mission via the following funding programs: * Advancing Renewables Program (ARP) - Development, demonstration and pre-commercial deployment projects; * Research and Development - Renewable energy technologies that will increase commercial deployment within Australia; * Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund (REVC) - REVC fosters skills and management capability. It encourages investment in innovative Australian renewable energy companies to strengthen their chance of success; * Innovation Fund - Emerging Australian technologies & businesses that can accelerate Australia's transition to a renewable energy economy.; === Projects === ARENA has committed to 486 projects investing $1.46 billion. Some of the projects include: *Battery storage: Australia's first grid scale batteries in South Australia and Victoria *Bioenergy and Waste-to-energy: An assessment by the company Licella of the feasibility of constructing its first pre-commercial biofuel plant and James Cook University developing a macroalgae to biofuels project to provide a blueprint for the development and production of high energy algal fuels. *Demand response: A three-year trial of ten pilot demand response projects to curb energy use during extreme peak demand periods, in partnership with AEMO and the NSW Government *Distributed generation: Australia's first trials of virtual power plants (VPP) *Electric vehicle: Australia's first fast charging networks for electric vehicles *Hydrogen fuel: Australia's first renewable hydrogen facilities *Photovoltaic power station: Australia's first large scale off grid renewable projects including microgrids, solar farms and hybrid projects to power mines and remote communities *Pumped-storage hydroelectricity: Feasibility studies into pumped hydro projects across Australia including Snowy 2.0, Hydro Tasmania's Battery of the Nation initiatives and a proposed seawater pumped hydro plant at Cultana, South Australia *Solar photovoltaics: Research which developed techniques for obtaining high photovoltaic performance from poor-quality silicon, and has helped fund utility-scale solar photovoltaic stations in Nyngan, New South Wales (which at 103MW will be the largest solar power station in the southern hemisphere) and Broken Hill, New South Wales. *Solar thermal: Integration of solar-thermal integration with coal-fired power generation at the Kogan Creek Solar Boost Project, a 44MW concentrating solar power plant, projected to be the world's largest solar-coal plant. The agency is also contributing to a feasibility study into local solar thermal power generation in Port Augusta, South Australia and supported a study into the integration of solar thermal power with the National Electricity Market (NEM). *Wave energy A 1MW demonstration generator (by Oceanlinx) for installation off the coast of Port MacDonnell, South Australia.

He was the editor of the organs of the CPI, CPI(M) and CPI(ML).p. 12 He eventually fell out with the mainstream Charu Majumdar group and died of a heart attack in 1971. ==Career== Sushital Ray Chowdhury graduated from the University of Calcutta and joined the Communist movement at an early age. Appendix B Initially with Communist Party of India (CPI), he was elected secretary of the Hooghly district committee, and wrote extensively on issues such as the Tebhaga movement in party magazines Swadhinata, Sambad, etc. He entered the Calcutta District Committee after 1947, and also joined the editorial board of Swadhinata as a marxist intellectual (along with other radicals such as Saroj Dutta). However, Sushital was inclined to a more revolutionary brand of Marxism, and after the Communist Party split in 1964, he went with the Communist Party of India (Marxist). At the time, CPI(M) adopted a radical stance, with erstwhile revolutionary leaders like Hare Krishna Konar \\"trumpeting revolutionary rhetoric, suggesting that militant confiscation of land was integral to the party's programme.\\"p. 348 In the leadup to the 1967 Indian general election, CPI(M) decided to participate in parliamentary elections, much to the chagrin of radical idealists like Sushital. In 1965, he wrote a series of extreme-left articles in the magazine Chinta, challenging the party programme as \\"revisionist\\". ===United Front government and Naxalbari=== CPI(M) did unexpectedly well, and won 18.1% of the popular vote, though Congress remained the largest party with 127 (of 280) seats. In May 1967, The non-Congress parties linked up to form the United Front coalition, (CPI-M along with CPI and the breakaway Bangla Congress). At this time, Charu Majumdar, who had been involved with the peasant tribals of North Bengal, brought out some cyclostyled pamphlets calling for armed revolution. A group of followers including Kanu Sanyal and Jangal Santhal lived and worked with the armed peasants, ousting landowners. Violence started with land grabbing in March but escalated with the murder of a policeman in May. However, with the deployment of state and central police, the movement was extinguished by July 1967. ==Expulsion from CPM== Sushital and other Calcutta based radicals supported the Naxalbari movement by forming Naxalbari Krishak Sangram Sahayak Samiti (NOKSS) in May 1967. Sushital served as secretary and former Indian National Army activist Pramod Ranjan Sengupta was the president of the organisation. In September 1967, Sushital, along with Saroj Dutta and others from Kolkata, as well as Charu Majumdar, Kanu Sanyal etc. from Siliguri, were expelled from the CPI-M, which was embarrassed by their actions since it was a member in the ruling coalition, and no longer supported such radical steps. On 12 November 1967, Sushital organized a two-day all India meeting of radical leftists at his house in Maniktala; Charu Majumdar flew down from Siliguri. p.295 Delegates included Satyanarayan Singh of Bihar, Appu of Tamil Nadu, and many others from Bengal. In May, 1968 the group adopted the name All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries (AICCCR), with Sushital as its convenor. Sushital became the editor-in-chief of the mouthpieces of the group Deshabrati (Bengali), and Liberation (English). ===Formation of CPI(ML)=== In April 1969, AICCCR was reorganized into the Marxist-Leninist party, the CPI(Marxist -Leninist). The new anti-parliamentary party was announced to the world on May, 1969 at a large meeting on the Maidan organized by Kanu Sanyal. Here there was a scuffle with CPI(M) cadres, a harbinger of much worse to come. In a national CPI(ML) meeting in 1970, fissures started appearing between Charu and some others. By August 1970, Sushital was complaining that some pieces were appearing in the magazines without his knowledge, though he was editor-in-chief. He also suggested that the party should debate whether statues of personalities such as Rabindranath should be vandalised. However, Charu Majumdar did not agree, and after this Sushital was relieved of his editorial role, though he continued to be a politburo member, but was marginalized. In November 1971, the dissident group Satyanarayan Singh and Shiv Kumar Mishra joined the dissidents. In November 1971, this dissident group formed a new Central Committee with Satyanarayan Singh as the General Secretary, and expelled Charu Majumdar. == Death == Early in 1971, Sushital, who had become a forlorn figure, died of a heart attack during the period of underground. It was even rumoured that he may have been attacked by cadres close to the party. ==References== Category:Indian communists Category:1917 births Category:1971 deaths Category:People from Hooghly district Category:University of Calcutta alumni ","title":"Sushital Ray Chowdhury"},{"id":"42004848","text":"Saud Khamis Al-Farsi (; born 3 April 1993), commonly known as Saud Al-Farsi, is an Omani footballer who plays for Al-Oruba SC. ==Club career statistics== {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !rowspan=\\"2\\"Division !colspan=\\"2\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Continental !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"3\\"Sur 2011‚Äì12 rowspan=\\"2\\"Oman Professional League -1-000-0-1 - 2013‚Äì14 -11-000-0-11 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !-!!12!!-!!0!!0!!0!!-!!0!!-!!12 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !-!!12!!-!!0!!0!!0!!-!!0!!-!!12 } ==International career== Saud is part of the first team squad of the Oman national football team.

He is married to Nu Nu Swe. In 2010, he resigned from the military, in order to stand as a Union Solidarity and Development Party candidate in the 2010 Burmese general election. He won a Pyithu Hluttaw seat representing Hpakant Township in Kachin State by a majority of 29,426, defeating his primary opponent, Bawk Ja from the National Democratic Force, an ethnic Kachin activist. ==Controversy== In January 2014, a controversial video of Ohn Myint speaking to residents at Thityakauk village in Magway Region during a 28 January visit surfaced. In that video, Ohn Myint used profanity and vulgar language toward the residents, who were pleading for clean potable water in the village. He also threatened to slap and imprison residents who inquired about the government's water access initiatives. In part of the diatribe, Ohn Myint said \\"I don‚Äôt care about anybody.

He was a commander of the Massachusetts militia during King Philip's War who led troops during the Attack on Hatfield, Massachusetts and the Great Swamp Fight. He also held numerous positions in government and was an opponent of Governor Sir Edmund Andros. ==Early life== Appleton was born in 1625 in Little Waldingfield, England to Samuel and Judith (Everard) Appleton. When he was eleven years old he moved to Ipswich, Massachusetts with his father. Through his mother Judith Everard a number of historians have traced his ancestry to William D'Aubigny, a signer of the Magna Carta, and to King Henry I of England. Roberts, Gary Boyd. Ancestors of American Presidents. New England Historic Genealogical Society, 1995, page 199. ==Personal life== In 1651 he married Hannah Paine of Ipswich. They had three children ‚Äì Hannah, Judith, and Samuel. On December 8, 1656 he married Mary Oliver. They had four children ‚Äì John, Issac, Oliver, and Joanna. In 1664, Appleton sued the Saugus Iron Works, which had been owned by his father-in-law, William Paine, in order to secure an inheritance of ¬£1,500 left by Paine to Appleton's three children with Hannah Paine. Samuel Appleton, Jr. would eventually take control of the Ironmaster's House as part of the settlement. ==Military career== In 1668, Appleton was chosen to serve as a deputy to the Massachusetts General Court and received the title of Lieutenant. He served in the company of his brother, Captain John Appleton, from 1669 to 1671. He then served by himself from 1673 to 1675. In 1675, King Philip's War broke out and Appleton was promoted to Captain. On September 24, 1675, Appleton received a commission to command a foot company of 100 men. He proceeded to the Connecticut River Valley, where Captain Thomas Lathrop's Company had been destroyed on September 18. On October 4, Major John Pynchon resigned as Commander-in-Chief of the militia headquarters in Hadley and Appleton was chosen to succeed him. Not knowing where the next attack would come from, Appleton divided his army among three towns. He stationed a force in Northampton under the command of Lieutenant Nathaniel Sealy. This group was supplemented by troops under the command of Robert Treat of Connecticut. A second group, under the command of Captains Jonathan Poole and Samuel Moseley, was stationed in Hatfield. Appleton himself commanded the third force, which was stationed in Hadley. ===Attack on Hatfield=== At noon on October 19, several fires were spotted north of Hadley. Captain Moseley sent out a scouting party of ten men who were ambushed two miles outside of the garrison. Six of the men were killed and three were captured. Moseley sent to Hadley and Northampton for reinforcements. Appleton and most of his men crossed the river and joined Moseley. Around 4 pm, a large band of Native American warriors charged the settlement. Appleton defended one side of the town, Captain Poole defended the other, and Captain Moseley defended the middle. Appleton's sergeant was killed by his side and Appleton just missed getting shot as a bullet went through his hat. After two hours the warriors retreated in confusion. The battle at Hatfield was the Native Americans' first real setback of the war and a turning point for the English colonists, as it proved that the Native Americans could be repelled if the militia was prepared. ===Great Swamp Fight=== In November 1675, the commissioners of the United Colonies of New England had evidence that the neutral Narragansett tribe was assisting Metacomet. They chose to launch a preemptive strike on the Narragansett. On December 8, 527 members of the Massachusetts militia, led by Appleton, gathered in Dedham, Massachusetts. Plymouth Colony gathered 159 men under the command of William Bradford and Connecticut moved 300 men under the command of Robert Treat, along with 150 Mohegan warriors. Governor Josiah Winslow of Plymouth Colony was named Commander-in-Chief. On December 19, 1675, the Narragansett fort was captured in the Great Swamp Fight. 110 of Appleton's men were either killed or wounded in the battle. Afterwards, Appleton and his remaining men returned to Boston and he retired from active service. ==Civil service== Appleton's Pulpit, the location where Appleton is said to have made a speech denouncing the tyranny of Governor Andros In 1668, Appleton served as a Commissioner of Essex County. From 1668 to 1671, 1673 to 1675, and 1679 to 1681 he was a deputy to the Massachusetts General Court. From 1681 to 1686 he was a member of the council of assistants. ===Opposition to Andros government=== Appleton opposed the government of Colonial Governor Sir Edmund Andros as early as 1682. In 1687, Appleton refused to pay taxes levied by Andros without approval of the Council. On September 19, 1687, a warrant was issued for Appleton's arrest for being \\"factiously and seditiously inclined, and disaffected to his Majesty's government\\". According to tradition, Appleton hid at his son's home in Saugus (then part of Lynn) and delivered an address from a rocky cliff near the Iron Works in which he denounced the tyranny of Andros. The place where he is said to have delivered the speech became known as Appleton's Pulpit. Appleton was arrested on September 20 and brought before the Council on October 5. He remained in prison until March 7, 1688, when he was released by the Superior Court in exchange for a ¬£1,000 bond for his future appearance. ===Later service and death=== Appleton was a member of the council that governed Massachusetts between the 1689 Boston revolt and the Charter of Province of Massachusetts Bay taking effect in 1692. He served as justice of the Quarterly and General Sessions Court. He was also a member of the Governor's Council in Salem on April 11, 1692, which interrogated Elizabeth Proctor and Sarah Cloyce on charges of witchcraft brought against them. Both, plus Elizabeth's husband, John Proctor, were bound over for trial once a Superior Court could be convened to hear the cases. Council Record Pertaining to Sarah Cloyce, Martha Cory, Dorothy Good, Rebecca Nurse, Elizabeth Proctor & John Proctor Appleton died on May 15, 1696. ==Descendants== Appleton's descendants include President Calvin CoolidgeRoberts, Gary Boyd.

The fictional Arab country of \\"Abuddin\\" is deliberately compiled out of mixed elements of a few different actual countries, in order to not appear to simulate a particular nation or situation. The producers of the series have also said that no particular sects or clans will be named while relating details. Executive producer Howard Gordon stated, \\"We do want to stay away from reality and yet hew to it as long as it sort of feels emotionally correct and culturally correct. I think we‚Äôre going to try to stay away from names as much as possible.\\" The first television promos appeared in April 2014, featuring an excerpt of the song \\"Wave\\" from the album Morning Phase by Beck. Season 3 episodes were also filmed in Budapest, Hungary (June 2016). ==Reception== Tyrant has received mixed reviews. On Metacritic, the show holds a score of 54 out of 100 (78 out of 100 for the user review base on 150 critics) , based on 33 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the show has a rating of 60%, based on 47 reviews, with an above average score of 6.2 out of 10. The consensus on the site reads: \\"Realizing a uniquely vital representation of life in the Middle East, Tyrant mostly thrives as a biting family drama set against immersive scenery\\". The pilot episode had been criticized by some for Adam Rayner's lackluster performance, the show's depiction of the Middle East, and for being boring ‚Äì others have said it is a nuanced performance in an understandably complicated role. Alan Sepinwall at HitFix labeled the show \\"messy\\", and criticized Adam Rayner's performance as Barry: \\"Rayner is so bland, so lacking in charisma in the role ‚Äì Barry is by nature, a quieter, more reserved character, but there are ways to play silence that aren't remotely this dull ‚Äì that it's baffling that Gordon and company would go to the trouble and risk the justifiable anger over the casting.\\" Some reviews were more positive. Melissa Maerz at Entertainment Weekly gave the show a B‚àí, enjoying it, but admitting that the show could use some work: \\"With so much attention focused on this American series set in the Middle East, Tyrant is already an important show. Now it just has to prove that it's also a good one.\\" At The Arizona Republic, Randy Cordova wrote that the first season \\"was one of the most overheated programs on TV, in the best sense of the word.\\" Cordova, Randy. \\"Stars of FX drama Tyrant talk about second season.\\" The Arizona Republic. June 10, 2015. He also praised Barhom's work, saying the actor overshadowed Rayner: \\"Through his layered performance, Barhom brings a smoldering intensity to the role and practically drips with testosterone,\\" Cordova writes. The show's depiction of Jamal al-Fayeed as a rapist was also criticized. Maureen Ryan at The Huffington Post accused the show of using Jamal's sexual assaults to add \\"edge\\" and \\"atmosphere\\" to the show: \\"The women in these scenes are devices‚Äîthey are there to create an atmosphere of danger or to move the plot along.\\" The A.V. Club's Emily VanDerWerff also agreed that the sexual assaults were used as plot devices: \\"The pilot is far too cavalier about throwing around sexual assault as a plot point, even if it's trying to make a point about women's rights in Middle Eastern nations.\\" She added that the scenes \\"leave a bad taste in the mouth\\". ===Ratings=Home media release== On January 13, 2015, Fox Home Entertainment released the first season of Tyrant on DVD.

It is based on a novel with the same title written by Roberto Proia. == Plot summary == Mattia is a homosexual guy from Rome, the lover of a young Spanish student named Eduard. He cannot tell his parents about his love affair, because of their very conservative opinions and the particular situation in Rome - everyone Mattia meets in the city hates gay people, and condemns them as unclean beings. Mattia plans to secretly run away with Eduard while telling his parents that he intends to leave Italy in order to find work. Mattia's plan seems to work, but the troubles begin when he discovers that Eduard is coming to Italy in order to meet Mattia's parents. Given the relative liberal attitudes in Spain towards gay people, Eduard thinks that Mattia has already told his parents and his environment. Mattia tries to get along with everyone for a while, but in the end is forced to reveal his homosexuality to his parents, who understand him. Finally, Mattia can fulfill his need for love by going to Spain with Eduard. == Cast == *Josafat Vagni: Mattia *Jos√© Dammert: Eduard *Valeria Bilello: Stefania *Francesco Montanari: Giacomo / Alba Paillettes *Monica Guerritore: Aurora *Ninni Bruschetta: Rodolfo *Victoria Cabello: herself ==Awards== { class= style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" !Year !Category !Recipient(s) !Result - ddd;\\"  colspan=5  Golden Graal Student's Choice Awards - rowspan=32013  Best Director, Comedy  Ivan Silvestrini  -  Best Actor, Comedy  Francesco Montanari  } == See also == * List of Italian films of 2012 ==References * Category:2012 films Category:2012 comedy films Category:Italian films Category:Italian LGBT-related films Category:2012 LGBT-related films Category:Films based on Italian novels Category:Italian comedy films Category:Gay-related films Category:Films set in Rome ","title":"Tell No One (2012 film)"},{"id":"42005438","text":"Sister Dr Bernadette Mary Porter (born 21 July 1952) is a British Roman Catholic nun, educator and academic administrator.

Director Randall Miller co-wrote the screenplay with Jody Savin, based on the autobiography My Cross to Bear by the singer Gregg Allman. Miller and Savin were also the producers. The film was to star William Hurt, Tyson Ritter, Zoey Deutch, Eliza Dushku, and Wyatt Russell. On February 20, 2014, the first day of filming, the crew was on an active railroad trestle bridge, high over the Altamaha River in Wayne County, Georgia. Due to criminal negligence by the producers of the film, second assistant camerawoman Sarah Jones was killed when she was struck by a CSX freight train that arrived on the trestle. Seven other crew members were also hurt, one seriously. Production was suspended the following week and multiple investigations into the incident were undertaken with several yet to be resolved. Miller, Savin, executive producer Jay Sedrish, and first assistant director Hillary Schwartz were charged with involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespass as well as being cited by OSHA for \\"serious\\" and \\"willful\\" safety violations. On March 9, 2015, Miller pled guilty to felony involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespassing and received a 10-year sentence, of which he served one year, followed by probation. Sedrish was also convicted of felony involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespassing via a plea bargain and sentenced to 10 years of probation. The charges against Savin were dropped as part of the plea agreement with her husband and business partner Randall Miller. Film Allman LLC, referenced in multiple lawsuits, is the production company created by Randall Miller, Jody Savin and Brad Rosenberger in the state of Georgia, specifically for the production of Midnight Rider. Unclaimed Freight Productions is Miller and Savin's parent California production company. ==Cast== *William Hurt as Gregg Allman \\\\- Hurt officially pulled out of the project on April 23, 2014.

Dutton as Chank Middleton *Aldis Hodge *Kathy Baker ==Development== On May 18, 2013, it was announced that Open Road Films, Randall Miller and Jody Savin planned to film a biopic based on Gregg Allman's autobiography My Cross To Bear. Miller was announced as the director and co- writer of the screenplay with Savin. When Open Road Films was announced as the US distribution partner this was a substantial boost to the independent production, as it is owned by AMC Theatres and Regal Entertainment Group, and thus at the time could directly distribute to approximately 31% of the nation's theaters. Open Road Films' Tom Ortenberg said, \\"We are thrilled to have the opportunity to be a part of this movie. Gregg Allman's story is fascinating and we are looking forward to working with Randall, Jody and Gregg to bring this project to theaters.\\" Miller and Savin would produce, along with their business partner Brad Rosenberger, and work closely with Allman and his manager Michael Lehman, who would serve as executive producers. The name of the film was announced as Midnight Rider: The Gregg Allman Story on November 1, 2013, and was followed with promotional artwork, a Facebook page, and casting calls using that title. ==Events of February 20, 2014== On February 20, 2014, the film crew was transported an hour from Meddin Studios to a remote location for a \\"camera test\\". They had permission to film on property that was secured by fencing, owned by Rayonier for mill operations. Running through this property was CSX railroad property, which included Wayne County's historic Doctortown railroad trestle. CSX claims that the production asked twice for permission to use its property, and was denied both times in writing. Sergeant Ben Robertson later wrote in an incident report, \\"In my presence, Mr. Sedrish was asked by an employee of CSX if he had permission to be on the trestle or tracks and Mr. Sedrish replied, 'That's complicated.'\\" Under Miller's direction, the crew prepared and started filming a dream sequence involving William Hurt as Allman on a heavy metal hospital bed on this live railroad trestle, high above the Altamaha River. The producers had assured the cast and crew that it was safe to film on the trestle. Even though official shooting of the film was scheduled to begin on February 24, in and around Savannah, and February 20 had been called a camera test, it seems that the producers intended to shoot a substantial scene without the full crew. While they were filming, a train came around a corner at , giving the cast and crew less than a minute to evacuate the filming location, a substantial way out onto the trestle. The only escape route was toward the oncoming train. Video of the crew indicates that they were unaware how fast it was approaching; some attempted to remove camera equipment and the metal bed from the trestle. They failed to remove the bed before the train rolled through, and many of the crew were trapped on the trestle. The train struck and shattered the metal bed, sending shrapnel toward crew members. Fragments struck camera assistant Sarah Jones and propelled her toward the still fast- moving train, killing her. Hurt, who was meant to be on the hospital bed in the scene, got off the trestle before the train hit the bed, collecting splinters on his bare feet as he ran across the ties then to the sharp rocks on shore. Several other crew members were injured and taken to the hospital. The trestle the film crew was on is a historic bridge crossing the Altamaha River in Wayne County where the Battle of Altamaha Bridge took place. According to the NTSB preliminary report, the train was traveling at and the speed limit for this section of track was . On February 21, sheriff's deputies identified the deceased as Sarah Elizabeth Jones, and confirmed that seven others were injured in the incident. Executive producer Nick Gant, creative director and principal of Meddin Studios, denied any wrongdoing or negligence in the incident, told Variety that the crew was extremely well qualified, and blamed the railway company for the mishap. On February 24, the Wayne County Sheriff's Office released an incident report that said the production company had been denied permission by CSX to film on the trestle. The investigation was later expanded to include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Railroad Administration and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, investigating Jones's death as a negligent homicide. ===Attempts to restart filming after the accident=== Producers had intended to continue filming immediately following the tragedy, evidenced by their request for new film permits from the city of Savannah, but on February 26, 2014, Film Allman, LLC announced that the production was on hold due to Jones's death and the injuries to crew members. Miller hired public relations strategist Matthew Hiltzik, of Hiltzik Strategies, on February 27, to address the negative press coverage. On April 14, 2014, it was reported that Miller was planning to resume filming in Los Angeles in June 2014. On April 17, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees said that Unclaimed Freight Productions had notified them that they would begin pre-production \\"in a couple weeks\\", but that the company \\"did not ask for permission and was not granted permission to restart production\\". IATSE also said, \\"As uncomfortable as this is, we cannot prevent them from starting up again. Whether or not they can get people to work for them is a decision that those people will have to make for themselves.\\" In response to Miller's and Savin's decision to resume filming, film crews that had remained largely silent on the details of pending criminal investigations mounted a very vocal protest against the production company and asked Allman, Open Road Films, Hurt and other actors to withdraw their support for the film. The greatest concern was that despite what seemed to be the production company's negligence, resulting in serious injuries and a death, there was no federal, state or union entity that could prevent them from resuming production. A Facebook group of crew members voicing opposition had grown to more than 10,800 members by April 23 when Hurt announced he was leaving the film. Hurt, who was scripted to be lying on the metal bed in the scene, wrote in an email to a friend that the production crew had twice assured him that the bridge scene was safe to film. In a personal letter Allman released to the press on April 25, he asked the producers not to proceed with the film, writing, \\"Your desires as a filmmaker should not outweigh your obligations as a human being, I am asking you to do the right thing and to set aside your attempts to resume the production out of respect for Sarah, her family and the loss that all of us feel so deeply.\\" Allman later filed a civil suit against Miller and Savin in an attempt to halt the film. Open Road Films has yet to withdraw their support for it. ==Criminal and civil actionsCriminal case and convictions=== Miller, Savin, and Sedrish were charged with involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespass on July 3, 2014. Miller and Savin originally pleaded not guilty. On September 10, 2014, Hillary Schwartz, the first assistant director of Midnight Rider, was charged with involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespassing. On March 9, 2015, just before the trial was to commence, the DA agreed to plea bargains for two of the defendants. Miller and Sedrish entered guilty pleas to felony involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespassing, while charges were dropped against Savin as part of Miller's plea. Miller received a sentence of 10 years, of which he was expected to serve two years in prison followed by probation (during which he would be precluded from working as a director or assistant director or other capacity involving employee safety) as well as pay a fine and do community service. He was immediately remanded to custody after the plea hearing to begin serving his sentence in the Wayne County jail. He was released in March 2016 after serving one year of his term. Sedrish was sentenced to 10 years' probation and a fine, and is likewise precluded from working as a director or assistant director or other capacity involving employee safety. On March 10, 2015, Schwartz pleaded guilty to felony involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespass, and was also sentenced to 10 years' probation.'Midnight Rider' First AD Hillary Schwartz Guilty; Gets 10 Years Probation ‚Äì Update. Deadline Hollywood, 10 March 2015 ===Civil lawsuits=== Gregg Allman v. Unclaimed Freight Productions et al. In an attempt to halt Miller's and Savin's effort to resume filming Midnight Rider, Allman, the subject of the film and executive producer, filed suit on April 28, 2014, in Chatham County Superior Court. He claimed that Miller and Savin had failed to pay the agreed option price for the film rights or to start primary photography by the date stipulated in the option contract. After one day of court proceedings that included Miller testifying, the trial ended when Allman's and Miller's attorneys agreed to an out-of-court settlement. Nothing has been publicly revealed about this settlement. Richard Jones and Elisabeth Jones v. CSX Transportation and Unknown Corporations Richard and Elisabeth Jones, Sarah's parents, filed a wrongful death lawsuit on Sarah's behalf against CSX, the film's producers, and related companies and individuals, on May 21, 2014, in Chatham County, Georgia,Richard Jones And Elizabeth Jones, as the administrators of the estate of Sarah Elizabeth Jones, deceased, v. CSX Transportation Inc and Unknown Corporations A Z, no. STCV1400752 (Ga. St. Ct. Chatham County, May 21, 2014) where the production was based. The complaint alleged that the defendants \\"had knowledge, actual or constructive, that the scene filmed on February 20 was to take place on active railroad tracks, without permission from CSX\\" and that they \\"knew of the danger presented by filming under those circumstances.\\" In reply, CSX stated that it had repeatedly denied the producers permission to use its property and railroad trestle. It also revealed that its employees on two previous CSX trains saw the film crew congregating near CSX's property where there is also a railroad crossing. The Joneses' attorneys contended that given these warning signs CSX should have slowed the train and sent an investigator to the site. The Joneses settled with a number of parties before trial. Defendants CSX, Meddin Studios, and Jeffery Gant remained in the trial. In July 2017, a jury awarded the Joneses $11.2 million. Liability for $3.9 million was allocated to CSX, $3.14 million to Miller, and $2 million to Rayonier Performance Fibers, the company that owned the land where the tracks were; the remaining liability was allocated to Savin, Schwartz and Serdish. CSX appealed and ultimately settled with the Joneses for an undisclosed lesser amount while the appeal was pending.CSX Transportation, Inc. v. Richard Jones, as Administrator of the Estate of Sarah Elizabeth Jones, et al., no. A19A1066 (Jan. 30, 2019 Ga. Ct. App.) (docket entry) Film Allman LLC v. New York Marine Insurance On August 12, 2014, Film Allman LLC filed a lawsuit against New York Marine Insurance contending that if it did not receive the $1.6 million insurance payout for the interruption caused by the collision, it would be unable to continue with the production. The lawsuit also revealed that it had rewritten the script, and submitted it to the insurance carrier, to be about 1970s rock music in general, not specifically about Allman. This revelation, along with Allman's undisclosed out-of-court settlement with Film Allman LLC, raised substantial questions about whether the film would still be a \\"Gregg Allman biopic\\", based on his autobiography. The insurance policy has a clear stipulation that the insured must adhere to all safety standards and laws to prevent loss, but OSHA cited Film Allman LLC for putting its crew at risk both of falls from the trestle, a \\"serious citation\\", and of being struck by a train, a \\"willful citation\\", in addition to criminal indictments of the three managing producers and first AD for criminal trespassing and involuntary manslaughter. ==Federal NTSB, OSHA and FRA investigations, citations and reportsNTSB investigation=== On March 23, 2015, the National Transportation Safety Board adopted a final report that cited the probable cause of the accident as \\"the film crew's unauthorized entry onto the CSX Transportation right-of-way at the Altamaha River bridge with personnel and equipment, despite CSX Transportation's repeated denial of permission to access the railroad property. Contributing to the accident was the adjacent property owner's actions to facilitate the film crew's access to the right-of- way and bridge.\\" ===OSHA citations of Film Allman LLC=== On August 14, 2014, OSHA cited Film Allman LLC for willful and serious citations with a proposed penalty of $74,900. The producers appealed OSHA's charges and fines, and a hearing was set for March 31, 2015, in Savannah. ===FRA statement on investigation=== On October 15, 2014, the Federal Railroad Administration said it was still investigating the collision. A spokesperson said, \\"The FRA is investigating the February 20, 2014 accident that occurred on the CSX rail line in Nahunta, Georgia. Once completed, the investigation will identify the root cause of the accident, and we will take all appropriate enforcement actions.\\" ===National Council on Occupational Safety and Health report=== In its annual report, the National Council on Occupational Safety and Health (COSH) cited Sarah Jones as one of seven case studies of workplace deaths that could have been prevented. Hairstylist Joyce Gilliard, also injured in the collision, spoke about the report on a conference call with reporters and separately said in a statement, \\"After what I saw and lived through, I want to advocate for safety and prevent any other tragedies or injuries in the workplace.\\" ==LegacySlick Rock Trail=== On October 2, 2014, it was revealed that Miller was in pre-production for a film called Slick Rock Trail and working with casting director Rick Pagano of Pagano/Manwiller Casting. Pagano had also worked with Miller as casting director on Midnight Rider, CBGB, Noble Son and Bottle Shock. It seems the film had similarities to Midnight Rider, including a line from Allman's book that is also a commonly quoted line from the Allman Brothers band's origin story, calling a band with two drummers as a potential train wreck. It was unclear whether the Slick Rock Trail script was the same one Miller presented as a rewrite of Midnight Rider in his lawsuit against New York Marine Insurance. ===Safety for Sarah movement=== In the wake of Jones's death, her family, friends, supporters and others in the film industry launched a campaign for greater awareness and attention to safety issues in film and television production. ==See also== *List of film accidents *Twilight Zone accident ==References== Category:American biographical films Category:American biographical drama films Category:American films Category:Biographical films about musicians Category:Cancelled films Category:Films directed by Randall Miller Category:Films shot in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Open Road Films films Category:2010s biographical drama films Category:2010s unfinished films Category:Cultural depictions of rock musicians ","title":"Midnight Rider (film)"},{"id":"42005466","text":"Tatyana Rodionova may refer to *Tatyana Rodionova (born 1941), Russian volleyball player *Tatyana Rodionova (long jumper) (born 1956), Russian long jumper *Tatyana Rodionova (runner) (born 1980), Russian middle-distance runner ","title":"Tatyana Rodionova"},{"id":"42005479","text":"Matthew \\"Matt\\" Sim (born 18 April 1988) is an Australian professional footballer who currently plays left or right sided / central midfielder for Sydney United.

It was one of several similar bills in U.S. state legislatures allowing individuals to refuse service based on religion, with some bills specifically protecting religious disapproval of same-sex marriage. It was widely reported as targeting LGBT people, although Arizona law provides no protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Critics noted that it would have broadly denied anyone service on religious grounds. Supporters argued that it was simply restoring the legal status of the right to free exercise of religion as intended by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The bill was passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature and vetoed by Republican Governor Jan Brewer on February 26, 2014. The national controversy surrounding the bill prompted Arizona State Senator Steve Gallardo to publicly come out as gay.Arizona's Anti-Gay Bill Inspired This State Lawmaker To Come Out He referred to the bill as a \\"game changer,\\" and noted the national controversy surrounding its passage, as prompting his decision. ==Background== The United States Supreme Court ruled in Employment Division v. Smith (1990) that a person may not defy neutral laws of general applicability, such as public accommodation laws, as an expression of religious belief. \\"To permit this,\\" wrote Justice Scalia, \\"would make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself.\\" He wrote that neutral laws of general applicability do not have to meet the standard of strict scrutiny, because such a requirement would create \\"a private right to ignore generally applicable laws\\". Strict scrutiny would require a law to be the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest. The meaning of neutral law of general applicability was elaborated by the court in 1993. The US Congress responded by passing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), requiring strict scrutiny when a neutral law of general applicability \\"substantially burden[s] a person's exercise of religion\\". When the Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that the RFRA was inapplicable to state laws, some states passed their own Religious Freedom Restoration Acts, including the Arizona law that SB 1062 proposed to amend. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the federal RFRA as applied to federal statutes in Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal in 2006. Arizona lawmakers were concerned about a 2013 New Mexico Supreme Court ruling that weakened its state's RFRA, which was passed as a religious exemption to its own public accommodation law prohibiting the denial of services based on a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. Twenty-one states, not including Arizona, have similar public accommodation laws protecting sexual orientation. The New Mexico Supreme Court ruled in Elane Photography v. Willock that the state's RFRA could not be invoked between two parties if the government was not a party to the legal proceedings. The bill was introduced by Senator Steve Yarbrough to amend a law currently giving religious assemblies or institutions a religious exemption from any law. The bill was passed by the Republican-controlled Senate on February 19, along party lines and passed by the state House on February 20. The vote tally in the Senate was 17 for, 13 against, and in the House, 33 for, 27 against. On February 26, Governor Jan Brewer vetoed the bill after significant national attention. There are not enough votes in the legislature to override the veto. Following the veto, Senator Steve Gallardo, one of the bill's most strident opponents, came out as gay. He identified the day that the bill passed the Senate as a \\"game changer\\". ==Content== SB 1062 was intended to amend Section 41-1493 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, which prevents \\"any law, including state and local laws, ordinances, rules, regulations and policies\\" from \\"substantially burden[ing]\\" a person's exercise of religion, unless the burden is the least restrictive means of furthering a \\"compelling government interest\\". SB 1062 would have revised it by expanding the definition of person in the article from \\"a religious assembly or institution\\" to also include \\"any individual, association, partnership, corporation, church,\\" \\"estate, trust, foundation or other legal entity\\", and would have allowed for religious- freedom as a claim or defense in lawsuits \\"regardless of whether the government is a party to the proceeding.\\" ==Criticism== While proponents said the bill was intended to protect the right of business owners to refuse services based on religious objections and was a direct response to the New Mexico Supreme Court's ruling in Elane Photography v. Willock against a business that religiously objected to accommodating a same-sex wedding, critics, a few media outlets, and opponents argued that the intent was to allow businesses to refuse to serve the LGBT community, specifically in the cases of same-sex couples. Critics said that the bill would have allowed any business to discriminate against any group of people for any religious reason. Businesses, civil rights groups, and gay rights groups had opposed the bill. As state law already allows businesses to refuse services to anyone for any given reason, business owners noted that refusing services to LGBT people was currently allowed anyway. They would only be losing business by discriminating and do not need extra protections for something they cannot be sued for. Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Irvine law school, argued that the bill was harmful and \\"sends a message that the state is bigoted.\\" Supporters of the bill included two conservative groups, the Center for Arizona Policy and the Alliance Defending Freedom, both of whom worked on the bill. The Arizona Catholic Conference had called on its congregants to support the bill. Three lawmakers who initially voted for the bill, including Senate Majority Whip Adam Driggs, had encouraged Governor Brewer to veto it. The National Football League stated that it was \\"following the issue in Arizona and will continue to do so should the bill be signed into law\\", prompting concerns from Arizona business leaders that signing of SB1062 would lead to the pulling of Super Bowl XLIX, similar to how Super Bowl XXVII was moved to Pasadena, California after a Martin Luther King Jr. Day ballot measure failed in Arizona's 1990 elections. The issue was rendered moot by the vetoing of the bill. ==Similar legislation in other states== Arizona SB 1062 was similar, at the time, to bills in five other states‚ÄîSouth Dakota, Kansas, Idaho, Tennessee, Colorado, and Maine‚Äîthat all failed or faced major setbacks . Other bills centered on the same core issues are: *Arkansas **The Legislature passed the Conscience Protection Act is quoted as: \\"designed to make sure governments cannot burden the free exercise of religion.\\" **Governor signed and in effect since July 1, 2015. *Colorado **Bill \\"designed to make sure governments cannot burden the free exercise of religion.\\" **Rejected along party lines in February 2013. *Georgia **Bill would affirm the \\"right to act or refuse to act in a manner substantially motivated by a sincerely held religious tenet or belief whether or not the exercise is compulsory or a central part or requirement of the person's religious tenets or beliefs.\\" **House version withdrawn on February 27.

Senate leaders refused to take up the bill. *Maine **Bill states \\"the government could not infringe upon a person's religious freedom except in cases of 'compelling state interest.\\" **Rejected by Senate on February 18 and by House on February 20. *Mississippi **Bill says state and local governments cannot put a substantial burden on religious practices. **Approved by House and Senate on April 1. The Governor signed the approved bill into law three days later and the law became effective on July 1, 2014. *Missouri **Bill would allow individuals to deny service to gays and lesbians. **No action on bill as of March 1. *Nevada **Bill \\"designed to make sure governments cannot burden the free exercise of religion.\\" **Passed by Senate on Apr 22, 2013.

The right to act or refuse to act in a manner motivated by a sincerely held religious belief may not be substantially burdened unless the government proves by clear and convincing evidence that it has a compelling governmental interest in infringing the specific act or refusal to act and has used the least restrictive means to further that interest. A \\"burden\\" shall include indirect burdens such as withholding benefits, assessing penalties, or an exclusion of programs or access to facilities.\\" **Governor signed, went into effect July 1, 2014. *Utah **Bill would have allowed individuals to deny service to gays and lesbians. **Legislature refused to take up bill in wake of state's gay marriage fight. *West Virginia **Bill would require the government to show compelling interest if it chooses to enforce a law that substantially burdens one's religious beliefs. **No action on bill as of March 13. ==See also== * Indiana SB 101 * Freedom of religion in the United States * Kansas House Bill 2453 * LGBT rights in Arizona ==References *Text of the Senate Bill 1062 *Legislative proceedings *Bill Text: AZ SB1062  2014  Fifty-first Legislature 2nd Regular  Introduced.

It was released on December 4, 2013.

The song, produced by ASAP Mob's ASAP Ty Beats features East Coast rapper Method Man. The song has since peaked at number 29 on the UK R&B; Chart. == Background and composition== The song originally appeared as a one-minute snippet on the end of ASAP Ant's \\"The Way It Go\\".

But, on September 26, 2014, fellow ASAP Mob member and general manager, Steven \\"ASAP Yams\\" Rodriguez, announced on his Tumblr account, that the album was scrapped. In an April 2014 interview with HipHopDX, Nast spoke on the song saying, \\"Basically what I wanted to do with that was put people in that time machine and bring them back to 1997, 1996‚Äîwith Wu-Tang Clan, A Tribe Called Quest, AZ, Gang Starr‚Äîall these guys were coming up, and it was all about rapping. It wasn't about your fancy clothes. Well it was, but to an extent. \\"Trillmatic\\" was basically to showcase that we're in 2014, but we could still shine with the whole Golden Era.

Billy Johnson Jr. of Rolling Stone praised both rappers performances, the refrain and the song's production. Andy Bustard of The BoomBox stated, \\"Trillmatic\\" \\"is a fun and refreshing throwback to '90s East Coast rap.\\" Nast has \\"two stellar verses and a surprisingly dope hook, but it‚Äôs Johnny Blaze who lights up the track with an effortlessly acrobatic guest appearance. A$AP Ty Beats' sample-laced, boom bap production proves that the true New York essence is hiding beneath all that Houston flavor after all.\\" Jeff Rosenthal of Complex said, \\"it's been years since Method Man sounded so urgent as he does\\" on \\"Trillmatic\\". == Chart performance == {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2014) ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - UK Singles (The Official Charts Company)  align=\\"center\\" 193 - } ==Release history== {  - !Country !Date !Format !Label -  United States December 4, 2013  Digital download rowspan=\\"2\\"  ASAP Worldwide, Polo Grounds, RCA Records -  United Kingdom  January 16, 2014  Urban contemporary radio } == References == Category:Debut singles Category:2013 songs Category:2013 singles Category:Method Man songs Category:RCA Records singles Category:Songs written by Method Man ","title":"Trillmatic"},{"id":"42005579","text":"Francis Edgar Stock CBE (5 July 1914 - 26 September 1997) was a British academic and academic administrator.

It is located on the Korle bu campus, on the first floor of the Charles Easmon building. It caters for all the students and faculty of the College of Health Sciences. The library seats one hundred and twenty-eight (128) persons in the main reading area. There is a graduate commons that has a seating capacity of twenty-three (23).  Collection  The library consists of both print and online resources. It has a total collection of eleven thousand eight hundred and seventy-five (11, 875) volumes of print books. These books cut across all the health disciplines offered by the schools in the College. The print collection is made up of textbooks, some WHO publications, books on reserve and a reference collection made up of medical dictionaries, anatomy atlases and medical illustrations. In addition to the print books, the library benefits from online resources of both book and journal databases that the University of Ghana subscribes to. An alphabetical list of these resources can be found at http://balme.ug.edu.gh/index.php/researchtools/databases-quick-a-z and include health & biomedical databases. === University of Ghana Business School (UGBS) Library === The University of Ghana Business School (UGBS) Library is part of the of the University of Ghana Library System. The library operates from two locations. The K.E. Adjei Library which caters for the undergraduate students and is located on the main campus within the UGBS building. THE UGBS Tullow Ghana Library is the graduate library and is located in the Graduate Building of the school, off campus on the UPSA Road. The library seats 360 but has the capacity to increase seating. The library provides for relaxed seating area called the CAL Bank corner at the undergraduate library and the Tullow Corner at the graduate library. There are also 2 designated areas in the undergraduate library for use as discussion or seminar rooms for faculty and staff. The library units include the administration, acquisitions, cataloguing, circulation and reference.  Collection  The library‚Äôs collection reflects the courses and programmes in the school to include accounting, finance, health services administration, human resource management, operations and management information systems, marketing and entrepreneurship and public administration. These resources can be found in print and online. === Institute of African Studies (IAS) Library === The IAS library serves fellows (faculty and researchers) and students of the institute. As part of the University of Ghana Library Systems (UGLS), the activity of the IAS library is a reflection of what is done at the main library (Balme library) and so there is a lot of liaison activities between the centre and the IAS library to ensure that fellows are students are aware of all the resources made available through the main library. The operations of the IAS library are governed by the UGLS policy with some local disparities. The library has access and subscription to print resources and online/electronic resources which is accessible through (www.balme.ug.edu.gh). The collections of the IAS library are basically special collections on Africa, its people and societies. These collections cuts across countries but more emphasis and efforts are made to collect any material about and on Ghana. We have the newspaper project which constitute the indexing of newspapers from 2015 to present using subjects and keywords as the search tern. The newspapers include Graphic, Times, Spectator, Chronicle and Mirror. The collections are developed by acquiring relevant materials and textbooks based on recommendations by fellows. Again, fellows also contribute to the collection by purchasing relevant materials from conferences and also giving copies of their book publications to enhance teaching, learning and research. The library has the main reading room with a seating capacity of 72 and the graduate wing (for fellows, researchers and postgraduate students) with a seating capacity of 20. The Library has eight staff who are in charge of the daily operations of the library. The IAS library provides a siren environment for learning and research with Wi-Fi network. The team members at the library are always ready and available to assist users within the opening days of the library. === Population and Social Sciences (PSS) Library === The PSSL is a reference library for the Institute of Statistical Social and Economic Research (ISSER) and Regional Institute for Population Studies (RIPS). The library was established in the beginning of the 1973/74 academic year, when ISSER and the Population Dynamics Programme (PDP) both of the University of Ghana, Legon, joined resources. Regional Institute for Population Studies (an institute jointly sponsored by United Nations and the Government), later merged its library stocks with that of the PSSL in 1975.  Sitting Capacity  The library has a sitting capacity of 80  The Collection  This is made up of the following: 1\\\\. Books 2\\\\. Bound Newspapers 3\\\\. United Nations Documents 4\\\\.

It started with a small collection in 1994 and steadily grew into a full-fledged school library in the year 2010, after merging the previous library collections with those at the then Malaria Centre which is now the current location of the School of Public Health. The SPH-Library is a branch of the University of Ghana Library System (UGLS). As such, this library also benefits from the use of e-resources acquired by the Balme Library through the interconnectivity of the University of Ghana library system. Although a small library, the SPH-Library is well-equipped to serve its numerous clienteles. For example, there is a Wi-Fi-facility in the library for easy connectivity to the internet by users. Additionally, the collection is current because efforts are made by the management of the Public Health School to ensure that the collection is up to date. Since most students of the school are health practitioners, some of whom are resident outside the Greater-Accra region, provision has been made for them to use the off-campus access for the use of the library resources anywhere outside campus at their own convenience. Apart from students and faculty of SPH, the library is patronised by regular users from other departments on UG campus. The SPH-Library also provides services to students and faculty from other Universities and Public Health Institutions, members of Ghana College of Physicians and Surgeons, private medical practitioners and researchers who visit the library to use print books as well as e-resources. All these other categories of users are being attracted to the SPH-Library not only because the SPH at UG is the pioneer public health school to be established in Ghana but also due to the uniqueness of the library‚Äôs collection. Some of the titles available in stock can be located under the following broad subject areas: Encyclopaedias and dictionaries in public health, public health policy; culture, health and illness; public health monitoring & evaluation; health communication; modern nutrition in health; understanding environmental health; epidemiology; principles and practices of infectious diseases; adolescent health problems; waste treatment and disposal and public health research methods among others.
