During his childhood, aged 9, he was taken along with his brother, Adam Khan, by Tatar Khan to meet the Mughal Emperor Babur and his son, Prince Humayun. In this meeting Babur gifted a fur coat, to the young Sarang and Humayun gifted his sword to Sarang's younger brother, Adam Khan. At this meeting their father, Tatar Khan, was also present, as he had been advised by Daulat Khan Lodi to meet with Babur in order to incite him in attacking India. This meeting took place next to the Indus River, in Attock. On receiving his gift from Babur, the young Sarang exclaimed, ‚ÄúO King! If, in exchange for this fur coat, I have to give my life for you or your family then I will not hesitate in doing so.‚Äù The young Adam said to Humayun upon being gifted his sword, ‚ÄùO Prince! If I have to destroy the forts of your enemies with this sword then I will not hesitate in doing so.‚Äù === Father's assassination === Account of Tatar Khan assassination by Hathi Khan from the Persian rendering of Baburnama In 1519, Tatar Khan was assassinated by his nephew Hathi Khan, due to envy and hatred, in a late night raid on Pharwala Fort in which he also plundered the city, by doing so he was able to take control. When Babur was made aware of this incident he marched from Khushab and attacked Pharwala. This incident is recorded in Baburnama by Babur as such:The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians: The Muhammadan Period by Henry Miers Elliot, John Dowson, Volume IV, p. 235 === War with Hathi Khan === Sarang Khan and Adam Khan, both being young, escaped to Dangali. They then desired their share of the land and thus anarchy and disorder took rise. The hate, enmity, anarchy and discord coming from both sides increased to such an extent that war between Hathi Khan and the two brothers became inevitable and so they began to attack each other. It is famously known that the vanguards in the army of Hathi Khan declared that they would not strike any with the spear besides Sarang Khan. One of them, named Murad Khan, struck the head and face of Sarang Khan with a spear. ===Assassination of Hathi Khan=== Hathi Khan made peace with the Kaswals and married a daughter from the family of Basa Khan Kaswal, he also founded a township named after him, called Hathyah. The Kaswals, either due to old enmity or upon the encouragement of Sarang Khan, poisoned Hathi Khan through their daughter. He died due to this poisoning in 927 AH, 1520 CE after 12 years of rule. Whilst he was in the agonies of death, he sat Sarang Khan by his side and gave him some advice: ==Reign== Sarang Khan payed heed to the advice of Hathi Khan and buried the body of the deceased Sultan in the township of Plakhar, Haveli, Pargana Dangali. After that he heated a Tandoor and placed the woman inside it, burning her and reducing her to ashes. That place thus became known as Tandoorwala. He granted Murad Khan Badhal a robe of honour and gave him the command that the Kaswals be banished. They were stationed in great numbers at Jogyalkot Fort, which is near to the east of Thoa District. After much war and fighting, the fort was destroyed by a land mine and the Kaswals were banished from the land of Pothohar, they chose to settle in Pargana Anderhal. After the death of Hathi Khan, Sarang Khan assumed leadership and the position of Sultan. In the mid 16th century, the Afghan king, Sher Shah Suri usurped the Mughal dynasty under Humayun, the second Mughal emperor. Sultan Sarang resisted Sher Shah on the notion of loyalty to the ousted Mughals. Sultan Sarang was later captured by Islam Shah and flayed alive.The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians: The Muhammadan Period by Henry Miers Elliot, John Dowson, Volume IV, p. 493 Sultan Sarang was thus martyred in 1546 and is buried in a tomb in Rawat Fort.

He spent time with a group of teenagers through to thirty-year-olds‚Äîthe \\"sub-culture of the mall\\"‚Äîwatching films and playing video games, and noticed the discrepancies between the teenagers' behavior and the way they were portrayed in the teen films they saw. He had attended the University of Southern California to learn screenwriting and had already written nine as-yet unsuccessful spec scripts. He went to his father, a psychiatrist, and told him that he was unsure of whether he could become a successful screenwriter in the film industry. His father advised him to create a list of everything he hoped to accomplish, and write next to each \\"You can do it\\". That night, he dreamed of a character who remained optimistic and whose mantra was \\"You can do it\\"; he says the entire film came to him in one night, and he had completed the Charlie Bartlett screenplay in four weeks after observing his teenage friends further for inspiration. As Nash finished writing Charlie Bartlett, he read C. D. Payne's novel Youth in Revolt for the first time. He wrote the screenplay for a film adaptation of the same name. He says that, writing the screenplay, he stayed as honest to the novel as possible besides changing the ending because he envied Payne's writing, saying jokingly, \\"Here was a chance to take credit for writing something that was much better than what I'd come up with on my own.\\" He says he preferred adapting Youth in Revolt to writing Charlie Bartlett as he had source material, and in early 2008 he was working on a spec script based on a graphic novel series of short stories called Rumble, Young Man, Rumble, which he is in an agreement to direct as well. He is also working on another teen film to star Vince Vaughn titled Career Day, based around a high school career day where adults visit the school to speak about their professions. ==References * Category:Film producers from California Category:American male screenwriters Category:Living people Category:People from Burbank, California Category:USC School of Cinematic Arts alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Screenwriters from California ","title":"Gustin Nash"},{"id":"19312896","text":"Haapalainen is a Finnish surname.

It is alleged that Hollingwood was the first village in the country to have hot running water via a ring main from a central boiler house in the village. This boiler house was shut down in the very early 1980s when gas and electric boilers became readily available. It is surrounded by Brimington (where the population is included), Barrow Hill, and Inkersall. Between Barrow Hill and Hollingwood runs the Chesterfield Canal which is currently being regenerated by the Chesterfield Canal Trust. The canal house at Hollingwood has been renovated as a visitor centre and a very popular cafe, as well as being the headquarters of the Trust.Richardson, Christine, Lower John (2010). Chesterfield Canal ‚Äì A Richlow Guide. Richlow. . The remains of the entrance to the Hollingwood Common Canal, originally a navigable adit, can still be seen close to the village. Between Hollingwood and Inkersall is Ringwood Park, this houses a fishing lake, BMX bike track and a small play park. At the top of the park is Ringwood Hall which was built by the Markham family for the management of Staveley Works. During the early eighties when the works started declining and management numbers fell it was opened up to lesser ranked workers to keep money coming in. However membership was strictly by committee only and members had to be approved. It is now open for wedding functions and has a number of rooms for rent. It also has a gym and pool which can be used by the public. It has a pub called the Hollingwood formerly known as the Hollingwood Hotel, this has a bowling green located at the rear of the pub. The BRSA club on Station Road is now in a state of ruin, more commonly known as the 'Railway Club' this closed in 2015. It did have another club called the 'Trough Lees', formerly known as the Lees Buildings, but this has now been demolished and at the moment the land lies in ruin. On the same road as the 'Trough Lees' is a working farm currently still in operation. It also houses a 'tack' shop which sells horse, dog, cat and bird food and supplies. Farm produce can be bought from the farm as well such as eggs, potatoes and other implements. Also local residents who have horses keep them there. The day centre on Station Rd, where people with learning disabilities could attend on a daily basis has now closed (2016) and has been demolished, a new housing estate has been built on the site. It used to have a church called St. Francis Church on Cedar Street, but this is now a set of flats. It has a primary school called Hollingwood Primary School,Hollingwood Primary School, Ofsted. accessed August 2012 the school has just opened as a new build, the old original school has now been demolished. The village did have a secondary school, which was called Westwood Lower School, (previously Hollingwood Senior Girls School),it used to school ages 11‚Äì14 (Westwood Upper School was located in nearby Brimington and used to school ages 14‚Äì16). The school was closed in 1992 and the land was sold off for housing to Barratts the housebuilders. The schools football field remained untouched and is now used for Sunday League football and events that are hosted by the Hollingwood public house. The local post office closed in November 2008 and the space left by it is currently waiting for planning permission to be granted to be turned into an Indian takeaway. However the other local shop has now reopened (Mar 2009) and seems to by flourishing.

It was developed by Wade and Brad Gillingham and became an internationally recognised contest featured at some of the world's most prominent strength athletics events and expos, including the Arnold Strongman Classic and the various WSM Super Series Grand Prixs. The last time the GNC Grip Gauntlet was run in a competitive format was the 2010 Arnold Classic. Since that time the challenge has changed to an informal challenge with no official results maintained. Prizes are still awarded for successful completion of the challenge. ==History== In 2002 Wade and Brad Gillingham (GNC Pro Performance Sponsored Athletes) and General Nutrition Center (GNC) introduced The Blob Challenge in the GNC booth at the Mr. Olympia in Las Vegas, NV. The Blob Challenge was run in the GNC booth at 4 events from 2002 - 2003. Late in 2003 Wade and Brad Gillingham wanting to expand the challenge came up with the idea to test 3 main facets of grip strength: Crushing Strength, Pinching Strength, and Supporting Strength. Upon approval from GNC to expand the challenge Wade approached Randall Strossen from IronMind to get permission to use Captains of Crush grippers as part of the challenge. In conversation with Randall it was decided that Wade and Brad's original idea to use a Thomas Inch Dumbbell replica for the supporting grip challenge should be replaced with the IronMind Rolling Thunder. The GNC Pro Performance Grip Gauntlet debuted at the 2004 Arnold Expo Challenge. The three implements used were the No. 3 Captains of Crush gripper, the Rolling Thunder, and an implement called the Blob. Cash prizes were available for succeeding with all three elements of the challenge. An estimated 20,000 competitors at Fitness Expos over a 7 year run from 2004-2010 tested their hands at the GNC Grip Gauntlet. As to the stature of the Gauntlet, Gillingham is quoted as saying in 2008: \\"If you think this challenge isn't world class, think again. Over the past four years, an estimated 10,000 attempts have been made to complete the three challenges on the GNC Grip Gauntlet stage and only two individuals have ever completed all three in the ‚Äòheavy‚Äô format.\\"The two men to whom Gillingham was referring were former NFL linebacker and professional wrestler, Monte ‚ÄòAlpha Male‚Äô Brown, and Wade Gillingham himself. The Gauntlet eventually settled on three formats, Light, Medium and Heavy. In early 2009, the weight of the Rolling Thunder was dropped from 212 lbs to 207 lbs, to correspond with Ironmind's new version of the Rolling Thunder.Wade Gillingham's Arnold Classic Recap In 2010 due to changes in the Rolling Thunder and a change from Captain's of Crush grippers to the new GNC Pro Performance Hand Grippers, it was decided by Wade Gillingham that the historical integrity of the event was not longer sound enough to continue compiling a list of winners. ==Disciplines== The disciplines of crushing, pinching and supporting are tested. Crushing, uses the IronMind Captains of Crush grippers. Supporting is tested using IronMind Rolling Thunder. Pinching (or pinch gripping) uses the Blob. {  !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"Implement !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"Light Format !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"Medium Format !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"Heavy Format - Rolling Thunder  187 lbs  197 lbs  207 lbs - Blob  50 lbs  50 lbs  50 lbs - Crush Grippers  #2  #2.5  #3 } ==Rolling Thunder== Although often referred as a part of the GNC Grip Gauntlet, the Rolling Thunder's history goes back more than a decade before the Gauntlet first existed. IronMind developed the Rolling Thunder in 1993 and it is now known by strong men worldwide. One-hand deadlifts had long been a preferred means of testing and building grip strength and Rolling Thunder itself is a thick revolving deadlift handle to which can be attached weights. Such is the rise of its popularity that Rolling Thunder competitions are often held in conjunction with major strongman events including the Mohegan Sun Grand Prix 2008 and the Hawaii based Beauty and the Beast Strongman Contests. As part of the GNC Grip Gauntlet it is also seen around the world at expos. Early on in its history, in 1993, Ironmind issued a challenge to the world of strongmen to lift 300 lbs with Rolling Thunder, and it took 15 years for this challenge to be met when Mark Felix performed the feat at the Mohegan Sun Grand Prix 2008, in the process becoming Rolling Thunder World Champion. In May 2009 Felix defended his Mohegan Sun title, although this was not considered the world championships.Mark Felix Wins Mohegan Sun Rolling_Thunder Championships II He defended the world title in June 2009 in Quebec as a lead-in event to the Fortissimus championships.

The experience persuaded her to race seriously.

The Golden Book of Cycling, which she signed when she was 29, said: \\"Her potential was evident: Britain had a new star in the making.\\" She won the national 3,000m individual pursuit championship at Leicester in 1982, broke the world 5,000 metres record on the same track in the same year, and became national 50-mile time-trial champion.

When the Armidale Teachers‚Äô College (ATC) was established in 1928 there was a need to provide accommodation for the women students and this was met by using Girrahween a building opposite Central Park, which had originally been constructed as a private boarding school for girls. In 1930 the residence was renamed after the then Director of Education in New South Wales, Stephen Henry Smith. S H Smith House remained as a residence for ATC until 1972, then continued as a residence for Armidale College of Advanced Education students until amalgamation with the University in 1989. When Smith House became co-ed in 1974 it housed 233 students in a complex of buildings. During the period following amalgamation, the College Finance Officer was Ms Allison Rocks and the Head of Residence was Dr AW (Sandy) Scott. Drummond College was established as a College of the University in 1969 with 109 females and 44 males, with Dr Richard Bawden appointed as the first permanent head of the College in 1970. Drummond College operated throughout the 1970s until 1979 when the University withdrew it from student accommodation and used it primarily for conferences, also giving office space to the Financial Management Research Centre and The Regional Centre for Music and Drama. Drummond is named after the late Hon. David Henry Drummond, a prominent State and Federal parliamentarian, and for almost 14 years, NSW Minister for Education. D H Drummond played a vital role in the establishment of the University of New England in the mid to late 1930s and is often referred to as the Father of the University of New England. The College was restored and reopened as a fully operational college in 1990. During most of this period from 1990 to 1996 Mrs Wallis Lenehan was the Secretary and Mr Mike Knowling was appointed the Principal. Following a downturn in students requiring residential accommodation, the University decided in late 1996 to consolidate the residential colleges on the main campus and to generally reduce the number of beds in the residential system for 1997. One result of this decision was the amalgamation of Drummond College and S H Smith House to form the new entity Drummond and Smith College. This was located in the Drummond College buildings with Dr AW (Sandy) Scott as Principal. ==Crest and Motto== The S H Smith House crest has been in place above the front foyer of Girrahween since it was built in 1889. Why John Bliss, the builder, used the St Andrews Cross on a curved raised surface set on scroll-like background is not known. However, the origin of the motto is: in 1992 Maurice Kelly, a retired UNE classics scholar was asked to write a Latin phrase to encapsulate the ideas of good living, health, and learning. Salubritati et litteris studemus literally meaning ‚Äúhealth and letters are our concern‚Äù, was his response. By way of contrast, Drummond College had its crest and motto devised by students in 1970. The motto Cognoscimus quo vivamus literally means ‚Äúlearning to live‚Äù, the idea coming from Isabelle Davidson. The crest is based on a design by John Tilly. Briefly, the two Tudor roses of the Drummond College crest represent the two sexes in the college (it was a relatively new concept to have co-ed colleges in 1970); the red wavy lines are symbols from the Drummond family; and the book signifies learning and scholarship. Both the original College shields, carrying the crest and motto, were donated by final year students. They now hang in the College dining room. == Some more recent events == Following a downturn in students requiring residential accommodation, the University decided in late 1996 to consolidate the residential colleges on the main campus and to generally reduce the number of beds in the residential system for 1997. One result of this decision was the amalgamation of Drummond College and S H Smith House to form the new entity Drummond and Smith College. This was located in the Drummond College buildings with Dr AW (Sandy) Scott as Principal and Ms Allison Rocks as Finance Officer. The shield for Drummond and Smith College was officially unveiled by Professor Michael Stoddart (DVC Academic) on 25 October 1997 following a design competition amongst students early in 1997. The wording for the motto was suggested as \\"through unity is strength\\" and was translated by Maurice Kelly, a retired UNE classics professor. He presented the College with the Latin Per concordiam animi robur literally meaning \\"through hearts in unison mind like the strength of oak\\" : Strength Through Unity. Many of the valued traditions and practices from the original Colleges are in action. The links with the Drummond family and the annual D H Drummond Dinner continue, the Drummond Address in 1999 being given by the Director of the Australian Museum, Michael Archer. In 1997 both the Drummond Senior Common Room and the Fellows of S H Smith House combined and reconstituted themselves as The Fellows of Drummond and Smith College. In July 1999 Dr. Sandy Scott retired as head of Drummond and Smith College. Allison Rocks took on as The Acting Head until July, 2000 when the University appointed Edwina Ridgway as Principal of both Drummond & Smith and Duval Colleges. With a review of the total operation of both Colleges the new administrative entity in 2001 was moved to offer, through outsourced caterers, Eurest Australia, a combined 'Cafeteria' to provide supplementary food services under the direction of The Principal and a 'one-line' budget has been prepared to enable both Colleges to flourish in the future. ==List of College PrincipalsFor 1997 - 2005, see: Handbook, University of New England (Armidale, Australia), .== * 1997-1999 Dr A.W.

When, after fifteen years, Mayall disbanded the Bluesbreakers, Whittington continued to gig in Texas, but also joined forces with Roger Cotton and Pete Stroud, who had toured with Mayall as part of Peter Green's band. In 2008, Whittington released his first solo album and he continues to tour regularly in the UK and throughout Europe, though Roger Cotton has left the band, which now works as a threesome featuring Darby Todd on drums. In August 2013, Whittington sat in with his old boss John Mayall at the Bedford Blues Festival in Bedford, Texas. Whittington lives in Hurst, Texas with his family. Whittington usually plays a 1963 Stratocaster plugged into a Dr. Z amplifier. He also plays a Lentz guitar modeled partially after the Fender Telecaster. ==Discography== * 1980 ‚Äì Texas Boogie Blues (Ray Sharpe) * 1995 ‚Äì Spinning Coin (John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers) * 1997 ‚Äì Blues for the Lost Days (John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers) * 1999 ‚Äì Padlock on the Blues (John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers) * 2001 ‚Äì Along for The Ride (John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers) * 2002 ‚Äì Stories (John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers) * 2003 ‚Äì 70th Birthday Concert (John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers) * 2005 ‚Äì Road Dogs (John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers) * 2007 ‚Äì In the Palace of the King (John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers) * 2007 ‚Äì Buddy Whittington (Buddy Whittington Band) * 2007 ‚Äì Texas Blues Project, Vol. 1 (Dr. Wu and Friends) * 2010 ‚Äì Bag Full of Blues (Buddy Whittington Band) * 2010 ‚Äì Texas Blues Project, Vol. 2 (Dr. Wu and Friends) * 2011 ‚Äì Six String Svengali (Buddy Whittington Band) ==References * Buddy Whittington on Myspace * Official Buddy Whittington website Category:1956 births Category:John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers members Category:Living people Category:Guitarists from Texas Category:American male guitarists Category:People from Fort Worth, Texas Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:21st-century American guitarists ","title":"Buddy Whittington"},{"id":"19313087","text":"Coronation Cinematograph and Variety Hall was a hall in the Girgaon area of south Mumbai, India used for variety entertainment shows, dramas and to screen movies.

It is the true story of a Jewish family that escaped from Nazi-occupied Vienna to Shanghai under Japanese rule. The book was published in English in Canada and in the U.S. by St. Martin's Press in 2004 and has been republished in Germany (as Von Wien nach Shanghai), Italy (as Dieci Bottiglie Verdi), Hungary (as Sanghaji Fogsag) and China (as ÂçÅ‰∏™ÁªøÁì∂Â≠ê). In Canada it won the Canadian Jewish Book Award and in Italy won the ADEI (Associazione Donne Ebree d'Italia) - WIZO Award. It has received generally positive critical reviews in the North American press. The title of the book comes from the song sung in Marco's Bar by British servicemen stationed in Shanghai. ==Plot== The book is told from the viewpoint of the author's mother and starts in 1921. Gerda Karpel (referred to always as Nini in the book) is a 5-year-old Jewish girl living in Vienna in 1921. She comes from an upper-middle-class family. The book starts with the birth of Nini's brother, Willi, and chronicles the death of Nini's father shortly after the birth. The book then discusses day-to-day life from the viewpoint of a Jewish girl growing up in Vienna. It talks about the political instability caused after the assassination of Engelbert Dollfuss and the suppression of democracy after it. The Anschluss occurs, and Nini desperately tries to secure tickets to Shanghai. She receives help from Herr Berger, a Gentile Vienna lawyer, and obtains tickets for her family and for her friend's parents. The book then mentions the infamous Kristallnacht and the lead up to their departure. In Chapter 19, the Karpel family arrives in Shanghai. They struggle to survive through the poverty and violence that greets them on arrival and to the moving of most Jews into a ghetto in the Hongkou District. During that time, they purchase ownership in a bar owned by Marco, a Bulgarian Jew; this is where Nini heard the song \\"Ten Green Bottles\\". The book ends with the family leaving Shanghai for Richmond Hill, Canada. ==Play== The critically acclaimed world premiere of the play was performed in English in Toronto, Canada in 2009. All performances were sold out and seen by over 4,000 people. It was produced by Helena Fine of Te-Amim Theatre and written and directed by Mark Cassidy of Threshold Theatre. == External links == * Vivian Jeanette Kaplan website * On the Writing of Ten Green Bottles * Reading Group Guide * Teacher's Guide * Student's Guide Category:2004 non- fiction books Category:World War II memoirs Category:Jewish Chinese history ","title":"Ten Green Bottles (book)"},{"id":"19313118","text":"The Future of Things (TFOT) is an online magazine covering diverse topics related to science and technology. The magazine was launched in 2006. ==History== TFOT was founded by Iddo Genuth and co-founder Barak Raz in early 2006 and its beta version was first launched on the 27 of September 2006. During beta the site included two sections ‚Äì Picture of the Day (PODs) and Articles. In mid-2007 TFOT launched its full version with several new sections and a new design. Its team has more than 20 writers, from various countries worldwide. As of 2013 TFOT has been running under a different management. ==Sections== As of September 2008, TFOT had several sections including: headlines, news, PODs, personal columns, book reviews and forums. TFOT also includes full articles which typically contain a Q&A; section which, according to TFOT, is a more accurate way of doing an interview. In January 2009 TFOT added a video section featuring science and technology related videos from the web as well as original video clips produced by the TFOT team. Another change in 2009 was the expansion of the daily RSS service, providing headlines from similar websites among the original research published in the website. Until then, a smaller number of headlines were uploaded each day. ==Scoops== On August 22, 2007 TFOT was the first to extensively cover the Israeli company Mempile TeraDisc 1TB optical storage technology. The article was later picked up by numerous websites including Engadget , tgdaily and arstechnica . On January 14, 2009 TFOT exclusively reported on advancements in laser hard drive development . This news was quickly picked up by several publications including Engadget and electronista . ==Criticism== Since its launch in early 2008, TFOT's headlines section was criticized several times for being too short (approx 500 characters); this, however, is probably the result of copyright issues. A different criticism was raised regarding the relatively short term look at the future of science and technology on TFOT as the site typically deals with research and technology for the next 5‚Äì10 years or so. ==Similar websites/magazines== *Physorg *Technology Review *Scientific American ==External links== * The Future of Things website Category:Croatian news websites Category:Science websites Category:Technology websites Category:Internet properties established in 2006 ","title":"The Future of Things"},{"id":"19313121","text":"The Communaut√© d'agglom√©ration du Grand Gu√©ret was created on December 15, 1992 as communaut√© de communes de Gu√©ret Saint-Vaury and is located in the Creuse d√©partement of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, central France.

At the Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung (Musicians Assembly) of 1859 in Leipzig, the organisers, Liszt and Brendel, wanted to open the path for the foundation of a \\"Allgemeiner Deutscher Musikverein\\" (General German Music Association), to embody what they thought of as the core principles of the New German School (q.v.) of music. The proposal was introduced by Louis K√∂hler on the afternoon of June 3, 1861. It was supported in speeches by prominent persons, among them Liszt, and then accepted.See: Pohl (1859) p. 296. On 7 August 1861, at the next Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung, for this time in Weimar, the foundation of the ADMV took place. The association started with 202 members, 37 of them from abroad.Lucke-Kaminiarz: Der Allgemeine Deutsche Musikverein, p. 224. ==The ADMV== Liszt left Weimar on August 18, travelling to Silesia, where, from August 22 until September 19, in L√∂wenberg he was guest of the Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen. In a letter to Brendel of September 16, 1861, he wrote: :His Highness adheres always firmly and faithfully to the endeavors of the \\"New German School,\\" and is desirous of supporting it still further. On this account I think it would be desirable to elect SeifrizMax Seifriz (1827‚Äì1885) was conductor of the Prince's Court Orchestra in L√∂wenberg. Under his direction, the orchestra frequently played works by Liszt; see: Walker (1989) p. 299. as a member of the Committee of the Allgemeiner Deutscher Musikverein. I also vote especially for Stein (of Sondershausen), Eduard Liszt, Herbeck, Ambros, David ‚Äì without a word against the rest of the names which you have proposed.La Mara (ed.): Liszts Briefe, Band 1, No. 260. The letter shows that, according to Liszt's wishes, the endeavors of the \\"New German School\\" and those of the ADMV were to be very close, not to say identical. For the purpose of reaching this aim, the steering committee of the ADMV should consist solely of persons with his confidence. The main initiatives which led to the foundation of the ADMV had nearly all been Liszt's. In 1835 he had published in the Parisian Gazette musicale an article series De la situation des artistes (\\"On the situation of artists\\"). In his first articles, he had taken a critical look at contemporary Parisian musical life which he found wanting in all aspects. In his last article he had made suggestions for a reorganisation of musical life. In October 1842 Liszt had been nominated in Weimar as \\"Kapellmeister in au√üerordentlichen Diensten\\" (\\"Conductor in extraordinary services\\"). At that time he was travelling virtuoso, touring with concerts through Europe. In the beginning of 1848 he had settled in Weimar. Since 1849 he had tried to install a \\"Goethe-Stiftung\\" (\\"Goethe Foundation\\") for the purpose of supporting the arts as suggested in his article series of 1835. During the 1850s it became clear that the project could not be realized.For details concerning the \\"Goethe-Stiftung\\" see: Raabe (1931), pp. 201ff. The foundation of the ADMV was Liszt's next attempt, and this attempt was a success. In their version of 1861, the statutes of the ADMV were formulated by Liszt together with Brendel. They resembled those of the projected \\"Goethe-Stiftung\\".Lucke-Kaminiarz, p. 223. In the early 20th century, there were attempts to rename the ADMV as \\"Liszt Verein\\" or \\"Neudeutscher Musikverein\\" (\\"New German Music Association\\").Raabe (1931), p. 229. Until the end of his life, Liszt was the intellectual rector of the ADMV,Kaminiarz: Richard Strauss, Briefe, p. 12. but did not want to be its president.See his letter to Brendel of September 16, 1861, in: La Mara (ed.): Liszts Briefe, Band 1, No. 260. The first president was Franz Brendel, until his death in 1868. Brendel's successors were Carl Riedel, until 1888, Hans Bronsart von Schellendorff, until 1898, Fritz Steinbach, until 1901, Richard Strauss, until 1909, Max von Schillings, until 1919, Friedrich R√∂sch, until 1925, Siegmund von Hausegger until 1935, and Peter Raabe. In 1937, the ADMV was closed on order of the German National Socialist regime. ==Aims of the ADMVSupporting aims=== The ADMV aimed at both musical performance and practical support. Absence of funds delayed support initiatives. In the course of time the ADMV became trustee of several foundations. The earliest was a \\"Beethoven-Stiftung\\" (Beethoven Foundation), (1871) funded by the assets of Sophie and Robert Pflughaupt, and enlarged by gifts of Liszt and Karl Alexander, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. Artists supported by the \\"Beethoven-Stiftung\\" included Robert Franz, August G√∂llerich, Felix Draeseke, Max Reger, Hans Pfitzner and others. After Liszt's death on July 31, 1886, Marie Hohenlohe-Schillingsf√ºrst, daughter of Princess Wittgenstein, founded in 1887 a \\"Franz Liszt Stiftung\\" (Franz Liszt Foundation). The funds were destined for editing a complete edition of Liszt's musical works, as well as for stipends. Amongst artists supported by the \\"Franz Liszt Stiftung\\" were Robert Franz and Claudio Arrau. In 1903 and 1904, when Richard Strauss was president of the ADMV, Arnold Schoenberg was supported with an annual sum of 1,000 Marks, the maximum grant of the foundation. Further foundations were a \\"Mansouroff-Stiftung\\", founded 1889, a \\"Hermann-Stiftung\\", founded 1893, and a \\"Richard-Wagner-Stiftung\\", founded 1915 and dedicated to supporting performances of music dramatic works. In 1937, when the ADMV was closed, the foundations still existed, although there had been losses of considerable amounts due to World War I and subsequent economic crisis. Traces of the foundations can be found until 1943, but are lost thereafter.Lucke-Kaminiarz, p. 224f. ===Artistic aims=== As part of the artistic aims of the ADMV, annual Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlungen at different locations were to be arranged, with performances of important, rarely heard, and especially new musical works of all kinds. However, older works that were only seldom or not at all heard, but of interest because of their importance, were also to be performed. In addition, new works, either musical or scholarly ones, were to be printed. The ADMV was to have an own library, and to edit an annual almanac. Of the almanac, only volumes for the years 1868, 1869 and 1870 were realized. Until 1892, the main organ of the ADMV was the Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik. Afterwards, until 1933, members of the ADMV received \\"Mitteilungen\\" (Communications). The ADMV had a literary and a musical department; the former decided about lectures to be given at the Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlungen, the latter selected musical works to be performed. Until his death in 1886, Liszt was the head of the musical department. Other prominent members over the years were Hans von B√ºlow, Carl Friedrich von Weitzmann, Louis K√∂hler, Carl Riedel, Bronsart von Schellendorff, Felix Draeseke, Eduard Lassen, Eugen d'Albert, Richard Strauss, Engelbert Humperdinck, Felix Weingartner, Max von Schillings, Siegmund von Hausegger, Hans Pfitzner, Alexander von Zemlinsky, Peter Raabe, Jean Louis Nicod√©, Emil von Reznicek, Heinz Tiessen, Joseph Haas, Paul Hindemith, Alban Berg, Ernst Toch and others.See: Lucke-Kaminiarz, p. 225f, and: Walter (2000), p. 317\\\\. During Liszt's lifetime, the musical department received about 20 scores each year from composers who wished their works to be performed. In the beginning of the 20th century this became an annual amount of about 130, and in the 1920s an annual amount of up to 700 scores; see: Kaminiarz (1995), p. 25. The musical department also decided at which places the Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlungen should be arranged. After the Tonk√ºnstler- Versammlung of 1861 in Weimar, there was a break of three years. In 1864 a Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung in Karlsruhe took place. After that, with exception of the years 1866, 1875 and 1915‚Äì18 (World War I), annual Tonk√ºnstler- Versammlungen were arranged.See the list in: Kaminiarz (1995), p. 20\\\\. The list is incomplete, since the Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlungen of 1859 in Leipzig and of 1919 in Berlin are missing. In several cases, 1903, 1910 and 1932, places in Switzerland, Basel, Z√ºrich, and once again Z√ºrich, were chosen. The Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung of 1905 took place in Graz. ==Concert repertoire of the ADMV until 1886== During Liszt's lifetime, he was himself by a long way the most frequently performed composer at the concerts of the Tonk√ºnstler- Versammlungen.See the table in: Lucke-Kaminiarz, p. 234f. In 135 performances 96 of his works were played. The second place was held by J. S. Bach with 30 performances of 24 works. Many of his works were new discoveries after they had for the first time been published in the complete edition of the \\"Bach- Gesellschaft\\" (Bach-Society). After Liszt the most frequently performed contemporary composer was Brahms with 25 performances of 16 works.In Lucke- Kaminiarz, p. 234, erroneously \\"26 Werke\\" is printed, while \\"16 Werke\\" was meant. Of Berlioz, 14 works were performed in 23 performances, and of Wagner 12 works in 22 performances. In places 6 to 12 were Raff, Cornelius, Lassen, Schumann, Draeseke, Beethoven and B√ºlow. The strong position of Brahms in the concert programs of the ADMV may at first sight be surprising, as he had been often characterized by reference to the \\"Manifesto\\" he wrote with Joachim against the New German School. But an artist's career can hardly be reduced to a single event. Even in 1864, in connection with the Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung in Karlsruhe, it was Liszt who suggested a performance of Joachim's Violin Concerto in Hungarian style. After a dispute with B√ºlow, who vehemently voted against, Liszt's suggestion was accepted.Lucke-Kaminiarz, p. 230. After 1869, Brendel having died the previous year, works by Brahms were regularly performed; and 1887, after Liszt's death, Brahms became himself a member of the ADMV. Shortly afterwards he was elected as member of the steering committee.Lucke-Kaminiarz, pp. 229f.

Frequently Liszt also suggested works by Russian composers such as C√©sar Cui, Alexander Borodin, Alexander Glazunov, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, all of them members of the ADMV.Kaminiarz (1995), p. 14. In 1876, 1880 and 1883, the Symphony in E-flat major of Borodin was played. However, not all of Liszt's suggestions regarding Russian composers found acceptance. For example, in 1885 it was Liszt's suggestion to perform the Symphony in C major by Mily Balakirev, dedicated to him himself. Instead, Balakirev's Overture King Lear and some of his piano pieces were played.Lucke-Kaminiarz:, p. 229. Due to the close connection between Liszt himself, the \\"New German School\\" and the ADMV, the above listed works can be taken as examples of music of the \\"New German School\\". Estimating their artistic value, or even getting knowledge of them, is however a difficult task. Nearly all of the works have disappeared from the regularly played concert repertoire, and the scores can only be accessed in archives. The music of the \\"New German School\\" up to 1886, including most of Liszt's works, was neglected or ignored even by scholarly research for a long period, with the exception of that of Wagner. Only relatively late in the 20th century did interest revive. ==The ADMV after Liszt's deathThe ADMV up to World War I=== Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung 1‚Äì5 June 1894 in Weimar The development of the ADMV after Liszt's death is linked with the career of Richard Strauss. He was a member from 1887. In the same year, at the Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung in Cologne, his Piano Quartet, Op. 13, for was performed.Kaminiarz: (1995), p. 24. During 1890‚Äì98 Strauss was member of the \\"musikalische Sektion\\". As such he supported Gustav Mahler, whose Symphony no. 1 was performed in June 1894 at the Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung in Weimar. In 1898 a new president was to be elected, since Bronsart von Schellendorff wanted to resign. Strauss, at that time regarded as avant-garde composer, and a successful one, was an ideal candidate. However, there were severe divergences between him and the rest of the leading committee concerning his activities in favour of a change of the legal rights of composers of instrumental music, regarding royalties from performances of their works. For these reasons, after Fritz Steinbach had been elected as new president, Strauss was on September 24, 1898, excluded from the steering committee. He founded own organisations, but 1901 returned to the ADMV.Details will be found in: Walter (2000), pp. 291ff. In a so-called \\"revolution of Heidelberg\\" the old steering committee was removed, and Strauss was elected as president. The subsequent presidents Max von Schillings and Friedrich R√∂sch were close friends of Strauss, who in 1909 was nominated as Honorary President. Until World War I he dominated the ADMV as has Liszt in former times. During the last years of Bronsart's time as president discontent arose over the repertoire of the concerts at the Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlungen. In 1896, in Leipzig, for example, works by Alessandro Scarlatti, Pietro Antonio Locatelli, Johann Sebastian Bach, Georg Friedrich H√§ndel and Friedrich II of Prussia as well as works by Brahms, Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner were performed. The works of historical styles met an increasing interest of that time in music of the Baroque or even earlier periods of music history. Performing these works was in congruence with the statutes of the ADMV. Brahms, Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner, however, were more and more regarded as classics. While their works were still performed, works of the present generation of young composers, with exception of Strauss, were missing. The ADMV hence was accused of confusing an esprit de corps, as installed by Liszt, with interests of a diocese or the conceit of a regiment. Strauss, who did not share the interest in music of historical times,See his letter to Cosima Wagner of October 30, 1901, in: Wagner-Strauss: Ein Briefwechsel, p. 243, according to which his understanding of music history commenced with Liszt's Symphonic Poems. changed the statutes of the ADMV. Its central aim was now cultivating and supporting German musical life in the sense of new developments. The literary department and the paragraphs concerning performances of older works were removed, the Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlungen were renamed as Tonk√ºnstler-Feste (Musicians Festivals), and performances of works of the older \\"New Germans\\" were reduced to exceptions.Kaminiarz: (1995), p. 15. Until World War I, the most frequently performed contemporary composer at the Tonk√ºnstler-Feste was Strauss himself, but there were also works such as Mahler's Symphonies Nos. III and VI, Pfitzner's Overture Das Christ-Elflein, Reger's String Quartet in D minor op.113, The Swan of Tuonela and Lemmink√§inen's Return from the Lemmink√§inen Suite, Op. 22, of Sibelius, Bart√≥k's Rhapsody Op. 1 for piano and orchestra, and Kod√°ly's String Quartet in C minor. As president of the ADMV, Strauss was responsible for the complete edition of Liszt's musical works, as projected by the \\"Franz Liszt Stiftung\\". In this respect, due to legal difficulties, a delay occurred. The edition was to be undertaken by the publishing-house Breitkopf & H√§rtel, Leipzig, but the consent of original publishers of Liszt's works was needed. Most of them refused to take part. According to the legal situation of that time, Liszt's works were not free until 30 years after his death, i.e. in 1916.For details, see the letter by Strauss to Cosima Wagner of April 20, 1905, in: Wagner-Strauss: Briefwechsel, pp. 253f. The edition commenced in 1907 with volumes containing works, such as the Symphonic Poems, originally published by Breitkopf & H√§rtel. Until 1936 further volumes appeared. In the following year 1937, when the ADMV was closed, the Liszt edition, although by far incomplete, was stopped. ===The ADMV after World War I=== After World War I, at the Tonk√ºnstler-Fest of 1919 in Berlin, the ADMV restarted with a concert program consisting of Karl Prohaska's Oratorio Fr√ºhlingsfeier, Friedrich Klose's Oratorio Der Sonne Geist, Julius Weismann's Lieder auf indische Dichtungen with Trio accompaniment, Siegmund von Hausegger's Aufkl√§nge, Symphonic variations on the nursery-rhyme \\"Schlaf, Kindchen, schlaf\\", Georg Schumann's Variationen √ºber ein Thema von Bach, Op. 59, and his scene David und Absalom, Op.70, songs with orchestral accompaniment by Paul Stuiber, the String Quartet, Op.31, by August Reu√ü, a violin sonata by Julius Kopsch, Richard Strauss' 'Sechs Lieder, Op. 68, on poems by Clemens Brentano, a string trio by Erwin Lendvai, Paul Juon's tone poem Litania for piano, violin and violoncello, and songs by Heinz Tiessen.Walter (2000)', . The ADMV was attacked by critics from different sides. According to Bruno Schrader, an ultranationalist of an anti-Semitic inclination, most of the productions as performed at the Tonk√ºnstler-Fest were hyper modern. The songs by Paul Stuiber were caterwauling, and with the songs by Strauss, not fit to be sung as they were, impotence and decadence had reached their height. After World War I had been lost by the \\"Deutsche Reich\\", according to Schrader, a cultural retaliatory battle against a French, Belgian and Polish invasion of art had to take place.Walter (2000), . Other critics had opposite views. From their perspective, the ADMV was trying to reconstruct the cultural life of the \\"Deutsche Reich\\" of Wilhelm II. The \\"New Germans\\" thus were regarded as representatives of a misplaced traditionalism. Strauss‚Äôs Tone Poems, such as Also sprach Zarathustra, ten years earlier still regarded as avant-garde music, were now viewed as works of times of yore. His Sinfonia Domestica was old-fashioned and even scraping the borders of program music, which was no longer acceptable. His Elektra, premiered in 1909 and at that time attacked as ultra progressive, was old hat.Walter (2000), . The ADMV elected new presidents, in 1919 Friedrich R√∂sch, and in 1925 Siegmund von Hausegger. Until the early 1930s, works of a large scope of different styles, among them works by Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, Alban Berg, Paul Hindemith, Ernst Krenek, Heinz Tiessen and Karol Rathau, were performed. Unavoidably, among the members of the ADMV there were different opinions regarding these works. By some, Hindemith's dance pantomime Der D√§mon was taken as evil prank, and Krenek's opera Der Sprung √ºber den Schatten as music of an intellectually overfed brain. Rathau in his Second Symphony had created a dissonant soup. Nevertheless, the ADMV had once again proven itself to be the leading institution of musical progress.Kaminiarz: (1995), . ==End of the ADMV== Since 1933, after Adolf Hitler had become Chancellor of the \\"Deutsche Reich\\", the ADMV was attacked by the National Socialists. During the Tonk√ºnstler-Fest, now being called Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung again, of that year in Dortmund, the \\"Reichsministerium f√ºr Volksaufkl√§rung und Propaganda\\" (Ministry for the Enlightening of the People and Propaganda) of Joseph Goebbels made known that a reorganization of cultural life had to take place. In November 1933, as part of Goebbels' Ministry, a Reichsmusikkammer (\\"Imperial Music Chamber\\"), directed by Richard Strauss, was installed, responsible for all parts of German musical life. In July 1935 Strauss had to resign due to his collaboration with Jewish artists, especially with Stefan Zweig, librettist of the opera Die schweigsame Frau. His successor, until his death on April 12, 1945, was Peter Raabe. Siegmund von Hausegger, until then president of the ADMV, suggested his resignation in favour of Raabe, who should be elected instead. The suggestion was accepted, since leading members hoped, with Raabe's uniting both positions the ADMV could maintain independence; but this was an error. In 1936, at the Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung in Leipzig, Raabe read out a letter to the general assembly of the ADMV. It was a letter by some National Socialistic members to Paul Graener, rector of the composers department at the Reichsmusikkammer, with complaints about the steering committee of the ADMV. Suggestions by National Socialistic organisations had not sufficiently been taken into consideration. Besides, publishing-houses, such as Schott, were supported by the ADMV, although their catalogues were promoting the works of Jewish composers. The ADMV was also accused of being reigned by a \\"black-red coalition\\".Kaminiarz: (1995), . Black was meant as colour of the Church, and red as that of Socialists. After a heated debate with further accusations against Joseph Haas, Siegmund von Hausegger, Hermann Abendroth and Richard Strauss, the authors of the letter apologized. The letter, however, together with two further ones in which the liquidation of the ADMV was demanded, had been sent to the Gestapo. In December 1936, Raabe told the leading committee, Goebbels had said to him that the ADMV should be dissolved. Raabe tried to convince his colleagues that the Reichsmusikkammer was the proper cultural advocate of musicians. He also assured them that future Tonk√ºnstler-Feste would be as marvellous as the Nazi Rallies in Nuremberg. As Raabe found no support in decisions of two further general assemblies, in June and November 1937, the ADMV was closed.Kaminiarz: (1995), . In 1937, in Darmstadt and Frankfurt, a last Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung with concerts took place. As last pieces, Liszt's Symphonic Poem Orpheus, his Piano Concerto No. 1 in E-flat major, and the Faust Symphony were played.Kaminiarz: (1995), p. 19. The Faust Symphony, in its final version, had for the first time been performed at the Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung of 1861 in Weimar, where the foundation of the ADMV had taken place. A circle had closed. With the sounds of the Chorus mysticus \\"Alles Verg√§ngliche ist nur ein Gleichnis\\" (Anything perishable is only a symbol) the ADMV dismissed itself from history. ==Bibliography== * Kaminiarz, Irina (ed.): Richard Strauss, Briefe aus dem Archiv des Allgemeinen Deutschen Musikvereins 1888‚Äì1909, Weimar 1995. * Lucke-Kaminiarz, Irina: Der Allgemeine Deutsche Musikverein und seine Tonk√ºnstlerfeste 1859‚Äì1886, in: Altenburg (ed.): Neudeutsche Schule, pp. 221ff. * Pohl, Richard: Die Leipziger Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung, Erster Artikel, in: Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik, 50 (1859), pp.282ff and 289ff. * Raabe, Peter: Liszts Schaffen, Cotta, Stuttgart und Berlin 1931. * Wagner, Richard, and Liszt, Franz: Briefwechsel zwischen Wagner und Liszt, 3. erweiterte Auflage, ed.

Olsson is paralysed from the waist down and has barely 50% lung capacity left after the injury. ==Career== Olsson began to swim at an early age and he was very promising. But in his early teens he started to have problems with his back, he had been in a weightlifting accident as a child. It was a faulty vertebra that caused him pain. For a long time he was able to keep up with his athletic life but after several years he had to undergo an arthrodesis operation. Due to an accident in the home he fell so badly that he tore-up several muscles in his back. This led to other complications. He had to undergo stomach surgery and because of a failure during the spinal anaesthesia he had to be treated in a medical ventilator and this finally led to him being paralysed from the waist down. For several years Olsson was apathetic and got addicted to drugs, such as morphine, and other painkillers. But, in 2002, when a close friend made a bet with him that he would swim the vansbrosimmet an annual 3 km event in a river, his life took a turn for the better. He started to train and when he crossed the finish line he was in the top 100s out of over 3000 competitors. This is a result he later improved as he in 2007 came 9th. In 2004 he competed in the Paralympics in Athens where he won one gold medal and two bronze medals. His favorite event is the 400 m freestyle, a distance he was undefeated at and where he is the current world record holder. In 2005 he managed to complete the 90 km long Vasaloppet a crosscountry skiing competition, using a sled. In 2008 he competed in the Paralympics in Beijing where he won another two gold medals (100 m & 400 m freestyle). He won the annual swim competition at Alcatraz 2011, where he swam from the island to shore. In the 2012 Paralympics he won silver in the 400m freestyle, the first time he had been beaten in this event in a major international competition. ==References *Official site Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Paralympic gold medalists for Sweden Category:Paralympic bronze medalists for Sweden Category:Paralympic swimmers of Sweden Category:Swimmers at the 2004 Summer Paralympics Category:Swimmers at the 2008 Summer Paralympics Category:Swimmers at the 2012 Summer Paralympics Category:World record holders in paralympic swimming Category:Medalists at the 2004 Summer Paralympics Category:Medalists at the 2008 Summer Paralympics Category:Medalists at the 2012 Summer Paralympics Category:S6-classified Paralympic swimmers Category:Paralympic silver medalists for Sweden Category:Swedish male swimmers Category:Medalists at the World Para Swimming European Championships Category:Paralympic medalists in swimming ","title":"Anders Olsson (swimmer)"},{"id":"19313155","text":"El Manar English Girls School (M.E.G.S) () is a school in El Raml Station (Mahatet El Raml), Alexandria, Egypt.

This leads to the children eventually being taken from her and put in foster care. The film originally premiered on NBC on February 16, 1992. The film was partially shot in Marengo, Iowa, roughly 30 miles west of Iowa City. ==Plot== The film opens with Callie Cain (Parker) leading her kids in singing along to John Denver's \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\\" as she moves back to her hometown of Estherville, Iowa with her 4 young daughters (plus another baby on the way) and boyfriend Ray (Hodges). Although Callie's brother John (Graham) and sister-in-law Wanda (Atkinson) attempt to help them, the abusive Ray (the father of youngest child Jason) has no interest in working, and Callie rebuffs Wanda's suggestion that she continue treatment for the manic depression she suffers from. As a result, the family soon finds themselves living in poverty, with oldest child Jessi (Randall) forced to play mother to her younger sisters (Julie, Susan, and Cindy) and brother. A short time later, Ray leaves them, and Callie continues on a downward spiral. Sensing her sister in law has some serious problems, Wanda notifies the authorities, who send social worker Donna Evans (Barnes) to the house. After initially attempting to avoid her, Callie agrees to undergo treatment for her disorder, on the condition that John and Wanda don't get custody of her children, who are instead taken in by Patty and Harlan Pepper (Struthers and Johnston). Between the fact that the children are not only thriving in the Peppers' care, but also referring to them as \\"Mom\\" and \\"Dad\\", Patty soon becomes determined that she and Harlan win custody, particularly after seeing the effects that the children suffer after their required visits with Callie at the hospital. This results in a difficult legal battle, which drags on over a period of two years, and generates much media coverage over the legal system's apparent inability to act in the children's best interest. Despite the couple's best efforts, after much consideration, the presiding judge rules that the children be removed from Patty and Harlan's care. After a tearful farewell that generates more media attention, the children are placed in the care of the state, during which time they begin receiving therapy. During one of these sessions, Julie expresses anger towards her older sister for things not working out, despite Jessi's promise that they would, and tells her she's \\"just like Callie\\". Later, Jessi tearfully tells her therapist that she tried her hardest, but was overwhelmed by the adult role she attempted to fill. Meanwhile, all is not well for Harlan and Patty, whose marriage is deteriorating as a result of the grief caused by the children's removal. In a subsequent therapy session, Jessi is joined by Callie, who attempts to explain the reasons for her past erratic behavior, but Jessi is still angry with her mother for everything that happened, and the session abruptly ends when Callie runs from the center. After this incident, she subsequently disappears, thus detouring the original plan of eventually returning the children to Callie. Nor is there an alternate workable plan, as the current foster placement is only short-term, Harlan and Patty have split, and the kids blame their Uncle John for having them removed. Eventually finding Callie in the backseat of his truck, John makes a heartfelt plea for his sister to resume treatment, promising to care for her kids as if they were his own, and she finally agrees to do so. Callie then explains the situation to the kids, who ask why their Uncle John and Aunt Wanda never stepped in to help them before. At this point, Callie admits she refused to accept their help because of her illness, but assures the kids that the decision of where they will live is up to them. The younger children look to Jessi as to what they should do, but she snaps and tells them she doesn't know everything, and they should just take a vote. She then runs after her mother to wish her good luck, making an apparent peace with her, and Callie later bids goodbye to her children as they leave with John and Wanda, whom they have decided to live with. The film ends in the same manner as it opened, with the children singing a rendition of \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\\", eventually joined by their aunt and uncle.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104496/ ==Epilogue== As a result of the public consciousness raised by the real-life Cain children's experience, the Iowa State Legislature subsequently enacted new laws regarding the rights of foster children. The children themselves were subsequently adopted by their aunt and uncle, and continued to visit their mother frequently, though she was still battling mental illness. ==Cast== *Sarah Jessica Parker as Callie Cain *Sally Struthers as Patty Pepper *Lexi Randall as Jessica Cain *Gary Graham as John Birney *Susan Barnes as Donna Evans *Jayne Atkinson as Wanda Birney *John Dennis Johnston as Harlan Pepper *Tom Hodges as Ray Jacobs *Elizabeth Ashley as Carla Scott *Jessica Campbell as Julie Cain *Lacey Guyon as Susan Cain *Amanda Laughlin as Cindy Cain (age 5) *Molly Laughlin as Cindy Cain (age 3) *Matthew and Mitchell Cook as Jason Cain (age 3) *Chase and Corey Johnson as Jason Cain (age 2) *Milo Popp as Cousin Mark Birney *Jeremy Hopkins as Cousin Bobby Birney *Sonny and Alex Stinnet as Baby Jason Cain *Harry Lennix as Tim Coffey *Jane Lynch as Gwen Hatcher * Kris Dougherty as Kris Dougherty ==References * Category:1992 television films Category:1992 films Category:1990s drama films Category:American drama films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films about bipolar disorder Category:Films based on actual events Category:Films set in Iowa Category:Films set in the 1980s Category:NBC network original films Category:NBC Productions films ","title":"In the Best Interest of the Children"},{"id":"19313213","text":"Arthur Hugh Garfit Alston (born in West Ashby on 4 September 1902; died in Barcelona on 17 March 1958) was an English botanist.

His father was Anton Gueth, a professor and principal of the municipal Gymnasium of Wiesbaden, as well as a private councillor. His mother's name was Paula Auffahrt. She had studied piano and singing at the Royal Court Theatre in Kassel.Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker,pp.13‚Äì15 He studied at the K√∂nigliche Realgymnasium (Royal Gymnasium) in Wiesbaden from 1888 to 1896. From 1896 to 1898 he received private tuition in music theory and composition, and in playing the violin, piano, viola and clarinet. From 1889 to 1900 he studied theory and composition of music as well as the playing of the violin and piano at Hoch‚Äôsches Conservatorium (Hoch Conservatory) in Frankfurt. From 1900 to 1902 he studied composition under Charles-Marie Widor at the Music Academy of Paris (Paris Conservatoire).Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, p.15‚Äì16, 20 His childhood was happy. As a child Nyanatiloka had a great love of nature, of solitude in the forest, and of religious philosophical thought. He was brought up as a Catholic and as a child and adolescent he was quite devout. He went to church every evening and absorbed himself in the book The Imitation of Christ by Thomas √† Kempis. As a child he wanted to become a Christian missionary in Africa and as an adolescent he ran away from home to become a Benedictine monk at Maria-Laach monastery but soon returned. From then on his \\"belief in a personal God gradually transformed into a kind of pantheism\\" and was inspired by the prevailing atmosphere of weltschmerz (world-weariness). From the age of seventeen he was a vegetarian and abstained from drinking and smoking.Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, p.17 Around the age of fifteen he began to have an \\"almost divine veneration for great musicians, particularly composers, regarding them as the manifestation of what is most exalted and sublime\\" and made friends with musical child prodigies. He composed orchestral pieces and in 1897 his first composition called \\"Legende\\" (\\"Legend\\") was played by the Kurhaus Orchestra of Wiesbaden.Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, p.18 At about the same time he conceived a great love for philosophy. He studied Plato's Phaedo, Descartes, Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, von Hartmann and especially Schopenhauer. He also had a great interest for languages, foreign countries and peoples. While visiting a vegetarian restaurant he heard Theosophical lecturer Edwin B√∂hme give a talk on Buddhism which made him immediately an enthusiastic Buddhist. The following day his violin teacher gave him Buddhist Catechism by Subhadra Bhikshu and another book on Buddhism that gave him the desire to become a Buddhist monk in Asia.Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, p.19 After studying composition with the well-known composer Charles-Marie Widor in Paris, he played in various orchestras in France, Algeria, and Turkey. In 1902, intending to become a Buddhist monk in India, he travelled from Thessaloniki to Cairo by way of Palestine. After earning the necessary money by playing violin in Cairo, Port Said and Bombay, he travelled to Sri Lanka.Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, pp.23‚Äì24. ==Early years as a Buddhist monk== In 1903, at the age of 25, Nyanatiloka briefly visited Sri Lanka and then proceeded to Burma to meet the English Buddhist monk Bhikkhu Ananda Metteyya. In Burma he was ordained as a Theravada Buddhist novice (samanera) at the Nga Htat Kyi Pagoda under Venerable U Asabha Thera in September 1903. As a novice he first stayed with Ananda Metteyya for a month in the same room.Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, pp.24‚Äì25.Harris (1998). In January or February 1904 he received full acceptance into the Sangha (upasampada) with U Kumara Mahathera as preceptor (upajjhaya) and became a bhikkhu with the name of √ëƒÅ·πáatiloka. Although his preceptor was a renowned Abhidhamma reciter, he learned Pali and Abhidhamma mostly by himself. Later in 1904 he visited Singapore, perhaps with the intention to visit the Irish monk U Dhammaloka.Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, pp.27. Nyanatiloka wrote that Dhammaloka had a \\"dubious reputation\\" (\\"zweifelhaftem Ruf\\"), probably referring to controversial actions of Dhammaloka, such as his campaign against Christian missionaries, and appearing in Japanese monk's robes. See Turner, Alicia, Brian Bocking and Laurence Cox. At the end of 1904 he left Rangoon to go to Upper Burma together with the Indian monk Kosambi Dhammananda, the later Harvard scholar Dharmananda Damodar Kosambi. In a cave in the Sagaing Mountains they practised concentration and insight meditation under the instructions of a monk who was reputed to be an arahant.Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, pp.27. Desiring to deepen his study of Pali and the Pali scriptures, he went to Sri Lanka in 1905. In 1905‚Äì06 Nyanatiloka stayed with the Siamese prince monk Jinavaravamsa, (layname Prince Prisdang Jumsai, who had earlier been the first Siamese Ambassador for Europe) in palm leaf huts on the small island of Galgodiyana near Matara, which Jinavaravamsa called Culla-Lanka (\\"Small Lanka\\"). Pictures of Nyanatiloka and Jinavaravamsa taken at this monastery suggest that they were doing meditation of the nature of the body by way of observing skeletons or were contemplating death.'Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, pp.25‚Äì27, picture plate 2. Silacara, Dhammanusari, and Nyanatiloka, Burma, 1907 At Culla-Lanka Nyanatiloka ordained two laymen as novices (samanera). The Dutchman Frans Bergendahl, the troubled son of a rich merchant, was given the name Su√±√±o and the German Fritz Stange was given the name Sumano. In the summer of 1906 Nyanatiloka returned to Germany to visit his parents. Sumana, who was suffering from consumption and had to get treatment, also went with him. They returned to Sri Lanka in October. At the end of 1906 Nyanatiloka returned to Burma alone, where he continued to work on translating the Anguttara Nikaya. He stayed at Kyundaw Kyaung, near Rangoon, in a residence built for Ananda Metteyya and him by the rich Burmese lady Mrs Hla Oung. He also stayed in Maymo in the high country. At Kyundaw Kyaung he gave the novice acceptance to the Scotsman J.F. McKechnie, who got the Pali name Sasanavamsa. This name was changed to Silacara at his higher ordination. Nyanatiloka also gave the going forth (pabbajja) to the German Walter Markgraf, under the name Dhammanusari, who soon disrobed and returned to Germany. Markgraf became a Buddhist publisher and founded the German Pali Society (Deutsche Pali Gesellschaft), of which Nyanatiloka became the Honorary President. In 1906, Nyanatiloka published his first Buddhist work in German, Das Wort des Buddha, a short anthology of the Buddha's discourses arranged by way of the framework of the Four Noble Truths. Its English translation, The Word of the Buddha became one of the most popular modern Buddhist works. It has appeared in many editions and was translated into several languages. Nyanatiloka also started on his translation of the A·πÖguttara Nikaya. He gave his first public talk, on the Four Noble Truths, in 1907. It was given on a platform in front of the Pagoda of Moulmein. Nyanatiloka spoke in Pali and a Burmese Pali expert translated.Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, pp.25‚Äì27. ==Plans for a Theravada Buddhist monastery in Europe== Upon returning to Germany, Markgraf planned to found a Buddhist Monastery in the southern part of Switzerland and formed a group to realise this aim. Enrico Bignani, the publisher of Coenobium: Rivista Internazionale di Liberi Studi from Lugano had found a solitary alpine hut at the foot of Monte Lema Mountain, near the village of Novaggio overlooking Lake Maggiore, and Nyanatiloka left Burma for Novaggio at the end of 1909 or the beginning of 1910. The architect Rutch from Breslau had already designed a monastery with huts for monks, and the plan was that Bhikkhu Silacara and other disciples were to join Nyanatiloka there. Nyanatiloka's stay and plans drew a lot of attention from the press and several journalists visited him to write about him and the planned monastery. However, Nyanatiloka suffered heavily from bronchitis and malnutrition, and after half a year left Novaggio with the German monk candidate Ludwig Stolz, who had joined him at Novaggio, to try to find a better place in Italy or North Africa. In Novaggio he worked on his Pali-grammatik (Pali Grammar) and his translation of the Abhidhamma text called Puggalapa√±√±atti (Human Types).Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, pp.30‚Äì31. ==Italy, Tunisia, Lausanne== In Italy, Nyanatiloka first stayed with a lawyer in a town near Turin. After the lawyer tried to persuade Nyanatiloka and his companion Stolz to make harmoniums to make their living, they left to Rome, where they stayed with the music teacher Alessandro Costa. From Rome they went to Naples and took a ship to Tunis, where they stayed with Alexandra David-N√©el and her husband for a week. Then they went on Gab√®s, where they were told to leave Tunisia by policemen. After visiting David-N√©el again, they left for Lausanne, where they stayed with Monsieur Rodolphe-Adrien Bergier (1852-?) in his Buddhist hermitage called \\"Caritas\\". At Caritas, the glass painter Bartel Bauer was accepted by Nyanatiloka as a novice called Ko√±√±a√±√±o. Soon after Ko√±√±a√±√±o left to Sri Lanka for further training, the American- German Friedrich Beck and a young German called Spannring came to Caritas. After two more unsuccessful visits to Italy in search of a suitable place for a monastery, Nyanatiloka, Spannring, Stolz, Beck, and perhaps also Bergier, left to Sri Lanka from Genoa on 26 April 1911 to found a monastery there.Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, pp.31‚Äì35, endnote 71. ==Founding of the Island Hermitage== After arriving at Sri Lanka, Nyanatiloka stayed in a hall built for Ko√±√±a√±√±o in Galle. Ludwig Stolz was given novice ordination at a nearby monastery and given the name Vappo. From Ko√±√±a√±√±o, Nyanatiloka heard about an abandoned jungle island in a lagoon at the nearby village of Dodanduva that would be a suitable place for a hermitage. After inspecting the snake-infested island and getting approval of the local population, five simple wooden huts were built. Just before the beginning of the annual monk's rainy season retreat (vassa) of 1911 (which would have been started the day after the full moon of July), Nyanatiloka and his companions moved to the Island. The hermitage was named Island Hermitage. The island was bought by Bergier in 1914 from its Burgher owner and donated to Nyanatiloka. In September 1911 Alexandra David-N√©el came and studied Pali under Nyanatiloka at the Island Hermitage while staying with the monastery's chief supporter, Coroner Wijeyesekera. Visitors such as Anagarika Dhammapala and the German ambassador visited the Island Hermitage during this period. Several Westerners‚Äîfour Germans, an American-German, an American, and an Austrian‚Äîwere ordained at the Island Hermitage between 1911 and 1914.Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, pp.35‚Äì39, 193. Stolz who had followed Nyanatiloka from Europe was ordained as a novice at the island in 1911 and was ordained under the name Vappo in Burma in 1913. In 1913 Nyanatiloka started a mission for the Sri Lankan \\"outcastes\\", rodiya, beginning in the area of Kadugannava, west of Kandy. Some of the rodiya lived and studied on the Island Hermitage. The son of the Rodiya chieftain was accepted by Nyanatiloka as a novice with the name √ëa·πáaloka. After the death of Nyanatiloka he became the abbot of the Island Hermitage. Nyantiloka mentions that there were reproaches because of the caste egalitarianism at the Island Hermitage ==Sikkim== Nyanatiloka travelled to Sikkim in 1914 with the intention to travel on to Tibet. In Gangtok he met the Sikkimese scholar translator Kazi Dawa Samdup and the Maharaja. He then travelled on to Tumlong monastery where Alexandra David-N√©el and Silacara were staying, and returned to Gangtong the next day. Because of running out of finances Nyanatiloka had to return to Ceylon. He returned to Sri Lanka accompanied by two Tibetans, who became monks at the Island Hermitage.Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, pp.40‚Äì44. ==World War I== In 1914, with the outbreak of World War I, Nyanatiloka along with all Germans in British colonies, was interned by the British. First he was allowed to stay at the Island Hermitage, but was then interned in the concentration camp at Diyatalawa. From there he was deported to Australia in 1915, where he mostly stayed at the prison camp at Trial Bay. He was released in 1916 on the condition that he would return to Germany. Instead he traveled by way of Hawaii to China in order to reach the Theravada Buddhist Burmese tribal areas near the Burmese border, where he hoped to stay since he could not stay in Burma or Sri Lanka. After China joined the war against Germany, he was interned in China and was repatriated to Germany in 1919.Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, pp.44‚Äì77, Buddhist Annual of Ceylon (1929). ==Japan== In 1920, after being denied re-entry into British ruled Sri Lanka and other British colonies in Asia, Nyanatiloka went to Japan with his German disciples Bhikkhu Vappo (Ludwig Stolz) and Sister Uppalava·πá·πáƒÅ (Else Buchholz). He taught Pali and German at Japanese universities for five years, including at Taisho University where he was assisted by the legendary eccentric Ekai Kawaguchi, and at Komazawa University where he taught with President Yamagami Sogen (Â±±‰∏äÊõπÊ∫ê), who had also studied Pali in Sri Lanka. He also met with Japanese Theravada monks, but could not stay in any monasteries in Japan. He lived through the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake, which destroyed Tokyo, but was surprised to see universities reopen just two months later. Nyanatiloka continued working on his translations of Pali texts during this period. In 1921 he visited Java, where he contracted Malaria, and Thailand, where he apparently hoped to stay since it was a Theravada Buddhist country. Although he was given a pass and visa by the Thai ambassador in Japan, he was arrested in Thailand on suspicions of being a spy and was deported after a few weeks. By way of China he returned to Japan.Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, p.82‚Äì101 ==Return to Sri Lanka and Island Hermitage== In 1926, the British allowed Nyanatiloka and his other German disciples to return to Sri Lanka. The Island Hermitage, which had been uninhabited for many years, was overgrown by the jungle and had to be rebuilt. The period from 1926 to 1939 was the period during which the Island Hermitage flourished most.Situation early 1929 described in: Mangelsdorf, Walter; Erlebnis Indien; Braunschweig 1950, p. 40-44. Scholars, spiritual seekers, adventurers, diplomats and high ranking figures such as the former King of Saxony visited and stayed during this period. Anagarika Govinda, the later Lama Govinda came in 1928 and with Nyanatiloka founded the International Buddhist Union (IBU), which stopped functioning after Govinda converted to Tibetan Mahayana and Vajirayana Buddhism a few years later. During the period from 1931 to 1939 there were many ordinations at the Island Hermitage, mostly of Germans. Nyanaponika (Sigmund Feniger), who became a well known Buddhist writer and scholar, and Nyanakhetta (Peter Sch√∂nfeldt), who later became a Hindu Swami called Gauribala, ordained as novices in 1936 and as bhikkhus in 1937. They both had a German Jewish background. All applicants for ordination were taught Pali by Nyanatiloka, who considered a working knowledge of Pali indispensable for a proper understanding of Theravada Buddhism since the translations of Buddhist texts at that time were often faulty.Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, p.105‚Äì110 ==World War II== In 1939, with the British declaration of war against Nazi Germany, Nyanatiloka and other German-born Sri Lankans were again interned, first again at Diyatalawa Garrison in Sri Lanka and then in India (1941) at the large internment camp at Dehradun.Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, p.128‚Äì142 ==Last Years, 1946‚Äì1957== In 1946, Nyanatiloka and his German disciples were permitted by the British to return to Sri Lanka, where they again stayed at the Island Hermitage. In 1949 the well known Western Buddhist monks, Nanamoli, Nyanavira were ordained under Nyanatiloka. In December 1950, Nyanatiloka became a citizen of the newly independent Ceylon. For health reasons he moved to the Forest Hermitage in Kandy in 1951. Vappo and Nyanaponika soon followed him. In 1954, Nyanatiloka and his disciple Nyanaponika were the only two Western-born monks invited to participate in the Sixth Buddhist council in Yangon, Burma. Nyanaponika read out Nyanatiloka's message at the opening of the council.Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, p.129‚Äì143, Pariyatti (2008). Nyanatiloka also served as the first Patron of the Lanka Dhammaduta Society (later renamed as the German Dharmaduta Society) which was founded by Asoka Weeraratna in Colombo, Sri Lanka on 21 Sept. 1952. Nyanatiloka attended and spoke at the Public Meeting held at Ananda College, Colombo on 30 May 1953 which was presided by Hon. C.W.W.Kannangara, then Minister of Local Government, to make public the findings of the survey carried out by Asoka Weeraratna (Founder and Hony. Secretary of the Lanka Dhammaduta Society) on the current state of Buddhist activities in Germany and the prospects for sending a Buddhist Mission to Germany before the Buddha Jayanthi celebrations in 1956. Nyanatiloka's Message to the Society dated 25 May 1953 contained in a Booklet entitled ' Buddhism in Germany ' by Asoka Weeraratna, was distributed at this Meeting, which was largely attended and comprised a very representative gathering of leading Buddhists. Nyanatiloka also resided temporarily at a new Training Centre for Buddhist Missionary work in Germany that was opened by the Lanka Dhammaduta Society in Dalugama, Kelaniya in 1953. Ven. √ë√¢naponika (German) and the (then) newly arrived Upasaka Friedrich M√∂ller from Germany were also temporarily resident together with Nyanatiloka at this Training Centre. Friedrich M√∂ller was the last disciple of Nyanatiloka. At the age of forty-three, M√∂ller was accepted as a novice by Nya·πáatiloka on 19 September 1955, taking the PƒÅli name √ëƒÅ·πáavimala. He was later known as Ven. Polgasduwe √ëƒÅ·πáavimala Thera. ==Death== Nyanatiloka died on 28 May 1957, in Colombo, Sri Lanka. At that time Nyanatiloka was resident at the Sanghavasa located on the newly opened premises of the German Dharmaduta Society at 417, Bullers Road (later known as Bauddhaloka Mawatha), Colombo 07. This was his last place of residence prior to his death. He was given a state funeral which had the then Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Hon. S.W.R.D Bandaranaike delivering the funeral oration. The proceedings of the funeral were broadcast live over Radio Ceylon. Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, p.157 ==Biography== The English translation of Nyanatiloka's German autobiography ‚Äì covering his life from his childhood Germany to his return to Ceylon in 1926 after banishment; finished by Nyanatiloka in 1948, but probably based on a draft written in 1926 - was published as part of The Life of Nyanatiloka: The Biography of a Western Buddhist Pioneer (written and compiled by Bhikkhu Nyanatusita and Hellmuth Hecker, BPS, Kandy, 2009 View online.)

In the 1960s, the Hamar Youth Club changed its name to the Somali African National Union (SANU). SANU and other parties competed for 123 parliament seats, taking part in the Somali parliamentary elections of 1964. In the general elections held in March 1969, it took home 6 seats.

Their houses, which are made from stone and wood, are based on a structure that strongly resembles the Monpa. The Khamba are adherents of Tibetan Buddhism and use Hingna, their own script, which is based on the Tibetan script.

If it includes the identity function, it is a monoid, called a transformation (or composition) monoid. This is the semigroup analogue of a permutation group. A transformation semigroup of a set has a tautological semigroup action on that set. Such actions are characterized by being effective, i.e., if two elements of the semigroup have the same action, then they are equal. An analogue of Cayley's theorem shows that any semigroup can be realized as a transformation semigroup of some set. In automata theory, some authors use the term transformation semigroup to refer to a semigroup acting faithfully on a set of \\"states\\" different from the semigroup's base set. There is a correspondence between the two notions. ==Transformation semigroups and monoids== A transformation semigroup is a pair (X,S), where X is a set and S is a semigroup of transformations of X. Here a transformation of X is just a partial function from subset of X to X, not necessarily invertible, and therefore S is simply a set of transformations of X which is closed under composition of functions. The set of all partial functions on a given base set, X, forms a regular semigroup called the semigroup of all partial transformations (or the partial transformation semigroup on X), typically denoted by \\\\mathcal{PT}_X. If S includes the identity transformation of X, then it is called a transformation monoid. Obviously any transformation semigroup S determines a transformation monoid M by taking the union of S with the identity transformation. A transformation monoid whose elements are invertible is a permutation group. The set of all transformations of X is a transformation monoid called the full transformation monoid (or semigroup) of X. It is also called the symmetric semigroup of X and is denoted by TX. Thus a transformation semigroup (or monoid) is just a subsemigroup (or submonoid) of the full transformation monoid of X. If (X,S) is a transformation semigroup then X can be made into a semigroup action of S by evaluation: : s\\\\cdot x = s(x)\\\\text{ for }s\\\\in S, x\\\\in X. This is a monoid action if S is a transformation monoid. The characteristic feature of transformation semigroups, as actions, is that they are effective, i.e., if : s\\\\cdot x = t\\\\cdot x\\\\text{ for all }x\\\\in X, then s = t. Conversely if a semigroup S acts on a set X by T(s,x) = s ‚Ä¢ x then we can define, for s ‚àà S, a transformation Ts of X by : T_s (x) = T(s,x).\\\\, The map sending s to Ts is injective if and only if (X, T) is effective, in which case the image of this map is a transformation semigroup isomorphic to S. ==Cayley representation== In group theory, Cayley's theorem asserts that any group G is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group of G (regarded as a set), so that G is a permutation group. This theorem generalizes straightforwardly to monoids: any monoid M is a transformation monoid of its underlying set, via the action given by left (or right) multiplication. This action is effective because if ax = bx for all x in M, then by taking x equal to the identity element, we have a = b. For a semigroup S without a (left or right) identity element, we take X to be the underlying set of the monoid corresponding to S to realise S as a transformation semigroup of X. In particular any finite semigroup can be represented as a subsemigroup of transformations of a set X with X ‚â§ S + 1, and if S is a monoid, we have the sharper bound X ‚â§ S, as in the case of finite groups. ===In computer science=== In computer science, Cayley representations can be applied to improve the asymptotic efficiency of semigroups by reassociating multiple composed multiplications. The action given by left multiplication results in right-associated multiplication, and vice versa for the action given by right multiplication. Despite having the same results for any semigroup, the asymptotic efficiency will differ. Two examples of useful transformation monoids given by an action of left multiplication are the functional variation of the difference list data structure, and the monadic Codensity transformation (a Cayley representation of a monad, which is a monoid in a particular monoidal functor category). ==Transformation monoid of an automaton== Let M be a deterministic automaton with state space S and alphabet A. The words in the free monoid A‚àó induce transformations of S giving rise to a monoid morphism from A‚àó to the full transformation monoid TS. The image of this morphism is the transformation semigroup of M. For a regular language, the syntactic monoid is isomorphic to the transformation monoid of the minimal automaton of the language. == See also == * Semiautomaton * Krohn‚ÄìRhodes theory * Symmetric inverse semigroup * Biordered set * Special classes of semigroups * Composition ring == References == * * * Mati Kilp, Ulrich Knauer, Alexander V.

A portico with four columns, which Cassin saw as a metaphor for the format of his draft The underlying structure of the Universal Declaration was introduced in its second draft which was prepared by Ren√© Cassin working from the Humphrey draft. The structure was influenced by the Code Napoleon, including a preamble and introductory general principles.Glendon, pp 62-64 Cassin compared the Declaration to the portico of a Greek temple, with a foundation, steps, four columns and a pediment. Articles 1 and 2 are the foundation blocks, with their principles of dignity, liberty, equality and brotherhood. The seven paragraphs of the preamble, setting out the reasons for the Declaration, are represented by the steps. The main body of the Declaration forms the four columns. The first column (articles 3-11) constitutes rights of the individual, such as the right to life and the prohibition of slavery. The second column (articles 12-17) constitutes the rights of the individual in civil and political society. The third column (articles 18-21) is concerned with spiritual, public and political freedoms such as freedom of religion and freedom of association. The fourth column (articles 22-27) sets out social, economic and cultural rights. In Cassin's model, the last three articles of the Declaration provide the pediment which binds the structure together. These articles are concerned with the duty of the individual to society and the prohibition of use of rights in contravention of the purposes of the United Nations.Mary Ann Glendon, A World Made New: Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Chapter 10 The Cassin draft was submitted to the Commission on Human Rights and was to undergo editing in the Commission, then in further drafts considered by the Third Committee of the United Nations, and finally in a draft before the General Assembly of the United Nations, which ultimately adopted the Declaration on 10 December 1948. The vote for the declaration was 48 to 0 with eight abstentions: the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, Czechoslovakia, the People's Republic of Poland, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Union of South Africa, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. == Controversies == The first controversy to resolve was related to the very origin of the human rights, basically the discussion between the supporters of the concepts of natural rights (which humans are endowed by God or Nature) and positive rights (which humans acquire as a result of a rational agreement).\\"–†–ê–ó–†–ê–ë–û–¢–ö–ê –í–°–ï–û–ë–©–ï–ô –î–ï–ö–õ–ê–†–ê–¶–ò–ò –ü–†–ê–í –ß–ï–õ–û–í–ï–ö–ê (1946‚Äì1948 –ì–ì.)\\", –ì–ª–µ–Ω –î–∂–æ–Ω—Å–æ–Ω (Glen Johnson ), –†–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏–µ –ª–∏—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ no. 3, 2014 The second controversy was basically between the positions of the Marxist theory of the Soviet Bloc and the liberal theory of the Western World. In philosophical terms, the Soviet Bloc criticized the individualist stance of the issue, arguing in favor of the collectivism approach, where the rights of the collective dominate that of an individual. In political terms, the Soviet Union and its satellites, facing mounting accusations of human rights violations, argued that the declaration is a mere formality if it would not consider guarantees of economic and social rights. However these objections were of surprisingly little consequence, because the Soviet Block was not very active during the seating of the Commission, perhaps indicating a preestablished decision not to sign the Declaration. Another issue is the legal status of the declaration. The majority considered the document to be mainly of moral character. At the same time some participants argued in favor of adding certain legal aspects in terms of international law. British representatives in particular were extremely frustrated that the proposal had moral but no legal obligation. (It was not until 1976 that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights came into force, giving a legal status to most of the Declaration) == UDHR timeline == Source: United Nations Year Book 1948-1949, pp. 524 et seq === 1945 === * United Nations Conference on International Organization, San Francisco === 1946 === * 15 February, Establishment of \\"Nuclear Committee\\" of Commission on Human Rights. * 29 April - 20 May 1946 - First Meeting of the Nuclear Committee. * 21 June 1946 - The UN Economic and Social Council adopts terms of reference of permanent Commission on Human Rights === 1947 === * 27 January - 10 February - First Meeting of the Commission on Human Rights, Lake Success, New York.

She was best known for the 1985 film A Hora da Estrela (Hour of the Star). ==Career== Amaral's film career started at the age of 37 when she entered the University of S√£o Paulo film school. After graduating, she taught at the University for three years and began working for Radio and Television Cultura. In her 14-year career at Radio and Television Cultura she produced approximately 50 documentaries, films, and plays for the station.Martin, Michael T. New Latin America Cinema. Vol. 2. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1997. In 1976 she moved to New York to pursue a degree in film from the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. She completed this degree and graduated in 1978. ==A Hora da Estrela== Amaral's first feature film and best known work, A Hora da Estrela (Hour of the Star) was released in 1985. Based on the novel of the same name by Clarice Lispector, the film focuses on the life of a troubled young protagonist, Macab√©a (Marc√©lia Cartaxo), living in S√£o Paulo. According to film critic Nissa Torrents, \\"the film upsets many stereotypes in its presentation of the female protagonist, who is neither beautiful nor middle-class. An anti- heroine, starved of affection and respect, she wanders through life looking for an image she can adopt and adapt.\\"Annette Kuhn and Susannah Radstone, eds., The Women‚Äôs Companion to International Film (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994), 13. The film was well received at its release and was a Submission to the 59th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film. Additionally, it was entered into the 36th Berlin International Film Festival, where actress Marc√©lia Cartaxo won the Silver Bear for Best Actress. At the 1985 Brasilia Film Festival the film won best picture and Amaral won best director. Additionally, the film also won best picture at the 1986 Havana Film Festival. Amaral was chosen as best director at the 1986 International Woman's Film Festival. A Hora da Estrela was shot in four weeks on a budget of $150,000, 70% of which was funded by Embrafilme. The success of A Hora da Estrela led Amaral to immediate notoriety, though none of her other films have achieved such success. ==Personal life== Amaral had nine children, one of which was born while she was pursuing her film studies in S√£o Paulo. She has said that she was \\"\\"totally dedicated to motherhood\\" for 10 years\\" before deciding to pursue her dream of filmmaking. She was divorced. Amaral was an avid follower of Bollywood films who said she wanted Indian films to come to Brazil in a big way.Sify Amaral was a Buddhist. ==Filmography== {  style=\\"width:100%\\" + Key - align=center style=\\"width:50px;background-color:#CEE8F0\\" Indicates a documentary align=center style=\\"width:50px;background-color:#FFECC8\\" Indicates a short film } { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" + List of films directed by Suzana Amaral - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\"  Original title ! scope=\\"col\\"  English release title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Language(s) ! scope=\\"col\\"  Notes - -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1970 ! scope=\\"row\\" CEE8F0;\\"  A Semana de 22   Portuguese  Short documentary on the Modern Art Week of 1922. -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  1971 ! scope=\\"row\\" CEE8F0;\\"  Sua Majestade Piolin   Portuguese  Short documentary on clown Piolin. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1980 ! scope=\\"row\\" CEE8F0;\\"  Projeto Pensamentos e Linguagem   Portuguese  Series of 15 films, each 15 minutes in length, as part of a training program for elementary school teachers. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1985 ! scope=\\"row\\"  A Hora da Estrela  Hour of the Star  Portuguese  -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1992 ! scope=\\"row\\"  Procura-se   Portuguese  TV mini series.

He has been internationally recognised for his work, but has faced widespread harassment from local authorities in his home country. In September 2008 he applied for political asylum in Norway. ==Work== His harassment began in May 1997, when the Chief of Post for the Immigration Police in Ekondo-Titi, a town close to the Nigerian border, responded to Njaru's allegations of various corruption by warning Njaru \\"that he would 'deal with him', should he continue to publish 'unpatriotic' articles, accusing police officers of corruption and alleging that constable P.N.E. had raped a pregnant Nigerian woman\\". According to Njaru's statement, he was eventually kicked and beaten to unconsciousness by the Chief of Post in October 1997. Complaints to the local authorities were fruitless because \\"his complaint had disappeared from the Registry\\". In February 1998, Njaru, hospitalised, was approached by the constable P.N.E., who arrested him, threatened him and slapped his face. Njaru spent parts of 1998 in hiding in Bekora Barombi. He was found and approached by the constable P.N.E. Around May 1999, Njaru wrote a newspaper article where he alleged ill- treatment of civilians conducted by the 11th Navy Battalion based in Ekondo- Titi. In late May Njaru was approached by the local captain who asked Njaru \\"to stop writing such articles and to disclose his sources\\". Refusing to do this, Njaru five days later found his house encircled by armed soldiers, and escaped to Kumba. Here, he was assaulted by police in June 2001, with no particular reason stated. Njaru complained to the local authorities, but later learned that \\"his complaint had not been received\\". Later, while still living in the Southwest Province, Njaru was threatened again in October and December 2003. In 2006, he was accused by local police of working for the Southern Cameroons National Council, a Southern Cameroons secessionist organisation. He was arrested on a bus, beaten and his gear confiscated, according to a piece written by former executive director of the World Press Freedom Committee Marilyn Greene. In August 2008, Njaru wrote a long complaint about alleged police fraud, arbitrary arrests and extortion of Nigerian immigrants, again in the town of Kumba. ===International attention=== In 2005 Njaru filed a case to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, evoking the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and citing \\"unlawful arrest, ill-treatment and torture, threats from public authorities and failure to investigate\\" as the reasons for his complaint. The committee found that Cameroon (the state party) failed to co-operate, not responding regarding the substance of Njaru's claims. Citing previous cases, the committee found that Njaru's claims should be given weight. Concluding the case in 2007, the committee commented \\"that the author [Njaru] is entitled (...) to an effective remedy\\" and that the state of Cameroon \\"is under an obligation to ensure that similar violations do not occur in the future\\". He was also mentioned specifically in Amnesty International's 2008 country report on Cameroon, as one case in a series of concerns about the human rights in Cameroon. He has won \\"multiple international awards\\" for his investigative journalism, among others the 2002 PEN-Novib Award, given by International PEN and NOVIB for \\"brave efforts to resist censorship\\". He was also given the Hellman-Hammett Grant in 2003 by Human Rights Watch. ==Defection attempt== In September 2008 he travelled to the Global Investigative Journalism Conference in Lillehammer, Norway. He represented Ocean City Radio, for which he has worked the past six years. He had previously been invited to the 2007 edition of the conference, held in Toronto, but was denied entrance into Canada. However, although there were suspicions that Njaru might defect during the conference, no objections were raised towards his entrance into Norway. On the night before the last day of the conference, he applied for political asylum in Norway. According to Njoru himself, he had a \\"90% chance\\" of getting murdered if returning to Cameroon. Commenting on the United Nations Human Rights Committee report, which called upon a remedy as well as future protection, Njaru stated that nothing had happened in this respect. ==References== Category:1960s births Category:Living people Category:Cameroonian journalists Category:Free speech activists ","title":"Philip Njaru"},{"id":"19313534","text":"Antoinette Halloran, 2016 Antoinette Halloran is an Australian operatic soprano. ==Education== Antoinette Halloran grew up in the Melbourne suburbs of Rosanna and Deer Park.\\"Ultimate nausea cure for mothers-to-be: Puccini\\" by John Mangan, The Age, 27 September 2009 She attended Mac.Robertson Girls' High SchoolThe Mac.Rob Portrait Gallery ‚Äì Antoinette Halloran 1983‚Äì1986 , Mac.Robertson Girls' High School and is a graduate of the Victorian College of the Arts where she won the Mabel Kent Scholarship and completed a Diploma of Arts (Voice); she has an Honours Degree in Music from the University of Melbourne.

Guitarists Sean Halleck and John Norris of Arlington were in this initial group. By 1995, the band had changed its name to Chomsky, and included Halleck, Norris, bassist James Driscoll, and drummers Rob Avsharian (of Bobgoblin) and Luke Adams. This lineup self-released an 8-track album in 1996 which was sold at shows in Denton. In 1997, Adams left the group and moved to Los Angeles, where he would later go on to drum for Pete Yorn. Matt Kellum of \\"The Doldrums\\" and \\"Blueface\\" replaced Adams, and the new lineup began recording with New Bohemian Wes Burt-Martin. However, Norris' side project, \\"Tommorowpeople\\", began to take up more of his time. The Tomorrowpeople were then signed to DGC Records and were often out in Los Angeles, working on their first major label effort. This created problems for Chomsky, who relied heavily on Norris' keyboard and guitar eccentricities in their recordings and live show. Because of this, Chomsky played infrequently in 1997 and early 1998. In April 1998 new drummer Matt Kellum befriended guitarist Glen Reynolds backstage at Fry Street Fair. Reynolds was there to hang out with his friend and former drummer Pete Young, who was playing with .357 Lover that day. Kellum was there with former Chomsky drummer Avsharian and, as the only non-drummer present, Reynolds stuck out to Kellum. The two became fast friends and Kellum invited Reynolds to practice with the band in the future. Kellum placed a follow-up call to Reynolds later the next week and the next day Reynolds, Driscoll, Kellum, and Halleck played together for the first time. This final Chomsky lineup would go on to play together for the next 10 years. At the band's first-ever practice, Halleck showed Reynolds a new song, \\"Road\\". Reynolds debuted with Chomsky a week after that first practice, playing a show at Dan's Bar on the eve of Kellum's University of North Texas graduation. Within three months, both Reynolds and Kellum moved from Denton to Dallas to work and take Chomsky more seriously. Chomsky released its second full-length record in the summer of 1999. The record, A Few Possible Selections for the Soundtrack of Your Life, went on to win the band several Dallas Observer and Fort Worth Music awards in 2000. ==Touring== Chomsky spent its early years from 1994-1999 playing strictly in Denton and Dallas. The group branched out further, hitting places like Austin, Houston, Lubbock, and Fort Worth on a consistent basis. By 2001 Chomsky was playing shows around Texas often with Dallas label mates the Deathray Davies and DARYL. Chomsky also went on several \\"jaunts\\", or short national tours. The first of these was a late 2001 tour with Pennsylvania's The Juliana Theory. This tour spanned the states directly east of the Mississippi and included three Texas dates. 2002 was spent primarily doing short weekend tours of Texas with Idol records label mates DARYL and DRD. Also in 2002 was a summer tour of the midwest with saw Chomsky playing the Great Lakes area states. In 2003, Chomsky went on a tour of the Midwest and West Coasts twice as well as several shows in and around Texas, playing new cities in Texas such as San Marcos, Odessa, Wichita Falls, and Spring. On a 2004 West Coast tour Chomsky made an appearance on CBS' The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, during which the band played \\"Fine\\" from Let's Get To Second. ==Labels== Chomsky signed its first record deal with Dallas' Idol Records in 2000. Idol released the two most well-known Chomsky albums, A Few Possible Selections for the Soundtrack of Your Life and Onward Quirky Soldiers. In 2003, Chomsky signed with uber-fledgling label Aezra Records of Phoenix, Arizona. The band recorded 2004's \\"Let's Get To Second\\" for that label. Chomsky has also released songs on several compilations, including Summer Break Records' \\"Sunny Teriyaki Hamburger Breakfast\\". Chomsky's 1996 first album and the 5 songs recorded by Wes Burt Martin in 1996-97 are out of print and were self-released. ==External links== * Category:Rock music groups from Texas ","title":"Chomsky (band)"},{"id":"19313585","text":"The Greater Somalia League (GSL) was a political party in Somalia that advocated for the establishment of a Greater Somalia. ==History== The GSL was led by Haaji Mahammad Husseen.

Its main feature is provocativeness and mockery while being formally polite. Historically, Kashchenist style uses many words and idioms of Jewish origin; in conversations, Kashchenists often pretend to be Jews, in order to troll antisemites while also causing others to make excuses to prove that they are not antisemites. Kashchenist style also typically uses medical terms, especially from psychiatry; this is because Kashchenists consider themselves jocularly as \\"network psychiatrists\\", and imitate either medical staff or, conversely, patients in a mental hospital. The word \\"Kashchenism\\" also denotes a philosophy of people who use Kashchenist style in electronic conversations. == Etymology == 100px The word Kashchenism comes from the name of the Kashchenko psychiatric hospital. The hospital was named after the prominent Russian psychiatrist Pyotr Kashchenko. Kashchenists consider Pyotr Petrovich to be their patron saint. == Origin == Kashchenism originated as a Fidonet echo conference SU.KASCHENKO.LOCAL (SKL) created by Vladimir \\"MedBrat\\"–ú–µ–¥–ë—Ä–∞—Ç in Russian. –ú–µ–¥–±—Ä–∞—Ç means \\"male nurse\\"; a tradition to have nicknames named after medical staff is very typical for early Kashchenists. Timofeev in 1998. In the first half of 2000-s, SKL (and Russian FidoNet in general) slowly became deserted, and in 2005 MedBrat led residual Kashchenists away from SKL to the Internet forum kaschenko.ru; SKL worked then for a while but now it is almost dead. == Ideology and philosophy == Kashchenists logo The basics of an ideology of Kashchenism are laid out in a text called \\"Kashchenesis\\".See here (Russian); the name of the text is a parody on \\"catechesis\\"‚Äî but not in the sense of study of a standard catechism, but instead as an allusion to an anti-Semitic Soviet book called –ê Catechesis of a Jew living in USSR (–ö–∞—Ç–µ—Ö–∏–∑–∏—Å –µ–≤—Ä–µ—è –≤ –°–°–°–†), dating from the 1950s. It is similar in content to the much earlier The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and in fact states that it is an abridged version of the Prococols. Also, there is a digest of the Kashchenist ideology formulated in three phrases, a kind of Kashchenists motto; the phrases are: * Rigorous observance of mutually exclusive points. * Brutal politrecal correctness. (This is a pun based on homophones: –ø–æ–ª-–ª–∏—Ç—Ä–∞ (polliÃÅtra), half a litre [of vodka], and –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∫–æ—Ä—Ä–µ–∫—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å (poliÃÅtkorreÃÅktnost\`), political correctness.) * Total schizophasia. The same in Russian (as it is written in an upper part of every page of kaschenko.ru): * –ù–µ—É–∫–æ—Å–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ —Å–æ–±–ª—é–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤–∑–∞–∏–º–æ–∏—Å–∫–ª—é—á–∞—é—â–∏—Ö –ø–∞—Ä–∞–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–æ–≤. * –ë—Ä—É—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –ø–æ–ª–ª–∏—Ç—Ä–∫–æ—Ä—Ä–µ–∫—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å. * –¢–æ—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è —à–∏–∑–æ—Ñ–∞–∑–∏—è. Since those slogans, written in Russian, contain eight words containing 99 letters in total, Kashchenists often abbreviate their motto as 8/99, and use this abbreviation as a greeting (which is in turn a mockery of the Nazi greeting 14/88). == Influence == The influence of Kashchenism upon the Russian Internet is quite significant, especially the influence of Kashchenist slang, which is now known and is sometimes used by a big part of Russophone Internet users, though they never were Kashchenists themselves. Also, Kashchenists, who appeared earlier than the well-known \\"padonki\\" subculture, contributed much to padonkaffsky jargon, and many of the early \\"padonki\\" were former Kashchenists.See, for example, an article on kashchenists and padonki by Pavel Protasov(Russian) ==References External links == * The Kaschenists main forum * International Kashchenism * Kaschepuzia: the encyclopedia of Kashchenism * SU.KASCHENKO.LOCAL on Google groups Category:FidoNet Category:Internet in Russia Category:Russian Internet slang ","title":"Kashchenism"},{"id":"19313618","text":"David John Bryant (27 October 1931 ‚Äì 27 August 2020) was a three-times World (outdoors) singles bowls champion (in 1966, 1980 and 1988), a three-times World indoors singles champion (in 1979, 1980 and 1981) and a four times Commonwealth Games singles gold medallist.

Hurricane Ike also had a long-term impact on the U.S. economy.Ike's effect on U.S. economy Making landfall over Galveston, at 2:10 a.m. CDT on September 13, 2008, Category 2 Hurricane Ike caused extensive damage in Texas, with sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h), a 22 ft (6.8 m) storm surge, and widespread coastal flooding. More than 140,000 residents in the Texas Gulf Coast danger zones in Ike's path had failed to evacuate, partly due to fears of multi-hour traffic jams as during Hurricane Rita, but over 940 were rescued from rising waters, and nearly 2,000 rescued afterward. As of December 27, 2008, 37 people are known to have lost their lives in Texas due to Ike while hundreds are still missing.Texas in 2008: Ike dominated news like no other Jeff Carlton - The Associated Press The storm had come ashore hours before daybreak with 110-mph (175 km/h) winds and towering waves, pushing boats ashore, smashing many houses, flooding thousands of homes, knocking out windows in Houston's skyscrapers, uprooting trees, and cutting electric power to millions of customers (estimates range from 2.8 million to 4.5 million customers) for weeks or months. Some people survived by punching holes in attics, climbing to rooftops or trees, using nearby boats, or floating on debris until reaching solid ground. Afterward, an estimated 100,000 homes had been flooded in Texas, and numerous boats washed ashore. Galveston was declared uninhabitable, and Houston imposed a week-long nighttime curfew due to limited electric power. ==Hurricane preparations== On September 8, Texas State Governor Rick Perry declared 88 Texas state counties a disaster area in preparation for Hurricane Ike, expected to hit the Texas coast as early as Saturday morning, which included placing 7,500 Texas Military Forces troops on standby. The Texas County of Brazoria called for voluntary evacuation and Matagorda County called for mandatory evacuation as did the County of Brazoria for zip code 77541 and the city of Lake Jackson. Galveston, parts of southern Houston and areas south of the city and near the Texas coast were under a mandatory evacuation order starting at noon September 11.Bloomberg News vans at the Texas Department of Public Safety in Austin for a news conference about Hurricane Ike. The state's emergency operation center is located in the DPS building. On September 10, U.S. President George W. Bush made an emergency declaration for Texas in advance of Hurricane Ike, making more federal help available for preparations and evacuations. State rural water associations activated mutual aid networks to prepare for the landfall of Hurricane Hanna and Hurricane Ike while still providing assistance to areas impacted by Hurricane Gustav. The Texas Rural Water Association held meetings with state agencies on Tuesday, September 9, to plan for landfall along the Texas gulf coast. On September 11, forecasting models began to show Ike making landfall just south of Galveston. City Manager Steve LeBlanc late Wednesday issued a mandatory evacuation order for the low lying west end of Galveston Island. Later, the mandatory evacuation order was extended to the entire island of Galveston, as well as low-lying areas around Houston, Texas.Galveston, part of Houston evacuated ahead of Ike Accessed 2008-09-11. Mandatory evacuations were not restricted to the Houston and Galveston areas only. Mandatory evacations were also ordered for Jefferson, Orange, and Chambers counties located east of Houston. Additionally, mandatory evacuations were ordered for residents with special needs and those registered with 211 in Jasper and Newton counties. Voluntary evacuations were in effect for Hardin and Tyler as well as the remainder of Newton and Jasper counties. Also on September 11, at 8:19 p.m. (CDT), the National Weather Service in Houston/Galveston, TX issued a strongly worded bulletin, regarding storm surge along the shoreline of Galveston Bay. The bulletin advised residents living in single-family homes in some parts of coastal Texas may face \\"certain death\\" if they do not heed orders to evacuate. Reports said as many as 40 percent of Galveston's citizens may have not paid attention to the warnings. It was feared to be much the same in Port Arthur. The prices of crude oil and gas increased in the expectation of damage to some of the numerous oil refineries along the South Texas coast, or at least delays in production from the oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. ==Surge measurements== Satellite image map of Hurricane Ike after landfall on the Texas Coast. Landfall had been predicted near Freeport, Texas, by the National Hurricane Center, as of Wednesday, September 10, 2008. However, the actual landfall was further east, over the east end of Galveston Island (near Texas City, TX), with the eye centered over Galveston Bay. Because some winds blew from the north at Galveston, water was pushed back out into the Gulf, and the actual storm surge there was muted to 19 ft (5.8 m), rather than the original prediction of over 25 ft (7.6 m) as with a west-end landfall, which would have pushed more water into Galveston Bay, being a channel bay. As of September 13, 2008, the highest storm surge had been noted at Sabine Pass at 22 ft (6.5 m), the highest surge ever recorded at that station, and Ike also brought on the record for greatest storm surge ever seen with any Category 2 hurricane. However, Bolivar Peninsula, at the entrance to Galveston Bay, was nearer to the eastern side of the eye. The morning high tide (on 2008-09-13), adding 2.3 ft (0.7 m), occurred at 4:14am CDT at the Galveston Bay entrance. The total eastern storm tide was then nearly 16 ft (4.9 m) by landfall at 2:10am, with higher waves on top. ==Aftermath== On the night of September 13, 2008, the eye of Hurricane Ike approached the Texas coast near Galveston Bay, making landfall at 2:10 a.m. CDT over the east end of Galveston Island(near Texas City). People in low-lying areas who had not heeded evacuation orders, in single-family one- or two-story homes, had been warned by the weather service that they \\"faced certain death\\" in the overnight storm surge. In regional Texas towns, electrical power began failing before 8p.m. CDT, leaving more than 3 million people without power. In addition, grocery store shelves in the Houston area were left empty. Rainfall estimates indicated that 2-day rainfall totals from mid-day Friday through mid-day Saturday exceeded 20 inches (50 cm) in parts of both northern Harris County and southern Montgomery County, with a multi-county area receiving at least 10 inches (25 cm) of rainfall. ===Bolivar Peninsula and southern Chambers County=== left Bolivar Point - September 13, 2008 left Total destruction of the Bolivar Peninsula Ruins of the Bolivar Bolivar Peninsula got the strong side of the storm. Bolivar Peninsula, just east across the water from the landfall site on Galveston Island, had been submerged under the storm tide. Water from the storm surge was over the first floor of many houses. Most, if not all of the communities previously located on the Bolivar Peninsula, which together with Galveston Island separates Galveston Bay from the Gulf of Mexico, were utterly devastated. Based on an extensive aerial survey conducted on the afternoons of Saturday, September 13 and Sunday, September 14, very little remains west of the community of High Island. The area of total or near-total destruction includes Caplen, Port Bolivar, and the area surrounding Gregory Park. Most, if not all of the structures that had been situated along the length of Highway 87 west of High Point, as well as Highway 108 on the western edge of Bolivar, were destroyed. Crystal Beach, a populous community located roughly at the midpoint of the peninsula, was submerged and destroyed; waves and wind pounded houses, and even some houses elevated on 14-ft (4.3-m) stilts rolled into the waters. The tiny beachfront community of Gilchrist, which sat astride the north-facing Rollover Bay on Bolivar, was completely swept away, save for only a few homes. One of these homes, the only one in its neighborhood to remain intact (although it was rendered uninhabitable), attracted widespread media interest after images of it began to appear in newspapers and on television. At least six bodies were found in an extensive search. Two flood water sensors in Chambers County, Texas survived Ike's storm surge, while those on eastern Bolivar Peninsula were left inoperable during the hurricane. Along the Eastern shores of Galveston Bay surge heights were measured at 16.9 feet (5.15 m) and a measurement along SH126 measured 17.0 feet (5.18 m).Ike's Storm Surge Revealed Houston Weather Blog - ABC13 News (KTRH houston) - ABC13.Com - October 26th, 2008Hurricane Ike Storm Surge Chambers County Houston Weather Blog - ABC13 News (KTRH houston) - ABC13.Com - October 26th, 2008 Massive amounts of surge carried debris, largely from Bolivar Peninsula and southern Chambers County were left along the northern coast of Rollover bay Chambers county. There is controversy whether houses near the beach are allowed to be rebuilt if they are destroyed by such storms. ===Galveston=== In Galveston, by 4 p.m. CDT (2100 UTC) on September 12, the rising storm surge began overtopping the 17-ft (5.2 m) Galveston Seawall, which faces the Gulf of Mexico; waves had been crashing along the seawall earlier, from 9a.m. CDT. Although Seawall Boulevard is elevated above the shoreline, many areas of town slope down behind the seawall to the lower elevation of Galveston Island. The historic Balinese Room, a former mafia-run nightclub on a pier that had extended 600 feet into the Gulf of Mexico and had withstood many serious storms, was swept away as Ike's eye crossed over the eastern half of Galveston Island. The elevated structure, a pier, which had hosted performers ranging from Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope and George Burns to Groucho Marx and Sammy Davis, Jr., had recently been renovated and returned to profitability after years of neglect and disrepair, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. None of the many wooden piers that gave Galveston much of its unique character survived the landfall of Hurricane Ike. In addition to the Balinese Room, Murdoch's, Hooters and the 61st Street Pier were all completely destroyed. Murdoch's Pier was rebuilt and reopened in October 2009, while Hooters Galveston (housed in the former Ocean Grill building) was not rebuilt; the site remains vacant as of 2011. (A new Hooters was reopened in November 2017 off 61st Street south of Interstate 45.) The 61st Street Pier was rebuilt and reopened in 2010. Seawall Boulevard, which runs the entire length of the seawall several meters above the popular beaches adjoining the Gulf, was littered with the debris of these and other structures. Sign showing the highest water level of Hurricane Ike in Galveston The landmark Flagship Hotel, which sat on deep concrete pylons, was seriously damaged, but no one was injured, and while an early survey indicated the structure would be salvageable; however that proved to be untrue, and the hotel was demolished in 2011. Some of the hotel's siding was peeled off by the storm (this occurred during Hurricane Alicia in 1983), venting at least one top-floor guest suite to the open air, and the elevated ramp permitting vehicles to access the hotel's lower level from Seawall Boulevard fell into the Gulf. The seemingly protected back side of the island also suffered heavy damage to tourist areas. The Lone Star Flight Museum suffered massive damage as the storm surge washed over the airport and though all the aircraft hangars (not just the museums) with about 8 feet of water. All the airplanes, except those that flew out before the storm, were damaged from moderate to severe, but the worst was the complete destruction of the \\"Aviation Hall of Fame\\" with numerous personal items of aviation's greatest pioneers. Conversely, Moody Gardens was built with hurricane storms in mind with strong pyramid shaped structures very high above sea level, so it was able to withstand the worst of the storm and return to operation quickly. The Galveston Island Trolley infrastructure was heavily damaged and operations were not restarted after the hurricane, and later suspended indefinitely. FEMA agreed to provide $200 million for repairs in the city. the line has yet to reopen. The Galveston Railroad Museum suffered damage throughout its museum and exhibit grounds. Several railcars and locomotives are damaged by the hurricane's winds and flooding# 2 historical EMD F7 locomotives are scrapped after severely affected.http://galvestondailynews#com/story/241454 The museum's model railroad layout was also destroyed. Even though there were advance evacuation plans, Mary Jo Naschke, spokesperson for the city of Galveston, estimated that (as of Friday morning) a quarter of the city's residents disregarded calls for them to evacuate, despite predictions that most of Galveston Island would suffer heavy flooding storm tide. By 6p.m. Friday night, estimates varied as to how many of the 58,000 residents remained, but the figures of remaining residents were in the thousands. Galveston Island, viewed during a search and rescue mission Some people survived by punching holes in attics and carried sick relatives away from the flood. On the 91st Street Pier, formerly a two- story structure resembling a house that extended some 400 feet (120 m) into the Gulf, three persons opted to ride the storm out, despite a National Weather Service warning direly predicting that they faced \\"certain death\\" from what was expected to be up to a 24-foot storm surge. Calling local emergency operators three hours ahead of Ike's landfall, they requested evacuation by Coast Guard personnel, as the entire length of the pier and the structure's first story had by that time fallen into the Gulf. They were informed that no one could rescue them at that time, due to the unacceptable risks their prospective rescuers would be subjected to. Weathering the storm huddled inside what remained of the pier's second floor, they were lifted to safety by a rescue helicopter late the following morning. An early survey of Galveston Island, performed late Saturday, September 13 and Sunday, September 14, 2008, indicated that the entirety of the Island west of 11 Mile Road was entirely devastated, and that few structures on Galveston's western one-third had survived. This area of near-total destruction includes the communities of Bayou Vista and Jamaica Beach, as well as the Galveston Country Club and the Galveston Island State Park. The affected area previously included some 1,000 structures, including single-family dwellings, commercial enterprises, and hotels and resorts. It is unknown how many residents may have ignored repeated calls to evacuate, or what became of those who decided to remain in Galveston's vulnerable West End. Electric power failed in Galveston around 7:45 p.m. CDT. Widespread flooding included downtown Galveston: such as 6-ft (2 m) deep inside the Galveston County Courthouse, and the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston was flooded. Five people have died on Galveston Island - two of them drowned and three of them were due to natural causes. In transferring survivors out of town, Galveston officials used Ball High School, which was used as a \\"shelter of last resort\\" for evacuees, to be a center for FEMA. More than 200 residents stayed at the school shelter, and hundreds more ate meals there. Buses were brought in on Sunday to take residents from that shelter, and others who wanted to leave the island, to a shelter in San Antonio. On the day of landfall, police were stopping travelers at La Marque, 4 miles (6 km) north of Galveston, and making them exit the highway. Interstate 45 at La Marque had been closed because boats and parts of wrecked piers were strewn throughout floodwaters blocking the road. Chris Terrill filmed the impact of Ike on Galveston, in the second part of his three-part series Nature's Fury. The film captured the evacuation, storm surge and waves overtopping the sea wall preceding the hurricane's arrival; before and after footage of the historic Balinese Room nightclub that was destroyed in the storm; scenes on the street during 100 mph winds and lashing rain; and the devastation afterwards. From a historical perspective, on September 8, 1900, the Great Galveston Hurricane came ashore on a path similar to Ike,For details and sources, see: Galveston Hurricane of 1900. bringing with it a storm surge that inundated most of Galveston Island: as a result, much of the city was destroyed and at least 6,000 people were killed in a few hours; afterward, the level of the island was raised an average of 4 ft (1.3 m), adding a high seawall (17-ft, 5.2 m) to block incoming waves. ===Houston=== JPMorgan Chase Tower. In Houston, windows broke in downtown buildings such as the 75-story JPMorgan Chase Tower, and Reliant Stadium was damaged. according to a witness interviewed by Fox News, furniture from offices in the JPMorgan Chase building was blown out of the shattered windows and into the parking garage across the street. A fire partially burned Brennan's restaurant in downtown Houston, but workers were rescued. Many trees were uprooted, and bus stop shelters were mangled. The Houston Theater District was flooded. Although electric power was out in most of the region, the lights remained on at the Texas Medical Center, a complex of about a dozen hospitals. At Memorial Hermann Hospital, patients were coming in with a variety of problems, including people who had run out of medicine or oxygen, or others who had cuts and bruises. Based on information compiled by the US Center for Disease Control, twenty-eight deaths in Harris County are attributed to the indirect effects of Ike, including illnesses, and accidents, such as carbon monoxide poisoning, fires, and tree cutting. Hurricane Ike affected Houston Astros' late dash for Major League Baseball's playoffs, indefinitely postponing Friday and Saturday's games against the Chicago Cubs. Flights in and out of Houston's two major airports (Bush Intercontinental and Hobby) were suspended on Friday September 12, 2008, with plans to resume on the following Sunday. However, as of Sunday September 14, 2008, Intercontinental remained without power, but both airports planned to re-open Monday with limited service. Due to large number of destroyed, damaged, or dysfunctional traffic lights, most Houston roads remained clogged two weeks after Ike hit. Many highway exits were jammed and caused a gridlock on highways as well, especially during rush hours. Many gas stations were out of service for a week because of no electricity to pump the gas. The few that functioned resulted in long lines and only once a week gasoline deliveries. This \\"hit and miss\\" to find gasoline led to the buying out of gasoline once it was delivered. Similarly there were long lines in most of the few open grocery stores, home repair stores, and restaurants. ===Texas City=== A Valero Energy Corp. spokesman, Bill Day, said that crews would soon get in to inspect the oil refineries in Houston and Texas City, which remained shut down on Saturday, 13 September 2008. Texas City (north of Galveston) was very near to the landfall site of Hurricane Ike. The Mainland Medical Center (off I-45) closed its doors on Saturday (13Sep08) at 4p.m. CDT, after water service was unavailable in the area. One death has been reported in Texas City, which was caused by a lack of dialysis treatment due to the storm's aftermath. The beloved Texas City Dike, a manmade structure extending nearly five miles into the mouth of Galveston Bay, was overtopped and seriously damaged along with all structures built upon it.USA Today Video The dike, known to locals as \\"the world's longest manmade fishing pier,\\" had stood for seven decades and was considered Texas City's primary defense against the devastation wrought by a powerful storm surge. An aerial survey late afternoon Sunday, September 14, revealed that the eastern and northern portions of Texas City, as well as San Leon were still substantially flooded. Substantial wind damage appeared to have been sustained by the Texas City Industrial Complex that borders Galveston Bay. A few businesses, including some gasoline stations, convenience stores and fast food restaurants, were planning to re-open as early as Monday, September 15, 2008. Beginning Sunday, September 14, the Texas Military Forces began using the city's high school football stadium as a staging and relocation area used by Black Hawk helicopters, which were used to retrieve stranded citizens from Bolivar, Galveston and other area communities. Also on September 14, the Red Cross opened a disaster relief center in Texas City. ===League City=== In League City, TX, the electric power went out, and CenterPoint Energy said it could take four weeks or more to restore power after the largest outage in the company's history. Residents who evacuated were allowed to return on September 16, 2008 and advised to bring back enough food for two weeks; a dusk-until-dawn curfew was in effect. Two deaths have been reported in League City, both due to natural causes indirectly caused by Ike. ===Kemah, Seabrook, Taylor Lake Village and El Lago=== House in Kemah, TX, that was struck by Hurricane Ike in 2008.Kemah, Texas, about 35 miles (56 km) south of Houston, was without power and water, and still had 5 feet of flooding on Saturday, September 13, 2008. State Highway 146 was closed at the 2094 intersection. There was a lot of debris on the roads, completely covering some lanes. Severe damage occurred at the Kemah Boardwalk, the site of many popular restaurants and shops, as well as a small waterfront amusement park with various rides, including a carousel, kiddie train and Ferris wheel overlooking Galveston Bay. The entire first floor of Landry's seafood restaurant was demolished and swept away, as well as those of neighboring structures. The Boardwalk had received 4 million visitors per year. In an interview on local CBS affiliate KHOU-TV, the Boardwalk manager expressed confidence that despite such unprecedented devastation to the tourist attraction, the site would be rebuilt. In Seabrook, most homes and businesses east of State Highway 146 (close to Galveston Bay) were flooded by storm surge, which included the Miramar subdivision and \\"Old Seabrook\\". Homes along Todville Rd (which parallels Galveston Bay) were washed away, or had their entire bottom floors gutted. State Highway 146 just north of the Kemah Bridge was completely inundated, causing boats and other debris to collect on the highway after the waters subsided. The Seabrook Waterfront district sustained substantial damage. The surge caused boats to float onto or very close to Nasa Road 1.. also destroyed boat docks and businesses along Nasa Road 1 all the way to the Nassau Bay Hilton hotel. ===Clear Lake and Nassau Bay=== Near Clear Lake, where winds reportedly gusted over 100 mph, many people rode out the storm at the Nassau Bay Hilton, across from the NASA/JSC complex. The roof of the Mission Control Center of NASA's Johnson Space Center was damaged by Hurricane Ike, but there were no injuries and no major flooding. Along with the roof damage, there were branches and light poles on the ground, with minor damage to buildings and vehicles. There was also damage to hangars and awnings at NASA's Ellington Field, east of I-45. NASA has its own generators to provide electric power. ===Baytown=== Baytown,on the upper portion of Galveston Bay, was affected by the storm surge from Hurricane Ike. Homes in the Lakewood subdivision on the western side of Baytown on the bay sustained major flood damage. Many homes were eventually demolished because they were beyond repair. The Bayland Marina on the Waterfront District near Hwy 146 sustained major damage. All boats docked there were lost. Most of the boats were found along Hwy 146 or in the nearby subdivision. Hurricane Ike also caused the temporary shutting down of the Baytown ExxonMobil refinery. ===Jefferson County=== Recovery crews gather at an HEB Store while refineries in background flare due to shutdown in Port Arthur, TX. Gas station canopy damage near Nederland, TX. Like most of East Texas, the Beaumont and Port Arthur areas received winds at hurricane force. Ike's storm surge threatened the Port Arthur levees, and penetrated far enough inland to contaminate the water supply for Beaumont with salt water. Hardest hit were rural areas of Jefferson County, including the unincorporated communities of LaBelle and Fannett. As of September 18, 4000 head of cattle were estimated dead, drowned by floods in the county, both from rain, and storm surge. One fatality has been reported in extreme Southeast Texas related to Ike. It was as a result of a generator fire when power was out. Despite official assurances that this was the only Ike-related death in the area, rumors spread that large numbers of people died during the storm. This was fueled by the presence of refrigerated trailers outside a Beaumont funeral home. The funeral home had lost electrical service and was using the trailers to store bodies of people who died of natural causes until burials could be arranged. ===Orange County=== Damage was widespread and severe across Orange County. Storm surge almost completely flooded Bridge City, breached the levee at the City of Orange, and travelled up the Neches River to flood Rose City The City of Orange received winds at hurricane force. Mayor Brown Claybar estimated about a third of the city of 19,000 people was flooded, anywhere from 6 inches (15 cm) to 6 feet (2 m). He said about 375 people, of those who stayed behind during the storm, began to emerge, some needing food, water and medical care. Many dead fish littered streets and properties.\\"Ike: A fish story .\\" CNN. Bridge City Mayor Kirk Roccaforte estimated that only 14 homes (Amended later to some 34), in the city were unaffected by the surge. 10 of which were in the Oakview addition,. 5 on Louise Street, and 5 on Lafitte Street. One resident on Louise Street who stayed made a video of the cresting serge. These homes were well above the 100 year storm surge flood plain. The piles of debris and waterlogged furniture placed outside homes by residents beginning to clean up led the mayor to say \\"The whole city looks like a flea market. During the post-storm cleanup, Bridge City residents found swimming pools had been occupied by jellyfish brought inland with the water. Three people were found dead in Orange County on September 29. ===Other towns=== Flood waters begin to rise in a neighborhood of Bayou Vista, Texas. One death was confirmed to have been Ike- related as a tree fell onto a boy in Montgomery County while being cut in preparation for the storm, and another person was killed not far away from a fallen tree during the storm. After the storm, another tree-cutting accident involving a damaged tree killed another young boy in Montgomery County, and a cleanup accident involving a truck resulted in a fourth death in the county. Another fallen tree in Huntsville resulted in a fatality after it crashed into a house. In Anahuac, one person was electrocuted in the preparations, and one person was killed by a house fire while without power in Walker County. One person in San Leon drowned. Corpus Christi, Texas received winds at tropical- storm force. Near Corpus Christi, a man was reportedly swept away with the Coast Guard searching for his body after the storm had passed. ===Electrical outages=== CenterPoint Energy, the largest power company in the region, said that it had restored power to 112,000 homes and business on Saturday, plus many of Houston's skyscrapers had regained power. The progress was as follows: * by Saturday evening, 112,000 customers had power; * by Sunday noon, 262,000 customers had power; * by Tuesday 9p.m., 750,000 customers had power. However, over 1.5 million people remained without power as of September 16, 2008. Entergy Texas, whose service area includes Beaumont-Port Arthur west to cities north of Houston such as The Woodlands and Conroe, estimated that 392,600 of their 395,000 customers lost power during Ike. Although nearly all their customers lost power, the company reported restoration of electrical service to all customers who could safely receive power on September 25, twelve days after the storm. The majority of Entergy customers unable to receive power were located in High Island and on the Bolivar Peninsula. ===Offshore ships and oil rigs=== On Saturday, September 13, 2008, the US Coast Guard sent the tugboat Rotterdam to rescue the crew of a disabled freighter, Antalina, carrying 22 people, hours after the ship had survived Hurricane Ike, without any means of escaping. Repairs to the ship's broken fuel pump will be made at sea; the tugboat will then tow the ship to Port Arthur, Texas, to be anchored for additional repairs and eventually to offload more of its cargo: petroleum coke, a petroleum byproduct. Two oil rigs were adrift in the Gulf of Mexico, but crews had prepared to secure both rigs as soon as the water conditions settled. As of September 19, a revised total of 49 oil and gas platforms, of the 3,800 in the Gulf, were considered destroyed (compared with 44 destroyed during Hurricane Katrina). BP reported that the drilling derrick (tower) on its Mad Dog platform had been toppled into the sea, adding that it was too early to predict when the platform could resume production. ===Oil refineries=== There were 14 oil refineries in the affected region, and 8 were known to have survived with little flooding. ===Emergency shelters=== Several communities accepted thousands of evacuees, or later refugees, from the impact areas, including: * In Galveston, Ball High School held 200 evacuees (as a \\"shelter of last resort\\"), plus providing meals to hundreds more. * In San Antonio, about 219 miles (352 km) from Galveston, shelters held nearly 5,000 evacuees. * In Tyler, about 200 miles (320 km) inland, 3,400 evacuees took temporary refuge, and it became clear that some shelters would not suffice for long-term evacuation. * More than 4,000 people rode out the storm in tents, campers and RVs, according to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. There were other shelters as well. ==Recovery== Response teams from the Texas Rural Water Association moved from their staging area in Mauriceville, Texas the day after landfall. They distributed emergency generators to impacted systems, some as early as eight hours after the loss of water service. ==Economic Impact== Source: Property damage in Texas from the storm was estimated to be $29 billion. The storm also had a large lingering negative economic impact to the state long after the storm with estimates totaling $142 billion according to a Hurricane Ike Impact Report by the Texas Engineering Extension Service Below is a summary of the estimated economic by county according to the report. Each surveyed county experienced decreases in economic performance during the study period with the exception of Liberty County which experienced a growth. * Brazoria County - $1.8 billion ($528.5 million in manufacturing sector). * Chambers County - $20 billion ($12.1 billion in utilities sector). * Galveston County - $22.16 billion ($19.5 billion in manufacturing sector). * Harris County - $103.8 billion ($38.8 billion in wholesale sector). * Jefferson County - $11.9 billion ($9.1 billion in manufacturing sector). * Liberty County - Only county where economy grew following Ike - Growth during study period was $169.8 million. The county's economic growth was burdened with $277 million in losses in the manufacturing sector. * Orange County - $364.9 million ($116 million in retail). * Tyler County - $79.9 million ($50.4 million in real estate). ==See also== * Hurricane Ike - main storm article for Ike * Effects of Hurricane Ike in inland North America * 1900 Galveston Hurricane - the catastrophic Category 4 hurricane for which the city of Galveston is famous * Hurricane Gustav - another 2008 Category 4 storm that existed prior to Hurricane Ike * 2008 Atlantic hurricane season ==NotesReferences== * ==External links== * National Hurricane Center: NHC homepage. * Houston Chronicle electric progress: Ike Power Map. * Harris County Housing Authority DHAP programs: Beyond Boxes.

It was proposed in 1967 as an explanation for the maintenance of Rh negative blood groups. Reproductive compensation refers to the tendency of parents, seeking a given family size, to replace offspring that are lost to genetic disorders. It may also refer to the effects of increased maternal or parental investment in caring for disadvantaged offspring, seeking to compensate for genetic disadvantage. It is a theory that suggests that behavioral as well as physiological factors may play a role in the level of recessive genetic disorders in a population. According to Andrew Overall of the University of Edinburgh, ‚ÄúReproductive compensation may be particularly significant where economic or social factors mean that families are small compared to the maximum reproductive rate. Within small families, diseased infants may be more likely to be replaced. As a consequence, parents with otherwise reduced fertility have a greater influence on the frequency of recessive alleles in future generations.‚Äù Ian Hastings has argued that reproductive technologies such as embryo sex selection, preimplantation genetic diagnosis with in vitro fertilization, and selective termination of pregnancy may increase the frequency of genetic disorders through reproductive compensation. More recently the reproductive compensation hypothesis has been generalized to include, not only recessive genetic disorders, but in a more general sense, the effects of parental compensation when mate selection or breeding take place under constraints. According to Patricia Adair Gowaty, ‚ÄúThe reproductive compensation hypothesis says that individuals constrained by ecological or social forces to reproduce with partners they do not prefer compensate for likely offspring viability deficits.‚Äù In human societies, such constraints include the manipulation of female mating options, forced copulation, arranged marriages, assortative mating, and the trading of copulation for access to resources. Whereas heterozygote advantage can explain the persistence of high carrier rates of lethal alleles in certain regions (e.g. sickle-cell disease in Central and West Africa), Johan Koeslag and Stephen Schach have suggested that reproductive compensation might explain why different communities have high carrier rates for differing lethal alleles, despite living in similar or sometimes the same environment. Examples are Tay‚ÄìSachs disease amongst Ashkenazi Jews, cystic fibrosis amongst people of West European origin, and phenylketonuria among persons from Ireland. ==References== Category:Autosomal recessive disorders ","title":"Reproductive compensation"},{"id":"19313637","text":"H37 may refer to : * H-37 (Michigan county highway) * HMS Garland (H37), a 1935 British Royal Navy G-class destroyer * HMS H37, a British Royal Navy ship name * London Buses route H37, a Transport for London contracted bus route and also : * Arabic language Chinese Library Classification code * Armagh vice- county code * an alternate name for RBM5 human gene ","title":"H37"},{"id":"19313648","text":"The Cebu hanging parrot (Loriculus philippensis chrysonotus) is a subspecies of the Philippine hanging parrot found only on the island of Cebu, Philippines.

Partnered with her brother Alex Shibutani, she is the 2018 Olympic bronze medalist, a three-time World medalist (silver in 2016, bronze in 2011 and 2017), the 2016 Four Continents champion, and a two-time U.S. national champion (2016, 2017). The siblings have won six titles on the Grand Prix series and stood on the podium at 14 consecutive U.S. Championships, at five levels including eight as seniors. They are two-time members of the US Olympic team, competing at the 2014 and 2018 Winter Olympics. In 2018, the siblings became the first ice dancers who are both of Asian descent to medal at the Olympics (winning bronze in both team figure skating and the individual ice dancing event). They are the second sibling duo to ever share an ice dancing Olympic medal, and the first from the United States. The Shibutani siblings are often referred to by their nickname the Shib Sibs. ==Personal life== Maia Harumi Shibutani was born on July 20, 1994, in New York City. She is the daughter of Chris Shibutani and Naomi Uyemura, both of Japanese descent, who met as Harvard musicians. She has an older brother, Alex Shibutani, who competes with her as her partner in the discipline of Ice Dance. She started figure skating at the age of 4 in 1998 in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, where she was a student at Greenwich Academy in Greenwich, Connecticut. Maia lived in Colorado Springs from 2005 through 2007 and was home-schooled. She moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan in 2007 and graduated from Huron High School in Ann Arbor in 2012. She enrolled at the University of Michigan in the fall of 2012. In 2019, Shibutani was diagnosed with a malignant mass on her kidney. She began immediate treatment. ==CareerEarly career=== Maia Shibutani began skating at age four. She originally trained as a single skater and was taught by Slavka Kohout Button, a coach best known for guiding US ladies' champion Janet Lynn. A key source of inspiration for Maia and her brother Alex to pursue ice dancing came in March 2003 when their family attended the World Championships in Washington D.C. Alex Shibutani recalled, \\"We were seated close to the ice in the second row, and when the ice dancers came out for their warm up, we could actually feel a gust of wind as the skaters flew by. We were so impressed with the artistry, skating quality, and speed of the top teams that we decided to give it a try.\\" ===2004‚Äì2005 season=== Maia and Alex Shibutani first teamed up as ice dance partners in the spring of 2004. Their singles coach, Kathy Bird, arranged for them to work with their first ice dancing coaches Andy Stroukoff and Susie Kelley. The Shibutanis also worked with Mary Marchiselli, and their first free dance program was choreographed by Josh Babb. During the 2004‚Äì2005 season, their first season of competition, they competed on the juvenile level, which is the lowest competitive level in the U.S. Figure Skating testing structure. They competed at the 2005 North Atlantic Regional Championships, the qualifying competition for the U.S. Junior Championships, and won the competition. The win qualified them for the 2005 U.S. Junior Championships. At that competition, they placed second in the first compulsory dance, fourth in the second compulsory dance, and third in the free dance, ending up with the silver medal. ===2005‚Äì2006 season=== The Shibutanis moved up to the intermediate level and embarked on several visits to Colorado Springs, Colorado, to work with choreographer Tom Dickson. During that season, they were also coached by Judy Blumberg on the east coast. After unexpectedly strong results in their first year competing at the intermediate level at the Lake Placid Ice Dance Competition (including first place in every compulsory and free dance segment of the competition that they entered at the Lake Placid Ice Dance Competition in the summer of 2005), the Shibutanis decided to relocate to Colorado Springs on a full-time basis in order to benefit from the strong training center environment of the Broadmoor Skating Club. In Colorado Springs, their primary coach was Patti Gottwein During that time, they also worked with Rich Griffin, Damon Allen, Eric Schulz, and Christopher Dean. The Shibutanis won the Southwestern Regional Championships, qualifying for the 2006 U.S Junior Championships. At the 2006 U.S. Junior Championships, they placed second in the first compulsory dance and then won the second compulsory and free dances to win the title overall. They worked as guest bloggers and aides for the media staff for U.S. Figure Skating at the 2006 U.S. Championships, and again at the 2006 Four Continents, which were held in Colorado Springs. ===2006‚Äì2007 season=== The Shibutanis moved up to the novice level, which is the first of the three levels that compete at the U.S. Championships. Strong results at the Lake Placid Ice Dance Championships, including first place in the Novice Free Dance event, earned them their first opportunity to compete internationally under the ISU Judging System. At the North American Challenge event in Burnaby, British Columbia, they were the highest placing Americans in the novice event, pulling up from fifth place after the compulsory to second overall. At the 2007 Midwestern Sectional Championships, their qualifying competition for the national championships, the Shibutanis placed second in the first compulsory dance and then won the second compulsory and the free dances to win the competition overall and qualify for the 2007 U.S. Championships. At US Nationals, the Shibutanis placed second in both compulsory dances, but with a win in the free dance were able to capture the novice gold medal. This was their second consecutive national title. Following the 2007 U.S. Championships, the Shibutanis relocated once again, moving to Michigan to be coached by Marina Zueva and Igor Shpilband at the Arctic Edge Arena in Canton, Michigan. An important factor in the decision to relocate their training based included the opportunity to live and train in an area which could provide access to both world class ice dance coaching, as well as excellent educational opportunities. Alex Shibutani, at the time of the coaching change, had two years left of high school and was considering his university options. ===2007‚Äì2008 season=== The Shibutanis perform a lift at the 2008‚Äì2009 Junior Grand Prix Final The Shibutanis moved up to the junior level nationally. However, in an unusual circumstance for junior level competitors, they were unable to compete internationally on the junior level because Maia was not yet old enough. At the 2008 Midwestern Sectionals, the Shibutanis placed fourth in the compulsory dance and then third in the original and free dances to win the bronze medal overall. This medal qualified them for the 2008 U.S. Championships. At Nationals, they placed 7th in the compulsory dance, 2nd in the original dance, and 4th in the free dance. They placed 4th overall, winning the pewter medal. This was their fourth consecutive year earning a medal and podium placement, competing at four different levels at the national championship level. ===2008‚Äì2009 season: Silver at World Junior Championships=== Alex & Maia Shibutani with coaches Igor Shpilband and Marina Zueva in 2008. Maia Shibutani became age-eligible to compete on the international junior circuit. The Shibutanis made their junior international debut on the ISU Junior Grand Prix (JGP). At their first event, the 2008‚Äì09 ISU Junior Grand Prix event in Courchevel, France, they placed second in the compulsory dance and then won the original and free dances to win the gold medal overall by a margin of victory of 11.00 points. At their second Junior Grand Prix event in Madrid, Spain, they won the silver medal. These two medals qualified them for the 2008‚Äì2009 ISU Junior Grand Prix Final for which they were the third-ranked qualifiers. The Junior Grand Prix Final was held concurrently with the senior final for the first time and so did not have a compulsory dance segment. The Shibutanis placed 7th in the original dance and 3rd in the free dance, finishing in 4th place overall. The Shibutanis went on to the 2009 U.S. Championships, where they competed on the junior level for the second consecutive year. At the event, the Shibutanis placed second in the compulsory dance, the original dance, and the free dance. They won the silver medal overall marking their fifth consecutive podium finish at a national- level competition. Following the competition, the Shibutanis were named to the team to the 2009 World Junior Championships. At the 2009 Junior World Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria, the Shibutanis placed 5th in the compulsory dance, 4th in the original dance, and 2nd in the free dance. At the ages of 14 and 17, they won the silver medal. ===2009‚Äì2010 season=== For the 2009‚Äì2010 season, the Shibutanis continued to compete at the junior level, as Maia at just 15, remained age-ineligible to compete on the senior level internationally. On the Junior Grand Prix series, the Shibutanis won gold medals at both their JGP events - in Lake Placid, New York, and in Zagreb, Croatia. At the JGP Final in Tokyo, Japan, they won the bronze medal. At the 2010 US Nationals, competing for their third and final time at the junior level, they won the Junior ice dance title. At the 2010 Junior Worlds, their final junior event after having competed for only two seasons on the international circuit, they finished just off the podium in fourth place. ===2010‚Äì2011 season: World bronze medal=== 2011 Worlds At the ages of 16 and 19, the Shibutanis advanced to the senior level and experienced a historic rookie season. At their senior international debut, they finished fifth at the 2010 Nebelhorn Trophy, moving up from a disappointing eighth place in the short dance with a strong second place in the free dance, finishing ahead of several veteran senior competitors. During their debut season competing in the senior Grand Prix, they won the bronze medals at both the 2010 NHK Trophy (pulling up from 5th place after the short dance) and the 2010 Skate America (pulling up from fourth place after the short dance), making them the first ice dance team to medal at both Grand Prix events during their first season, rising from the junior and then competing on the senior level. They were first alternates for the 2010‚Äì11 Grand Prix final. The Shibutanis debuted domestically at the senior level with a second place at the 2011 U.S. Nationals behind Meryl Davis and Charlie White. At their first ISU Championship event as senior competitors, the 2011 Four Continents championships, they once again finished just behind Davis and White, earning a silver medal. Maia and Alex Shibutani became the first figure skaters of Asian descent in the history of the sport to medal in ice dance at an ISU championship event. At the 2011 World Championships, an event which had to be postponed and relocated from Tokyo to Moscow owing to the earthquake disaster in Japan, they were in fourth after the short dance, 4.09 points behind third- placed Nathalie P√©chalat and Fabian Bourzat. In the free dance, they scored 4.34 ahead of Pechalat and Bourzat, both of whom had fallen. The Shibutanis moved third place overall by 0.25 points and won a bronze medal in their World Championships debut. Their bronze medal finish remains the highest world championship debut of any US ice dance team in history. At the ages of 16 and 20, they were also the youngest world medalists in the discipline of ice dance in over 50 years. ===2011‚Äì2012 season=== Maia and Alex Shibutani at the 2012 World Figure Skating Championships The Shibutanis started their season with a silver medal at the 2011 Finlandia Trophy. Beginning their Grand Prix season, they won silver at the 2011 Cup of China. A week later they captured their first senior Grand Prix title, earning gold at the 2011 NHK Trophy, pulling up from third place after the short dance and edging Kaitlyn Weaver and Andrew Poje for gold by 0.09 points. It was the Shibutanis' first senior Grand Prix title, earned during just their second season competing at the senior level. Their combined results qualified them for the Grand Prix Final where they finished in fifth place. At the 2012 US National championships, the Shibutanis repeated as the silver medalists behind Davis and White. The Shibutanis finished 4th at the 2012 Four Continents, an event during which Alex competed in the free dance while extremely ill, and 8th at the 2012 World Championships. During the off-season, the Shibutanis were invited as athlete ambassadors by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to attend a dinner in honor of Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda on May 1, 2012, in Washington, D.C. When the coaching partnership of Igor Shpilband and Marina Zoueva came to an end in June 2012, the Shibutanis - along with Davis and White, and Virtue and Moir - chose to continue their training at the Arctic Edge Arena under the primary direction of Marina Zoueva. ===2012‚Äì2013 season=== The Shibutanis placed third in the short dance at the 2012 Rostelecom Cup. They paused their free dance for half a minute due to Alex pulling a muscle in his thigh. They were allowed to continue from the point of interruption and finished 4th overall, their first and thus far only time over 10 consecutive seasons and 20 Grand Prix events, that they did not finish on the podium at a junior or senior Grand Prix event. At their second Grand Prix event, the 2012 NHK Trophy they won the bronze medal. The Shibutanis also took bronze at the 2013 U.S. Championships. They then competed at the 2013 Four Continents and finished 4th. At the 2013 World Championships, the Shibutanis finished 8th. ===2013‚Äì2014 season=== The Shibutanis began their season with another injury which forced them to withdraw from the US Classic in September. They began their competitive season on the Grand Prix by capturing bronze medals at both of their events - 2013 Skate America and 2013 NHK Trophy - qualifying as alternates to the Grand Prix Final. At the 2014 U.S. Championships they earned the bronze medal and were named in the U.S. team to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. They placed 9th at the Olympics. The Shibutanis finished their season with strong performances and a 6th-place finish at 2014 World Championships. ===2014‚Äì2015 season=== The Shibutanis started their season by winning the 2014 Ondrej Nepela Trophy. Combined with their gold medal at the 2014 Ice Challenge they were the top finishers in the 2014-2015 ISU Challenge Cup series. On the Grand Prix circuit, they won the silver medals at both of their events, 2014 Skate America and the 2014 Cup of China. Their results on the Grand Prix series qualified them for the 2014‚Äì15 Grand Prix Final in Barcelona, Spain, where they placed 4th. At the 2015 U.S. Championships, the duo won the silver medal. They then went on to compete at the 2015 Four Continents Championships where they finished second in the short dance and third place overall. They completed their season with a fifth-place finish at the 2015 World Championships. ===2015‚Äì2016 season: Unprecedented Return to the World podium=== 2015 Grand Prix Final The Shibutanis began their season by winning bronze at 2015 Ondrej Nepela Trophy. On the Grand Prix circuit, both of their programs - a short dance to the music of Coppelia, and their free dance program to the music of Fix You by Coldplay - earned them standing ovations. They won silver at 2015 Skate Canada International and gold at the 2015 NHK Trophy, for their second career Grand Prix event title. They qualified for the 2015‚Äì16 Grand Prix Final as the fourth ranked team based on qualification criteria that had been modified in an attempt to account for the partially cancelled Trophee Bompard event. Their combined short dance and free dance score from NHK Trophy of 174.43 points was the highest total score amongst all competitors during the Grand Prix season. At the Grand Prix Final event, they placed 4th in the short dance. The night before the free dance, however, Alex became severely ill with food poisoning. They chose to compete nonetheless, and managed to earn yet another standing ovation for their free dance with a highly emotional performance. They finished 4th in the free dance and 4th overall. They had to withdraw from the exhibition so that Alex could recover. At the 2016 U.S. Championships, the Shibutanis placed second behind Madison Chock and Evan Bates during the short dance, but moved up to first place following the free dance to win their first senior US title.They earned standing ovations from the audience during both segments of the competition, as well as when their scores and results were announced. The Shibutanis next competed at the 2016 Four Continents Championships in Taipei, Taiwan. They set personal bests and finished first in both segments of the competition, capturing their first ISU Championship title. With this title, they became the first ice dancers of Asian descent to win an ISU ice dance championship event. The Shibutanis ended their season at the 2016 World Figure Skating Championships held in Boston MA. Skating before a hometown crowd (Alex was born in Boston) they set new personal best scores, finished second in both segments of the competition, and with a silver medal earned their second Worlds medal. Their return to the World podium after a 5-year gap, is unprecedented in the sport. ===2016‚Äì2017 season=== The Shibutanis began the 2016‚Äì17 season with a gold medal at the Skate America Grand Prix in Chicago. They followed that with another victory at the Cup of China Grand Prix event held in Beijing, once again qualifying for the Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final. At the Grand Prix Final event in Marseille, France, the Shibutanis were ranked second after the short dance, placing behind Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir from Canada, and ahead of reigning World champions, Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron. A third-place finishing the free dance portion of the competition placed them third place overall - the bronze medal being their first medal at a Grand Prix Final. At the 2017 U.S. Championships, the Shibutanis won their second consecutive national title, once again defeating Madison Chock and Evan Bates. Their short dance performance set a new U.S. scoring record. The siblings took silver at the 2017 Four Continents in Gangneung, South Korea, placing second in both segments of the competition to Canada's Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir. The Shibutanis delivered a performance of their \\"Evolution\\" free dance which earned them their ISU best free dance score in spite of Alex needing to quickly repair damage to his blade which occurred during the on-ice warm-up period, just moments before they competed. At the 2017 World Championships in Helsinki, Finland, they ranked fifth in the short dance and fourth in the free dance, ending up third overall. With their third world medal, a bronze, the Shibutanis notably demonstrated their ability as competitors to deliver under pressure situations. It was their placement that enabled the US team to qualify three entries in ice dance to compete at the 2018 Winter Olympics. The Shibutanis were the only members of the U.S. delegation to earn a medal at this pre-Olympic world championship. ===2017‚Äì2018 season: Olympic Bronze medals=== The Shibutanis made their season debut in October during the Grand Prix Series at the 2017 Rostelecom Cup. They scored 77.30 in the short dance and 111.94 in the free dance to place first in both events and won the gold medal over 7-time Russian national champions, Ekaterina Bobrova and Dimitri Soloviev, with 189.24 points. At their second Grand Prix event, 2017 Skate America, they again won both the short and free dance for a total of 194.25 and first place overall, qualifying for the 2017/18 Grand Prix Final in Nagoya, Japan. At the Grand Prix Final, they earned a second consecutive bronze medal. At the 2018 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, the Shibutanis placed first in the short dance and third in the free dance, placing them second overall behind Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue. At the 2018 Winter Olympics, the Shibutanis were chosen to represent the United States in the team event. They placed second in both segments, helping the U.S. team win the bronze medal. They became the first ice dancers who are both of Asian descent to medal at the Winter Olympics. In the ice dance event, they placed 4th in the short dance, 3rd in the free dance, and won the bronze medal with a combined total of 192.59 points. The Shibutanis chose to not compete at the 2018 World Championships. === 2018‚Äì2019 season === The Shibutanis did not compete in the 2018-2019 season. === 2019‚Äì2020 season === The Shibutanis are not competing in the 2019-2020 season. This is the second season the Shibutanis have not competed in since the 2017‚Äì2018 season. On December 16, 2019, Maia revealed that she had a successful surgery to remove a malignant tumor on her kidney. It was unsure at the time how the tumor would affect her ability to compete. She returned to the gym for the first time after her surgery on February 22, 2020, which happened to be the two-year anniversary of her second medal at the PyeongChang Winter Games. ==ProgramsPost-2018=== {   - !

The unique feature of a WFOE is that involvement of a mainland Chinese investor is not required, unlike most other investment vehicles (most notably, a sino-foreign joint venture). == Description == Basic elements of a WFOE (Click to enlarge) WFOEs may be limited-liability companies, as distinct from corporations, partnerships (limited or general), and proprietorships organized by foreign nationals and capitalized with foreign funds. WFOEs are mostly used by foreign companies to start a manufacturing operation in China. This can give greater control over the business venture in mainland China and avoid a multitude of problematic issues which can potentially result from dealing with a domestic joint venture partner. Such problems often include profit not being maximized, leakage of the foreign firm's intellectual property and the potential for joint venture partners to set up in competition against the foreign firm after siphoning off knowledge and expertise. WFOEs are often used to produce the foreign firm's product in mainland China for later export to a foreign country, sometimes through the use of Special Economic Zones which allow the importation of components duty-free into China, to then be added to Chinese-made components and the finished product then re-exported. An additional advantage with this model is the ability to claim back VAT on the Chinese manufactured component parts upon export. In addition, WFOEs now have the right to distribute their products in mainland China via both wholesale and retail channels. Another recent variant (the Foreign Invested Commercial Enterprise FICE) of the WFOE has also come into effect, and are used mainly for trading and buying and selling in China. The registered capital requirements for a FICE are lower than for a WFOE as the FICE does not need to fund plant and machinery acquisitions. . == Advantages == WFOEs are among the most popular corporate models for non-PRC investors due to their versatility and structural advantages of a representative office or joint venture. Such advantages include: * the ability to uphold a company's global strategy free from interference by Chinese partners (as may occur in the case of joint ventures); * a new, independent legal personality; * total management control within the limitations of the laws of the PRC; * the ability to both receive and remit RMB to the investor company overseas; * increased protection of trademarks, patents and other intellectual property, in accordance with international law; * exempt from having to obtain an import/export license for products manufactured; * shareholder liability is limited to original investment; * easier to terminate than an equity joint venture; * simpler establishment than a joint venture; * full control of human resources. A key feature of a WFOE is that it allows for any profits made in running the business to be repatriated without prior approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). Dividends cannot be distributed and repatriated overseas if the losses of previous years have not been covered while dividends not distributed in previous years may be distributed together with those of the current year. Repatriation of the registered capital is possible upon dissolution of the WFOE. For most WFOE types, paid-in capital is no longer a part of business registration. When the company is registered, no capital verification report is required either. == Disadvantages == The disadvantages of establishing a WFOE include the inability to engage in certain restricted business activities, limited access to government support and a potentially steep learning curve upon entering the mainland Chinese market. As a WFOE is a type of limited liability company, it requires the injection of foreign funds to make-up the registered capital; something unnecessary with a Representative Office. Normally 15% of the total investment needs to be injected within one month after obtaining the business license starting from 50,000 USD. It is important to note that regional differences in regulations and practical differences in the application of Chinese legislation can also apply. A WFOE comes with more legal rights than a Representative Office (RO). Consequently, its process of liquidation is more time consuming and expensive when compared to ROs. The liquidation is divided into four steps and might take up to 12 months (notification of the relevant authorities, setting up a liquidation committee, submission of a liquidation report to the authorities, deregistration of the company and closing of the bank account). ==Taxation== *Corporate tax: 15% to 25% (depending on the WFOE's location and industry). *Income tax: rates up to 35% of business profits. *Consumption tax:1% to 56% of sales revenue of goods.

The party contested the 1957 territorial assembly election, winning 61% of the vote and all 30 seats in the assembly. After the election Harbi became vice-president of the governing council of the territory. At the time, the party was allied to the African Democratic Rally.Laudouze, Andr√©.

After the referendum had been held (resulting in a defeat for the pro-independentists), pro-French leader Hassan Gouled called for fresh elections to the territorial assembly.

Partnered with his sister Maia Shibutani, he is a two-time Olympic bronze medalist (2018), a three-time World medalist (silver in 2016; bronze in 2011 and 2017), the 2016 Four Continents champion, and a two-time U.S. national champion (2016, 2017). The Shibutanis have also won six titles on the Grand Prix series and a silver medal at the 2009 World Junior Championships. They are two-time members of the US Olympic team, competing at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, and the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. In 2018, they became the first ice dancers who are both of Asian descent to medal at the Olympics (bronze in team figure skating and ice dancing). They are the second sibling duo to ever share an ice dancing Olympic medal, and the first from the United States. ==Personal life== Alex Hideo Shibutani was born on April 25, 1991, in Boston. He is the son of Chris and Naomi Shibutani, both of Japanese descent, who met as Harvard musicians. He has a younger sister, Maia Shibutani who competes with him as his partner for ice dancing. He attended the Brunswick School in Greenwich, Connecticut, during the late 1990s before relocating to Colorado Springs from 2005 through 2007 then Ann Arbor, Michigan in 2007. While in Colorado Springs, Alex Shibutani attended Cheyenne Mountain High School and finished his sophomore year there. He completed his junior and senior years of high school at Huron High School and entered the University of Michigan in the fall semester of 2009. ==CareerEarly career=== Alex Shibutani began skating at age seven. He originally trained as a single skater and competed up to the juvenile level in singles. In March 2003, he and his family attended the World Championships in Washington D.C. He said, \\"We were seated close to the ice in the second row, and when the ice dancers came out for their warm up, we could actually feel a gust of wind as the skaters flew by. We were so impressed with the artistry, skating quality, and speed of the top teams that we decided to give it a try.\\" ===2004‚Äì2005 season=== Maia and Alex Shibutani teamed up to compete in ice dancing in the spring of 2004. Their singles coach, Kathy Bird, arranged for them to work with their first dancing coaches Andy Stroukoff and Susie Kelley. The Shibutanis also worked with Mary Marchiselli. During their juvenile season, their programs were choreographed by Josh Babb. During the 2004‚Äì2005 season, their first season of competition, they competed on the juvenile level, which is the lowest competitive level in the U.S. Figure Skating testing structure. During that season, Alex Shibutani represented the Hickory Hill Figure Skating Club in competition. They competed at the 2005 North Atlantic Regional Championships, the qualifying competition for the U.S. Junior Championships, and won the competition. The win qualified them for the 2005 U.S. Junior Championships. At that competition, they placed second in the first compulsory dance, fourth in the second compulsory dance, and third in the free dance, ending up with the silver medal. ===2005‚Äì2006 season=== After moving up to the intermediate level and performing well at the non-qualifying competitions, the Shibutanis went to Colorado Springs, Colorado to work with choreographer Tom Dickson. During that off-season, they were being coached by Judy Blumberg on the east coast. After doing better than expected at the Lake Placid Ice Dance Competition in the summer of 2005, the Shibutanis decided to move coaching centers to a better training environment and so moved to train in Colorado Springs under head coach Patti Gottwein. During that time, they also worked with Rich Griffin, Damon Allen and Eric Schulz. Alex Shibutani changed his club representation to the Broadmoor Skating Club, where he and his sister trained. The Shibutanis won the Southwestern Regional Championships, their qualifying competition for the 2006 U.S Junior Championships. At the 2006 U.S. Junior Championships, they placed second in the first compulsory dance and then won the second compulsory and free dances to win the title overall. They worked as guest bloggers and aides for the media staff for U.S. Figure Skating at the 2006 U.S. Championships, and again at the 2006 Four Continents, which were held in Colorado Springs. ===2006‚Äì2007 season=== The Shibutanis moved up to the novice level, which is the first and lowest of three levels that compete at the U.S. Championships. At the 2007 Midwestern Sectional Championships, their qualifying competition for the national championships, the Shibutanis competed under the ISU Judging System for the first time. They placed second in the first compulsory dance and then won the second compulsory and the free dances to win the competition overall and qualify for the 2007 U.S. Championships. At Nationals, the Shibutanis placed second in both compulsory dances and then won the free dance to win the novice gold medal by a margin of victory of 2.06 points ahead of silver medalists Sara Bailey & Kyle Herring. This was their second consecutive national title. Following the 2007 U.S. Championships, the Shibutanis changed coaches to Igor Shpilband and Marina Zueva in Canton, Michigan. One factor in the decision to change coaches was the issue of university for Alex Shibutani, who at the time of the coaching change, had two years left of high school and was considering his university options. ===2007‚Äì2008 season=== The Shibutanis perform a lift at the 2008‚Äì2009 Junior Grand Prix Final The Shibutanis moved up to the junior level nationally. However, they were unable to compete internationally on the junior level because Maia was not yet old enough. At the 2008 Midwestern Sectionals, the Shibutanis placed fourth in the compulsory dance and then third in the original and free dances to win the bronze medal overall. This medal qualified them for the 2008 U.S. Championships. At Nationals, they placed 7th in the compulsory dance, 2nd in the original dance, and 4th in the free dance. They placed 4th overall, winning the pewter medal. ===2008‚Äì2009 season: Silver at World Junior Championships=== Alex & Maia Shibutani with coaches Igor Shpilband and Marina Zueva in 2008. Maia Shibutani became age-eligible to compete on the international junior circuit. The siblings made their junior international debut on the ISU Junior Grand Prix (JGP). At their first event, the 2008‚Äì09 ISU Junior Grand Prix event in Courchevel, France, they placed second in the compulsory dance and then won the original and free dances to win the gold medal overall by a margin of victory of 11.00 points over silver medalists Kharis Ralph and Asher Hill. They were then assigned to their second event, the event in Madrid, Spain. At this event, they placed second in all three segments of the competition and won the silver medal. These two medals qualified them for the 2008‚Äì2009 ISU Junior Grand Prix Final, for which they were the third-ranked qualifiers. Qualifying for the event had also qualified them for the 2009 U.S. Championships. The Junior Grand Prix Final was held concurrently with the senior final for the first time and so did not have a compulsory dance segment. The Shibutanis placed 7th in the original dance and 3rd in the free dance, finishing in 4th place overall. The Shibutanis went on to the 2009 U.S. Championships, where they competed on the junior level for the second consecutive year. At the event, the Shibutanis placed second in the compulsory dance, the original dance, and the free dance. They won the silver medal overall marking their fifth consecutive podium finish at a national-level competition. Following the competition, the Shibutanis were named to the team to the 2009 World Junior Championships. At Junior Worlds, the Shibutanis placed 5th in the compulsory dance, 4th in the original dance, and 2nd in the free dance. At the ages of 14 and 17, they won the silver medal. ===2009‚Äì2010 season=== The Shibutanis won both of their JGP events and won the bronze medal at the JGP Final. They again skated at the junior level at US Nationals, which they won. At 2010 Junior Worlds, they finished off the podium in fourth place. This was their final junior event. ===2010‚Äì2011 season: World bronze medal=== 2011 Worlds The Shibutanis moved to the senior level. They finished fifth at the 2010 Nebelhorn Trophy, moving up from eighth after the short dance with a strong free dance showing. They won the bronze medal at both the 2010 NHK Trophy and the 2010 Skate America, making them the first dance team to medal at both Grand Prix events in its first senior season. They were the first alternates for the Grand Prix final. The Shibutanis finished second at U.S. Nationals and were chosen to compete at the Four Continents and World Championships. They won the silver medal at Four Continents. At the World Championships, they were in fourth after the short dance, 4.09 points behind third-placed Nathalie P√©chalat / Fabian Bourzat. In the free dance, they scored 4.34 ahead of Pechalat and Bourzat, both of whom had fallen. The Shibutanis finished third overall by 0.25 points and won a bronze in their World Championships debut, a feat not even Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, the current Olympic Champions, had accomplished. ===2011‚Äì2012 season=== Maia and Alex Shibutani at the 2012 World Figure Skating Championships The Shibutanis started their season with a silver medal at the 2011 Finlandia Trophy. Beginning their Grand Prix season, they won silver at the 2011 Cup of China. A week later they placed first at the 2011 NHK Trophy, edging Kaitlyn Weaver and Andrew Poje for gold by 0.09 points. It was the Shibutanis' first senior Grand Prix title. Their combined results qualified them for the Grand Prix Final. The Shibutanis finished 4th at the 2012 Four Continents and 8th at the 2012 World Championships. Invited by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Shibutanis attended a dinner in honor of Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda on May 1, 2012, in Washington, D.C. Following Igor Shpilband's dismissal from the Arctic Edge Arena in June 2012, the Shibutanis decided to remain at the rink with Marina Zoueva and ended their collaboration with Shpilband. ===2012‚Äì2013 season=== The Shibutanis placed third in the short dance at the 2012 Rostelecom Cup. They paused their free dance for half a minute due to Alex pulling a muscle in his thigh. They were allowed to continue from the point of interruption and finished 4th overall behind Russian ice dancers Victoria Sinitsina and Ruslan Zhiganshin. They won the bronze medal at their next event, the 2012 NHK Trophy. The Shibutanis also took bronze at the 2013 U.S. Championships. They then competed at the 2013 Four Continents and finished 4th behind Madison Chock and Evan Bates. At the 2013 World Championships, the Shibutanis finished 8th. ===2013‚Äì2014 season=== The Shibutanis began their season by winning bronze medals at 2013 Skate America and 2013 NHK Trophy.

They then went on to compete at the 2015 Four Continents Championships and the 2015 World Championships where they placed 3rd and 5th, respectively. ===2015‚Äì2016 season: Return to World podium=== 2015 Grand Prix Final The Shibutanis began their season by winning the bronze medal at 2015 Ondrej Nepela Trophy. On the Grand Prix circuit, they earned standing ovations for Fix You, their Coldplay free dance. They won the silver medal at 2015 Skate Canada International and the gold medal at the 2015 NHK Trophy, for their second career Grand Prix event title. They qualified for the 2015‚Äì16 Grand Prix Final as the fourth ranked team based on qualification criteria that had been modified in an attempt to account for the partially cancelled Trophee Bompard event. Their combined short dance and free dance score from NHK Trophy of 174.43 points was the highest total score amongst all competitors during the Grand Prix season. At the Grand Prix Final event, they placed 4th in the short dance. The night before the free dance, Alex became severely ill with food poisoning. They chose to compete nonetheless, and managed to get another standing ovation for their free dance. They finished 4th in the free dance and 4th overall.

The word proverb corresponds to the Tagalog words salawikain, kasabihan (saying) and sawikain (although the latter may also refer to mottos or idioms), and to the Ilocano word sarsarita. Proverbs originating from the Philippines are described as forceful and poetic expressions and basic forms of euphemisms. If used in everyday conversations, proverbs are utilized to emphasize a point or a thought of reasoning: the Filipino philosophy. One notable and locally popular example of a Filipino proverb is this: A person who does not remember where he (she) came from will never reach his (her) destination. Of Tagalog origin, it conveys and urges one person to give \\"importance in looking back at one‚Äôs roots and origins.\\" The maxim also exemplifies a Filipino value known as the \\"utang na loob\\", one‚Äôs \\"debt of gratitude\\" to the persons who have contributed to an individual‚Äôs success. Damiana L. Eugenio, a professor from the University of the Philippines, author of Philippine Proverb Lore (1975), and who is also referred to as the \\"Mother of Philippine Folklore\\" grouped Filipino proverbs into six categories based on the topic expressed, namely: ethical proverbs (those that express a general attitude towards life and the laws that govern life itself), proverbs that recommend virtues and condemn vices, proverbs that express a system of values, proverbs that express general truths and observations about life and human nature, humorous proverbs, and miscellaneous proverbs. ==Usage== Philippine proverbs are further illustrated to be ornaments to language, words of ancestors handed down from one generation to another, and as wisdom gained from experience, which can be quoted to express a sentiment, a statement, or an opinion. Apart from this, Filipino proverbs are also used to prevent offending other individuals. This is one example of such a proverb: Bato-bato sa langit, 'pag tinamaan huwag magagalit, meaning \\"a stone thrown heavenward, if you get hit on its way down, don't get mad.\\" Equipped with the appropriate and timely proverb, a Filipino can communicate empathy, and might be able to convince another person leading to the closure of an argument. Some Filipino proverbs are also intended to provide a warning, a lecture, an advice, and as a supporting statement for a particular viewpoint or issue. ==References Category:Proverbs by language Category:Philippine literature tl:Salawikain ","title":"Filipino proverbs"},{"id":"19313728","text":"ICCI-FM (101.1 FM) is a non-commercial radio station in the Cayman Islands in the British West Indies.

The team were promoted to the 2. Liga at the end of the season. Fischli started playing semi-professionally in 1965 with FC Young Fellows Z√ºrich in the Nationalliga B (later renamed Challenge League).

It coincides with the push within Australian fandom to host the World Science Fiction Convention in Australia in 1975, (Aussiecon), and the rise of fanzine fandom centred on Melbourne, Australia; e.g. Australian SF Review, SF Commentary, ANZAPA. He based the procedures of DUFF on the already-existing Trans-Atlantic Fan Fund (TAFF), which began in 1952. ==Funding== DUFF is funded through the support of fandom. Candidates are voted on by interested fans all over the world, and each vote is accompanied by a donation of not less than $US5 or A$6. These donations, and the continued generosity of fandom, are what make the whole concept of these fan funds possible. In addition to donations, fans hold auctions at science fiction conventions to raise money for DUFF. Frequently art, books, T-shirts, and other ephemera of fandom are auctioned off for this purpose. ==Procedure== Each candidate posts a bond, promising to travel (if elected) to a major convention on the other side of the Pacific; and has provided signed nominations and a platform. Voting is by secret ballot, using instant-runoff voting; and is open to anyone who has been active in fandom for the prior year or more and who contributes to the Fund. Ballots are signed, to prevent ballot-box stuffing and to enable the election administrators to identify each voter as a known member of fandom. Although the winner is expected to attend Worldcon or a specific national convention, DUFF delegates generally also tour the country before and/or after the convention in order to meet a variety of fans. Winning DUFF candidates are expected to write a trip report, which customarily takes the form of a fanzine or a series of fanzine articles. These fanzines are sometimes sold in order to help raise funds towards future DUFF trips. In addition, winners take over the administration of the fund for their region (Australia/NZ or North America) for two years until the next regional DUFF delegate is selected. At any given time, there are at least two administrators, one for each region. ==List of DUFF winners== Past DUFF winners by year.

Primarily designed by John Wardley and opened in 1987, it is located in the Land of the Tiger (formerly Mystic East) area of the park. The ride was originally extensively themed, although the majority of its scenic design was later removed due to lack of maintenance and durability over time. A contest was held in 2014 that focused on possible new themes for the ride. In September 2017, the ride closed for refurbishment and reemerged on 5 May 2018 as Tiger Rock. ==History== The ride was named Dragon River when it opened in 1987, but subsequently named Dragon Falls since the 1999 season. The ride was manufactured by Mack Rides and was produced by John Wardley with the Tussauds Group. In July 2017, Chessington filed for planning permission to undertake a large overhaul of the Mystic East area of the theme park. Part of this overhaul included the re-theming and renaming of Dragon Falls to Tiger Rock. The ride closed on so that the overhaul could take place, which involved nearby Peeking Heights, a ferris wheel that was closed permanently the same day. In 2018, Chessington opened Tiger Rock to the public on 5 May 2018. Its theme revolves around tiger imagery and features a large tiger's head on the second drop, replacing the Angkor Wat heads. ==Ride description== The top of the main falls, as the boat travels between the tops of the two stone heads Tiger Rock is a water flume ride and features two drops, with the first being smaller than the second. When it was known as Dragon Falls, the station building was designed as a pagoda and the first drop featured a sculpted dragon tunnel. The ride began its journey by passing out of the station, and then along a picturesque stream lined with traditional Japanese plants and trees. Bridges are positioned above the ride at certain points, allowing guests to view passing boats. The boats go up the first lift hill, and then drop down into a tunnel which originally housed a trick waterfall effect. The boats exit the tunnel into trees, under a bridge, and around a lagoon until reaching a second, taller lift that ascends the side of a rocky mountain. The boats reach their highest point, before dropping into the main splash pool. Prior to the Tiger Rock theme, the boats would pass between two large scenic stone faces resembling Angkor Wat. Right before returning to the station, they would also pass an animatronic elephant that sprayed water at passing riders from its trunk. ==Theme== The surrounding area is Oriental themed and features multiple bridges, viewpoints of the flume and a large fibreglass Buddha statue based on the Great Buddha of K≈çtoku-in. The original faux-rock mountain with waterfall, which the boats climbed up on the second lift, was demolished in 2005. The boats are themed to resemble wooden canoes with inline seating. The original Dragon sculpture for the tunnel was created by Aden Hynes Sculpture Studios, along with the two stone Angkor Wat Buddha faces that framed the large flume drop. These sculptures were installed in 1987, having been hand carved from polystyrene, and coated with glass fibre for long time durability outside. Both the dragon and the stone faces were repainted over the years, contributing massively to the rides impressive theming. The Buddha heads and remaining rock scenery were demolished in 2013, a few years prior to the re- theming of the ride, leaving a bare structure of the flume drop. Half of the dragon tunnel was also removed, meaning boats now travel through exposed back- of-house facilities during the ride. Much of the architectural decoration in the station plaza has also been removed over time. Chessington initially advertised a competition to redesign the ride, claiming the attraction would be rethemed for 2014. However, nothing immediately came of this development, and the ride continued to operate in this half-demolished condition. The ride closed for a tiger retheme on . In October 2017, it was announced that the ride would be renamed Tiger Rock. As with Runaway Train, the ride itself will remain unchanged, with only the scenery being redesigned. New Amur tiger enclosures were constructed and built into the area and the 'Mystic East' area of the park was later renamed 'Land of the Tiger'. The parks Ferris Wheel attraction called 'Peeking Heights' was demolished to make way for the new enclosures. The enclosures feature great interactions with the paths, bridges and with the 'Tiger Rock' flume ride in the area and there are also trails in the area where the tigers can walk over the head of guests called 'Tiger Crossings' in a 'Europe First'. A fair bit of the theming of the area has been changed including a few buildings have been repainted to fit in with a new tiger theme, the 'Angkor Wat' structure on the second 'main' drop of the ride has been replaced with a large rock structure centrepiece that the ride drops through that looks like a tiger head. Noticeably, the 'Dragon tunnel' has been repainted and re-purposed to look like a rocky cave structure, with the rough shape of the dragon being recognizable, but the artwork replaced with a flat blanket of grey rock texture. Notably, the large Buddha statue themed to K≈çtoku-in in the city of Kamakura in Japan has survived the re-theme. ==Gallery== File:Chessington World of Adventures 097.jpgShot of the ride from above File:310812-003 CPS.jpgSecond lift hill File:Chessington World of Adventures 087.jpgDragon head File:Julia, Ella and Phillip, Chessington, Surrey, 10 April 2011 - Flickr - PhillipC (3).jpg2011 File:Julia, Ella and Phillip, Chessington, Surrey, 10 April 2011 - Flickr - PhillipC (2).jpg2011 File:DragonFalls Splash.jpgThe main waterfall File:Julia, Ella and Phillip, Chessington, Surrey, 10 April 2011 - Flickr - PhillipC (1).jpg2011 File:Dragon Falls √† Chessington World of Adventures.JPGThe main waterfall ==References * Category:1987 establishments in England Category:Chessington World of Adventures rides Category:Rides designed by John Wardley Category:Log flume rides ","title":"Tiger Rock"},{"id":"19313749","text":"Mountains was the third album of the British blues-rock band Steamhammer.

Its products were buses, coaches, vehicle transporters, trailers and special vehicles like snow groomer vehicles. The group broke up in 1995 due to economic problems and was acquired by Daimler AG, which continues to produce under the brand name Setra. ==History== thumb In 1893, Karl K√§ssbohrer founded the Wagenfabrik K√§ssbohrer in Ulm. In 1922, K√§ssbohrer developed a trailer for goods transport, having solid rubber wheels. When Karl K√§ssbohrer senior died in 1922, his sons, Karl junior and Otto K√§ssbohrer, took over the company and began to produce the first 2x4 axle trailers. In 1928, Karl and Otto purchased Ulmer Karosseriefabrik Neuer & Thieme, a frame and body construction company an focused on bus, trailer and upper body production. In 1931 Karl applied for a patent on semi-trailer coupling which was extremely reliable and low maintenance and further paved the way to 3-axle semi-trailers which changed the transportation industry. In the mid to late 1930s the first low-bed with 12 ton capacity was produced and the K√§ssbohrer Ulm factory in Peter-Schmid- StraŒ≤e expanded to meet demand with staff numbers increasing from 300 to 1000 between the years 1934 - 1939. In 1969, K√§ssbohrer was Germany's biggest coach and truck trailer producer. On April 29, 1973, Karl K√§ssbohrer passed away. K√§ssbohrer's coaches and buses were named Setra. The snow-grooming vehicles were called PistenBully and 2,000 were sold between 1979 and 1989. At the end of the 1990s, about 9,000 employees worked for K√§ssbohrer. Currently Pistenbully is the largest manufacturer of snow groomers in the world. Starting in 1993, the company began to fall apart. The division's truck bodies, semi-trailers and trailers were sold to the competitor K√∂gel. In 1994, the snow groomer and beach cleaner division was bought out by management and became K√§ssbohrer Gel√§ndefahrzeug AG (all-terrain vehicle), based in Laupheim. In the end, Daimler bought the bus and coach division in 1995 and the new name EvoBus was introduced.

The M6 extends from its junction with the M4 at Kinnegad all the way west to the outskirts of Galway City, but the Athlone bypass and the approach to Galway city - while of dual carriageway standard - have not been designated motorway and are still signed as N6. The motorway was officially completed and opened to traffic on 18 December 2009, and was the first city-to-city direct major inter-urban route to be completed in Ireland. The M6 and M4, which form the Galway-Dublin route, consist of a grade- separated 2+2 dual carriageway road with a top speed limit of 120 km/h. At approximately 144 km (90 mi), the M6 is the third longest motorway in the state and will be 159km. ==Route== Near Kinnegad, the M6 motorway diverges from the M4 at a restricted access junction. From here it proceeds westward, passing through counties Westmeath, Offaly, Roscommon and Galway before terminating just east of Galway City near Doughiska. ==History== The present- day M6 was constructed in five stages between 2005 and late 2009. Some of the sections which now form part of the M6 were initially opened as dual- carriageway and previously formed part of the N6, while other sections were opened as motorway. In chronological order, the various sections opened as follows (status on opening in brackets): * Kinnegad-Tyrrellspass (5 December 2006, as dual carriageway); * Tyrrellspass-Kilbeggan (16 May 2007, as dual carriageway); * Kilbeggan-Athlone (16 July 2008, as dual carriageway); * Athlone-Ballinasloe (23 July 2009, as motorway); * Ballinasloe-Galway (18 December 2009, as motorway). ===Kinnegad-Athlone=== Pass of Kilbride From 24 September 2008, motorway regulations were applied from Kinnegad to the eastern end of the Athlone bypass. The Kinnegad-Athlone scheme was signed as a motorway (and numbered \\"M6\\"). Its road markings were already appropriate to a motorway prior to the change in designation coming into effect; however, motorway regulations were not in force and the speed limit was 100 km/h until 24 September of that year. ===Athlone-Ballinasloe=== Construction of this 19-km section of road commenced on 3 September 2007 and opened to traffic on 23 July 2009. It was built as a grade separated HQDC to motorway standard and was redesignated a motorway on 28 August 2009. Prior to this date, the scheme was subject to a reduced speed limit of 100 km/h. The central barrier on this road is a traditional metal barrier rather than the Concrete step barriers, which have become standard on all new dual-carriageways in Ireland and UK in recent years. The Athlone to Ballinasloe scheme was built by SIAC-Willis JV. ===Ballinasloe-Galway=== Construction of this 56-km section of M6 began in 2007. This section lies between the town of Ballinasloe and Galway City, running between junctions 14 and 20 on the M6 corridor. The road is a tolled Public-private partnership scheme, and opened under motorway restrictions. The PPP contract was awarded to N6 Concession Limited in April 2007 which comprised FCC Construction S.A. and Itinere Infraestructuras (both major companies from Spain) and P.J. Hegarty & Sons who are a leading Irish Contractor. The contract was signed on 4 April 2007 for 30 years from that date. The construction took approximately 3 years to be completed and the N6 Concessions Limited will be responsible for collection of tolls for a period of approximately 27 years. This scheme was a matter of some controversy at its planning stage. The environmental agency An Taisce claimed that the National Roads Authority's planned route would be \\"particularly destructive\\" in passing the site of the 17th-century Battle of Aughrim The decision to toll the route is also controversial, as the M4 motorway to/from Dublin, which connects with the N6/M6 route, is also tolled. This meant that motorists would have to pay two tolls when driving between Dublin and Galway. It was pointed out, however, that this corresponds with the Authority's plan to have two tolls on each of the main interurban routes. The new section of N6/M6 between Ballinasloe and Galway was also quite unusual in another way: Unlike most national road upgrade projects in Ireland, the new route differed significantly from that of the original N6. The new route runs roughly east‚Äìwest between the two destinations, rather than dipping south to Loughrea, as the former alignment N6 did. The N65 was extended from Loughrea to the new M6 was constructed to cater for this change. As an emergency measure to restore access from Dublin to Galway after severe flooding at Craughwell on Friday 20 November 2009, an incomplete section of this scheme between Loughrea and Galway Clinic (Doughiska) was opened temporarily. ==Junctions== Junction 7 on the M6. Until 2011 there were two junction numbering schemes on the N6 route. The M6 junction numbers below are used on the entire length of the road. The Athlone bypass had a separate numbering scheme (J1‚ÄìJ6) but was renumbered to its current form (J8‚ÄìJ13) following the upgrade of the bypass in 2011. {  style=\\"margin-left:1em; color: black; border-collapse: collapse;\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" border=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"#fffff8\\" - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"0080d0\\" style=\\"color: white;font-size:120%;\\"  colspan=\\"4\\" 70px - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"000000\\" style=\\"color: white\\"  Westbound exit  Junction  colspan=\\"2\\" Eastbound exit -  Start of motorway (M4 20px)  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" The EAST (M4 20px) \\\\- Dublin, Kinnegad, Leixlip, Lucan -  Kinnegad (R446)  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" Kinnegad (R446) Sligo, Westport (N4) Enfield (R148) -  Rochfordbridge, Milltownpass (R446)  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" Rochfordbridge, Milltownpass (R446) -  Tyrrellspass, Mullingar (N52)  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" Tyrrellspass, Mullingar (N52) -  Tullamore, Kilbeggan (N52)  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" Tullamore, Kilbeggan (N52) -  Moate (R420)  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" Moate (R420) -  Moate (R446)  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" Moate (R446) -  Athlone Services  65px  colspan=\\"2\\" Athlone Services -  Athlone (R446) End of motorway  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" Start of motorway - - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"128D2A\\" style=\\"color:#EBD600;font-size:120%;\\"  colspan=\\"4\\"  70px - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"000000\\" style=\\"color: white\\"  Westbound exits  Junction  colspan=\\"2\\"  Eastbound exits -  Birr (N62)  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" Birr (N62) -  Athlone East  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" Athlone East -  Cavan , Longford (N55)  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" Cavan , Longford (N55) -  Athlone , Coosan  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" Athlone , Coosan -  Roscommon , Sligo (N61)  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" Roscommon , Sligo (N61) -  Athleague , Athlone West (R446)  30px  colspan=\\"2\\"  Athleague , Athlone West (R446) - - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=0080d0 style=\\"color: white;font- size:120%;\\"  colspan=\\"4\\"  70px - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"000000\\" style=\\"color: white\\"  Westbound exit  Junction  colspan=\\"2\\" Eastbound exit -  Ballinasloe (R357)  30px  colspan=\\"2\\"  Ballinasloe (R357) -  Ballinasloe (R446)  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" Ballinasloe (R446) -   40px  colspan=\\"2\\" -  Kiltullagh, Loughrea  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" Kiltullagh, Loughrea -  Athenry (R348)  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" Athenry (R348) -   Rathmorrissy (M17/M18)  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" Rathmorrissy (M17/M18) -  Oranmore (R381)  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" Oranmore (R381) -  Galway (R446)  30px  colspan=\\"2\\" Galway (R446) - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#E32636\\" style=\\"color: white;font-size:120%;\\"  colspan=\\"4\\"  70px (in planning) - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"000000\\" style=\\"color: white\\"  Westbound exit  Junction  Eastbound exit  Completion -  Galway (N84)  30px  Galway (N84)  rowspan=\\"2\\"Preliminary design -  Galway (N59)  30px  Galway (N59) - align=\\"center\\"  colspan=4  End of N6 with R336 } ===Motorway Service Area=== Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) is constructing Motorway Service Areas at approximately 60 kilometre intervals along each of Ireland's interurban routes. Under this plan, the M6 has one such area. It is located just east of Athlone (see here, p. 25). The EIS for the M6 Athlone Motorway Service Area was issued in 2014. It was officially opened on 12 September 2019. ==Tolls== Although the M6 is a tolled motorway, there is only a single toll plaza, located at Cappataggle, between junctions 15 Ballinasloe West & 16 Loughrea. Hence there is no toll payable to travel between the eastern end of the motorway and Ballinasloe and also between Loughrea and the western end at Galway city. Tolls may be paid by cash, credit card or through the use of an electronic tag.Operating Company Website FAQs ==Future Motorway redesignations affecting the M6 === At present, the M6 motorway leads into the non-motorway Athlone bypass and continues again west of the bypass to Galway. Subject to improvements, the Athlone Bypass may yet come under motorway regulations and be incorporated into the rest of the M6 route. ==See also== *Roads in Ireland *Motorways in Ireland *National primary road *National secondary road *Regional road ==References *Roads Act 1993 (Classification of National Roads) Order 2006 ‚Äì Department of Transport *Scheme Activity 2006 ‚Äì National Roads Authority (road projects under construction) *N6 Galway to Ballinasloe ‚Äì Galway County Council *N6 Ballinasloe to Athlone Dual Carriageway ‚Äì Roscommon County Council *NRA map of the Athlone ‚Äì Kilbeggan section *N6 Galway City Outer Bypass *M6 Toll operator website M06 Category:Roads in County Meath Category:Roads in County Westmeath Category:Roads in County Offaly Category:Roads in County Roscommon Category:Roads in County Galway ga:N6 ","title":"M6 motorway (Ireland)"},{"id":"19313789","text":"Cathy Cassidy (born 13 June 1962) is an English author of young adult fiction.

Naef () is an astronomical observatory located at √âpendes, Canton of Fribourg, Switzerland at 7.13938 degrees east of Greenwich and 46.76236 degrees north latitude. Its parallax constants are : œÅ sin œÜ' = 0.68632 (Earth radii from the rotation axis) and œÅ cos œÜ' = +0.72501 (Earth radii from the equatorial plane). The observatory was named in memory of (1907‚Äì1975). The minor planet 1906 Naef was named in his honour. == Robert A. Naef Foundation == The Robert A. Naef Foundation was created on 15 April 1977 on the initiative of his widow, Mrs. Daisy Naef-Ryter. According to its statutes, the Foundation has the goal of honouring the memory of the late Robert A. Naef (22 July 1907 ‚Äì 13 March 1975) by installing his Reinfelder & Hertel telescope in a newly created astronomical observatory. The observatory has the further goal of actively contributing to the exposure of young people to the art and science of astronomy. The Foundation was recognised as being of public interest by the Government of the Canton (State) of Fribourg on 16 May 1978. For 50 years Robert Adolf Naef, who worked at the Urania Observatory in Zurich, dedicated all his spare time and energy to popularising astronomy. His Opus Magnum was the creation of the astronomical annual directory \\"Der Sternenhimmel\\" in 1941. == The observatory == The astronomical observatory in √âpendes is located a few kilometres outside the city of Fribourg (in German Freiburg) in Switzerland, in the countryside, at 700 m above sea level. The observatory is owned by a non-profit organization, the Robert-A. Naef Foundation. The daily operations and maintenance are performed by the Association of Friends of the √âpendes Observatory. Thanks to its ideal location in the south of the greater area of Fribourg and 22 km in the north from Bulle, the observatory serves the purpose of disseminating astronomical knowledge, particularly to children and teenagers as well as to the general population. The observatory is open every Friday evening free to the public. The schools can also benefit from special visit opportunities (in French or German). For Holiday Pass the observatory is open in the summer and autumn holidays in the canton (state) of Fribourg. Groups can reserve the observatory on Wednesday or Saturday evenings, on request, with or without observations. == The equipment  Reinfelder & Hertel telescope === The invention of the telescope in 1608 and the subsequent improvements in optics led to the revolutionary progress of the 17th and 18th centuries. We call this type of telescope a refractor because it deviates the light coming from an object in such a way that its image is reversed ; observation is done through an eyepiece at the end of the tube, which allows magnification of the image. Bequeathed by Mr. Robert A. Naef, the observatory's precious telescope is a Reinfelder & Hertel with a diameter of 162.5 mm and a focal distance of 1435 mm - this allows a magnification of X150. === Keller telescope === This telescope Keller was inaugurated on 21 May 2004. This new Keller telescope reinforces the attractiveness of the observatory through its exceptional performance. It is a Cassegrain type telescope, equipped with a 50 cm diameter mirror for a focal distance of 5000 mm. It is fixed on a fully computer-driven German mounting. The telescope offers staggering image of deep space objects. === The coelostat === The design and assembly of the coelostat VTT 120 extends the equipment of the observatory to another area. This makes it possible not only to admire the night sky, but also the Sun, with its sunspots, prominences, etc. The installation of the telescope opens to visitors several new possibilities : * Projection of white sunlight against a wall, so that all observers can simultaneously observe sunspots, granulation, solar rotation, etc. * Projection of the solar spectrum with the Fraunhofer lines * Observation of prominences by means of a hydrogen-alpha filter * Observing the Sun in white light directly in the eyepiece with maximum magnification * Photography and video works Designer: AOK (Astrooptik Kohler) === C14 telescope === The observatory is also equipped with a more modern and more powerful instrument - a Celestron C14. It is a telescope which works with mirrors, as is generally the case with per-formant instruments. This one is a Schmidt-Cassegrain - that is, it has a hyperbolic and concave secondary mirror in the same axis as the primary mirror, which reflects light back through a hole pierced in the primary mirror itself. The image can then be observed through an eyepiece at the end of the tube. This instrument, with a primary mirror of 40 cm diameter can capture about 1800 times more light than the naked eye; the diameter of the eye's pupil is only 5 mm. In order to increase the stability of the instrument we have opted for a German mount. The electronic pilot automatically follows observed objects by compensating for the rotation of the Earth. Our NGC-Max guiding system contains the coordinates of thousands of objects and greatly helps with the aiming of the telescope. === Planetarium === A mini planetarium, with seating for a dozen people, is used for initiating the general public into celestial mechanics : explanations as to the motion of stars and planets, the location of constellations, etc. are readily visualized. Since March 2006, a new digital planetarium system has been installed: the Digitarium Alpha. This equipment comprises a computer on which an adapted version of the Stellarium open source software runs, and a beamer equipped with a fish-eye lens. A simultaneous projection of the skies together with a drawing of the constellations and astronomical pictures or movies is made possible thanks to the incorporated DVD drive. At this observatory ‚Äì among the 523,584 minor planets already registered by the Minor Planet Center until 2018 July 12 ‚Äì 95 new minor planets (numbered between 129342 Ependes, recorded first on 5 November 2005, and 477358, recorded first on 23 October 2009) have been discovered by Dr. h.c.

It is located between the two directions of the A10 Amsterdam ring road. It is also a metro station at which GVB runs two lines. RAI gets its name from the nearby Amsterdam RAI Exhibition and Convention Centre. ==History== The original station opened in 1981 when it was a terminus station, with just one platform and the station had no signals. It was then possible to walk straight onto the GVB tramway line 4 (with Amsterdam Central Station as terminus) without changing platforms. In 1988 the tram terminus moved to street level below the station. This was due to the building of Amsterdam Metro line 51 next to the railway station. This line began operating in 1990. The roof of the railway station was built in 1997. The new station was built in 1991 and Amsterdam RAI became an island platform station and then in 1993 the line was extended towards Weesp. The design of the station is by architect Rob Steenhuis. In 2012, an expansion of the station from 2 to 4 tracks was commenced. These works were completed in August 2016.

In 1971, bassist Steve Davy left the band, and Louis Cennamo was recruited as his replacement - then, vocalist/guitarist Kieran White also left after a summer tour. Guitarist Martin Pugh, drummer Mick Bradley and Cennamo (with guest vocalist Garth Watt-Roy, of Fuzzy Duck) then went in the studio to record Speech, which was released in 1972. It consisted of three lengthy (and mostly instrumental) songs in a heavier progressive-rock vein, that was somewhat different from their initial blues and folk/jazz-influenced albums. Bradley died from leukemia shortly before the album's mixing was completed (the album is dedicated to him on the inside album cover). The band continued with American singer/guitarist Bruce Payne and drummer John Lingwood, touring in Germany in support of the album, where they were more popular than back home in England. After Steamhammer wound down, Pugh and Cennamo joined up with former Yardbirds vocalist Keith Relf (who had provided production assistance on Speech, as well as contributing background vocals) and drummer Bobby Caldwell, formerly of Johnny Winter's band and Captain Beyond, to form Armageddon. ==Track listing== Side 1: # \\"Penumbra\\" (22:42) (Pugh, Cennamo, Bradley; lyrics: Elizabeth Romilly) ## \\"Entrance\\" ## \\"Battlements\\" ## \\"Passage to Remorse\\" ## \\"Sightless Substance\\" ## \\"Mortal Thought\\" Side 2: # \\"Telegram (Nature's Mischief)\\" (12:00) (Pugh, Cennamo, Bradley; lyrics: Karl Williams) # \\"For Against\\" (10:58) (Pugh, Cennamo, Bradley) ==Personnel== ;Band members * Martin Pugh - guitar, vocals * Louis Cennamo - bass, bowed bass, vocals * Mick Bradley - drums ;Session musicians * Garth Watt-Roy - lead vocals * Keith Relf - backing vocals, production assistance * Jane Relf - backing vocals ;Technical *Pete Booth - engineer *Paul Whitehead - cover art == Product details == * Audio CD (1991) * Original release date: 1972 * Number of discs: 1 * Format: Import * Label: Repertoire (CD reissue) * ASIN: B00000743R Also: * Audio CD (October 11, 2005) * Original release date: 1972 * Number of discs: 1 * Label: Akarma Italy * ASIN: B00009Y34Y ==See also== * Steamhammer band ==References * Keith Relf website * Steamhammer's \\"Speech\\" review Category:Steamhammer (band) albums Category:1972 albums Category:Columbia Records albums ","title":"Speech (album)"},{"id":"19313897","text":"Essaim (swarm, in French) was a French military reconnaissance microsatellite constellation.

Primavera is a fine arts and crafts gallery at 10 King's Parade in Cambridge, England. Henry Rothschild of the Rothschild family founded Primavera in 1945 in Sloane Street, London, in order to promote and retail contemporary British art and craft.Greg, Andrew.Primavera:Pioneering Craft and Design 1945‚Äì1995. Newcastle Upon Tyne: Tyne and Wear Museums, 1995. The Cambridge branch of Primavera was founded in 1959, when Rothschild took over a shop formerly run by the Cambridge Society of Designer-Craftsmen on King's Parade. The blue-painted Gallery (left of centre) on King's Parade Henry Rothschild first became interested in the crafts when he encountered them in Italy in 1944 while on Army service with the Royal Corps of Signals. On his return to England, he researched British crafts and decided to found Primavera in Sloane Street. Primavera offered stoneware by the Winchcombe and Crowan potteries, tin-glaze from the Cole brothers' Rye Pottery, tableware by Lucie Rie, textiles, furniture and basketwork being exhibited and sold. From 1953, Primavera developed an exhibition programme showing continental ceramics, toys, sculpture and folk art. The reputation of the gallery enabled Rothschild to promote arts education in schools and to support museums and local authorities in putting together art and craft collections. Following the establishment of Primavera in Cambridge, the interior was refitted by Gordon and Ursula Bowyer and the basement redesigned as a textile showroom. Marion Goodwin and Valerie Webb were appointed as managers and focused on sourcing local crafts. The upstairs gallery space at 10 King's Parade was once home to Charles Lamb, the poet and essayist, along with his sister Mary in 1819. In 1965, the Viewpoint 1965 exhibition held at the gallery featured Geoffrey Clarke (sculpture and stained glass), Mary Potter (paintings), and Dan Arbeid (ceramics). In 1999 the current owner, Jeremy Waller, purchased the gallery. Jeremy returned to Cambridge (where he was previously a student) after spending many years working and travelling in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Whilst overseas he continued his lifelong study of different cultures and arts practise. Jeremy Waller's purchase of Primavera continued the lineage of the two previous owners with a keen interest in raising the profile of UK artists and makers. Since 1999, Primavera has been remodelled to accommodate more work on 3 floors of the King's Parade site, and opened a sister site at 13 Magdalene Street, which functions as a dedicated exhibition space as well as a studio for an artist-in-residence scheme. As a painter Jeremy has brought an artist's eye to the space and Primavera now represents more than 500 UK makers, exhibited in a unique way in the Grade II listed galleries on King's Parade. He and his wife Sheila have also dedicated a significant part of their home and grounds at College Farm, Haddenham (ex-Gonville and Caius College), to housing a permanent collection of work by UK artists. In 2001 Waller revived the connection between the Fitzwilliam Museum and Primavera by staging a joint exhibition entitled \\"Ceramics and Glass\\". New works by Caiger-Smith and Peter Layton were shown. Primavera has received commissions from Cambridge University to design and craft pieces for colleges, including a pair of wooden candlesticks for St Catharine's College turned by Guy Ravine in 2008. Primavera displays jewellery by the late Barbara Christie. Numbers 10 and 11, King's Parade is a Grade II listed building. ==History== In 1945 Henry Rothschild opened Primavera at 149 Sloane Street, London. In 1953, Primavera developed an exhibition programme starting with a selection of traditional British baskets held at the Tea Centre. In 1999, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, recognised Rothschild's contribution to the crafts by awarding an honorary Master of Arts degree. In 1999, Jeremy Waller purchased Primavera and continued the exhibition programme at 10 and later also 11 King's Parade. In 2013, Primavera displayed a new collection of porcelain and ceramic vessels by Tony Laverick In 2016, painter Stuart Cain was Primavera's artist-in-residence for Cambridge Open Studios. ==Bibliography== *Fisher, Sue. \\"Gallery with a difference\\".

It is located on the shores of the Sound of Raasay, southeast of Portree. The L√≤n B√†n watercourse flows from Loch Fada to \\"An Eas Mh√≤r\\" below which it is named \\"Allt √ìsglan\\" and discharges into the sea at Camas Tianabhaig. The stream forms the boundary between the township and Conordan to the south. √ìsglan itself is the land on the right bank of Allt √ìsglan. The name is from both Gaelic and Norse, Camas D√¨onabhaig. \\"Camas\\" means \\"bay\\" in the former and the Norse element may be from \\"dyn\\" meaning \\"noisy\\". ==Tourist activities== Camastianavaig has a rocky shore with views of the Cuillin and Raasay and is situated at the bottom of Ben Tianavaig, where there is a sea eagle colony. Other local wildlife includes bottlenose dolphin in the summer months, and seals, otters and ducks on a regular basis. ==Agriculture== The land is used for mainly crofting, with the majority of the livestock being sheep and a few cows. The land is slightly too acidic for arable farming although the addition of lime is used to compensate for this. The soil is also low in potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen, which are essential elements required for plant growth. The high levels of rainfall and steep slopes also cause soil erosion, creating further difficulties for crop growing. ==Battle of the Braes== The township is near the scene of the Battle of the Braes (Scottish Gaelic: Bl√†r a' Chumhaing) in 1882. Local crofting tenants facing eviction from the land withheld rent and released sheep onto a forbidden area on the shores of Ben Lee. Sent to evict them, the Sheriff Officer from Portree was met by an angry mob, who forced him to burn the eviction notices. Subsequently 50 Glasgow policemen, sent to quell the rebellion, faced 100 men, women and children, armed with sticks and stones. Several people were injured and five men were arrested. Small fines were imposed in court, but it was clear that law and order could only be enforced with military assistance. After the Battle of the Braes, the unrest spread to Glendale, Skye. The rebellion led to the Napier Commission and ultimately the Crofters Act of 1886, which brought security of tenure and the right to hand a croft on to their heirs. The Battle of the Braes is celebrated by a monument and a folk song and in 2012 various legal dignitaries paid a special visit to the site to commemorate the centenary of the Scottish Land Court. The court's chair, Lord McGhie led a party, including Lord Bracadale and Sheriff Roddy John MacLeod who were both born on Skye, past the church where the first witnesses to the court gave evidence in 1912. The party was expected to acknowledge that the court \\"stands on the shoulders\\" of the crofters of the Braes who resisted eviction. ==References *Canmore - Camastianavaig, Skye site record Category:Populated places in the Isle of Skye Category:1882 in Scotland ","title":"Camastianavaig"},{"id":"19313944","text":"Jos√© Mar√≠a Michavila N√∫√±ez (Madrid, Spain, 28 March 1960) is a Spanish politician who belongs to the People's Party (PP).

Armatae was \\"Flower-heads usually large, mostly terminal, enclosed in floral leaves longer than the flowers. Involucres broad. Perianths above 1 in. long.

His analyses have provided compelling evidence of the paraphyly of Banksia with respect to Dryandra; that is, it seems that Dryandra arose from within the ranks of Banksia. Early in 2007, Mast and Kevin Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by sinking Dryandra into it as B. ser. Dryandra. This transfer necessitated the setting aside of George's infrageneric arrangement of Dryandra; thus D. ser. Armatae is no longer current. Mast and Thiele have foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra is complete. ==References * Category:Banksia taxa by scientific name *ser.

He led Austria-Hungary's Third Army during the Battle of Galicia. ==Personal life== Brudermann was a son of Generalmajor (Major General) Rudolf Johann von Brudermann (1810‚Äì1889) and his wife Gisela von Barbaczy (1815‚Äì1855). He had two brothers, Anton (1847‚Äì1881) and Adolf (1854‚Äì1945), and a sister, Gisela Elisabeth (1852‚Äì1917). His brothers also pursued a military career. He married Marie Albine, n√©e J√ºrgens, on 2 July 1878. They had no children. ==Military career== Brudermann began his training at the Kadettenanstalt (Cadet Institute) in Hainburg an der Donau and attended the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt from 1865 to 1869. On 1 September 1869 he was commissioned as a Leutnant (lieutenant) and assigned to Imperial and Royal Uhlan Regiment \\"Alexander II, Emperor of Russia\\" No. 11. On 1 May 1874 he was promoted to Oberleutnant (first lieutenant). After attending the war college in Vienna, he joined the general staff in 1874, and while there received a promotion to Hauptmann 1.Klasse im Generalstab (captain first class in the general staff) on 1 November 1877. At his own request, he was transferred on 1 April 1878 to the reserve list as a member of Imperial and Royal Uhlan Regiment \\"Prince of Schwarzenberg\\" No. 2 with the rank of Rittmeister first class. He married his wife on 2 July 1878 while in a reserve status. On 1 January 1879, Brudermann returned to active service and was assigned to the Imperial and Royal Uhlan Regiment \\"Knights of Brudermann\\" No. 1. From 1880 to 1884 he acted as an instructor in the cavalry cadet school at M√§hrisch-Wei√ükirchen in Moravia and was then assigned to Imperial and Royal Dragoon Regiment \\"Prince to Windisch-Graetz\\" No. 14. While with this regiment, he received promotions to major on 1 November 1885 and to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) on 1 November 1888. He took over command of the regiment on 5 April 1891 and was promoted to Oberst (colonel) on 1 November 1891. He received the Order of the Iron Crown Third Class in March 1895, a standard award for three years of satisfactory service in command of a regiment. In March 1897 Brudermann took command of the 15th Cavalry Brigade at Tarnopol, and on 18 May 1897 he was promoted to Generalmajor (major general). From March 1900 to the end of March 1904, he commanded the 7th Cavalry Division in Krak√≥w. On 1 May 1901 he was promoted to Feldmarchalleutnant (lieutenant field marshal), and in April 1904 was honored with the Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold. In July 1906, Brudermann took over the position of Imperial and Royal General Inspector of Cavalry, and he was promoted to General der Kavallerie (general of the cavalry) on 26 April 1907. While in this position, he received the honorary title of Oberstinhaber (colonel-proprieter) of Uhlan Regiment No. 1 in February 1907 and was awarded the Order of the Iron Crown 1st Class in August 1908. Brudermann was an enthusiastic cavalry commander who had never seen combat and whose military experience was limited to maneuvers and what he had read in field manuals. As general inspector of cavalry, he was determined to retain the tactics and ethos of an earlier era even as warfare changed around him in the late 19th and early 20th century. He prevented any modernization of the cavalry force, rejecting all new weapons such as machine guns, and refusing to allow the cavalry to wear the hechtgrau (\\"pike gray\\") camouflage uniforms the rest of the army adopted. He viewed the use of camouflage as incompatible with heroism, and believed that cavalry forces of the early 20th century should fight as those of a century earlier had, charging into battle across open fields in colorful uniforms and wielding sabres in the face of enemy gunfire. Some senior officers, including the chief of the general staff, Franz Conrad von H√∂tzendorf, wished to replace Brudermann with someone who would see the need to modernize the cavalry for 20th-century warfare, and in October 1912 Brudermann was promoted to general inspector of the army to allow Karl Georg Reichsgraf von Huyn to take over as general inspector of cavalry. Despite this change, the Austro-Hungarian Army's cavalry force entered combat in World War I in late July 1914 still heavily influenced by Brudermann‚Ä≤s beliefs. ===World War I=== On the eve of World War I, Brudermann was still general inspector of the army. In the Austro-Hungarian Army system, the officer in that position normally was the designate to take command of the army in the event of war, but Conrad did not view Brudermann as up to the task. Therefore, after mobilization began and World War I broke out with Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Serbia on 28 July 1914, Conrad in August 1914 made Brudermann the commander of the Third Army in Eastern Galicia along the border with the Russian Empire. During the Battle of Galicia, which opened the war with Russia, Conrad ordered Brudermann's army to take on a defensive role around Lemberg while the First and Fourth Armies went on the offensive against the Russians to the north of the Third Army. Brudermann had difficulties with his superiors at the Army High Command, and his troops suffered major defeats at the hands of Imperial Russian Army forces during the Battle of Komar√≥w, particularly around Z≈Çocz√≥w on 26‚Äì27 August 1914, and in the Battle of Gnila Lipa on 29-30 August 1914, resulting in enormous losses among Austro-Hungarian troops. After Lemberg fell to the Russians, he was dismissed from his post on 4 September 1914 shortly after the beginning of the Battle of Rawa.Oskar Dohle (Hrsg.), Constantin Schneider: Die Kriegserinnerungen 1914‚Äì1919, p. 654 (in German) (restricted preview via Google Book Search). He left the army at his own request on 23 November 1914 and officially retired on 24 March 1915. ==Later life== Brudermann spent his retirement in Vienna. After the conclusion of World War I in 1918, and particularly after about 1930, his military mistakes and failures were largely forgotten in the First Austrian Republic, and he was a popular figure when he appeared in uniform at veterans events. In 1936, he was elected honorary president of the Vereinigung Alt Neustadt (Old Neustadt Association), the association of veterans from the Theresian Military Academy. Together with his wife, he is buried in the Vienna Central Cemetery in Vienna. ==Awards and honorsAustro-Hungarian=== *120px Order of the Iron Crown Third Class (March 1895) *120px Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold (April 1904) *120px Order of the Iron Crown First Class (August 1908) ===Foreign=== *120px Grand Cross of the Albert Order (Kingdom of Saxony, July 1905) *120px Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (United Kingdom, February 1908) *120px Order of the Crown (Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, October 1908) *120px Order of the Sword (Sweden, February 1909) *120px Order of the Red Eagle (Kingdom of Prussia, October 1909) ==NotesReferences *Biography at austro-hungarian-army.co.uk *General der Kavallerie Rudolf Ritter von Brudermann (in German) Category:1851 births Category:1941 deaths Category:People from Gy√∂ngy√∂s Category:Military personnel from Vienna Category:Austrian generals Category:Austro-Hungarian military personnel of World War I Category:Austrian knights Category:Recipients of the Order of the Iron Crown (Austria) Category:Recipients of the Albert Order Category:Recipients of the Order of the Sword Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Eagle Category:Honorary Knights Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order Category:Recipients of the Order of the Crown (W√ºrttemberg) Category:Burials at the Vienna Central Cemetery ","title":"Rudolf von Brudermann"},{"id":"19314033","text":"Captain Ghulam Ghaus Khan of Rawalpindi District, Pakistan was an Indian freedom fighter belonging to the famous Khatar Khan family of Rawalpindi District.The I.

It is sometimes called silver-leaved cuttsia, and confusingly also native elderberry, honey bush or native hydrangea (because these names are also used for other native Australian species). C. viburnea is the only species assigned to the genus Cuttsia. ==Description== The silver-leaved cuttsia is a shrub or bushy tree of up to 15 m high. Its branchlets however are initially herbaceous and have conspicuous lenticels. Young shoots and inflorescences have hairs that are flat against the surface. Leaves are alternately arranged along the stems. The leaf stem is 1¬Ω-4¬Ω cm long. The leaf blades are hairless, soft and thin in texture, bright green and shiny above with a paler underside, oval with the widest point at or beyond midlength, 8‚Äì20 √ó 2‚Äì6¬Ω cm. Its foot gradually narrows into the leaf stem, the edge is uniformly toothed and each tooth ends in a gland, and its tip is pointed. The secondary veins emerge at about 45¬∞ from the main vein and strongly curve, with their ends parallel to the edge of the leaf. The inflorescence is a multi-flowered panicle of 8‚Äì18 cm long. The symmetrical star-shaped flowers are pentamerous and pleasantly honey scented. The five triangular green sepals are less than 1 mm long. The five free white petals are long inverted tear-shaped 3‚Äì4 mm long and have a pointy tip. The five narrow white filaments alternate with the petals and are topped with anthers shorter than the filament, that shed cream-colored pollen. Pollen is tricolpate, triangular from a polar perspective and round from an equatorial perspective, about 20 Œºm, has a netted surface structure and is not shed in clusters of four but individually (microscope). On top of the yellowish disc sits a narrow white style that has a stigma with five lobes. Flowers can be found from October to December. The fruit is a green to light brown globose to ovoid capsule of 3‚Äì4 mm long, each locule of which opens separately. Seeds are minute and ovoid in shape. ===Differences with related taxa=== Cuttsia has white flowers with filaments longer than the anthers, a definite style and dry capsules, while Abrophyllum has creamy yellow flowers with filaments shorter than the anther, a seated stigma and the fruit is a berry that is black when ripe. In Cuttsia the ovary is superior, the stigma has five lobes and the seeds are small and ovate, while in Carpodetus the ovary is semi-inferior and topped by a conspicuous disc, the stigma is undivided and the seeds are angular, while the fruit is a black or greyish berry. ==Taxonomy== The genus and species were first formally described by botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1865 in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. ===Modern classification=== Cuttsia is most related to Abrophyllum and Carpodetus and these were joined in the Carpodetaceae. Recent genetic analysis showed a close relationship of this cluster with Roussea, an endemic of Mauritius, and these now constitute the Rousseaceae. ===Phylogeny=== The following tree represents the current insights in the relationships of Roussea with other taxa. ==Distribution== The silver-leaved cuttsia grows on the East- coast of Australia between Noosa Heads, Queensland and Newcastle, New South Wales and a few isolated locations in the mountains of Queensland. ==Ecology== The silver-leaved cuttsia occurs in subtropical and warm-temperate rainforest, and has a preference for locations with more light such as margins, regrowth, and along steams. The species is self-infertile. The flowers produce nectar and are visited by an array of different insects. Adults of the jewel beetle Calodema regalis are said to feed on Cuttsia. ==References== Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Asterales of Australia Category:Monotypic Asterales genera Category:Rousseaceae ","title":"Cuttsia"},{"id":"19314109","text":"Yale vs. Harvard is a 1927 Our Gang short silent comedy film directed by Robert F.

Each piece is named after the number of performers involved: for instance, Seven is a piece for seven performers, One9 (read \\"One Nine\\") is the ninth work for one performer, and 1O1 is a piece for an orchestra of 101 musicians. The vast majority of these works were composed using Cage's time bracket technique: the score consists of short fragments (frequently just one note, with or without dynamics) and indications, in minutes and seconds, during which the fragment can start and by what time it should end. Time brackets can be fixed (e.g. from 1.15 to 2.00) or flexible (e.g. from anywhere between 1.15 and 1.45, and to anywhere between 2.00 and 2.30). All of the Number Pieces were composed during the last six years of Cage's life, 1987‚Äì1992. Most are for traditional instruments, with six exceptions that range from works for rainsticks, the Japanese aerophone sh≈ç and conch shells to an electronically amplified version of 4‚Ä≤33‚Ä≥. This article lists all Number Pieces, organized by number of performers. ==List of Number PiecesOne=== {  ! Title ! Instrumentation ! Date of composition ! Dedicatee(s) ! Details -  One  piano  December 1987  Juan Allende-Blin  10 time brackets, all flexible except for the ninth. Each contains music written on two staves, but the content of one staff can be played in any relation with that of the other staff. -  One2  1‚Äì4 pianos  Summer 1989  Margaret Leng Tan  The pianist moves between several pianos (in 1992 Cage advised Margaret Leng Tan to use the I Ching to coordinate her movements). All instruments have their damper pedals wedged, so that the strings vibrate freely throughout the piece. -  One3  unspecified (amplified ambient sound)  late 1989   Full title: One3 = 4‚Ä≤33‚Ä≥ (0‚Ä≤00‚Ä≥) + 9px. There are no time brackets. The performer is to arrange a sound system so that \\"the whole hall is on the edge of feedback, without actually feeding back.\\" Thus the composition consists entirely of electronically amplified sound of the hall and the audience. -  One4  percussion  1990  Fritz Hauser  6 time brackets for the left hand and 8 for the right. Each contains a numeral on a stave, referring to an instrument ‚Äî the piece is to be performed on \\"cymbals and/or drums chosen by the drummer.\\" Cage adds that the sounds produced should be either very long or very short. -  One5  piano  May 1990  Ellsworth Snyder  21 time brackets for the left hand and 24 for the right. Each contains a single chord or a single note. The performer is instructed to either hold the pedal throughout, or make as many overlappings as possible (again, using the pedal if necessary). -  One6  violin  June 1990  J√°nos N√©gyesy  The time brackets are extremely long in this piece, up to 7 minutes, many overlap, and all contain just a single tone. Performances of the piece can be accompanied by a sound sculpture by Mineko Grimmer, which is made of ice with pebbles in it. When the ice melts, the pebbles fall and strike wires, producing sound, and then fall into a pool of water. One6 was initially intended for Paul Zukofsky. -  One7  unspecified  Fall 1990  Pauline Oliveros  This piece is the first part from Four6. The performer chooses 12 different sounds and plays within flexible time brackets. -  One8  cello with curved bow  April 1991  Michael Bach  There are 53 time brackets, each with a single sound produced on one, two, three or four strings. This Number Piece is microtonal. It may be performed with 108. -  One9  sh≈ç  July 1991  Mayumi Miyata  Ten movements, amounting to maximum total duration of 121 minutes. Any three movements of this piece may be performed with 108. -  One10  violin  February 1992   Each time bracket contains a single sound. Like One6, this piece can be performed simultaneously with a sound sculpture by Mineko Grimmer; the sculpture is essentially the same as in the earlier piece, but in a different configuration. -  One11  unspecified (film)  1992   This Number Piece is a film that consists of chance-determined play of electric light. It is scored for \\"solo cameraman.\\" It may be performed with 103. -  One12  voice  1992  Alfonso Fratteggiani Bianchi and the Quaderni Perugini di Musica Contemporanea  Possibly not a separate work, but a performing score for One7. The score contains instructions for creating a chance-determined series of 640 numbers between 1 and 12. The numbers are then interpreted as vowels or consonants (numbers 2‚Äì11), words (12) or \\"empty words\\" (1; pronouns, articles, etc.). The choice of words is left to the performer. -  One13  cello with curved bow 1 live and 3 recorded cellos  July‚ÄìAugust 1992  co-author is Michael Bach Bachtischa  The work remained incomplete at the time of John Cage's death but was published in 2009 as a collaborative composition with Michael Bach Bachtischa. The work has four voices, all playing the same note, but with various differences. - } ===Two=== {  ! Title ! Instrumentation ! Date of composition ! Dedicatee(s) ! Details -  Two  flute and piano  December 1987  Roberto Fabbriciani and Carlo Neri  This was the first Number Piece. Both parts contain 9 flexible time brackets and one fixed. Originally devised for flute and vibraphone, the flute part has only three different pitches and is quiet throughout, dynamics ranging from mp to pp. The piano part is notated on two staves, with the content of one played in any relation to that of the other. Each piano time bracket consists of 7 to 10 sounds. -  Two2  2 pianos  Summer 1989  For \\"Double Edge\\": Edmund Niemann and Nurit Tilles  This piece does not use time brackets. The score consists of 36 lines of music, 5 bars each. There are 31 sound events per each line, divided 5, 7, 5; 7, 7 as in Renga poetry. The pianists play one bar at a time in different tempi, both have to finish playing the bar at hand before moving to the next one. -  Two3  sh≈ç and five conch shells  July 1991   The sh≈ç part is the solo sh≈ç Number Piece, One9. There are 10 movements in this work, amounting to 121 minutes total duration. The conch shell parts contain only fixed time brackets. Within each time bracket there are two numbers: the first refers to the conch, the second, in superscript, refers to the intended number of bubbles to be produced (the shells are filled with water and \\"played\\" by carefully tipping them until a bubble forms inside, producing a sound). Any three movements of this piece may be performed with 108. -  Two4  violin and piano or sh≈ç  July 1991  Commissioned by the McKim Fund of the Library of Congress  Only flexible time brackets are used. The violin part is microtonal and consists for the most part of long sounds. It is divided into three movements. The piano/sh≈ç part contains mostly short sounds and is in four movements. -  Two5  tenor trombone and piano  October 1991  Hildegard Kleeb and Roland Dahinden  The trombone part is microtonal. Both parts include silences (up to 5 minutes). -  Two6  violin and piano  April 1992  Ami Flammer and Martine Joste  The time brackets of Two6 are empty and the performers have to fill them themselves. The pianist's material consists of parts of Extended Lullaby (chance-determined variations of Erik Satie's Vexations) and sequences of ascending pitches. The violinist chooses between silence, microtonal passages, or dyads from chance-determined pitches. } ===Three=== {  ! Title ! Instrumentation ! Date of composition ! Dedicatee(s) !

Bendix (August 28, 1818 ‚Äì October 8, 1877) was an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War who commanded two different New York regiments and then a brigade of infantry in Army of the Potomac in the Eastern Theater. He survived a serious wound at the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. He was noted as a prolific recruiter and organizer, and after the war, as a brevet general in the New York Militia, he helped organize the postbellum the New York state militia that later became the New York Guard. Bendix was mustered out of the Union Army on May 7, 1863. In July 1866, he was nominated and confirmed for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865. ==Biography== Bendix was born in between the United States and Canada, on board the \\"Sarah,\\" one of the first steamers that navigated St. Lawrence River. His parents (who were natives of Germany), returned to their native land soon after their son's birth and educated the boy in the common schools. While yet in his teens, young Bendix returned to the U.S. and settled in New York City, where he learned the trades of pattern maker and machinist. He joined the 9th New York State Militia in 1847 as a private. He was appointed as the lieutenant colonel of the 11th New York State Militia in October 1859. He became a prominent member of the New York City Freemasonry movement.The New York Times, October 9, 1877, adapted from Sue Greenahgen's webpage for Bendix. Retrieved 2008-09-14 Following the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Bendix organized the 7th New York Infantry and was appointed as its first colonel on April 23, 1861.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 127. He resigned that position on August 6, 1861 and became the colonel of the 10th New York Infantry (the \\"National Zouaves\\") on September 2, 1861. The regiment served at Fort Monroe in Virginia over the winter. In May, he was part of an expedition against Confederate forces at Norfolk, Virginia. During the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, he suffered a painful ankle wound during the Seven Days Battles. Later that same year, he participated in the battles of Second Bull Run, Antietam, and Fredericksburg, as well as several engagements of the intervening campaigns. Bendix was carried from the battlefield at Fredericksburg after suffering a serious wound in the neck from a shell fragment during the assault on Confederate entrenchments on Marye's Heights. He returned home to New York City on a leave of absence. He rejoined his regiment in January 1863, and assumed command of the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division of the II Corps between March 16, 1863 and April 27, 1863. He remained in command until April 28, when the 10th New York was ordered home to be mustered out of the volunteer service on May 7, 1863. Bendix then was heavily involved in helping recruit and train new soldiers for other New York units. On July 20, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Bendix for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on July 26, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 740. Bendix organized the Third Regiment (Bendix Zouaves) in November 1865. He was appointed a brevet brigadier general in the New York Militia in 1865. He retired from the service in 1871 and died in New York City six years later at the age of 59. He is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.

As a child he showed an early passion for drawing, and by his tenth year he was enrolled a fine art school. During his youth, he was deeply influenced by the atmosphere at his great-grandparents‚Äô house, steeped with authentic Russian traditions conserved during the Soviet regime. Young Shishkin travelled to the many old cities in his country. With his easel, he visited monasteries and paid close attention to the icons and frescoes. In the Vladimir Cathedral, an ex-capital of Russia, he was struck by the works of Andrei Rublev, considered the first Russian painter. He was a graduate of the Ural State Academy of Architecture and Arts in his home town, in 1975, then a trainee at the Stroganov Moscow State University of Arts and Industry. Georgy Shishkin was a professor of drawing and painting for about 10 years at this academy where he started as a trainee. From 1974 he took part in professional art exhibitions, while remaining at home in Socialist Realism. In the same year, he won the national competition for young creators in Russia and participated in the Prestige Exposition in Moscow. Experimentation with different techniques led him to favour pastel from 1980 and three years later he created his base preparation under the pastel. In 1981, during his first personal exhibition, many of his paintings were acquired by the State Fine Arts Museum. However, being multi-faceted, Georgy Shishkin made the interior decorations for the Ekaterinburg Opera Museum (1982‚Äì1985), with two large frescoes and a portrait gallery of the most famous soloists. The portrait of the ballet star Piotr Gusev was acquired by the Saint Petersburg State Museum of Theatre and Music. At the same time, for nine years, the artist worked as an architect and several buildings were erected according to his plans. In 1992, after travelling abroad, in Germany and the Netherlands, (from 1989), Georgy Shishkin, in a quest for his roots, began painting his ‚ÄúRussian Dreams‚Äù cycle of paintings. This cycle intended to express spiritual content by uniting abstraction and reality. He was invited by the mayor of Saint Petersburq, Anatoly Sobchak, to show his works in the Russian State Museum. As for the painting devoted to Chaliapin, it was presented to the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. His arrival in France (1993) and in Monaco (1995) led to a meeting with ‚ÄúWhite Russians‚Äù and a new impulse for his cycle. Lord Alistair McAlpine, after his visit to the Shishkin exhibition in Paris, wrote an article about him titled \\"Painter who captured the enigma of Russia\\" in The European Magazine (21‚Äì27 September 1995), noting the great mastery of the painter and high quality of his works. In 1999, Shishkin won the Taylor Foundation Prize. At Christie's, during an auction in the Principality, one of his paintings reached fourth place among works of famous artists like Arman, Botero, Folon or Matta (Le Figaro, 20 March 1999). Living in Monaco since 1998, the artist has participated in many humanitarian and charitable activities. Georgy Shishkin‚Äôs works are found in museums and private collections in many countries, notably in the Prince Palace in Monaco, in the collection of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, in the collections of Luciano Pavarotti, Lord Alistair McAlpine, brothers Lords David and Frederick Barklay. The artist has made two series of paintings for the Royal Palace of H.M. Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi. Invited to design Monaco‚Äôs postage stamps in 2005, Shishkin won the competition for drawing the effigy in profile of H.R.H. Prince Albert II of Monaco. In month May, 2009 in Monaco two postage stamps ¬´ Centenary of Ballets Russians of Diaghilev ¬ª went out, created by Georgy Shishkin.

It is the longest continuous enclosed aqueduct in the southern hemisphere. == Purpose == For many years, large areas in the Eastern Cape experienced severe water shortages because of little rainfall in the arid Karoo. The situation was aggravated by the reduction in capacity of many of the existing dams due to heavy silt deposits. The Project to alleviate this situation comprised two inter- dependent engineering schemes - neither of which was any use without the other. First, a dam had to be built across the Orange River; and then a tunnel had to be driven to take the water across the water-shed into another river system. The Orange-Fish Tunnel, together with its network of canals, weirs and balancing dams, has enabled these areas to be restored and has made the irrigation of thousands of hectares of additional land possible. The main purpose of the tunnel is to divert water from the Gariep Dam to the Eastern Cape for irrigation, household and industrial use. ==Route== The tunnel diverts water from the Orange River to the Great Fish River and the semi-arid areas of Eastern Cape province. The Orange River is the largest river in South Africa by volume, and the longest. It rises in the Drakensberg Mountains of Lesotho and flows Westwards through increasingly drier country to discharge into the South Atlantic at Oranjemund, where, through evaporation and abstraction, the volume was less than it was at the location of the Gariep Dam. The inlet tower at takes water from the Gariep Dam at Oviston: the name Oviston is an acronym based on the Afrikaans Oranje-VISrivier TONnel. After traversing due South under the Suurberg mountain plateau, it releases the water to the Teebus Spruit (tunnel outlet at ), to the Groot Brak River and onwards to the valleys of the Great Fish River and the Sundays River.http://www.halcrow.com/Who-we-are/film_archive/Orange-River-Tunnel- lining-film/ The tunnel is on what is called a \\"self-cleansing\\" gradient of 2% from North to South. During construction, South Africa changed over from \\"Imperial\\" measurement to the metric system, but special dispensation was made for this Project to use Imperial measure throughout, which was half-built at the time. == Construction == Construction started in 1966; preliminary works included a tarred road running along the rout of the tunnel, and three towns, Oviston at the North end, one in the one middle called \\"Mid-shaft\\", and \\"Teebus\\" at the South end. These towns included such facilities as a Clubhouse, tennis courts, a community hall, primary school, clinic, etc.. At Oviston there was also a power station to provide electricity to the tunnels and to the towns. Other facilities included Contractor's yards, a testing laboratory, and offices for the staff. The tunnel is 19'-6\\" in finished diameter, with a 9\\" thick mass concrete lining. The ground was excavated entirely by the drill-and-blast technique, and was tested both by flood and by fire.http://s3.spanglefish.com/s/27932/documents/civil- engineering/anticipating-the-unexpected-flood-fire-overbreak- collapse/anticipating-the-unexpected-flood-fire-overbreak-collapse.pdf The lining was done using a travelling shutter - concrete arrived first thing Monday morning, and continued unstopped until Saturday afternoon. The concrete mix was specially developed for the project, and the \\"cement\\" content was 50% Slagment a.k.a. PFA (Pulverised Fuel Ash). The mix contained retarders to enable the concrete to be placed up to six hours after mixing, and it also contained accelerators, to enable the shutter to be moved after only eighteen hours. The speed of the shutter was about 1000 ft a week. The tunnel has a finished diameter of and ranges in depth between and . It is on a gradient of 1:2000.http://www.spanglefish.com/miscellany/index.asp?pageid=382305 It was engineered by the British firm of Consulting Engineers, Sir William Halcrow & Partners, in association with Messrs Keeve Steyn and Partners of Johannesburg. The Client was the South African Department of Water Affairs. Halcrow's senior partner, Sir Alan Muir-Wood, sometimes known as \\"the father of modern tunnelling\\", worked on many of the world's leading tunnel projects, including the Orange-Fish Tunnel; the senior Engineer in charge of the design & supervision was Barry Kidd, who died young, before construction was complete.. The tunnel opened in 1975. When completed the tunnel's length of 83 km was the longest continuous enclosed aqueduct in the southern hemisphere and the second-longest water supply tunnel in the world. Over 200 000 m3 of concrete was used to line the tunnel which has a maximum throughput of 54 m3/s (about 2,000 cusecs).http://www.dwaf.gov.za/orange/Mid_Orange/orange-f.htm ==Intake at Oviston== The intake tower is situated on the south bank of the Gariep Reservoir at Oviston, approximately 19 km upstream of the dam wall. Seen from above, the intake tower is shaped like a four-leaf clover with each leaf containing an inlet gate - all at different levels. In this manner, water can be drawn from different levels to help control the water quality. Each of the four inlets can be sealed off to allow complete de-watering of the tunnel for routine maintenance. ==References * Panoramio Photo of the tunnel inlet Category:Orange River Category:Great Fish River Category:Water tunnels Category:Tunnels in South Africa Category:Tunnels completed in 1975 Category:Interbasin transfer ","title":"Orange‚ÄìFish River Tunnel"},{"id":"19314356","text":"Oviston is a settlement in Walter Sisulu Local Municipality in Joe Gqabi District Municipality in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.

Goan Catholics are Roman Catholics from the state of Goa, a region on the west coast of India. Most of the Goan Catholics are descended from Kshatriya and Vaishya natives of Goa, as well as Saraswat Brahmins. The rest of the locals of Goa who were converted to Christianity was during the Portuguese rule. The culture is a combination of Indian and Portuguese influences. ==Non-vegetarian== Fried Goan sausages Goan Catholic cuisine has distinct Portuguese influence as can be seen in the Roast Maas, a famous pork roast crackling dish served as the Pi√®ce de r√©sistance at wedding dinners, the Pork Sorpotel with slight variations, and Cabidela, a dish where fresh blood is stirred into the pork delicacy which ceases to exist in Goa although- is more prominent in Mangalore in Karnataka, than in Goa. The mainstay of the Ros dinner is Pork Bafad. The curries use a lot of coconut, coconut oil and spices, along with vinegar. Xit Kodi (Xit ‚Äì par-boiled or red rice; Kodi ‚Äì fish curry) forms the staple food of the community. Other popular Portuguese influenced delicacies are Chouri√ßo (pork sausage), Vindaloo, Fish Rechad, and Xacuti. The Chamu√ßa is a Goan derivative of the samosa, which is usually filled with beef or pork, and is a well-known snack. Croquettes, beef cutlets, and beef potato chops are common snacks. Roast beef and beef tongue are popular entrees at Goan celebrations. The traditional, Mol de Peixe (fish pickle) and Balch√£o (prawn pickle sauce), are originally from Macau. ==Vegetarian== 'Patoleo' are the pi√®ce de r√©sistance of the Assumption feast celebration. Patoleo (sweet rice cakes steamed in turmeric leaves consisting of a filling of coconut and palm jaggery) are prepared on the Feasts of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary on 15 August , Sa√µ Joa√µ (Nativity of Saint John the Baptist) on 24 June and Konsachem fest (harvest festival) which occurs across Goa during the month of August. Pez (a type of congee), Koiloris and Podecho (variants of dosa) are popular delicacies. The Sanna (a variant of idli) is another popular delicacy made from soaked rice, water, and salt. Sannas, a variant of idli Sweet dishes including Perad (guava cheese) and Kadio bodio (a tiny stick made with maida flour dipped in sugar syrup and dried) are well-known. Cashew laddus, Khaje, Revdyo, Peda, Tizan, Godshem, Puran Poli, and Sakhar Bhat are other well-known sweet dishes. Filoz (a jaggery and banana pancake) and Arroz doce (a Portuguese derivative of kheer (sweetened rice) from India) are also popular. Feni: cashew feni is made from the fermentation of the fruit of the cashew tree, while coconut feni is made from the sap of toddy palms, which is a popular alcoholic beverage. Kuswar is a term often used to refer to a set of unique Christmas goods that are a part of the cuisine of the Goan Catholic community. There are as many as 22 different traditional recipes that form this distinct flavour of Christmas celebration in Goa. Neuries are mince puffs stuffed with plums, nuts, fried theel, and sugar. Kidyo or Kulkul is a curly concoction dipped in sugar treacle. Bolinhas are small cakes, which are also known as \\"coconut cookies\\". Perad is a type of savoury guava cheese. Nankatais, which resemble \\"snow balls\\", are made from a batter of sugar, butter and flour. Baath is a moist rich coconut tart baked in a large round shape with pastry lattice work on top. Marzipan is a confection consisting primarily of sugar and cashew or almond meal. Doce is a sweet made using chickpeas and coconut. Bebinca, a rich egg-based multi-layered sweet dish, is what Goa is famous for and the subtle flavoured rose cookies are a hot favourite, but it is the Rich Plum Cake, which takes the better part of a week to make, that is the most famous. Candied fruit, plums, currants, and raisins are dexterously cut and soaked in rum. Flour is sieved and gently warmed in the sun. Nuts are peeled and chopped and the whole family comes together to make the cake. Jobs are allotted, one to whip up the eggs, while another creams the butter and sugar, cake tins are lined, and a strong pair of arms requisitioned to do the final mixing and stirring. ==See also== * Goan cuisine ==Notes== Ros is a ceremony celebrating the last day of the virginity of a bride and bridegroom.

In 1920 he appeared three times for the New South Wales Waratahs against the All Blacks scoring a try in his representative debut. With no Queensland Rugby Union competition in place at that time the New South Wales Waratahs were the top Australian representative rugby union side of the period and a number of Waratah matches of the 1920s played against full international opponents were in 1986 decreed by the Australian Rugby Union as Test matches. In 1921 he represented for New South Wales against the visiting Springboks and was selected to tour New Zealand. He played in seven matches on tour including the Waratah's Test victory. He made representative appearances in 1922 against the New Zealand Maori and the All Blacks, played in three Tests against them in 1924 and in five matches against them in 1925. The 3rd test of 1925 played on 23 June at the Sydney Showground was Fox's sole appearance as the national captain. He was solid in further Test appearances against New Zealand in 1926. He was a tremendous lineout forward and one of the senior players for the 1927‚Äì28 Waratahs tour of Britain, France and Canada, picked as the tour's vice-captain under Johnnie Wallace. He played in ten of the first thirteen games of the trip until he suffered a severe leg injury in the tour match loss to Oxford University RFC. He was captain in that Oxford game and with no substitutes allowed, the Waratahs played the second half with 14 men and lost to the students 0‚Äì3.

After the opening of a Walmart Supercenter in Garden City, Kmart closed in late April 2014. On January 7, 2015, it was announced that one of the mall's two main anchor stores, JCPenney, would be closing in March of that year. A Planet Fitness opened in place of the former Ladies Choice fitness center in May 2015. The mall's Stein Mart location closed in September 2015 so it can relocate to the South Strand Commons shopping center near Surfside Beach, the new location opened in October 2015. ==History== Inlet Square was built in 1990 by CBL Properties. It was the area's largest mall, slightly larger than the now demolished Myrtle Square Mall. The mall was bought in the early 2000s. It was originally going to be redesigned similarly to the successful Broadway at the Beach. With those plans falling through, a $4.5 million remodeling project began in 2007. This was the first renovation in the mall's history, and had been much needed since the massive 1.3 million square-foot () Coastal Grand Mall opened in 2004. The renovations weren't complete until 2011 due to financial hardships and loss of foot traffic. During this time, the mall lost most of its long time tenants, including the 12-screen Regal Cinemas, in 2010. In 2011, Franks Cinebowl and Grill opened a new complex in the former Regal Cinemas, bringing new life to the mall. In 2014, the mall lost Kmart, which opened with the original mall in 1990, and also gained a Planet Fitness location in the former Ladies Choice location. In 2015, the mall was hit with two more tenant losses, with the closures of JC Penney and Stein Mart. This leaves Belk, Planet Fitness, and Books-A-Million as the only stores left in the mall. On October 13, 2013, it was reported that the owners of Inlet Square Mall, Murrells Retail Associates was suing Frank Theaters for failing to make lease payments on time on several occasions. It was reported that the theater chain owes the mall $201,363 in unpaid rent and is asking a judge to accelerate nearly $24 million worth of payments which is due under a 20-year lease agreement that was signed in 2011. The Frank Theaters and CineBowl that were located in the Inlet Square closed suddenly at midnight on May 14, 2016 with no notice to the public after being in business for five years. On March 31, 2018 Rait Partnership defaulted on their lease by not paying their five year Overage Payment of $328,000 to the landlord. Rait refused to pay the landlord its monthly rent of $45,000 in June and July. The landlord hired a litigation attorney immediately since Rait was pocketing all the tenant rents. During this time of waiting on a rule by the SC judge, Rait remained in Inlet Square Mall now owing four months rent to the landlord. The landlord won in court and a court summons was ruled for RAIT to be evicted even though it said they left voluntarily. Rait was never planning to leave voluntarily and planned to stay for an additional two years making the original landowners suffer losses. With the win in court, the landowners can now feel relief of the Philadelphia group and the SC landowners can continue to regain the ability to make Inlet Square Mall a great place again. The landlord and all the original land owners are now trying to redevelop the mall. ==Current Stores== Belk, Planet Fitness ==Reconstruction== F + F Development began reconstruction on the mall in 2012 in an attempt to make it similar to the popular outdoor shopping center Broadway at the Beach.

It is usually described as a janya rƒÅga of Harikamboji (28th Melakartha Raga). However, alternate opinions suggest that Mechakalyani may be a more appropriate classification based on the lakshana of the raga.

It is a symmetric pentatonic scale (audava- audava raga in Carnatic music classification - audava meaning 'of 5'). Its ' structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see swaras in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms): * : * : (the notes used in this scale are shadjam, chathusruthi rishabham, antara gandharam, panchamam, chathusruthi dhaivatham) Mohanam is usually classified as a janya rƒÅga of Harikambhoji, the 28th Melakarta rƒÅga, though alternate opinions exist that prefer classifying it as a janya raga of Kalyani based on its lakshana. The Hindustani equivalent Bhoop is associated with Kalyan thaat (equivalent of Kalyani). One of the first scales employed by the ancient Tamils was the Mullaippann (3BCE), a pentatonic scale composed of the notes sa ri ga pa da equivalent to C, D, E, G and A in the western notations. These fully harmonic scales, constitutes the raga Mohanam in the Carnatic music style. ==Popular compositions== Mohanam rƒÅga lends itself for extensive elaboration and exploration and has many compositions in both classical music and film music. ===Kritis=== The geetham Varavina mridupani is one of the first short songs taught to beginners in Carnatic music.

E. Smith, was an English- born Australian violin and viola maker whose violins and violas are prized for their 'excellence of tone' and 'decorative elements' (e.g. sound holes, scrolls and curves). According to some musicians, \\"it is his violas that have the greatest reputation, being easily counted amongst the greatest ever created, regardless of era or nationality.\\"Christopher Latham, \\"Love on a G-string\\", Limelight, May 2007 ==Birth and early years== It is believed that Smith was born 1880, at Islington, London. He began his violin-making hobby to improve upon an inferior instrument which he had played in the Maldon Amateur Orchestral Society. Luthiering subsequently overtook engineering as his primary interest. Smith was self-taught, guided by A. E. Hill's book on Antonio Stradivari. His rapid acquisition of expertise attracted the attention of the Maldon antique and musical instrument dealer C. W. Jeffreys, whose firm he joined in 1905 as repairer and violin-maker. ==Migration to Australia== By 1909, Smith had made twenty violins and a quartet, with his instruments having already become noted for their excellent outline, arching and scrolls. He migrated to Melbourne in an attempt to set up on his own in an environment with fewer established competitors. In 1912‚Äì14 he worked with the Hungarian Carl Rothhammer at San Francisco, then moving to Sydney where he briefly continued his partnership with Rothhammer. In 1919, he established A. E. Smith & Co. Ltd, an importer and repairer ‚Äì as well as a manufacturer, of stringed instruments. Smith personally trained his craftsmen in the production of violins, violas and cellos. His workshop established the careers of many other leading Australian violin makers such as Charles Clarke, Guy Aubrey Griffin, William Dolphin, Harry Vatiliotis and his own daughter, Kitty Smith. His presence as a luthier in Australia encouraged the development of local orchestras and violin teaching, as well as foreign virtuoso violinists through giving the confidence to accept Australian concert engagements and subject their precious instruments to long sea-voyages. During World War II when German strings were unavailable, Smith, trading under the trade name 'Paganini', designed and built machines to manufacture strings and fittings locally, rather than requiring import. Smith luthiered at his Roseville workshop, producing between one and six violins a year, and on occasion viola and cello. His total output between 1899 and 1970 was about 250 instruments, with construction details of each being recorded in a series of notebooks. He was a traditionalist, using only well-matured woods such as European maples for the ribs, scrolls and backs of the instruments, and Swiss or Italian pine for the bellies. Smith's ultimate aim was to achieve the same structural perfection as seen in Guarneri and Stradivari violins. He took a musical approach to the science of acoustics. The varnish on each individual instrument was created specifically for each instrument being finished. In 1938, his daughter, Ruth, married Ernest Llewellyn ‚Äì a violinist, violist and conductor who later became the founding director of the Canberra School of Music. Smith's wedding present to Llewellyn was a violin, which he used while concertmaster of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra 1949‚Äì64; it then passed to a later concertmaster, Dene Olding, who also used it in recordings of works such as the violin concertos of Ross Edwards, Samuel Barber, Frank Martin and Darius Milhaud. In 1947, the American violinist Isaac Stern, who was visiting Australia for the first time, attended a performance by the Queensland State String Quartet and was \\"struck by the tonal qualities of the violin being played by the leader\\", Ernest Llewellyn. He subsequently met with Llewellyn, and learned of A. E. Smith. The following morning they swapped instruments and played together. The two would remain friends until Llewellyn's death.W. L. Hoffmann, \\"Lest we forget Isaac Stern\\", Canberra Times, 24 October 2001 ==Reputation and awards== Smith's reputation for an even sound and tonal quality reminiscent of the Cremonese masters attracted the interest not only of leading Australian players but of the world's great violinists, violists and cellists; in addition to Isaac Stern, those who acquired and used A. E. Smith violins included Yehudi Menuhin (whose sister Hephzibah had played the Beethoven sonatas with Ernest Llewellyn), Tossy Spivakovsky,ADB entry for Jascha Spivakovsky, which includes a short biography of Tossy Spivakovsky Ruggiero Ricci, David Oistrakh, Emily Sunand Zlatko Balokoviƒá . In 1949, A. E. Smith was awarded diplomas of honour for both violin and viola at the International Exhibition of Violin Makers at The Hague and next year was the first Australian to be elected to the International Society of Violin and Bow Makers. He suffered a series of strokes from the late 1950s onwards and the workmanship on his later instruments became quite distinctive in terms of detail and chisel work. In 1971 he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his services to music.It's an Honour ==Death== Smith died in Canberra on 16 May 1978 aged 98, predeceased by his wife Kate (n√©e D√®n√®r√®az), formerly Davidson. He was survived by a pianist son, Arthur Denereaz, and his daughters Kitty Smith and Ruth Llewellyn. Kitty succeeded her father as violin maker and manager of A. E. Smith & Co. until its closure in 1972. A grandson Roderick Smith is also a violin maker. ==Instruments== A quartet of A. E.

His violas favored two models: the Brescian Model and the MacDonald Stradivarius model. The Brescian model is larger, with distinctive F-holes. The Macdonald Stradivarius model is easier to play, smaller around the bouts. Smith's later instruments exhibit very individual and personal craftsmanship. Chisel marks which can seem crude to the untrained eye are greatly valued by other makers and collectors. His varnish is considered to be one of the finest in existence and many luthiers agree that it is very close to that of Stradivarius's. ==References * ADB online * Smith‚Äôs Violins * Powerhouse Museum Collection * Founding father * AE Smith instruments at the National Museum of Australia Category:Bowed string instrument makers Category:Australian musical instrument makers Category:Australian Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:1880 births Category:1978 deaths Category:People from Islington (district) Category:English emigrants to Australia Category:Date of birth missing ","title":"A.

E. Christopher is President Emeritus of the Protestant Lutheran Church Society, the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church.The Lutheran World Federation, New President for India's Largest Lutheran Church. Internet, accessed 14 September 2008. ==Early years== Ernest Christopher was born into a pastoral family in Bhimavaram in Andhra Pradesh to Rev. Vardanapu Krupadas and Smt. Bhagyamma. His father, Rev. V. Krupadas was a pastor of the AELC.Prema Sakshi, National Christian Telugu Monthly, August 2006. He had his schooling in Bhimavaram and collegiate education in Rajahmundry. Later, he pursued degree studies in Sri Y. N. College (an NAAC-A grade college affiliated to the Andhra University), Narsapur in West Godavari District. ==Divinity== Like his father, Christopher had an inclination to pursue the ultimate profession of priesthood. His Church society (the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church) readily sponsored him for his priestly studies. The AELC was then headed by Rev. Dr. S. W. Schmitthener. Armed with a sponsorship letter from his Church society, Christopher enrolled for the graduate degree of Bachelor of Theology (B. Th.) offered by the ecumenical Andhra Christian Theological College (affiliated to the Senate of Serampore College (University)), Hyderabad. Later, the Senate of Serampore College (University) under the Registrarship of D. S. Satyaranjan awarded him with a degree. The then Principal of the College was the Cantabrigian Victor Premasagar. With disciplined faculty at ACTC, the young Christopher had a sound priestly formation. He was taught New Testament by Muriel Carder and K. David while Victor Premasagar and G. Babu Rao, taught him Old Testament, the core subjects in any seminary or theological faculty of a University. Christopher was known to be studious and disciplined. ==Ordination & Pastorship== After Christopher's ordination, his Church President, the India-born Rev. Dr. S. W. Schmitthener posted him to East Godavari District to minister in a rural parish. He also served in Lutheran parishes in Rajahmundry and Bhimavaram. ==Higher Studies== Christopher later enrolled for the degree of Bachelor of Divinity (B. D.) at his alma mater, the Andhra Christian Theological College, Hyderabad and upgraded himself to earn a B. D. degree. ==Synod of the AELC== Rev. Christopher was twice elected as the Synod President of the West Godavari Synod, one of the six Synods of the AELC. ==Presidentship== In due course of time, Christopher was elected to the Vice- Presidency of the Church Society. Later on 1 June 2005, he was declared elected as the President of the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Telugu people Category:20th-century Lutheran clergy Category:21st-century Lutheran bishops Category:Indian bishops Category:Andhra University alumni Category:Indian Christian theologians Category:Senate of Serampore College (University) alumni Category:People from West Godavari district ","title":"V.

The resulting panic and crush killed 69 children and injured 40; the final death toll was 71. It is considered one of Scotland's worst human disasters. == Events == The Glen Cinema was opened in 1901; it became known as 'The Glen' and 'The Royal Animated Pictures'. On the afternoon of 31 December 1929, during a children's matinee, a freshly shown film was put in its metal can, in the spool room, where it began to issue thick black smoke. Nitrate film, as used at this time, can burn on its own without needing any supply of air. When an assistant film operator spotted the smoke coming from a film container, he tried to smother the flammable film; but the container sprang open, and smoke and fumes entered the hall. Soon, smoke filled the auditorium that contained about one thousand children.Gardiner p. 4-8 Panic set in. Children ran downstairs so fast and in such numbers that they piled up behind the escape door that led to Dyers Wynd. The door could not be opened, as it was designed to open inwards and was padlocked. The following day, Paisley was stunned by the news that seventy children had died in the crush in the worst cinema disaster in British history. An inquiry was held in Edinburgh on 29 April 1930, during which it was revealed that the cinema had been inspected and pronounced safe by the Paisley fire brigade on the morning of the fire. The owner, James Graham, had, however, agreed that there were insufficient exits, but claimed he had repeatedly reminded the manager, Charles Dorward, that the escape exits were not to be shut during matinee performances. The manager conceded that the exit gates had sometimes been locked to prevent children from entering the cinema without paying. A policeman who arrived on the scene just after the fire started reported that the gates were padlocked; however, another witness confirmed that she had seen Dorward unlock them. It remained unclear as to why the gates had been padlocked. The conclusion of the inquiry was that the fire had been started by a short circuit when a metal box containing film stock had been placed on the top of a battery in the projection room. The tragedy had been made worse by the limited number of exits, insufficient attendants, and overcrowding.http://www.strathclydefire.org/rea/press_archive/Glen%20Cinema%20Report%20Paisley%2031st%20Dec.%201929.pdf The building that housed the Glen Cinema still stands, and currently houses a furniture store. A relief fund for the injured children and bereaved parents raised ¬£5,300: Paisley Town Council offered them a week's holiday at the seaside.Gardiner p. 8 On 31 December 2009, to mark the eightieth anniversary of the tragedy, a memorial service was conducted by Philip Tartaglia, Bishop of Paisley and his associates at the Cenotaph. Survivors congregated to remember the children who lost their lives on 31 December 1929. The wreaths were laid by one of the survivors, Emily Brown, who was five years old at the time of the incident. Since then, the memorial service has become an annual event. == Impact == The cinema manager was put on trial for culpable homicide, but found not guilty. Safety regulations were tightened in the wake of the disaster; many municipal authorities made inspections of cinemas compulsory. The Cinematograph Act 1909 was amended to ensure that cinemas had more exits, that doors opened outwards and that they were fitted with push bars. A limitation was also placed on the seating capacity of cinemas.Gardiner p. 8 == Artefacts == A small display is at Paisley Museum which has some articles on the disaster, a receipt for a funeral, a pair of shoes, and a hat. There are also letters sent to the Provost of Paisley from other civic leaders, in the UK, Europe and from the USA. Some of the more poignant letters are from women who were unable to keep their own children, offering them to the devastated families of Paisley. == See also == * List of disasters of the United Kingdom and preceding states * Victoria Hall disaster == References  External links == * Glen Cinema Website * The Paisley Cinema Disaster Category:Fires in Scotland Category:Theatre fires Category:1929 fires Category:1929 in Scotland Category:History of Renfrewshire Category:Building and structure fires in the United Kingdom Category:Fire disasters involving barricaded escape routes Category:1929 disasters in the United Kingdom Category:December 1929 events Category:Paisley, Renfrewshire Category:Human stampedes in the United Kingdom ","title":"Glen Cinema disaster"},{"id":"19315197","text":"Parallax Error Beheads You is the third studio album by Ben Jacobs under his stage name of Max Tundra.

House at Imus, Cavite Born in Imus, Cavite, on August 27, 1839 to Miguel Topacio, a former gobernadorcillo, and Marta Cuenca, the young Licerio finished his studies in Imus. He was not able to pursue higher education in Manila. But he kept on developing his inborn talent by self- study, and when the Revolution broke out he showed exceptional leadership in battle. Because of the ongoing Lachambre offensive in Magdalo territory, only eight Magdalo leaders were able to attend the Tejeros Convention on March 22, 1897. They were Baldomero Aguinaldo, Daniel Tria Tirona, Felix Cuenca, Cayetano Topacio, Crispulo Aguinaldo, Antonio Montenegro, and an unidentified Magdalo leader. Except for Montenegro and this unidentified leader, they were all members of the Magdalo Council or Government. Licerio Topacio was the eldest of the Magdalo leaders present at the age of 58. In deference to his age, he must have been considered by the group for nomination as president of the Revolutionary Government to be established. But he declined because he was too old (58) and that the presidency needed a younger, stronger man. The next choice was Emilio Aguinaldo, who was absent, defending the strategic Pasong Santol in Dasmari√±as against repeated assaults by Lachambre‚Äôs troops. Aguinaldo was elected president of the Revolutionary Government in absentia. After the Battle of Imus (September 3, 1896) and the Battle of Binakayan (November 9‚Äì11), Aguinaldo‚Äôs prestige as a military leader had risen like a meteor, making him a living legend. It was this image as a living legend, more than anything else that won for Aguinaldo the majority votes in the Magdiwang- dominated Tejeros Convention. Had Licerio Topacio, instead of Aguinaldo, been nominated in the Tejeros Convention, the chances were that he might have been decisely beaten by a younger and more famous man, Andres Bonifacio, the Katipunan Supremo. Of course, with such an outcome ‚Äúhistory would have been taken a different course,\\" as claimed by biographer Gwekoh. There are alternative views about the reasons he did not become head of the movement. One biographer, Sol H. Gwekoh, says that had Topacio not gallantly given way to a young man, Emilio Aguinaldo, he would have been the leader of the Philippine Revolution. Another biographer, Benjamin M. Bolivar, claims that Topacio ‚Äúdeclined the honor‚Äù when Aguinaldo offered him the leadership of the Revolution. After the Philippine-American War Topacio was twice appointed as municipal president of Imus. He died on April 19, 1925 at the age of 86. ==See also== * Sol H.

His father Aftab Ahmed Rana was a local politician for the Norwegian Labour Party, and a leader of an Islamic congregation (named \\"Islamsk Senter\\") in Vestfold. ==Career== Rana enrolled at the University of Oslo to attend medical school. In 2005 he became the leader of the Norwegian-Pakistani Students' Association (Norsk-pakistansk studentersamfunn). In 2007, Rana became the leader of the Muslim Students' Association at the University of Oslo. He is a columnist for Aftenposten ‚Äì the largest newspaper in Norway ‚Äì and is a commentator on Islam, extremism, and secularism. Rana helped organize humanitarian aid to the victims of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. He participated in debates on national television and was interviewed by newspapers on issues pertaining to immigration, integration, Islamism, internal strife in Norwegian Muslim groups. ===Norwegian Islam=== Rana emphasizes the importance of contextualization of Islam in Scandinavia and creating a Norwegian-Muslim identity, which is truthful to the Islamic texts and also to the Scandinavian context. Rana has written extensively on these topics. He is currently writing a book which is titled \\"The idea of Norwegian Islam\\". He recommends that future Norwegian imams must be trained at institutions in the West, he said in an interview with the Norwegian MorgenBladet: \\"It is tempting to believe that imams who are educated in the West will have greater understanding of what it means to be a Muslim in Western societies.\\" ===Essay contest victory=== In early 2008, Rana won an essay contest initiated by the newspaper Aftenposten. The idea of the contest is to broadcast voices of young people in Norway. In his winning text, titled \\"The Secular Extremism\\" (), Rana argued that religious debaters were driven away from the Norwegian public sphere, due to a perceived degradation of views based on religion. He used the case of then-bishop-elect of Oslo Ole Christian Kvarme as an example, claiming that Kvarme was exposed to the \\"pillory of modern society\\" when commentators largely denounced his Conservative Christian views. Rana warned against a perceived intolerance of religious practice, citing France and Turkey as bad examples due to the Islamic dress controversy in those countries and portrayed the US as the remarkable illustration of a moderate secular nation which allows and includes religious expressions. Muhammad cartoons Regarding the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons, Norwegian flags were burned in the Middle East. Rana said that \\"the burning of the Norwegian flag, all because a small number of Christian extremists published pictures of the Prophet, is unfair\\", according to the Verdens Gang. He was accused by Hege Storhaug, of \\"exploiting\\" the situation to promote illiberal attitudes towards perceived blasphemous expressions. The day before Rana had described Storhaug as \\"extremely xenophobic\\", \\"paranoid\\", adherent of racism and an \\"extremist\\" who \\"hates Islam\\", in Verdens Gang. He then countered that Storhaug's allegations were untrue. When one of the cartoons were reprinted in a Norwegian magazine in September 2008, Rana described it as \\"vulgar\\", \\"unnecessary and desperate\\". \\"Criticism of Islam is important, but there are other and better ways to do it\\", Rana commented. ==References * *(Rana opining about President Musharraf of Pakistan: )\\"Helt eller diktator?\\", Dagbladet Magasinet, 2006-01-24 * * * Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Norwegian people of Pakistani descent Category:Norwegian Sunni Muslims Category:People from T√∏nsberg Category:University of Oslo alumni Category:Punjabi people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Mohammad Usman Rana"},{"id":"19315214","text":"WKWX (93.5 FM, \\"93 WKWX\\") is a radio station licensed to serve Savannah, Tennessee, United States.

On 11 October 1724 he was consecrated bishop of Chichester in succession to Thomas Bowers. He found the Episcopal palace in a ruinous condition, and refitted it at his own charge. In 1730 he entered into a controversy with Nathaniel Lardner on the prosecution of Thomas Woolston for writing against the reality of Christ's miracles. Lardner's plea for freedom of statement did not meet with Waddington's approval, and several letters on the subject passed between them.Kippis, Life of Lardner, pp. 15-18) ==Family life== Waddington died without issue at Chichester on 8 September 1731,Noble, Mark A biographical history of England, from the Revolution to the end of George i's reign; a continuation of the rev. J. Granger's work iii. 92; and was buried in the cathedral. He was a liberal benefactor to Eton College, to which he left his library. He was married, on 20 June 1699, to Frances, daughter of Jonathan Newey of Worcestershire. She died on 5 September 1728. Most of Waddington's wealth descended to his nieces,PROB 11/647 Will of Edward Waddington Bishop of Chichester one of whom, Elizabeth Price, in 1731 made a runaway match with Isaac Maddox at one time his chaplain, and afterwards bishop of Worcester. Waddington was the author of several published sermons. His portrait was painted by Hamlet Winstanley, and was engraved by John Faber the younger (reproduced above). ==ReferencesAttribution=== This entry cites: ** Addit.

He races with a Venezuelan license but holds both German and Venezuelan nationality. He is the son of former racing driver and motorcycle world champion Johnny Cecotto. == Career == Cecotto driving for Ocean Racing Technology at the Monza round of the 2011 GP2 Series season. === Early career === He began his racing career in kart racing, then progressing to open wheel single seater racing. He competed in Formula BMW ADAC in 2005. In 2006 he raced in the German Formula Three Championship, taking one victory, and also in the Formula Renault 2.0 Northern European Cup. In 2007 he raced in the International Formula Master series, finishing eighth with three podiums. He returned to the German F3 Championship, finishing in third with two victories. In 2009 he raced in the Formula Three Euroseries for the HBR Motorsport team, before the team missed races at Brands Hatch. He then signed a deal to compete in the GP2 Series, partnering Michael Herck at David Price Racing. === GP2 === He joined up with Trident Racing for the 2009‚Äì10 GP2 Asia Series season, but was replaced by Dani Clos after the first round. He returned to Trident for the 2010 Main Series and scored his first championship points at Monaco, but was replaced by Edoardo Piscopo after sixteen races. Cecotto moved to Super Nova Racing for the 2011 GP2 Asia Series season alongside Fairuz Fauzy, and finished fifteenth in the drivers' championship. For the main series season, he switched to the Ocean Racing Technology team and was partnered with Kevin Mirocha and later Brendon Hartley, finishing 24th in the championship. He switched to the Addax team for the 2012 season, alongside Josef Kr√°l. After a difficult start to the season, he suddenly hit form at Monaco, taking his first pole position and race victory in the category. He also won the feature race at Hockenheim after his decision to start with dry tyres on a wet but drying track paid off. Despite also posting seven retirements, the season was comfortably Cecotto's best in the series, finishing ninth in the championship as a result. In 2013 lacked the pace he had shown in the previous year and struggled with no podiums. However he was once again quick in Monaco taking pole for the feature race, but he caused a first corner multi-car pile-up leaving him out of the race and banned from the following day's sprint race for causing the collision. Despite this he had his most consistent GP2 season with 10 points finishes ending with 41 points. He returned to Trident for 2014, he scored two victories and three further podium finishes but struggled in the latter stages, he would go on to finish a career-best 5th in the championship. === Formula One === Cecotto was confirmed as one of the Force India team drivers to participate in the young driver test held in Yas Marina Circuit, after the 2011 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. In 2012, Cecotto took part in the young driver test again, this time with Toro Rosso. === Formula V8 3.5 Series === In 2016 Cecotto moved to the Formula V8 3.5 Series with RP Motorsport. He won his first race of the season at the Hungaroring. However, after the round at Spa- Francorchamps he split with his team and was left without a ride. == Racing record  Career summary === {  style=\\"font-size: 90%; text-align:center\\" ! Season !

Sweden has produced five World Champions and the Sweden national speedway team have been World Cup winners on ten occasions. Speedway is one of the most popular motorsports in the country. ==History== The Swedish speedway league was founded in 1948 and was inspired by British speedway including adopting British teams nicknames in Swedish versions. As popularity of the sport grew many new clubs were founded all around Sweden and during the 1950s and over 30 different clubs have competed in at least one season in the league system. ==League competitions== There are three leagues in Sweden: *Elite League (Elitserien) *National League (Allsvenskan) *Division One Speedway meetings in Sweden are normally held between May and September. Swedish teams are generally known by nicknames rather than club or city names. These nicknames usually have some sort of local connection. The Elite League was established in 1982 and has ten teams with meetings usually held on Tuesday evenings. At the end of each season the top four teams ride in the play-offs in semi-finals and a final and the winner of the final are the Elite League champions. The team finishing bottom are relegated to the National league. The National league has seven teams and before the introduction of the Elite league in 1982 was the top flight speedway league in Sweden. Meetings are held usually on Thursday evenings. As with the National league, the top four teams at the end of each season compete in the play-offs in semi-finals and a final. The winner of the final are the National League champions and are promoted to the National league. Division One is the third tier of Swedish speedway with seven teams. Meetings are usually held on Thursdays. The team finishing the season in first place can apply for promotion to the National league, which is subject to having suitable facilities and sufficient finances. No teams are relegated as membership of the league is by application. ==Other competitions== The Swedish Individual Championship is for Swedish riders only. The riders are usually selected on the basis of their averages, with four riders being seeded directly to the final round. Another 36 riders are drawn into two semi-final rounds, with the four lowest ranked riders in each competing in the pre-meeting runoffs. The top nine riders in each semi-final progress to the final which is run using a modified Grand Prix format with 20 heats. The winner of the final is awarded a gold medal and becomes the Swedish Individual Champion. Riders finishing second and third are awarded silver and bronze medals. The Swedish Junior Individual Championship is for Swedish riders aged 21 years and under. Thirty six riders are drawn into two semi- final arounds with the four lowest-ranked riders in each competing in the pre- meeting runoffs. The top seven riders in each semi-final progress to the final round, with the next two riders qualifying for the pre-meeting runoff. The winner of the final is awarded a gold medal and becomes Swedish Junior Individual Champion. Riders finishing second and third are awarded silver and bronze medals respectively. ==See also== *List of speedway teams in Sweden *Speedway Grand Prix of Sweden in Eskilstuna *Speedway Grand Prix of Scandinavia in M√•lilla ==References== ","title":"Speedway in Sweden"},{"id":"19315491","text":"OkrƒÖglak roundhouse in Pi≈Ça The OkrƒÖglak roundhouse in Pi≈Ça, Poland, dates from the period 1870‚Äì1874, and is related to intensive development of railways in Prussia.

Once part of a complex of nineteenth century philanthropic institutions sited alongside a Congregational chapel, it is all that now remains of the original design. It is located at the corner of Westminster Bridge Road and Kennington Road close to Waterloo station and Lambeth North tube station in London, and is today a listed building associated with, and close to, Christ Church and Upton Chapel. ==Origins== Lincoln Memorial Tower The Lincoln Tower is built on the site of an orphanage for females, founded in 1758. When the orphanage closed in the mid nineteenth century, its site was acquired by trustees of the Surrey Chapel on nearby Blackfriars Road, whose own chapel lease was due to expire. This larger site provided them with ample opportunity to fund-raise not only for a new Congregational chapel which they named Christ Church, but also for a large complex of ancillary buildings. The pastor of Surrey Chapel at the time was the energetic Christopher Newman Hall who had lectured and written extensively in support of Abraham Lincoln and abolition of slavery during the American Civil War. He raised funds in America for a permanent International Memorial in London, to Abraham Lincoln, and incorporated this into plans for redevelopment of the former orphanage site. The Lincoln Tower was opened on 4 July 1876, the centenary of American independence. The foundation stone had been laid two years earlier, on 9 July 1874, by the American ambassador, His Excellency General Schenk. The two main rooms in the tower were named the Washington and the Wilberforce rooms. ==Architecture and design== The original design by the architect E.C.Robins, developed in 1873, would have placed the tower and spire as an elevated structure above the centre of the new Congregational chapel. This was adapted in the final scheme by architects Paull and Bickerdike, who kept much of the original design and detailing of the building complex as a whole, but gave greater prominence to the Lincoln Tower. This became a stand-alone building with its own ground floor and entrances, though still integral to the complex. As more memorial funds were raised, the new architects, like E.C.Robins before them, added a lofty spire; raising the tower 200 feet high. The spectacular spire incorporated E.C.Robins' concept for an architectural version of 'stars and stripes' - the use of a polychromatic colour scheme of red and white stones. On the Tower's north entrance, above the apex of a large archway, a stone was added bearing the title Lincoln Tower. Under the paved basement the coffin of preacher Rowland Hill was re-located from Surrey Chapel, with a tablet inset into the interior wall above. There was another tablet in memory of his successor, James Sherman, with a still larger tablet giving the name and purpose of the tower ‚Äì to commemorate emancipation by the martyred Lincoln, the contribution of half the cost of the tower by American citizens, and as a pledge of international brotherhood. The completed tower, built of Kentish Rag stone outside and Bath stone within, and modelled on a Gothic style, was widely regarded at the time as one of the best examples of steeple and tower architecture in south-central London. ==Modern context== The Lincoln Tower within its contemporary setting ‚Äì a modern office block and integral Christ Church & Upton Chapel Much of the Christ Church complex was destroyed in the Second World War, although the Lincoln Tower survived. In the 1950s a large commercial office block, with an integral Congregational and Baptist chapel and community office space, was planned where the nineteenth century Christ Church Congregational chapel and its school and meeting rooms (Hawkstone Hall) had stood. Today, the complex, with its integral Christ Church and Upton Chapel form a modernist backdrop to the surviving Gothic Revival tower. The Lincoln Tower, as well as the chapel and adjoining community office space, are presently owned by United Reformed Church (as successors to the Congregationalists) and Baptists, and managed by Oasis Church Waterloo, part of the Oasis Trust charity. The chapel is also open as a cafe. ==See also== *Lincoln Memorial *Abraham Lincoln Memorial Garden *Abney Park Cemetery ==References * Lincoln Tower, Kennington Road, Lambeth North * Oasis Church Waterloo Category:Churches completed in 1876 Category:Towers completed in 1876 Category:Chapels in England Category:Churches in the London Borough of Lambeth Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Lambeth Category:Congregationalism Category:Grade II listed churches in London Category:Monuments and memorials to Abraham Lincoln Category:Buildings and monuments honouring American Presidents in the United Kingdom ","title":"Lincoln Memorial Tower"},{"id":"19315627","text":"Bradford Adolphus Street railway station is a closed station in the city of Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. ==History== When the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway (later absorbed by the Great Northern) arrived in Bradford they initially built a terminus at Adolphus Street.

Known by the common name of the rufous milkcap, or the red hot milk cap in North America. It is dark brick red in color, and grows with pine or birch trees. ==Taxonomy== Described originally by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, and later by the Swedish father of modern mycology Elias Magnus Fries. The specific epithet rufus is a reference to its colour. ==Description== The cap is up to in diameter. It is dark brick, bay, or red-brown. At first it is convex, and often has a small central boss (umbo), but later flattens, eventually acquiring a shallow central depression. The surface is dry and matt. The concolorous, but paler stem often becomes hollow with age. The gills are slightly decurrent, cream, becoming coloured as the cap later, only paler. The spore print is creamy white, with a slight salmon tinge. The flesh is white, as is the milk, which tastes mild initially, gradually becoming very hot, and acrid after a minute or so. ==Distribution and habitat== Lactarius rufus appears from late spring to late autumn. It is frequent in the northern temperate zones in Europe and North America. It is most commonly found with pine trees, but can also appear with birch, or spruce. It is common in northern California, and the Pacific Northwest from late summer to early winter. ==Edibility== Lactarius rufus is generally not recommended for consumption. Google Books Google Books However, it is used in some places as a condiment after special treatment, and mycologist David Arora notes that it is eaten in Scandinavian countries after canning, and also mentions that there may be edibility differences in North American and European versions of the mushroom. It is one of the most common wild mushrooms harvested for food in Finland. Some authors, however, consider it poisonous. In order to eat these mushrooms, you will have to cook them approximately 10 minutes in plenty of water. After this, you can either preserve them in vinegar or salt water or freeze them lightly salted. These mushrooms make a great salad, with mayonnaise, cream and onions. Be careful when tasting for identification purposes, and only take a tiny piece. The delayed action effect masks an extremely hot mushroom. ==See also== *List of Lactarius species ==References rufus Category:Fungi of North America Category:Fungi of Europe ","title":"Lactarius rufus"},{"id":"19315652","text":"Francis Harvey (1873‚Äì1916) was an officer of the British Royal Marine Light Infantry during the First World War.

The station was the location of a three-way junction with platforms on two of the lines. ==History== Passenger train passing St Dunstans station around 1960 When the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway (later absorbed by the Great Northern) arrived in Bradford they initially built a terminus at Adolphus Street. This was poorly situated, so a link line was built from east of the terminus looping south and joining the existing Lancashire and Yorkshire line at Mill Lane junction, allowing LB & HJ services to enter the station. When the Queensbury Lines were constructed they entered Bradford from the west and passed under the L&YR; line south of Mill Lane junction. They then formed a Y junction with the GN link line, just to the east of Mill Lane junction. St. Dunstans was built in this location as a transfer station so that passengers travelling east / west could change trains without entering Bradford Exchange. The junction had opened in 1876 for goods traffic, two years before the passenger station was opened in November 1878. A third line, connecting with the Queensbury Lines, ran along the south of the station, but it was not given platforms. The triangle was used to turn whole trains (steam locomotives and coaches) to enable them to run boiler first from railway station. This practice continued until 1972 (when the lines were closed through St Dunstans) if a DMU needed turning, usually because it could not be driven from one end. With the run down in Queensbury services patronage of the station fell and it closed in 1952. The triangle of lines at St Dunstans were still in operation up until August 1972, when the City Road Goods Branch was closed. The branch veered off the old line to Thornton at railway station and usually consisted of coal being forwarded from Laisterdyke goods yard. ==Name== The station was located in the Bowling/Ripleyville area of Bradford, but took its name from a local manufacturing works called St. Dunstans. The station nameboards and the associated signal box, were labelled as St Dunstans, though several writers, and the Bradshaws Timetable, have labelled the station as St Dunstan's (with the apostrophe) and some with both. ==Services== Even though the route through the Aire Valley was flatter and easier to run trains over as opposed to the Queensbury Lines, the Great Northern offered passengers from Keighley a faster service to London in the 1880s by running a service from Keighley to St Dunstans, which connected with the GN service to London from Bradford Exchange station. In the 1887 timetable, at least one passenger train per day between Laisterdyke and Queensbury used the southern part of the junction that did not have platforms. The Bradshaws Timetable for 1906 shows St Dunstans having five services for the Shipley and Windhill Line, and 25 through services to Wakefield either direct via Morley, or taking the route via Batley and Dewsbury. In 1910, 20 services plied the route between Bradford and Queensbury, though not all trains stopped at St Dunstans. In 1947, the LNER timetable shows St Dunstans had 14 departures westwards towards Queensbury, with most travelling to Halifax railway station and the rest going to Keighley. ==ReferencesSources=== * Category:Disused railway stations in Bradford Category:Former Great Northern Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1878 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1952 ","title":"St Dunstans railway station"},{"id":"19315666","text":"Mohammad Hassan \\"Homa\\" Mohebbi (, born 6 September 1956) is an Iranian light heavyweight freestyle wrestler from Kermanshah.

The family broke into two factions: the Bonanno faction and DiGregorio-Sciacca faction. On January 28, 1966, an attempt was made on the life of Salvatore \\"Bill\\" Bonanno, the son of Joseph Bonanno. The Bonanno's suspected Paul Sciacca and his crew, who were loyal to Gaspar DiGregorio. The newspapers began calling the Bonanno family war the \\"Bananas War\\". The shooting war began in May 1966 with what became known as \\"The Troutman St. Ambush\\", where Bill Bonanno and three of his associates were lured to an alleged peace meeting and then ambushed from doorways, windows and rooftops along Troutman Street, but Bonanno and his associates escaped unharmed. Paul Sciacca and underling Frank Mari were suspected of masterminding the botched hit, but boss Gaspar DiGregorio was blamed for the bad publicity and added police scrutiny that surrounded the shooting. After Joe Bonanno was deposed by the Commission in late 1964, DiGregorio was named boss by early 1965, he made Pietro \\"Skinny Pete\\" Crociata the new underboss and Nicolino \\"Nick\\" Alfano the new consigliere. By 1966, the Commission lost faith in DiGregorio's ability to lead the crime family, and Sciacca became the acting boss. The \\"Bananas War\\" raged throughout the second half of the 1960s with Sciacca and his top lieutenant, Frank Mari leading the dissident faction of soldiers and shooters against the Bonanno loyalists. Less than a dozen men were killed during the war, but many low level soldiers and men on both sides were beaten, shot and injured, Sciacca was himself the victim of an attempt on his life. The war should have ended when deposed boss Joe Bonanno suffered a heart attack in 1968 and promised to retire to leave New York for his home in Tucson, Arizona, where he would retire comfortably with a handful of loyal underlings at his side. Also, by 1968, Bonanno successor DiGregorio was in ill health and stepped down as boss and retired, dying only two years later. The Commission sanctioned acting boss Paul Sciacca as the new boss of the Bonanno crime family. Sciacca promoted, who he thought to be a loyal underling, Frank Mari to be his new underboss, while another Sciacca underling, Michael \\"Mike\\" Adamo was promoted to consigliere. Unknown to boss Sciacca, soon after their promotions, Mari and Adamo began to plot against him and planned to remove him from power and possibly eliminate him all together, but their plans were revealed and on the night of September 18, 1968 both men disappeared, never to be heard from again. Bonanno soldier and former Mari underling Philip \\"Rusty\\" Rastelli, a former Bonanno loyalist, who switched allegiance to the DiGregoiro-Sciacca side at the start of the war became a top suspect in the case for New York City police, having also been a top suspect in the Troutman Street ambush. Rastelli, who was promoted to caporegime of the old Mari crew, was never charged in connection with either the ambush or the disappearance, but he was promoted once again to consigliere by boss Paul Sciacca immediately following the disappearance of Adamo, while former Bonanno loyalist Natale \\"Joe Diamonds\\" Evola was promoted to underboss in place of Mari. == The new boss == Due to the \\"Bananas War\\", in 1968, The Commission forced DiGregorio to retire and officially promoted Sciacca to boss. He became boss of a much weakened crime family as rivalries and internal dissension continued between the former DiGregorio-Sciacca faction and the remaining Bonanno loyalists. Hostilities continued within the Bonanno crime family into 1969, the last known Bonanno crime family member to be killed was soldier Thomas Zummo, a former DiGregorio-Sciacca faction member, who was shot dead on May 6, 1969. With the removal of disloyal underlings Mari and Adamo, Bonanno boss Paul Sciacca attempted to unite his crime family once again by promoting the leaders of the two most influential factions outside his own. Longtime family member and former Bonanno loyalist Natale Evola was leader of what remained of the former Bonanno faction, while Phil Rastelli had gained a great deal of influence with the younger, up and coming members of the crime family and was now the leader of the \\"young turks\\" faction. By promoting Evola to underboss and Rastelli to consigliere, Sciacca hoped to align the Bonanno crime family and bring it back to the level of power and influence within the New York Mafia it once occupied. In terms of numbers the Bonanno crime family had always been one of the smaller of the Five Families, but it was also one of the most cohesive and well structured crime families because most of its administration was family members related by blood or marriage. Sciacca hoped to at least mend the broken ties among members and re-align the three most influential factions within the Bonanno crime family, effectively removing the last of the rivalries and hostilities that were still present, creating cohesion and stability. On May 13, 1971, Sciacca was indicted in Mineola, New York, on charges of selling $100,000 worth of heroin. The charge was later dismissed. Sciacca died on August 27, 1986 of natural causes at the age of 77. ==References== Category:Bonanno crime family Category:Bosses of the Bonanno crime family Category:American mob bosses Category:American mobsters of Italian descent Category:1909 births Category:1986 deaths ","title":"Paul Sciacca"},{"id":"19315668","text":"Taleb Moussa (born 1 July 1978) is an Emirati chess player.

Shows part of the pond and the observation tower. Toa Payoh Town Park is located at the junction of Lorong 2 Toa Payoh and Lorong 6 Toa Payoh. Park size is 4.8 hectares. ==History== The park, previously known as Toa Payoh Town Garden, was completed in 1973. Its main features are an observation tower and a landscaped pond with willowing trees. In the seventies, the town garden was a favored venue for outdoor wedding photography. It was popular with visitors who came from near and far to enjoy the display of willows, bamboos and the brilliant reds and yellows of the Delonix regia trees. At the heart of the garden is a 0.8 ha pond which contains a small waterfall and a cluster of artificial islands linked by bridges. Fishes and tortoises populate the pond, and the islands are arranged to provide a sequence of delightful walking experiences. The observation tower is now not open to the public and there has been no plans announced by the National Parks Board to reopen it (as of 1 September 2011). There is a fountain pool installed around the tower. The Toa Payoh Town Garden was partially closed in 1999 to make way for a temporary bus interchange. After the new Toa Payoh Bus Interchange at the HDB Hub was completed in June 2002, the temporary bus interchange was converted to a landscaped park. Toa Payoh Town Garden was subsequently renamed Toa Payoh Town Park. ==Visitor Info== Toa Payoh Town Park is located directly opposite the HDB Hub, Toa Payoh Bus Interchange and Toa Payoh MRT station. The park has limited parking space, which is only available to patrons of the Chinese restaurant operating inside the park. The park has no gates and is open to the public at all times. It is equipped with open-concept restrooms, a large pavilion with a stage for organised activities, gazebos, foot reflexology footpaths and a jogging path. The Chinese restaurant operating inside the park specializes in Taiwan porridge (congee), and is located in a building beside the pond. Near this building is an overhead bridge that connects Toa Payoh Town Park to Jalan Rajah. ==See also== *List of Parks in Singapore == References  *National Parks Board, Singapore *Toa Payoh Town Park Category:Parks in Singapore ","title":"Toa Payoh Town Park"},{"id":"19315766","text":"Videocracy is the power of the image over society. ==Examples== \\"Voter- generated-content\\", such as videos on YouTube, have been identified as examples of a developing videocracy.

The monastery complex was built in the limestone rock massif on the northern side of the river, on some 25 metres height, using shallow natural caves and rock sheds, with additionally hewn premises and niches with religious and every-day purposes. The monastery is reached by a steep and narrow sandy pathway in the beginning of which was constructed a water tap, known as Haiduk cheshma. Being easily accessible, in later times the cave monastery was used by shepherds and stone-cutters as a shelter, and robbed and vandalized by treasure-hunters. Albotin monastery was active in the 14th century according to the account of the preserved fragments of frescoes and inscriptions, as well as adornments (earrings, tabs, bracelets) found in the 29 discovered Christian graves. The large number of burials of laity among the clergymen is an evidence that the monastery was a reputable sanctuary and a desired place for the eternal peace of its donors. Among the scarce historic records, it is noteworthy the mentioning of the nowadays non-existent village Altovin in a registry of Vidin kaaza (district) from year 1560. \\"–ê–ª–±–æ—Ç–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏ —Å–∫–∞–ª–µ–Ω –º–∞–Ω–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ä‚Äú, –ô–µ—Ä–æ–º–æ–Ω–∞—Ö –°–∏–æ–Ω–∏–π (\\"Albotin rock monastery\\", article by Hieromonk Sioniy) The monastery complex consists of eight premises in a row, with the church located in the middle sector, in the most concave part of the rock massif curve. The church contains three naves and is oriented according to the canon from west to east, its southern and southwestern parts being fully devastated. The presence of a baptisterium bespeaks of the temple being used not only for monastic praying but also for public liturgies. In the north-western of the monastery, there is a second floor, containing the second largest premise of the monastery, which was presumably used for a refectory. Other premises were located in the western part of the monastery : the monks cells, kitchen, cellar, store-rooms. Information about the monastery in web-portal vidin-online.com Two water tanks can also be seen. The name of the monastery church is unknown, but there are suppositions that it was devoted to the Resurrection of Jesus, due to the preserved old tradition of playing chain dances (horo) in the memory of the deceased on the second day of Easter. This custom is widely observed by Vlachs who hang the portraits of their dead relatives on the branches of a venerable tree in the meadow under the monastery. Each of the chain dances played before noon-time is devoted to a separate dead man, and the afternoon dances are devoted to the living people. Bulgarians and Vlachs pick up dictamnus and hand out a sprig per each deceased relative. \\"–ó–∞ –ø—Ä–∞–∑–Ω–∏—á–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–∞ –Ω–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏ –∏ –≤–ª–∞—Å–∏‚Äú, –†–∞—á–∫–æ –ü–æ–ø–æ–≤, —Å–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ \\"–ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞ –µ—Ç–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è‚Äú, –∏–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ –ï—Ç–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ—Å–∫–∏ –∏–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç —Å –º—É–∑–µ–π –ø—Ä–∏ –ë–ê–ù, –∫–Ω.5, 1995 –≥.

He was also the last surviving child of Dickens. ==Early life== Baptized in the church of St. Mary Marylebone in London on 21 April 1849,Dickens genealogy Henry Fielding Dickens was named after Henry Fielding, one of his father's favourite authors. His father had originally thought to name him after Oliver Goldsmith, but thinking that his son would constantly be teased as \\"Oliver asking for more\\", he changed his mind.Dickens, Henry Fielding 'The Recollections of Sir Henry Fielding Dickens, K.C.' Published by William Heinemann Ltd (1934) pg xviii His family nicknames were 'H', 'Mr Harry', and 'Mr H'. While a boy living at Gads Hill Place, his father's country home, he, with his brother Edward, started the 'Gad's Hill Gazette', a family newspaper printed on a small printing press given to him by Mr Wills, the sub-editor of All the Year Round. His father, Charles Dickens, and H F Chorley were contributors.Recollections pg 22A Dickens Chronology Dickens was educated at Wimbledon School at Wimbledon and at Mr Gibson's boarding school in Boulogne-sur-Mer, along with his brothers Alfred and Sydney.'Recollections' pg 11 He became the only one of Dickens's seven sons to attend university. ==Legal career== He attended Trinity Hall, Cambridge from 1868, graduating BA in Mathematics (29th Wrangler) in 1872 before studying Law at the university. Of that period at Cambridge, Dickens later wrote: > \\"Looking back now upon the years that are gone, I find that there are one or > two scenes or incidents which arise with astonishing vividness to my mind > that may be worth recording...I hope it will not be thought that I tell this > story vaingloriously, as it was but a small matter so far as I was > concerned. Nothing is farther from my thoughts.

Thus it > came about that, though his children knew he was devotedly attached to them, > there was still a kind of reserve on his part which seemed occasionally to > come as a cloud between us and which I never quite understood.\\" 'Spy in Vanity Fair in 1897 > \\"In the year 1869, after I had been at college about a year, I was fortunate > enough to gain one of the principal scholarships at Trinity Hall, Cambridge > ‚Äì not a great thing, only 50 pounds a year; but I knew that this success, > slight as it was, would give him intense pleasure, so I went to meet him at > Higham Station upon his arrival from London to tell him of it.

In 1899 he became a Bencher of the Inner Temple. Sir Henry's best recalled case was his defence of Kitty Byron for the murder of her lover in 1902. Although she was convicted, Dickens's defence was so spirited that she was given a reduced prison sentence due to public petition. For some years he was the Recorder for Deal and Maidstone in Kent. His interests included fencing, and he was the first President of the Chatham Yachting Club. He succeeded Sir Frederick Albert Bosanquet as Common Serjeant of London in November 1917,'Recollections' pg 276 an ancient office first recorded in 1291 with the appointment of Thomas Juvenal, and the second most senior judicial position at the Old Bailey after the Recorder of London. As Common Serjeant Dickens judged criminal trials at the Old Bailey for over 15 years, retiring on 18 October 1932.'Recollections' pg 366 He was succeeded by Cecil Whiteley KC. On one occasion Dickens was judging a case when the male prisoner interrupted him by saying \\"You ain't a patch on your father.\\" \\"I quite agree with you. What do you know of my father?\\" Dickens replied. The prisoner, who had spent most of his life in prison, answered \\"Well, I have read some in prison.\\" \\"Have you?\\", Dickens replied, \\"That's capital; for you will now have eighteen months in which to resume your studies.\\"Recollections pg 280 He repeatedly refused nominations for election to Parliament, believing it would adversely affect his legal practice.Today in History ==Later years== At family Christmas gatherings at his home at 8 Mulberry Walk in London he performed imitations of his father giving his famous \\"Readings\\", during which he would wear a geranium, his father's favourite flower, and lean on the same velvet- covered reading stand used by Charles Dickens during his reading tours. He had listened to his father many times, and older members of his audience said Henry Dickens's performances were amazingly like those given by his father. To celebrate his eightieth birthday in 1929 he went through the whole of A Christmas Carol without a hitch, his false teeth loosening at the melodramatic sections: 'I know him ‚Äì Marley's ghosht!'.Dickens, Monica An Open Book, Mayflower Books/Heinemann (1978) pg 14 From October 1914 he performed the recitals of his father's works in support of the Red Cross Society. These included excerpts from David Copperfield, A Christmas Carol, The Chimes, and The Cricket on the Hearth. Through his efforts he raised ¬£1,200 for the Society.'Recollections' pg 301 He was a Life President of the Dickens Fellowship. ==Personal life== Sir Henry Dickens, KC, as Common Serjeant of London Henry 'Harry' Dickens married Marie Roche (1852‚Äì1940), the daughter of Monsieur Antonin Roche, and the granddaughter of Czech Jewish composer and piano virtuoso Ignaz Moscheles, on 25 October 1876, in Portman Square in London; they had four sons and three daughters together. Within the Dickens family the couple were known as 'The Guvnor' and 'The Mater'. Their son Philip Charles Dickens is buried beside them in Putney Vale Cemetery in London, while a second son, Henry Charles Dickens, was the father of the author Monica Dickens. Henry Charles was a long serving member of Kensington Council in London where he was very active in improving housing in the poorer part of the borough after World War II; a block of flats in North Kensington is named after him. On his retirement when the borough was amalgamated with Chelsea in 1955 he was created an honorary Freeman. A third son, Cedric 'Ceddy' Dickens, fell in action at the Battle of the Somme in World War I. Dickens was also the father of Admiral Sir Gerald Charles Dickens and the grandfather of Cedric Charles Dickens, an author and the steward of Charles Dickens's literary legacy. He is the great-grandfather of actor and performer Gerald Dickens and the great-great-grandfather of biographer and writer Lucinda Hawksley and actor Harry Lloyd. Dickens was appointed a Knight Bachelor in 1922, and retired in August 1932. He died at St. Luke's Hospital, Chelsea in 1933, five days after being hit by a motorcycle while crossing Chelsea Embankment at his usual place and by his usual method of warning motorists by holding up his walking stick and stepping out into the road.'Time Magazine' January 1, 1934Dickens, Monica pg 99 He was the last surviving child of Charles Dickens.

Hammarsten's parents were opposed to her becoming an artist, and as a girl she had considered a career as a surgeon. Hammarsten went through 8 years of primary school, and then studied at Stockholm University between 1901 and 1905. She began to work as a drawing teacher at a Stockholm girls' school. It was during a study trip to Paris in 1910 that Hammarsten met and fell in love with the 24-year-old Finnish sculptor, Viktor Jansson. In 1913 they were married and they lived in Paris for a year before moving to Finland in 1914. A daughter was born to the couple shortly thereafter, and Hammarsten-Jansson resumed work as an illustrator. In 1924, Hammarsten-Jansson became a draughtsperson for the Bank of Finland. Here, between 1929 and 1962, Hammarsten-Jansson designed over 200 stamps. The couple had three children in total: Tove Jansson, Lars Jansson and Per Olov Jansson. Born to artistic parents, the children grew up in a Bohemian lifestyle, and all became artists in their own right. Tove became a writer and painter and would gain particular fame for her Moomin series. Lars became a cartoonist, ultimately becoming responsible for the Moomin comic strips as well as a later animated version. Per Olov became a photographer and collaborated with Tove on a few books. The children were directly influenced by their mother's artistic sensibilities and Tove in particular retained a close connection, only leaving the house at age 28. Tove has written that she felt her mother understood her better than anyone else and even toward the end of her life, Tove \\"always tried to resemble [her] Mother, always tried to draw like [her] Mother.\\" In 1928, at age 14, Tove noted that \\"Mother has important drawing work. (...) I am waiting for the time when I will be able to help her with her drawings. Mother does so much work by herself.\\" Hammarsten-Jansson's death in 1970 profoundly impacted her daughter's writing and it has been suggested that her presence is strongly felt in a number of the books Tove wrote after the death. The melancholic Sent i November (1970) deals themes of leaving and loneliness, and is typically considered the most mature of the Moomin series. Sommarboken (1972) concerns a young girl whose mother has died and her relationship with her grandmother. Hammarsten-Jansson's death marked the end of the Moomin series of novels and Jansson's literary output became primarily adult-oriented. ==References== Category:1882 births Category:1970 deaths Category:People from √Ötvidaberg Municipality Category:Swedish illustrators Category:Moomin series Category:Swedish women illustrators Category:Swedish children's book illustrators Category:Philately of Finland Category:Swedish emigrants to Finland ","title":"Signe Hammarsten-Jansson"},{"id":"19315902","text":"Florida Amendment 2 is an amendment made to the Constitution of Florida in 2008. It added Article I, Section 27 to the constitution, which defines marriage as a union only between one man and one woman, and thus bans the creation of similar unions, such as civil unions or same-sex marriage. Since 2014, the measure has been litigated in court and has been struck down by multiple state courts so far in several counties of southern Florida. Same-sex marriage became legal in Florida when the decision in the federal case Brenner v. Scott found the amendments banning same-sex marriage (including Amendment 2) to be unconstitutional. ==Text== Amendment 2 added Article I Section 27 of the Florida constitution. This states: ==The initiative== The amendment was proposed by means of the initiative process, and went before the voters of Florida in a referendum held on November 4, 2008. Similar proposals were put to a vote at the same time in Arizona (Proposition 102) and California (Proposition 8). Proposed constitutional amendments in Florida require 611,009 signatures, including at least 8% of voters in the last presidential election and at least 8% of voters in each congressional district of Florida. The initiative was certified with 649,346 signatures and was placed on the ballot on February 2008. 60% of voters were required to pass the amendment in Florida. A Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll on September 8, 2008 showed that 55% favored the proposed amendment, while 41% oppose it. \\"Florida and Arizona joined 27 other states that previously approved such amendments.\\"Gay-marriage bans pass in Florida, Arizona. Retrieved November 5, 2008 The amendment was ultimately passed by a margin of 61.9% in favor and 38.1% opposed. In the Florida 2008 election, Barack Obama voters as a whole voted 57% against Amendment 2 while John McCain voters voted 81% in favor of the legislation. Republican Governor Charlie Crist publicly supported Amendment 2. Monroe County was the only county to have a majority of the voters reject the amendment by a margin of 1,580 votes. thumbright250pxElection results by county. ==Comparison to Proposition 8== A similar and more widely controversial ballot initiative in California, Proposition 8, was titled \\"ELIMINATES RIGHT OF SAME‚ÄìSEX COUPLES TO MARRY. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT\\" and summarized accordingly. This description differed from the description of Florida's Amendment 2 in that it referred to a right being removed. Another difference between Amendment 2 and Proposition 8 was that the latter did not render domestic partnerships unlawful in California,http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2008/11/06/18549382.php while the text of Amendment 2 made the recognition of civil unions‚Äîor other marriage- like relationships for same-sex couples‚Äîunlawful in Florida. ==Effect of education== A study was done to see the effect of education on the votes. Controlling for other socioeconomic and political factors, for each additional 1 percent of a county's population with a bachelor of arts degree, the study concluded that there was nearly an equal 1 percent decrease in support for Amendment 2. By comparison, every 1 percent increase in a county's black population led to only two-tenths of a percentage point increase in support for Amendment 2. According to one of the study's authors, \\"Education is so important because it increases exposure to those who are different. Studies show very clearly that the more educated people are the more tolerant they are of differences.\\" ==2014 litigation== Since the beginning of 2014, several couples and plaintiffs have sued the state of Florida over the amendment, as part of a larger, concentrated effort by gay rights activists and groups encouraged by the federal Supreme Court's decisions regarding marriage made the previous year. Multiple state lawsuits against the amendment have already been successful so far, succeeding in the amendment being struck down successively in Monroe, Miami-Dade, and Broward counties. On August 5, 2014, a Palm Beach County judge issued a ruling in a case pertaining to a surviving spouse's rights in a specific estate case which resulted in the union of a widow and her deceased wife as the first ever same-sex marriage officially recognized in Florida. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Republican up for reelection in 2014 considered vulnerable due to association with Governor Rick Scott, has been a staunch defender of the amendment in court. Critics have pointed to her two previous divorces as a cause for hypocrisy when compared to her statements about the sanctity of marriage. Bondi has appealed all state court rulings thus far, which, as required by Florida law, automatically stays the rulings until the beginning of the appeal process. The rulings against the amendment have been welcome by gay rights groups, the activist gay community in southern Florida, both Democratic gubernatorial candidates, and it appears a majority of Floridians, as at least one recent poll by the conservative- leaning firm Quinnipiac now shows that 56% of likely voters now favor marriage equality, a near-total reversal since 2008. Concurrently with the lawsuits and rulings, a governor's race took place in 2014 and both leading candidates had completely opposite views on the issue of marriage. Incumbent Governor Rick Scott is opposed to marriage equality. Former governor and Democratic primary candidate Charlie Crist, who has changed parties since 2008, now supports same-sex marriage and ran on a platform that included giving same-sex couples the right to marry. == See also == * LGBT rights in Florida * Recognition of same-sex unions in Florida == References  * Yes2Marriage.org (Amendment 2 proponents) * SayNo2.com (Amendment 2 opponents) * The Money Behind the 2008 Same-Sex Partnership Ballot Measures - The National Institute On Money In State Politics Category:2008 in Florida Category:2008 in LGBT history Category:2008 Florida ballot measures Category:Initiatives in the United States Category:LGBT in Florida Category:U.S. state constitutional amendments banning same-sex unions Category:Same-sex marriage referendums ","title":"2008 Florida Amendment 2"},{"id":"19315919","text":"Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944), is a United States Supreme Court decision holding that an administrative agency's interpretative rules deserve deference according to their persuasiveness. The court adopted a case-by-case test, which considers the rulings, interpretations, and opinions of the administrator. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings. ==Background== Seven employees of the Swift & Company packing plant in Fort Worth, Texas, brought an action under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to recover overtime, liquidated damages, and attorneys' fees, totaling approximately $77,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). The employees were required to stay on the packing plant's premises when they were not on the clock. In the action brought by the employees to recover overtime for the periods that they spent on call, the district court ruled that the time employees spent waiting to respond to alarms did not count as hours worked. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision. The employees appealed to the Supreme Court. ==Issue== What deference was due to the interpretative rules of an administrative agency? ==Decision== The Court decided that no principle of law either in the Act or in Court decisions precludes waiting time from also being working time. Moreover, the Court did not attempt to lay down a legal formula to resolve similar cases, based on their facts. Whether waiting time falls within or without the Act is a question of fact, to be resolved by the trial courts. Congress created the office of the administrator, providing him with responsibilities and empowering him to implement them subject to the act. In pursuit of his duties, the administrator has gathered considerable experience in the problems of ascertaining working time in employment involving periods of inactivity and knowledge of how to resolve disputes over working time. The administrator has set forth views of the application of the Act under different circumstances. Such views, under Wage and Hour Division Interpretative Bulletin No. 13., provide a guide on how to settle such disputes. As the Court stated in resolving the dispute: > The Administrator thinks the problems presented by inactive duty require a > flexible solution... and his Bulletin endeavors to suggest standards and > examples to guide in particular situations‚Ä¶. [In general, the calculation of > working time] depends 'upon the degree to which the employee is free to > engage in personal activities during periods of idleness when he is subject > to call and the number of consecutive hours that the employee is subject to > call without being required to perform active work.' > ...the conclusion of the Administrator is that the general tests which he > has suggested point to the exclusion of sleeping and eating time of these > employees from the work-week and the inclusion of all other on-call time: > although the employees were required to remain on the premises during the > entire time, the evidence shows that they were very rarely interrupted in > their normal sleeping and eating time, and these are pursuits of a purely > private nature which would presumably occupy the employees' time whether > they were on duty or not and which apparently could be pursued adequately > and comfortably in the required circumstances; the rest of the time is > different because there is nothing in the record to suggest that, even > though pleasurably spent, it was spent in the ways the men would have chosen > had they been free to do so. The court stated that no statutory provision stated to what deference courts should pay to the administrator's guidance. However, the court stated that \\"we consider that the rulings, interpretations and opinions of the Administrator under this Act, while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.\\" The court developed a test to determine the deference to be given to an administrative agency's rules based on the following: * The thoroughness of the agency's investigation * The validity of its reasoning * The consistency of its interpretation over time * Other persuasive powers of the agency ==Subsequent developments== Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), was a landmark case in which the Supreme Court set forth the legal test for determining whether to grant deference to a government agency's interpretation of a statute which it administers. Chevron is the Court's clearest articulation of the doctrine of \\"administrative deference\\" to the point that the Court itself has used the phrase \\"Chevron deference\\" in more recent cases.United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 226 (2001). The Court, in an opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens, upheld the EPA's interpretation. A two-part analysis was born from the Chevron decision (called the \\"Chevron two- step test\\") in which a reviewing court first determines whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter because the court and the agency must give effect to the unambiguously-expressed intent of Congress. If, however, the court determines Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue, and the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute but determine whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute. Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576 (2000) is a Supreme Court case holding that a county's policy of requiring employees to schedule time off to avoid accruing time off was not prohibited by the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Court held that an opinion letter from the Department of Labor, stating that an employer had to get the employee to agree first before it required the employee to schedule time off, did not receive Chevron deference but should receive the less deferential standard of Skidmore v. Swift & Co. The majority attempted to draw a bright line between formal agency documents (such as legislative rules) and less formal ones (such as opinion letters). Therefore, the opinion letter of the Department of Labor was not binding on the court. The court went on to state nothing in the FLSA that prohibited the forced use of compensation time. Justice Thomas delivered the 6-3 decision of the court in favor of Harris County and ruled that an agency's interpretation of a statute, announced in more informal agency papers (such as an opinion letter) is entitled to Skidmore deference, not Chevron deference. The continuing vitality of Skidmore deference was questioned by Justice Scalia but is still used when agency actions do not carry the force of law. Justice Scalia, in his concurrence in Christensen v. Harris County, argued that Skidmore has no place since Chevron. However, the majority in Christensen held that an agency's interpretation of a statute, announced in more informal agency papers (such as an opinion letter), is entitled to Skidmore deference, not Chevron deference. United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218 (2001) explicitly reaffirms Skidmore and reiterates deference to agency interpretations that do not have statutory authority resulting from a rule- making process are based on \\"the agency's care, its consistency, formality, and relative expertness, and to the persuasiveness of the agency's position.\\"United States v Mead Corp., 533 US 218, 228 (2001). ==See also== * Swift and Company v.

Developed under the guidance of James S. Duncan, who gambled corporate losses would drop and won, the 101 introduced the Chrysler L-head inline six. The six would compete with Oliver's straight- six Model 70, while saving money on development of a whole new engine as well as taking advantage of Chrysler's existing parts and service network. ==Specification== The 101 used the 201 in¬≥ (3,292 cc) six, taking advantage of its stock electric start, a first in a tractor. Run at much lower revs than the truck engine, the 101 came in the usual standard and row-crop models, with four-speed transmission, and was capable of 20 mph (32 km/h) on roads. The row-crop model offered adjustable rear wheel spacing and rear wheel brakes, as well as PTO. There was also a rare model with a single front wheel.Pripps, p.71.

Emphasis was given to knights from Sussex and Kent, as it was produced in Dover between 1270 and 1280 and the document was designed to list the knights who owed feudal service there. It depicts 324 coats of arms, beginning with Richard Fitz Roy and William de Say, two of King John's illegitimate sons. The shields are arranged in 54 rows, with six shields on each line. Above each shield reads the knight's name, except in six cases where it has been omitted or removed. Stephen de Pencester may have commissioned the roll during his time as Constable of Dover Castle. ==Dering's amendment== Sir Edward Dering acquired the Roll whilst lieutenant of Dover Castle, and made his modification after 1638, removing the coat of arms of Nicholas de Crioll and inserting his own coat of arms with a fictitious ancestor named Richard Fitz DeringBritish Library, Digitized manuscripts viewer, Add Roll 77720, Image 1, row 11 nos. 1 & 2. in order to improve the history of his own family.J.

The library raised ¬£194,184 to acquire the roll; the Head of Medieval and Earlier Manuscripts, Claire Breay said of the purchase, \\"the acquisition of the Dering Roll provides an extremely rare chance to add a manuscript of enormous local and national significance.\\" They were assisted in funding the purchase from The Art Fund (¬£40,000), the National Heritage Memorial Fund (¬£100,000), Friends of the British Library (¬£10,000), Friends of the National Libraries (¬£10,000), and a number of individual benefactors.

Though plastic, proportions were accurate and details surprising. Svenska Galanite Industri, usually known simply as Galanite, was a Swedish vinyl and plastic company based in L√∂ddek√∂pinge, which made mostly toys. Cars were the most popular, but trucks, farm vehicles and airplanes were also produced. ==History== The plastics company Galanite was started in 1947 by two Danish immigrants to Sweden named Louis Hawaleska and Borje Hansen. The first product was a transparent ball with an angel inside. Galanite became a supplier of plastic parts for industry, including supplying parts for Saab and Volvo. Their toy cars, however, soon became the mainstay of the company. When the company prospered in the late 1950s and through the 1960s, it employed 125 people (Plastibar site). Varied plastics were used; soft PVC (for toys), polyethylene and polystyrene. ==Toy type== Most Galanite cars produced were in the four inch range at a scale of 1:42, but the company also made large pedal cars. Swedish vehicles were common like Volvo, Saab, and Scania trucks, possibly related to Galanite's parts and promotional connections, but Volkswagens and other vehicles like Mercedes Benz and the BMC Mini were also made. Like most rubber vehicles, construction was of only seven parts: a molded vinyl body, two metal axles, and four plastic tires. These toys were child friendly - soft vinyl, rounded edges and fun colours. Other Galanite Toys were of a larger proportion (1:30) and had a less realistic design, with some of the cleaner edges of the true design of a car softened or abstracted for instance. Models are not numbered on the bottom and usually simply say \\"Galanite Sweden\\". ==Almost promotionals== Approximate dates of production for Galanite Toys were the late 1960s through the 1970s. Items produced are similar in concept to what Tomte Laerdal produced in Norway, or what Auburn Rubber Company produced in the United States. Some examples were exceptionally detailed for vinyl such as the SAAB 96 with a very accurate front end, accurate body proportions and SAAB logo on the trunk lid. The model almost appears to be a company promotional, but none approach the detail of Finnish Stahlberg Models which were purpose built as promotional models for SAAB and Volvo. Galanite Mercedes Benz 350 SLC. ==Company details== Galanite was sold in 1971 to Branch & Co., and three years later the company moved to a new factory in Arl√∂v. Galanite went into liquidation in 1979. The company named changed a few years later to Bengtsfors Plastics Industry, which also went out of business. Later, MPV purchased the Galanite name. Some cars were thus made by MPV but marked Galanite. A unique collaboration existed between the Nordic toy manufacturers, which often sold their molds to each other. Galanite toys have also been made by HP-Plast in Denmark, by Giske in Norway and by Plasto in Finland. ==References== * Plastbilar site with history of Galanite toys (In Swedish) Category:Companies based in Sk√•ne County Category:1:43 scale models Category:Rubber toys Category:Toy companies of Sweden ","title":"Galanite"},{"id":"19316180","text":"Slimmy, born Paulo Fernandes, is a Portuguese singer/songwriter who combines various genres of rock, especially electro rock. He has an irreverent visual look and an addictive musical style and has achieved mainstream success after an appearance on the Portuguese soap opera Morangos com A√ß√∫car. His music has also appeared in one episode of CSI. His song, Self Control, has been featured on Sky Sports. ==Life and career1999‚Äì2005: early life and career beginnings=== In 1999 and 2000, Slimmy‚Äôs career took hold from the impact generated around a third prize at the Roland Masters Of The Groove 2000. From that point he began to develop a musical approach that combined rhythms and electronic instrumentation of dance within the rock genre. The first demos were recorded with producer Rodolfo Cardoso in 2003. The collection that had been developed during the previous years did not pass unnoticed by the national and international music scene, catching the attention of noticeables such as Quico Serrano, Alvaro Costa and Saul Davies of the British band James who would later work on Slimmy‚Äôs debut studio album in 2007. In 2004, after studio work and varied concerts, Slimmy relocated to London, performing in reputable venues such as the Dublin Castle, Hope and Anchor, Rhythm Factory, Bull and Gate, materialising in an opening slot on the tour of the American English Electric 6. In 2005, Slimmy began to reach the UK media with airplay on Virgin FM and XFM. http://www.slimmymusic.com Also around this time, \\"Bloodshot Star\\" started to play on MTV2 Channel, and was chosen for the TV series C.S.I.

The song 'Self Control' was also used as a soundtrack to the program summaries of the Premiership on Sky Sports.http://www.slimmymusic.com ===2006‚Äìpresent: career breakthrough, Beatsound Loverboy, Be Someone Else and Freestyle Heart=== In 2007, Slimmy returned to Portugal, embarking on an extensive national tour in preparation for the release of his debut album ‚ÄúBeatsound Loverboy‚Äù, on the Som Livre label. The album features a fusion of rock and electro music, releasing three singles, ‚ÄúBeatsound Loverboy‚Äù, ‚ÄúShow Girl‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou Should Never Leave Me‚Äù. The music video for ‚ÄúShow Girl‚Äù gained controversy for its revealing lesbian content. ‚ÄúBeatsound Loverboy‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou Should Never Leave Me‚Äù appeared on the ‚ÄúMorangos com A√ß√∫car‚Äù soundtrack and the album was voted the 3rd best national album of the past 15 years, chosen by the listeners of the national radio station Antena 3. The year 2008 began with a new tour, with Slimmy presenting the full album throughout the country. The album garnered much recognition within the media and earned Slimmy a nomination for ‚ÄúGolden Globe Newcomer of the Year‚Äù as well as a nomination in the ‚ÄúMTV Europe Music Awards‚Äù for ‚ÄúBest Portuguese Act‚Äù. Slimmy edited in digital format the ‚ÄúSlimmy Unplugged‚Äù, his only live album to date, with 13 songs, recorded live at Salon Castelense in June of that year. In late 2009 Slimmy's career was divided between live performances and studio work, where he began recording on the album \\"Be Someone Else\\", eventually released in June 2010. Recorded between studios Aguda (Portugal) and the studios Wrong Planet (UK), \\"Be Someone Else\\" enlisted the production of Quico Serrano and Mark Turner. The album marked a change in line up for the band with Slimmy on voice and guitar, Paulo Garim on bass and Toz√© on drums, joined by guest musicians on Gustavo Silva programming and keyboards, and Daniel Santos on guitar. This album features 11 tracks in the same musical style of \\"Beatsound Loverboy\\", but focused more on Electro music. The album also featured two singles, \\"The Games You Play\\" and \\"Be Someone Else\\". Promotional concerts ensued until the end of the year.http://portugalrebelde.blogspot.com/2010/03/slimmy-be-someone-else.html https://palcoprincipal.sapo.pt/noticias/Noticia/novo_album_de_slimmy_chama_se_be_someone_else_e_chega_em_maio/0002886 In 2012, Slimmy began work on \\"Freestyle Heart\\", developing demos with Canadian producer Andrew Torrence. Recording commenced in Portugal in April of that year and marked a noticeable difference in his direction, leaning more toward his inert dance influences. Changes in the band's line up also solidified a new direction for Slimmy, suggesting a more accessible approach from his earlier work. As a bonus track, \\"Anjo Como Tu\\" was included on the disc, his first and only recording done in his native language, Portuguese. As a result of the notoriety surrounding the song, it was chosen as a single and went on to become his biggest hit to date, going number one nationally. Presently, Slimmy is living in Portugal and performing in support of this latest release \\"Freestyle Heart\\". ==Image== Slimmy has been influenced by rock artists such as Placebo, IAMX and Kings of Leon. His vocals have drawn frequent comparison to those of Brian Molko and Caleb Followill, while the structure of his music is said to echo classic 1980s rock and 2000s electro.http://blitz.aeiou.pt/gen.pl?p=stories&op;=view&fokey;=bz.stories/19055 Slimmy's personal image, exploited with television appearances and a constant stream of videos has been considered extravagant and overworked, using rock imagery and fancy outfits to make a noticeable impression within the genre. This has also contributed to the widespread doubt as to his sexual orientation.http://plasticponey.blogspot.com/2008/11/brevemente-prximo-single- plastic-poney.html ==Awards== Slimmy was nominated for the Portuguese Golden Globe Awards and also for the European Music Awards (MTV) in Best Portuguese Act. ===MTV Europe Music Awards=== The MTV Europe Music Awards is an annual awards ceremony established in 1994 by MTV Europe. -  2008  Slimmy Best Portuguese Act  } ===Golden Globes=== The Golden Globes is an annual awards ceremony by SIC. -  2008  Slimmy Best New Act  } ==Discography== * 2007: Beatsound Loverboy * 2008: Slimmy Unplugged * 2010: Be Someone Else * 2012: \\"Freestyle Heart'' ===Videoclips=== So far he has released seven videoclips: * Beatsound Loverboy * Bloodshot Star * Showgirl * You Should Never Leave Me (Before I die) * The Games You Play * Be Someone Else * Anjo Como Tu ===Singles=== {  - bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\" ! bgcolor=\\"lightsteelblue\\" width=\\"25\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! bgcolor=\\"lightsteelblue\\" width=\\"170\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Title ! bgcolor=\\"lightsteelblue\\" colspan=\\"1\\" Chart Positions ! bgcolor=\\"lightsteelblue\\" width=\\"100\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Album - bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\" ! bgcolor=\\"#e2e2e2\\" width=\\"40\\" POR -  2007  \\"Beatsound Loverboy\\"  align=\\"center\\" 42  Beatsound Loverboy - bgcolor=\\"#f0f0ff\\"  2008  \\"Show Girl\\"  align=\\"center\\" 44  Beatsound Loverboy -  2008  \\"You Should Never Leave Me (Before I Die)\\"  align=\\"center\\" 48 Beatsound Loverboy - bgcolor=\\"#f0f0ff\\" -  2010  \\"Be Someone Else\\"  align=\\"center\\"  ‚Äì Be Someone Else - bgcolor=\\"#f0f0ff\\" -  2010  \\"The Games You Play\\"  align=\\"center\\"  ‚Äì Be Someone Else - bgcolor=\\"#f0f0ff\\" -  2013  \\"Glitter\\"  align=\\"center\\"  ‚Äì Freestyle Heart - bgcolor=\\"#f0f0ff\\" -  2013  \\"Anjo Como Tu\\"  align=\\"center\\"  ‚Äì1 Freestyle Heart - bgcolor=\\"#f0f0ff\\" } ==References== Category:Portuguese male singers Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Slimmy"},{"id":"19316197","text":"John Elwes [n√© Meggot or Meggott] MP (7 April 1714 ‚Äì 26 November 1789) was a Member of Parliament (MP) in Great Britain for Berkshire (1772‚Äì1784) and a noted eccentric and miser, suggested to be an inspiration for the character of Ebenezer Scrooge in Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol.The Letters of Charles Dickens by Charles Dickens, Madeline House, Graham Storey, Margaret Brown, Kathleen Tillotson, & The British Academy (1999) Oxford University Press [Letter to George Holsworth, 18 January 1865] pp.7 Dickens made reference to Elwes some years later in his last novel, Our Mutual Friend.Our Mutual Friend by Charles Dickens (1865) and in Bleak House (1853).

Parsons (1946)Dictionary of real people and places in fiction by M. C.

His father, Robert Meggot, was a respected Southwark brewer and his grandfather was Sir George Meggot, MP for that same borough.A genealogical and heraldic history of the extinct and dormant baronetcies ... by Bernard Burke His mother, Amy (n√©e Elwes), was the granddaughter of Sir Gervase Elwes, 1st Baronet and MP for Suffolk (see Elwes baronets).A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain .. by John BurkeAccess to Archives.

His maternal grandmother, Lady Isabella Hervey (of the Hervey family), happened to be a celebrated miser.The diary of John Hervey, first Earl of Bristol by John Hervey Bristol, Sydenham Henry Augustus Hervey He received a good education in the classics at Westminster School. After graduating he traveled to Geneva where he embraced his skill for horsemanship and love of the hunt. He was known as one of the best riders in Europe. It was at this time that he was introduced to Voltaire, to whom he was reported to bear a remarkable resemblance. However, Elwes was far more impressed with the quality of the horses at his riding school than by the genius of the French philosopher. ==First inheritance== Elwes inherited his first fortune from his father who died in 1718 when Elwes was just four years old. Although his mother was left ¬£100,000 in the will (approx. ¬£8,000,000 as of 2010), she reputedly starved herself to death because she was too cheap to spend it. With her death, he inherited the family estate including Marcham Park at Marcham in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), purchased by his father in 1717. ==Second inheritance== The greatest influence on Elwes' life was his miserly uncle, Sir Hervey Elwes, 2nd Baronet, of Stoke College and MP for Sudbury, whom Elwes obsequiously imitated to gain favour. Sir Hervey prided himself on only spending little more than ¬£110 on himself per annum. The two of them would spend the evening railing against other people's extravagances while they shared a single glass of wine. In 1751, in order to inherit his uncle's estate, he changed his name from Meggot to Elwes. Sir Hervey died on 18 September 1763, bequeathing his entire fortune to his nephew. The net worth of the estate was more than ¬£250,000 (approx. ¬£18,000,000 as of 2010), a figure that continued to grow despite Elwes' inept handling of his finances. ==Miserliness== John Elwes, MP, with moneybag On assuming his uncle's fortune, however, Elwes also assumed his uncle's miserly ways. He went to bed when darkness fell so as to save on candles. He began wearing only ragged clothes, including a beggar's cast-off wig he found in a hedge and wore for two weeks. His clothes were so dilapidated that many mistook him for a common street beggar, and would put a penny into his hand as they passed. To avoid paying for a coach he would walk in the rain, and then sit in wet clothes to save the cost of a fire to dry them. His house was full of expensive furniture but also moulding food. He would eat putrefied game before allowing new food to be bought. On one occasion it was said that he ate a moorhen that a rat had pulled from a river. Rather than spend the money for repairs he allowed his spacious country mansion to become uninhabitable. A near relative once stayed at his home in the country, but the bedroom was in such a poor state that the relative was awakened in the night by rain pouring on him from the roof. After searching in vain for a bell, the relative was forced to move his bed several times, until he found a place where he could remain dry. On remarking the circumstance to Elwes in the morning, the latter said: \\"Ay! I don't mind it myself... that is a nice corner in the rain!\\" His biographer, Edward Topham, who knew him well,The life of the late John Elwes, Esquire: member in three successive parliaments for Berkshire by Edward Topham recounts: :\\"...it is curious to remark, how he contrived to mingle small attempts at saving.... After sitting up a whole night at play for thousands, with the most fashionable and profligate men of the time, amidst splendid rooms, gilt sofas, wax lights, and waiters attendant on his call, he would walk out about four in the morning, not towards home, but into Smithfield! to meet his own cattle, which were coming to market from Theydon-hall,The History of Essex: From the Earliest Period to the Present Time : Illustrated with Accurate Engravings of Churchs, Monuments, pp260 a farm of his in Essex. There would this same man, forgetful of the scenes he had just left, stand in the cold or rain, bartering with a carcass butcher for a shilling.\\" According to author, William Haig Miller, he even \\"complained bitterly of the birds robbing him of so much hay with which to build their nests.\\"The Man of Wealth by W. H. Miller. London: Religious Tract Society, [c.1890] pp. 127. 16mo. [First published 1850] Even Elwes' health was limited by expense. In common with many misers, he distrusted physicians, preferring to treat himself in order to save paying for one. He once badly cut both legs while walking home in the dark, but would only allow the apothecary to treat one, wagering his fee that the untreated limb would heal first. Elwes won by a fortnight and the doctor had to forfeit his fee. He also bore a wound from a hunting accident. Legend has it that one day he was out shooting with a gentleman who was a particularly bad shot. This same man accidentally fired through a hedge, lodging several shot in the miser's cheek. With great embarrassment and concern, the gentleman approached Elwes to apologize. But Elwes, anticipating the apology, held out his hand, and said: \\"My dear sir, I congratulate you on improving; I thought you would hit something in time\\". ==Political career== In 1772 with the help of Lord Craven he became a Member of Parliament for Berkshire (his election expenses amounted to a mere eighteen pence).Eccentric Characters of Berkshire by A. L. Humphreys, F.S.A He entered the House of Commons in a by-election as a compromise candidate to replace Thomas Craven, which began the first of three terms. He held his seat unopposed until he stood down at the 1784 election. Elwes sat with either party according to his whim, and he never once rose to address the House of Commons. Fellow members mockingly observed that since he possessed only one suit, they could never accuse him of being a \\"turncoat\\". Being a member of parliament did, however, cause Elwes to frequently travel to Westminster. He made the journey on a poor lean horse, the route chosen being always the one whereby he could avoid turnpike tolls. He was known to put a hard-boiled egg in his pocket, and midway on his journey would sit under some hedge and eat his egg or sleep. After twelve years he retired rather than face the prospect of laying out any money to retain his seat. ==Moneylending== Despite his exceptional frugality, Elwes lost huge sums of money to his colleagues in unrepaid loans, uncollected debts and dubious investments. He believed that one did not ask a gentleman for money, regardless of the circumstances. On one notable occasion Elwes, unsolicited, lent Lord Abingdon ¬£7,000 to enable him to place a bet at Newmarket. On the day of the race, Elwes rode on horseback to the racetrack with nothing to eat for fourteen hours save a piece of pancake which he had put into his pocket two months earlier and which he swore to a startled companion was \\"as good as new\\". ==Later years== Marcham Park, formerly in Berkshire, from the north east. When his parliamentary career was over, Elwes devoted his full energies to being a miser as he moved about among his many properties. At his neglected estates he continued to forbid repairs, joined his tenants in postharvest gleaning, and sat with his servants in the kitchen to save the cost of a fire elsewhere. Even on the coldest day of winter he was known to sit fireless at his meals, saying that eating was \\"exercise enough\\" to keep him warm. If a stableboy put out hay for a visitor's horse, Elwes would sneak out and remove it. In his last years he had no fixed abode and frequently shifted his residence between his unrented London properties in the neighbourhood of Marylebone seeking out the ones which were temporarily unoccupied. A couple of beds, a couple of chairs, a table, and an \\"old woman\\" (housekeeper) were said to be all his furnishings. This same housekeeper was known to frequently catch colds because there were never any fires and often no glass in the windows. This practice nearly cost Elwes his life when he fell desperately ill in one of these houses and no one could find him. Only by chance was he rescued. His nephew, Colonel Timms, who wanted to see him, inquired in vain at Elwes's banker's and at other places. A pot boy recollected having seen an \\"old beggar\\" go into a stable at one of Elwes's uninhabited houses in Great Marlborough Street and lock the door behind him. Timms knocked at the door, but when no one answered, sent for a blacksmith and had the lock forced. According to author Edward Walford in Volume 4 of his \\"Old and New London\\" (1878): > \\"In the lower part (of the house) all was shut and silent, but on ascending > the stairs they heard the moans of a person seemingly in distress. They went > to the chamber, and there on an old pallet bed they found Mr. Elwes, > apparently in the agonies of death. For some time he seemed quite > insensible.\\"Golden Street and neighbourhood  Old and New London: Volume 4 > (pp. 235‚Äì246). British-history.ac.uk (22 June 2003). Retrieved 2012-04-17. He remained in this condition until some \\"cordials\\" could be administered by a neighbouring apothecary. After he had sufficiently recovered, Elwes stated that he believed he had been ill for \\"two or three days\\", and that there was an \\"old woman\\" in the house, but for some reason or other, she had \\"not been near him\\"; that she had \\"been ill herself\\", but that he supposed she must have \\"recovered\\" and \\"gone away\\". Upon searching the premises, however, Timms and the apothecary found the woman stretched lifeless on the floor, having apparently been dead for two days. Towards the end of his life Elwes grew feverish and restless, hoarding small quantities of money in different places, continually visiting all the places of deposit to see that they were safe. He began suffering from delusion, fearing that he would die in poverty. In the night he was heard struggling with imaginary robbers, crying: \\"I will keep my money! I will! Don't rob me! Oh, don't!\\" When asked who was there?, Elwes would reply: \\"Sir, I beg your pardon, my name is Elwes, I have been unfortunate enough to be robbed in this house, which I believe is mine, of all the money I have in the world of five guineas and a half, and half a crown.\\" The family doctor was sent for, and, looking at the dying miser, was heard to remark: \\"That man, with his original strength of constitution, and lifelong habits of temperance, might have lived twenty years longer, but for his continual anxiety about money.\\" Even his barrister, who drew up his ¬£800,000 will, was forced to undertake his writings in the firelight by the dying man's bedside in order to save the cost of a candle. The famed miser was also known to sleep in the same worn garments he wore during the day. He was discovered one morning between the sheets with his tattered shoes on his feet, an old torn hat on his head, and a stick in his hand. It was in this condition he died on 26 November 1789. His burial took place in Stoke-by-Clare. After having lived on only ¬£50 a year, Elwes left ¬£500,000 (Approx ¬£74,207,558 as of 2018) to his two sons who were born out of wedlock, George and John, (whom he loved but would not educate, believing that \\"putting things into people's heads is the sure way to take money out of their pockets\\") and the rest to his nephew. The following summary of his character, by his friend and biographer, Mr. Topham: > \\"...his public character lives after him pure and without stain. In private > life, he was chiefly an enemy to himself. To others, he lent much; to > himself, he denied everything. But in the pursuit of his property, or in the > recovery of it, I have it not in my remembrance one unkind thing that ever > was done by him.\\" Besides being a member of Parliament, Elwes's accomplishments include financing the construction of a significant amount of Georgian London, including Portman Place, Portman Square, and parts of Oxford Circus Piccadilly, Baker Street and Marylebone.History News Network .

He became a worker himself and travelled as a vagabond throughout Europe, Turkey and northern Africa. In 1929 he joined the German communist party KPD living in Berlin, where he published his first novels in communist periodicals. The Hessischer Rundfunk produced a portrait of him in 1980, in which he spoke about his years in Berlin before Hitler came to power. He had to realize that the German communist party in the early 1930s was willing to help bring Hitler to power. Kolbenhoffs words about the KPD were: \\"Die wollte ja faktisch die Nazis an die Macht bringen um dann die Macht zu √ºbernehmen\\" (\\"In fact, they wanted to bring the Nazis to power and then take power\\"). This was said very unambiguously in the periodical \\"Die Rote Fahne\\" of the KPD. It was told to Kolbenhoff and to his comrades, that Hitler would not remain in the government for long time and that a revolution of the working class in Germany would take place that would sweep him away and communist dictatorship would be the unavoidable consequence. Indeed in 1932 during a strike of the transport workers in Berlin the pickets were Rotfront (the KDP's organisation analogous to Hitler's SA) and SA-members side by side. These kind of actions by the German communists can only be explained by a direct order from Joseph Stalin. In 1933, he left Germany for Denmark, where he stayed until 1940, with Wilhelm Reich. 1933 in Denmark appeared his novel \\"Untermenschen\\" (Undermen) in which he depicted his former life as a vagabond. As German troops invaded Denmark in 1940 Kolbenhoff received orders from the communist party to go back to Germany and to join the Wehrmacht and to form a red cell. He obeyed, becoming a soldier and took part in the battles in Yugoslavia as well as Italy. In 1944 he was made a prisoner of war by the American troops in the ruins of the monastery at Monte Cassino. As a prisoner of war he got instructions in democratic governance in the USA and was released soon and came back to Berlin. In post war Germany he became a member of the famous Gruppe 47. He translated a lot of crime novels from English into German and wrote one himself about the man-hunt of the French Foreign Legion in Germany under chancellor Konrad Adenauer.

Originally, each singer/songwriter performed his own set. However, they eventually started sharing the stage, and collaborating with bassist Seth Whitney. The Wednesday night series was billed as \\"The Good Time Supper Club\\". A misprint in a local paper billed the act as \\"The Heathens.\\" Drummer John Chipman joined the band in 2007, and Keyboardist Trevor Nealon, who played in the studio during the recording of both \\"One Foot in the Ether\\" and \\"Top Hat Crown & the Clapmaster's Son\\", joined the touring unit in 2011. Their first recording, \\"Live from Momo's\\", recorded at the now closed club on West 6th Street in Austin brought the band national attention and they were voted \\"Best New Band\\" at the 2007 Austin Music Awards. Following the Momo's release, the band released a second live recording, the CD/DVD \\"Live at Antone's\\" which was recorded at the venerable Austin club. May 20, 2008 the band released their first, self-titled, studio album. Produced by Ray Wylie Hubbard, and featuring notable guests Patty Griffin, Stephen Bruton, and Gurf Morlix, the record went to #1 on the Americana Music Association's radio charts.

The TV performance showcased a set by both the Band Of Heathens and Elvis Costello. Following the Austin City Limits PBS show, the band also played on the German television live concert series Rockpalast on October 9, 2009, performing 14 songs, many from the albums \\"Band Of Heathens\\" and \\"One Foot In The Ether.\\". \\"One Foot In The Ether\\", BOH's second studio release once again charted to the #1 slot on the Americana Radio Charts.

Later, the band launched live.bandofheathens.com where the audio recordings are available either by subscription or a la carte download. Ed Jurdi said the band embraced the idea of sharing as much of their music as possible, \\"We play different set lists night to night and we‚Äôll play songs differently over time and they will evolve. And that‚Äôs another outlet for fans to follow the band and explore what we are doing. So our attitude is to share it as much as we can.\\"from an interview on episode 166 of the Americana Music Show, published November 18, 2013 ==Discography== The first two recordings were live - a live album at Momo's was recorded in 2006, and in 2007, \\"Live at Antone's\\" with a DVD/CD set was completed. In May 2008, the band released its first studio production simply titled \\"The Band of Heathens\\". Produced by Ray Wylie Hubbard, the album reached #1 on the Americana Charts and the EuroAmericana charts. What is significant however is that it was only the second independently released album to ever reach #1 on the Chart. In September 2009 the band released the album \\"One Foot in the Ether\\" which again made it to number one on the Americana as well as the Euroamericana charts.

Lancashire began his career as a youth player for Crystal Palace before joining Southampton's academy. He captained Southampton's under-18 side and turned professional in July 2006, making his senior debut in 2008. Lancashire had three loan spells at Grimsby Town in 2009/10 and, following his release by Southampton, joined Walsall in July 2010. He made 58 appearances for Walsall, but was released in the summer of 2012 and subsequently went to Aldershot Town. In July 2013, Lancashire made a permanent transfer to then-League Two side Rochdale. He went on to play a season for Shrewsbury Town, followed by two for Swindon Town, before joining Crewe Alexandra in May 2019. ==Early life== Lancashire was born in Basingstoke, Hampshire, on 13 December 1988. He attended Hook Junior School and Robert May's School in Odiham. Lancashire began his career with Southampton, where he signed a two-year contract. Lancashire was linked with moves to the Premiership with Manchester City and Liverpool. ==Club careerSouthampton=== Lancashire made his first-team debut against Queens Park Rangers on 14 September 2008, but was sent off after 29 minutes, for a rash tackle on Damien Delaney. After a two match ban, Lancashire made his return and helped the club keep two clean sheets in a row, in wins against Doncaster Rovers and Norwich City. But several weeks later, on 21 October 2008, Lancashire, once again, received a red card after a second bookable offence, in a 0‚Äì0 draw against Sheffield United. While at Southampton, he never became a first team regular, looking out of his depth. Upon joining Walsall, Lancashire explained his discipline issue. On 15 May 2010, Lancashire was named in a list of 13 players to be released from Southampton before the start of the 2010‚Äì11 season. Grimsby Town (loan spells) In October 2009, Lancashire signed on a one-month loan for Grimsby Town. In his second game for Town, against Accrington Stanley, on 30 October 2009, Lancashire received his third career red card, in only 15 league matches, after he was adjudged to have handled the ball in the penalty area. In his next appearance for Grimsby, he scored an own goal whilst playing against Leeds United in the Football League Trophy quarter final away at Elland Road on 10 November 2009. Lancashire returned for a second spell on loan at Grimsby on 23 December 2009,Olly back for big County battle 24 December 2009 only to be recalled on 31 December due to an injury crisis at his parent club. On transfer deadline day 1 February 2010, Lancashire joined Grimsby for a third time, until the end of the season. He scored his first professional goal in a 2‚Äì0 win over Darlington on 24 April 2010. However, towards the end of the season, Grimsby Town were relegated from the Football League for the first time in nearly 100 years. After the relegation, he said his difficult spell at the club had made him a better player. ===Walsall=== On 14 July 2010, Lancashire joined Walsall, where manager Chris Hutchings said \\"He has shown plenty of promise and we have had some good reports on him. He will add competition to the central defensive positions.\\" Lancashire made his debut for the club, on the opening game of the season, coming on as a late substitute, in a 2‚Äì1 loss against Milton Keynes Dons. He made 29 appearances during the season. The club avoided relegation, but Lancashire was one of many players criticised by Hutchings for poor displays during the season. He later described the relegation survival as \\"it's definitely the biggest day of my [his] career\\". In the 2011‚Äì12 season, Lancashire made 20 appearances as the club again avoided relegation. In mid-December, he suffered an hamstring injury, recovering after a month out, and making his return on 15 February 2012, in a 2‚Äì1 defeat against Oldham Athletic. On 3 March 2012, Lancashire scored his first Walsall goal, an injury time equaliser, as Walsall drew 1‚Äì1 against Leyton Orient. On 9 May 2012, it was announced that Lancashire had been released by Walsall. ===Aldershot Town=== On 14 June 2012, Lancashire signed with League Two side Aldershot Town on a two-year deal, following his release from Walsall. His time with Aldershot was hampered by injury; he made 15 appearances (12 league and three cup games). After one season with Aldershot Town, resulting in the club's relegation, Lancashire was among 13 players made redundant, after the club went into administration. ===Rochdale=== On 14 June 2013, Lancashire signed a one-year contract with Rochdale. He was given number six shirt and made his debut in the opening game of the season, in a 3‚Äì0 win over Hartlepool United. Lancashire quickly established himself as part of the team's first choice centre back pairing, along with on-loan Jack O'Connell. Due to the absence of first team captain Peter Cavanagh as a result of injury and suspension, he was handed the captain's armband. After his debut, he appeared in 18 consecutive games until he was sent-off in a 4‚Äì0 loss against Scunthorpe United on 28 November 2013; this resulted a one-match ban. Lancashire was sent-off for the second time that season on 11 March 2014, in a 2‚Äì1 loss against League Two strugglers Torquay United. Having led Rochdale towards promotion to League One, Lancashire wrote to the club's supporters about the promotion. On 27 June 2014, Lancashire signed a one-year extension with Rochdale. At the start of the 2014‚Äì15 season, on 5 August 2014, Lancashire was named Rochdale captain after the departure of Peter Cavanagh. He started in the opening game of the season, in a 1‚Äì0 defeat against Peterborough United, but sustained a groin injury that was expected to keep him out for four to six weeks. Unexpectedly, Lancashire managed to recover from the injury and returned to training, but remained on the bench until coming on as substitute for Jamie Allen in the 33rd minute of a 3‚Äì2 win over Leyton Orient on 27 September 2014. Following his return, Lancashire retained his first team place, captaining the side in a FA Cup first round 0‚Äì0 draw against Northampton Town. In the replay, Lancashire scored in the last minute to send Rochdale through to the next round. Throughout the 2014‚Äì15 season, Lancashire continued to be injury- plagued making 28 appearance in all competitions. ===Shrewsbury Town=== On 20 May 2016, Lancashire signed a two-year deal at Shrewsbury Town after rejecting a new deal at Rochdale. He scored his first goal for Shrewsbury in a 3‚Äì2 loss at former club Walsall on 15 October 2016. ===Swindon Town=== On 28 June 2017, Lancashire joined League Two side Swindon Town on a two-year deal after terminating his contract with Shrewsbury.

That scheme was and remains a collaborative effort involving ‚Äì for the first time ‚Äì national governments, local agencies, European and Asian conservation centres and international zoological institutions to save this species from extinction.The signing of the agreement by Professor Rubini on behalf of the Directorate and Francesco Nardelli on behalf of John Aspinall and the Howletts and Port Lympne Foundation was witnessed and endorsed by the Indonesian Minister of Forestry and the British Ambassador who described the project as \\"an imaginative illustration of the sort of collaboration between the two countries\\" and was discussed by the Indonesian President Soeharto and the British Prime Minister during Mrs Thatcher's visit. For more details see: http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/index.php?s=1&act;=refs&CODE;=note_detail&id;=1165253601 Under Nardelli's leadership, the Indonesian Government, Howletts and Port Lympne Zoo , the Cincinnati, San Diego, New York and Los Angeles zoos all played a crucial role in the success of the project. This plan is continuing under the Department of Forest Protection and Nature Conservation of the Indonesian Government assisted by the UK based Save the Rhino International, the US‚Äôs International Rhino Foundation and other agencies. The project resulted in the Indonesian government's signature of a rhino conservation agreement in 1985, the first time Jakarta has signed such an agreement and decided to participate in a coordinated international programme for the protection of an endangered species. Today the Sumatran rhino has a scattered population of around 300 individuals in the wild. Another legacy of the Sumatran Rhino Project is that several conservation agencies in Europe and North America are committed to save these very few surviving animals. Among other success stories related to this programme is the birth in captivity of three calves of Sumatran rhinos https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/05/070501095539.htm at the Cincinnati Zoo: on 13 September 2001. Andalas, a male, was the first of his species born in captivity since 1889 . His mother, Emi, has since had two more calves in Cincinnati: a female, Suci, born in 2004 and a male, Harapan, born in 2007. \\"Ten years ago many people were skeptical claiming this species would never breed in a zoo. Yet today, the Cincinnati Zoo is world-renowned for being the only place in the world this species is breeding successfully in captivity,\\" said Dr Terri Roth, Vice President of Conservation, Science and Living Collections at the Cincinnati Zoo. On 29 April 2007 Emi became the first Sumatran rhino in history to produce three calves in captivity, breaking her very own record.

His work with wild mammals, in particular with the Sumatran rhino, makes Francesco Nardelli a reputable naturalist and Italian conservationist. ==Publications== Nardelli's commitment to the protection and conservation of Sumatran rhinos inspired him to write ‚ÄúThe Rhinoceros‚Äù (Basilisk Press, London) a monograph featuring coloured plates by renowned wildlife artist Matthew Hillier,http://matthewhillierart.com/ describing the life and history of the five surviving species of rhinoceroses.

He was raised in both New York City and Puerto Rico. Rivera graduated from The World University in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He also studied at the School for International Training.Grimes, William (September 14, 2008). Ron Rivera, Potter Devoted to Clean Water, Dies at 60. New York TimesRon Rivera profile via Changemakers] Rivera worked with the Peace Corps in Panama and Ecuador, and with Catholic Relief Services in Bolivia. He founded the local consultancy office for the Inter American Foundation in Ecuador where he worked until 1988, when he moved to Nicaragua. ==Career and work with ceramics== Rivera first became passionate about ceramics in the early 1970s when he studied in Cuernavaca, Mexico with Paulo Freire and Ivan Illich, who taught that human beings had lost their connection with the earth. Rivera then went to live with an experienced potter and learned the art of ceramics. After moving to Nicaragua in the late 1980s, where he reunited with and eventually married his high-school sweetheart, Kathy McBride, Rivera worked for over two decades with potters from rural communities in Nicaragua, helping them to enhance their production methods, including the implementation of a more fuel- efficient kiln developed by Manny Hernandez, a professor at Northern Illinois University. He also worked with potters around the country to develop new designs and to connect to new markets. ==Ceramic water filter== He first learned of ceramic pot filters from its inventor Guatemalan chemist Fernando Mazariegos. Rivera produced this inexpensive filter developed in Guatemala by Mr. Mazariegos from a mix of local terra-cotta clay and sawdust or other combustible materials, such as rice husks. The combustible ingredient, which has been milled and screened, burns out in the firing, leaving a network of fine pores. After firing, the filter is coated with colloidal silver. This combination of fine pore size and the bactericidal properties of colloidal silver produce an effective filter, killing over 98 percent of the contaminants that cause diarrhea, thus dramatically reducing public health problems in the communities that use them to purify potable water. He designed a mold for the filter and a special clay press that was operated with a tire jack.Science Guardian The Family of the Americas Association, a Guatemalan organization, conducted a one-year follow-up study on the initial Mazariegos- developed filter project, concluding that this filter helped to reduce the incidence of diarrhea in participating households by as much as 50 percent. Laboratory testing and field studies have been performed on the filter by various institutions, including MIT, Tulane University, University of Colorado and University of North Carolina. Rivera began manufacturing the pots through Potters for Peace in Nicaragua, eventually helping to establish an independent enterprise to produce the filters.Potters for Peace (U.S.) Beginning in 1998, Rivera traveled throughout Latin America, Africa and Asia to establish 30 filter microenterprises in Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Ghana, Nigeria, El Salvador, the Darfur region of Sudan, Myanmar and other countries. These factories have produced over 300,000 filters, and the filters are used by about 1.5 million people to date. An additional 13 filter workshops are scheduled to begin operating by the end of next year. The filter has been cited by the United Nations‚Äô Appropriate Technology Handbook, and tens of thousands of filters have been distributed worldwide by organizations such as International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, Doctors Without Borders, UNICEF, Plan International, Project Concern International, International Development Enterprises, Oxfam and USAID. Rivera wanted to share this Guatemalan invention with the world and posted his experience in manufacturing ceramic pot filters in painstaking detail, on the Internet. ==Written work== Ron Rivera, Lynette Yetter, Jeff Rogers and Reid Harvey co- authored the paper, \\"A Sustainable Ceramic Water Filter for Household Purification,\\" which Lynette Yetter presented at a NSF Conference in 2000. ==Legacy== Rivera's filters were included in an exhibition at the Cooper- Hewitt National Design Museum called \\"Design for the Other 90 Percent.\\" Rivera died in Managua, Nicaragua on September 3, 2008, after contracting falciparum malaria while working in Nigeria. A memorial service held in Managua on September 6 at the Universidad Centroamericana was attended by hundreds, including scores of local potters. During his stay in Nigeria he worked endlessly to put together a ceramic water filter factory. ==See also== *List of Puerto Ricans *Puerto Rican scientists and inventors ==References *Ron Rivera Memorial *Ron Rivera profile via Changemakers *Design for the other 90%: Ron Rivera Coordinator of Ceramic Water Filter and International Projects, Potters for Peace *Potters for Peace (U.S.) *Potters without Borders(Canada) Category:Puerto Rican inventors Category:American people of Puerto Rican descent Category:Water filters Category:Water technology Category:SIT Graduate Institute alumni Category:Infectious disease deaths in Nicaragua Category:Deaths from malaria Category:1948 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American ceramists Category:Puerto Rican scientists Category:Puerto Rican writers Category:American emigrants to Nicaragua Category:20th-century Puerto Rican writers Category:20th-century American inventors Category:20th-century ceramists ","title":"Ron Rivera (public health)"},{"id":"19316430","text":"Brigadier John Durival Kemp, 1st Viscount Rochdale OBE, TD, DL (5 June 1906 - 24 May 1993), was a British peer, soldier and businessman. ==Early life== Kemp was the eldest son of George Kemp, 1st Baron Rochdale, and Lady Beatrice Mary Egerton, third daughter of Francis Egerton, 3rd Earl of Ellesmere.Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

It holds men sentenced by the courts of Devon, Cornwall, Dorset and Somerset. There are also prisoners from further afield who have been transferred from other prisons. Exeter Prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. ==History== In the reign of King Henry I (1100‚Äì1135) the manor of Bicton, near Exeter, was granted by the king to John Janitor,Pole, Sir William (d.1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John-William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p.163 who held the manor by the feudal tenure of grand serjeanty requiring him to provide a county jail,Risdon, Tristram (d.1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, p.50; Pole, p.163 which was an honourable position of trust. The Latin noun Janitor means \\"door-keeper\\", generally understood in the sense janitor carceris, \\"door-keeper of a jail\\".Cassell's Latin Dictionary Thus the tenant took his surname from his form of tenure.Swete, p.142 The county prison was later transferred to a building beneathPole, p.163 Exeter CastleRisdon, p.51 in the county capital Exeter, but the feudal tenant of Bicton was nevertheless for many centuries required to meet part of the repair and maintenance costs of the newly sited jail. The Devon topographer John Swete (d.1821) stated that Dennis Rolle Esq. (d.1797), the proprietor of Bicton at the time of his visit, had paid the sum of ¬£1,000 to the Treasury to be released in perpetuity from his vestigial feudal liabilities.Swete, Rev. John, Illustrated Journals of, published as Travels in Georgian Devon, The Illustrated Journals of the Reverend John Swete, 1789‚Äì1800, Gray, Todd & Rowe, Margery (Eds.),4 vols., Tiverton, Devon, 1998, Vol.2, pp. 140‚Äì145 The release was effected by an Act of Parliament in 1787, Public Act, 27 George III, c. 59 summarised as: > \\"An Act for making and declaring the Gaol for the County of Devon, called > the High Gaol, a Public and Common Gaol; and for discharging Denys Rolle and > John Rolle Esquires, and their respective Heirs and Assigns, from the Office > of Keeper of the said Gaol; and for improving and enlarging the same or > building a new one; and also for taking down the Chapel in the Castle of > Exeter; and for other Purposes therein mentioned\\". The current Exeter prison was built in 1853, and is of a typical Victorian design, by local architect John Hayward. The prison was based on the plan of the model prison at Pentonville, with four residential wings. The prison has been the setting for many executions. Of particular note is the attempted execution of John Babbacombe Lee in February 1885. Three attempts were made to carry out his execution. All ended in failure as the trap door of the scaffold failed to open. This was despite the fact it had been carefully tested by James Berry, the executioner, beforehand. As a result, Home Secretary Sir William Harcourt commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. Lee continued to petition successive Home Secretaries and was finally released from Exeter prison in 1907. ==Criticisms== In August 1999 a report by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons severely criticised conditions at Exeter prison, with some inmates still having to slop out despite government claims that the practice had been eradicated from all jails three years previously. The report went on to state that Exeter Prison seemed to be \\"at the end of the line\\" and that industrial relations there bordered on anarchy. On 8 July 2002, ex-inmate Gareth Connett broke into Exeter Prison and protested on the roof for four hours, demanding compensation for an alleged injury caused by another inmate. The prison successfully denied liability. A report issued by the Prison Reform Trust in May 2005 stated that Exeter was struggling with the result of overcrowding. The report criticised the lack of meaningful activities at the prison, resulting in inmates spending too much time locked in their cells. The report also noted, however, that Exeter Prison was among the best in the country at helping to rehabilitate offenders. Exeter was highlighted again months later for its overcrowding by the Howard League for Penal Reform, who stated that the prison was running at 70% over capacity. In recent years, Exeter Prison has regularly featured in the Howard League for Penal Reform's list of most crowded prisons in the UK. In 2014, it was revealed that the number of prison staff employed at Exeter Prison had dropped by 32%, yet numbers of inmates still continued to remain as high. A 2013 inspection concluded that there were 'weaknesses and gaps' in the operation of the prison, and that the establishment was 'old and difficult to maintain.' The Independent Monitoring Board found staffing levels (set by the Ministry of Justice) were too low and optimum care of prisoners, specially vulnerable prisoners could not be ensured. Violence and self-harm were at worrying levels. Prisoners with psychiatric issues may need to wait months for a place in a secure mental health unit.Staffing levels could lead to prison violence report finds ITV ==The prison today== HMP Exeter accepts all male adults and young offenders committed to prison by the courts from Cornwall, Devon and West Somerset. The prison offers prisoners employment in the kitchens, waste management, stores and domestic cleaning. Exeter also offers accredited training courses in education, computers, sports and vocational skills that link with local employer requirements. The prison was awarded 'across the board' Grade 2 accreditation by Ofsted in August 2013 for its Learning and Skills provision and continues to drive up the quality of their reducing reoffending services. In May 2018 Peter Clarke put Exeter Prison under an emergency protocol having found the prison, ‚Äúunequivocally poor‚Äù with soaring levels of violence and self-harm. An inspection in May had found high levels of self-harm and 6 suicides, also high levels of assaults against prisoners and staff and high drug use. Clark wrote, ‚ÄúDuring the inspection we saw many examples of a lack of care for vulnerable prisoners which, given the recent tragic events in the prison, were symptomatic of a lack of empathy and understanding of the factors that contribute to suicide and self-harm.‚Äù Clarke maintained prison safety had ‚Äúsignificantly worsened in many respects‚Äù since the August 2016 inspection. Prisoner on prisoner assaults rose by 107% and assaults on staff rose by 60% since the previous inspection. Clarke noted there was a, ‚Äústrong smell‚Äù of drugs in some wings and some prisoners were, ‚Äúclearly under the influence‚Äù. Many cells needed repair with broken windows, leaking toilets and sinks and badly screened toilets. Deborah Coles of Inquest said, ‚ÄúThis cannot be blamed on staffing levels. That serious safety concerns are systematically ignored points to an institutional and shameful indifference to the well-being of prisoners. In any other setting this institution would be closed down.‚Äù ==See also== *Black Assize of Exeter 1586 ==References *Ministry of Justice pages on Exeter *HMP Exeter ‚Äì HM Inspectorate of Prisons Reports Category:Category B prisons in England Category:Category C prisons in England Category:Buildings and structures in Exeter Category:Prisons in Devon Category:1850s establishments in England ","title":"HM Prison Exeter"},{"id":"19316496","text":"Eu4ya is an Italian Eurodance band from Milan. ==History== The band recorded old songs as dance versions.

The vast majority of firearms used by British police are semi-automatic. Police use of force regarding firearms is governed by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). ==Weapons used by Home Office police forces== Firearms used by police officers vary between police forces in the UK.

He made an arrangement with King Malcolm III of Scotland that he could take possession of land on the west coast around which a ship could sail. Magnus declared that Kintyre had \\"better land than the best of the Hebrides\\", and by taking command of his ship's tiller and \\"sailing\\" across the isthmus he was able to claim the entire peninsula, which remained under Norse rule for more than a dozen years as a result.Magnus's saga, chapter 10 in Hollander (1964), pp. 676-677.Murray (1977) p. 100. has the date as 1093.\\"Tarbert History\\" Tarbert.info.

He initially distinguished himself as deputy for his cousin Li Baoyu, and after Li Baoyu's death came into command of his own. He played substantial roles in fighting the rebellions during Emperor Dezong's reign against Zhu Tao, Wang Wujun, Tian Yue, and Li Na; and later in persuading Wang, Tian, and Li to again submit to Emperor Dezong. == Background == An Baozhen was born in 733, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. He was probably the 10th-born son.See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 230 (Wang Wujun's reference to Li Baozhen as \\"Brother Ten\\"). His family was originally from ParthiaNew Book of Tang, vol. 75. but had lived for generations in the Hexi region, and his great-grandfather An Xiuren () was a contributor to Tang Dynasty's establishment, having assisted his brother An Xinggui () in overthrowing one of the contenders for supremacy during the transition from Sui to Tang, Li Gui the Emperor of Liang and united Li Gui's Liang state to Tang. The An family was known for its capability in tending horses, and a number of An family members moved to the region around the Tang capital Chang'an and became students of literature, having intermarried with scholar-bureaucratic families. It was said that An Baozhen was a deep thinker yet decisive. He later served under his third cousin An Baoyu (a great-grandson of An Xinggui's). In 757, during the Anshi Rebellion, An Baoyu requested a surname change because he did not want to share a surname with the rebel Yan state's emperor An Lushan. Emperor Xuanzong's son and successor Emperor Suzong agreed and bestowed the imperial surname of Li on An Baoyu. Presumably, An Baozhen's surname was also changed to Li at the time, as Emperor Suzong also permitted the entire clan to have its designated home changed to the capital Chang'an at the time.New Book of Tang, vol. 138 . == During Emperor Daizong's reign == After Emperor Suzong died in 762 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Daizong, Li Baoyu, who already had a command as a military governor (Jiedushi), was given the additional command of Zelu Circuit (Êæ§ÊΩû, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), and it was said that he valued Li Baozhen's service under him. At one point, Li Baozhen was made the secretary general of Fen Prefecture (Ê±æÂ∑û, in modern Linfen, Shanxi), when it appeared that the general Pugu Huai'en, who controlled the region and commanded the powerful army of Shuofang Circuit (ÊúîÊñπ, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), was set on rebelling against Emperor Daizong. Li Baozhen slipped away in 764 and fled back to Chang'an. When Emperor Daizong asked him for his opinions on what to do with Pugu, Li Baozhen suggested that Emperor Daizong recommission the general Guo Ziyi, who was formerly Pugu's superior as the commander of the Shuofang army, arguing that such a move would undermine the morale of Pugu's army. Emperor Daizong agreed, and subsequently, Pugu did rebel but was unsuccessful. Emperor Daizong, crediting Li Baozhen for his opinions, made him the deputy military governor of both Zelu and Chenzheng (Èô≥ÈÑ≠, headquartered in modern Zhengzhou, Henan) Circuits, both of which were then under Li Baoyu's command. When Li Baozhen met Emperor Daizong to thank him, Li Baozhen, while thanking Emperor Daizong, stated, \\"Whether the people have to labor or can rest depends on their prefect. I would like to receive a prefecture to try myself.\\" Emperor Daizong approved of his volunteering, and, in addition to making him the deputy military governor of Zelu and Chenzheng, also made him the prefect of Ze Prefecture (Êæ§Â∑û, in modern Jincheng, Shanxi), one of the prefectures of Zelu Circuit. He served at Ze Prefecture for two years and then was moved to Huai Prefecture (Êá∑Â∑û, in modern Jiaozuo, Henan), which was merged into Zelu. He served there for eight years. At that time, as Li Baoyu was at Fengxiang (È≥≥Áøî, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) on the western border with Tufan, Li Baozhen was in effective command of Zelu. Li Baozhen believed that, eventually, there would be war against a number of circuits commanded by generals who nominally submitted to Tang authority‚ÄîPinglu (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong), Lulong (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing), Weibo (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), Chengde (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), Zhaoyi (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan), and Shannan East (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), believed that Zelu was in a strategic position and was vulnerable to attack. In the aftermaths of the Anshi Rebellion, however, the circuit was lacking in military manpower, and had no financial resources to recruit soldiers. He thus created an innovative program‚Äîhe selected the strongest of farmers and waived their tax burdens; in exchange, they were to train in archery, and the most capable ones would receive rewards. In three years, he was able to train them sufficiently that he was then able to convert them to an army of 20,000 men. It was said at the time that no other infantry in the realm could rival Zelu's. In 776, after Zhaoyi Circuit was largely seized by Tian Chengsi, the military governor of Weibo Circuit, after the death of its military governor Xue Song, and after the succeeding military governor of the portion of Zhaoyi that came under imperial control, Li Chengzhao (), fell ill, Li Baozhen was given the deputy military governorship of Zhaoyi as well, and Zhaoyi and Zelu were merged. In 777, after Li Baoyu died, Li Baozhen continued to be in command of the merged Zhaoyi Circuit, but still carried the title of deputy military governor. == During Emperor Dezong's reign == Emperor Daizong died in 779 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Dezong. In 780, Emperor Dezong officially made Li Baozhen the military governor of Zhaoyi. In 781, when Emperor Dezong, wanting to reassert imperial authority, refused to allow Li Weiyue to succeed his father Li Baochen as the military governor of Chengde or Li Na to succeed his father Li Zhengji as the military governor of Pinglu, Li Weiyue, Li Na, and Tian Yue the military governor of Weibo rose together against imperial forces. As a part of their operations, Tian attacked Linming (Ëá®Ê¥∫, in modern Handan), then defended by the Zhaoyi general Zhang Pi (). Li Baozhen sought aid from the imperial government, and Emperor Daizong sent the general Ma Sui the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) as well as a commanding general of the imperial Shence Army (), Li Sheng, to aid Li Baozhen. Together, Ma, Li Baozhen, and Li Sheng defeated Tian at Linming, forcing him to flee back to his headquarters at Wei Prefecture. In spring 782, they, along with Li Qiu () the military governor of Heyang Circuit (headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan) again defeated Tian (who was then aided by forces from Pinglu and Chengde as well) at Huan River (Ê¥πÊ∞¥, flowing through modern Handan). It was said that, in the aftermaths of the battle, Tian's subordinate Li Changshun () was ready to surrender Wei Prefecture to imperial forces, but as Ma and Li Baozhen did not get along with each other, their progressed was slowed, and only after 10 days after Tian was able to flee back to Wei Prefecture and kill Li Changchun did the imperial forces arrive at Wei Prefecture, and they were unable to capture it. (Ma and Li Baozhen's grudge against each other had originated when Ma was the defender of Heyang; at that time, there was an occasion when Li Baozhen wanted to kill his subordinate Yang Shu () the prefect of Huai Prefecture; Yang fled to Ma, who not only allowed him to take refuge but further submitted a petition to the emperor to defend Yang.) Later in the year, when Li Weiyue's subordinate Wang Wujun rose against Li Weiyue and killed him, Wang briefly submitted to imperial authorities, but then rebelled when he was not made the military governor of Chengde as Emperor Dezong had implicitly promised. (Emperor Dezong had promised that whoever killed Li Weiyue would receive the positions that Li Weiyue wanted‚Äîbut instead divided Chengde into three circuits, giving Wang the command of Hengji Circuit (ÊÅÜÂÜÄ, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang at the old Chengde headquarters in Heng Prefecture), containing only two prefectures of the seven Chengde prefectures, with the lesser title of military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi), while giving three prefectures to Zhang Xiaozhong, who was made military governor of Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei) and two prefectures to Kang Rizhi () as the military prefect of Shenzhao Circuit (Ê∑±Ë∂ô, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang).) When Wang rose, he attacked Kang's position at Zhao Prefecture. The Ma-Li Baozhen dispute then almost nearly broke into the open when Li Baozhen sent part of his army to defend part of his territory, Xing Prefecture (ÈÇ¢Â∑û, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), which neighbored Zhao Prefecture; this displeased Ma, and Ma considered withdrawing altogether. Only at the moderation of Li Sheng did Ma and Li Baozhen make peace, and Ma's subsequent recommendation, Ming Prefecture (Ê¥∫Â∑û, in modern Handan) was added to Zhaoyi. Subsequently, when Zhu Tao, the deputy military governor of Lulong‚Äîwho had been loyal to imperial authority earlier but who had turned against the imperial government after not given any part of Chengde after Li Weiyue's death‚Äîcame to Tian's aid along with Wang, the imperial forces suffered a major defeat. They had to take up defensive position and were no longer able to threaten Wei Prefecture. Subsequently, the four rebels declared themselves princes‚ÄîZhu declaring himself the Prince of Ji, Wang declaring himself the Prince of Zhao, Tian declaring himself the Prince of Wei, and Li Na declaring himself the Prince of Qi‚Äîeffectively declaring independence, although they continued to use Tang's era name in order to show nominal allegiance. Soon, however, Zhu and Wang had a dispute over Zhu's actions in not returning quickly to Wei Prefecture after he briefly went back to his own circuit to fight off a surprise joint attack by Li Sheng and Zhang Shengyun (ÂºµÊòáÈõ≤, Zhang Xiaozhong's son)‚Äîand Li Baozhen, hearing this, tried to exploit the situation by sending his subordinate Jia Lin () as a messenger to Wang, urging Wang to return to the imperial fold. Wang agreed to do so if Emperor Dezong would issue a general pardon to the rebels, but no pardon came at that time. Still, a secret relationship was created between Li Baozhen and Wang. In fall 783, after not being given rewards after being summoned to Chang'an in anticipation of further service to the east, the army of Jingyuan Circuit (Ê∂áÂéü, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu) rebelled at Chang'an, forcing Emperor Dezong to flee to Fengtian (Â•âÂ§©, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). The Jingyuan army supported Zhu Tao's brother Zhu Ci, then at Chang'an, as emperor of a new state of Qin, and Qin forces subsequently put Emperor Dezong under siege at Fengtian. When this news reached the armies fighting the rebels in the east, the collective Tang forces in the east scattered, with Ma and Li Qiu returning to their circuits, Li Baozhen taking defensive position at Linming, and Li Huaiguang heading toward Chang'an, hoping to save Emperor Dezong. Subsequently, when Tian tried to persuade Wang and Zhu Tao's subordinate Ma Shi () to attack Li Baozhen's position at Linming with him, Li Baozhen had Jia secretly persuade Wang that such a battle would not be to Wang's benefit‚Äîas if Linming fell, it would become part of Weibo territory, while a defeat would damage Hengji's army. Wang thus declined Tian's invitation and returned to Hengji. Subsequently, at Jia's further persuasion‚Äîpointing out that Zhu Tao's title of Prince of Ji showed an implicit ambition to take Wang's Ji Prefecture (ÂÜÄÂ∑û, in modern Hengshui, Hebei) and that Zhu Tao was planning to involve Huige forces and attack south to join with Zhu Ci‚ÄîWang made a secret pact with Li Baozhen and Ma Sui to turn against Zhu Tao. Wang was further able to persuade Tian and LI Na to turn against Zhu Tao as well. In 784, when Wang, Tian, and Li Na publicly renounced their princely titles, Emperor Dezong, then still at Fengtian although no longer under siege by Zhu Ci, accepted Wang's, Tian's, and LI Na's pledge of allegiance and officially made them military governors again, while honoring Li Baozhen with an honorary chancellor title. Tian Yue was subsequently assassinated and succeeded by his cousin Tian Xu, who continued to be aligned with imperial forces. When Zhu Tao and Huige forces subsequently attacked Tian Xu, Li Baozhen and Wang arrived to aid him. It was said, however, that despite the pact, Li Baozhen's army and Wang's army still viewed each other as enemies due to their long-time rivalry, and the armies suspected each other. Li Baozhen, in order to show Wang his good faith, took only a few soldiers with him and went into Wang's camp to meet him, further showing his good faith by sleeping there. Wang, touched by Li Baozhen's display, stated, \\"My body has been promised to Brother Ten and will die for you.\\" Together, they defeated Zhu Tao, forcing him to flee back to Lulong and end his campaign to take over the region. (Zhu Tao subsequently renounced his princely title as well and died shortly thereafter.) For Li Baozhen's contributions, Emperor Dezong created him the Duke of Ni, and then the Prince of Yiyang. After the end of the wars, early in Emperor Dezong's Zhenyuan era (785-805), Li Baozhen visited Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Dezong but returned to Zhaoyi thereafter. In 787, when Emperor Dezong tried to put him in charge of an operation to regain the western prefectures lost to Tufan, Li Baozhen declined. (The Song Dynasty historian Sima Guang attributed this to Li Baozhen being displeased that Emperor Dezong had, earlier in the year, relieved Li Sheng of his military command at the suggestion of the chancellor Zhang Yanshang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 232.) Meanwhile, it was said that Li Baozhen tried to gather talented people to his circuit by sending messengers throughout the realm to look for talented people and entice them with rewards, but that if those people thus retained had few suggestions for him, he would let them leave. As the realm was peaceful at the time, he constructed many pavilions and artificial lakes for his own amusement. He also engaged many alchemists in search of immortality. One of the alchemists that he engaged, Sun Jichang (), made golden pills for him and told him that consuming them would lead to immortality. Li Baozhen trusted Sun‚Äîso much so that he commented to his subordinates, \\"This is something that not even Qin Shi Huang or Emperor Wu of Han was able to have. I will soon be at the court of Shangdi and no longer be among you.\\"Old Book of Tang, vol. 132 . As he then dreamed of riding on a flying crane, he made a wooden crane and practiced riding on it. Eventually, Li Baozhen took a total of 20,000 pills, and it was said that his belly became firm and he was unable to eat. A Taoist monk, Niu Dongxuan (), briefly cured him by giving him lard and laxatives. However, after Li Baozhen was healed, he again listened to Sun, who stated, \\"You have come close to immortality. Why abandon it now?\\" Li Baozhen thereafter took 3,000 more pills and died. Emperor Dezong mourned him for three days and gave him posthumous honors. At the time that Li Baozhen was ill, his son Li Jian () plotted with Li Baozhen's subordinate Lu Huichang () and nephew Yuan Zhongjing () for Li Jian to take over Zhaoyi. After Li Baozhen's death, Yuan acted as if Li Baozhen were still alive and forged an order from Li Baozhen transferring command to Li Jian. Initially, Li Baozhen's deputy Li Shuo () and other subordinates agreed. Lu then forged a petition from Li Baozhen requesting Emperor Dezong to allow Li Jian to succeed Li Baozhen. Emperor Dezong, already hearing rumors that Li Baozhen had died, sent the eunuch Diwu Shoujin () to Zhaoyi, ordering that the command be transferred to Li Baozhen's subordinate Wang Yan'gui (). When Li Jian considered resisting, the other officers would not go along with him, and he gave up the command and went to Luoyang per Emperor Dezong's orders. == Notes and references == * Old Book of Tang, vol. 132. * New Book of Tang, vol. 138. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 223, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 235.

Lord Dunrossil was British High Commissioner to Fiji, Nauru and Tuvalu and later to Barbados. His career reached its peak when he was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda in 1983. While in South Africa he supported Nelson Mandela during his imprisonment by helping him gain a law degree from the University of London. ==Early life and education== Morrison was educated at Fettes College in Edinburgh before serving in the RAF between 1945 and 1948 and reaching the rank of Flight Lieutenant. Between 1948 and 1950 he read History at Oriel College, Oxford; his course being shorter than the usual three years due to the Second World War. He became President of the Conservative Association during his time at Oxford. ==Career== The early years of Morrison's diplomatic career were wide-ranging, including as Assistant Private Secretary to The Viscount Swinton and as First Secretary in Dacca, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). His career would go on to focus mainly on the Commonwealth countries. In February 1961, he inherited the viscountcy of Dunrossil from his father, William Morrison, 1st Viscount Dunrossil, who died in office as the Governor-General of Australia. Dunrossil was posted to South Africa, and was present during the trial of Nelson Mandela and his sentencing to 27 years' imprisonment. He subsequently obtained study materials for Mandela in order that he might achieve a law degree from the University of London. His career reached its peak from 1978 onwards when he was appointed High Commissioner to Fiji, Nauru and Tuvalu. He then became High Commissioner to Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean in 1982 before being appointed Governor and Commander-in- Chief of Bermuda in 1983. His time in Bermuda was very successful mainly, as John Ure argues, due to his \\"genial temperament\\" and \\"social standing\\" meaning that he was able to settle the troubles of the region that had preceded his appointment.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Lord Dunrossil was appointed a Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1981 for his diplomatic service. ==After Bermuda== Upon retirement in 1988, Lord Dunrossil took on several directorships and also played an active part as a cross-bench peer in the House of Lords. He left the House in 1999 as he was not one of the elected hereditary peers allowed to remain in the Lords. Lord Dunrossil therefore devoted himself to spending time at Dunrossil House, his ancestral home in the Outer Hebrides, becoming a Justice of the Peace (JP). He was appointed Lord Lieutenant of the Western Isles in 1993, holding this post until his death in Lanzarote in 2000. ==Personal life== Lord Dunrossil married twice, firstly to Mavis Dawn Spencer-Payne on 3 July 1951. The couple had three sons and one daughter, including his heir, Andrew William Reginald Morrison, who was born in 1953. Mavis, Viscountess Dunrossil, is a governor of the Cotswold School. He divorced his first wife in 1969 and remarried the same year to Diana Mary Cunliffe Vise who became Viscountess Dunrossil upon their marriage.

The proposal was offered as an alternative to an energy bill sponsored by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. House Republicans had attacked the Democratic plan for requiring that new offshore drilling take place at least 50 miles off the US Coast.PA September 12, 2008 This compromise proposal differed from Pelosi's by moving the federally permitted drilling boundary to 100 miles offshore, with states given the option to set it at 50 miles. In what Washington Post calls \\"a key difference with Pelosi's bill\\" they would allow new drilling off Florida's west coast. Also unlike Pelosi's plan, the \\"Gang of 20\\" proposal allows for revenue sharing with the states.Washington Post, September 9, 2008 ==Background and sponsors== This compromise legislation was first proposed on August 1, 2008 by a bipartisan group calling themselves the \\"Gang of 10\\" as the New Energy Reform Act of 2008 or \\"New Era\\".\\"Thune, Gang of 10 Unveil Bipartisan Plan to Reduce Energy Prices\\" [press release] (August 1, 2008). thune.senate.gov. Retrieved 2016-11-26. The group was founded by Senators Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) and Kent Conrad (D-ND) as the \\"Gang of 10\\", but ten additional members have since joined the coalition, creating a \\"Gang of 20\\". This nickname is in response to the 2006 Gang of 14, of which several members in the Gang of 10 were also a part. The original ten included five Republicans (Saxby Chambliss of Georgia (founding member), Bob Corker of Tennessee, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, and John Thune of South Dakota) and five Democrats (Kent Conrad of North Dakota (founding member), Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, and Mark Pryor of Arkansas.) Ten additional members have since joined: five Republicans (Norm Coleman of Minnesota, Susan Collins of Maine, Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina, John Sununu of New Hampshire, and John Warner of Virginia) and five Democrats (Evan Bayh of Indiana, Tom Carper of Delaware, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Ken Salazar of Colorado.) ==The proposal== The plan would allow offshore drilling outside of a 50-mile buffer zone in the Gulf of Mexico as well as along the southeastern coast.The Gang of 20's proposal focuses on several main components: * Increasing access to America's domestic energy reserves by opening additional acreage in the Gulf of Mexico for leasing and giving Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia the option of allowing energy exploration at least 50 miles offshore. * Enhancing conservation through a variety of tax incentives and providing a tax credit of $2,500 for the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles. * Investing $7.5 billion in research and development to break technological barriers to alternative fuel vehicles. * Providing $7.5 billion to help American auto manufacturers become the world's leader in making alternative fuel vehicles. * Initiating a $7,500 tax credit for the purchase of primarily non-petroleum fueled vehicles and a tax credit of up to $2,500 for the retro-fitting of existing vehicles with advanced alternative fuel engines; * Providing a CO2 sequestration credit for use in enhanced oil recovery to increase production from existing wells and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. * Supporting nuclear energy by increasing staff at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, providing workforce training, accelerating depreciation for nuclear plants and supporting research and development on spent fuel recycling to reduce nuclear waste. The $84 billion New Energy Reform Act of 2008 calls for a focused effort to transition the nation's motor vehicle fleets to fuels other than gasoline and diesel. To ease gas prices in the interim, the proposal includes significant conservation provisions, consumer tax credits, and responsible measures to increase domestic production.https://www.senate.gov/~chambliss/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=NewsCenter.PressReleases&ContentRecord;_id=7f7b7506-802a-23ad-47f2-90230d9a7b0d&CFID;=33380804&CFTOKEN;=70066786 The plan also would require cars to become more fuel efficient and would provide research funds for improved batteries to move away from petroleum- products in cars. The proposal calls for 85 percent of vehicles to run on non- petroleum-based fuel in 20 years. The bill would open new areas in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Atlantic to oil and gas drilling, while raising taxes on the major oil companies. Oil companies would be allowed to drill outside of a 50-mile buffer zone off the beaches of Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia ‚Äî if those states agree. To pay for their proposal, the Gang of 10 would raise the major oil companies' taxes by excluding them from tax credits that apply to other manufacturers.http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/5920512.html ==Reaction and criticism== From Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) as reported by Fox News: > This proposal includes some very good ideas to address our country's many > energy-related challenges, and while I do not agree with every part of it, I > very much appreciate the bipartisan spirit in which it was constructed. ... > I am hopeful this plan can begin to break the current legislative stalemate > on the Senate floor. The American people deserve a real debate with > productive Senate action on bipartisan proposals to help make energy more > abundant, secure and affordable for America's families and businesses. The response from Florida, however, has been mixed at best. \\"I compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis. Unfortunately, the proposal would eliminate Florida's 2006 Gulf protections and give Floridians absolutely no voice in determining where exploration could occur,\\" said Sen. Mel Martinez (R-FL). Martinez's Democratic colleague, Florida Senator Bill Nelson, has vowed to filibuster the proposal or any other legislation that would open the waters off Florida's western beach resorts. Both Pelosi's proposal and this $84 billion compromise are strongly opposed by many Republicans, including John McCain, described in Sept 12's Guardian as \\"the plan's biggest opponent.\\" McCain and many others consider the plan too expensive. Furthermore, McCain has made ending restrictions on offshore drilling a centerpiece of his election campaign. \\"I'd call it 40% tax increase, 10% energy and 50% snake oil\\" said Bob Schaffer (R-CO), 2008 Senate candidate. Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel explains, > Republicans like Mr. Schaffer had successfully turned this summer's > political debate into a fight over domestic energy exploration, putting > antidrilling Democrats on defense. Or at least that was the scene until the > 'Gang' ‚Äì five Republicans and five Democrats ‚Äì announced a lackluster > 'drilling' deal that may provide the left the cover it needs to defuse the > energy issue. Rush Limbaugh's voiced a similar objection: > And so, last Friday, in stumbled Sens. Lindsey Graham, John Thune, Saxby > Chambliss, Bob Corker and Johnny Isakson ‚Äî alongside five Senate Democrats. > This 'Gang of 10' announced a 'sweeping' and 'bipartisan' energy plan to > break Washington's energy 'stalemate.' What they did was throw every > vulnerable Democrat, and Mr. Obama, a life preserver. Others questioned the motivation of the proposal's Republican sponsors. \\"The package could prove difficult to resist for Republicans in tight reelection races. Nearly every potentially vulnerable Senate Republican, from Coleman to Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina and John Sununu of New Hampshire, has signed on to the legislation\\" according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Nine of the twenty sponsors (Pryor, Landrieu, Johnson, Chambliss, Collins, Coleman, Sununu, and Graham) are up for re-election this fall. All 10 Republican co- sponsors had earlier pledged their allegiance to Grover Norquist and the Americans for Tax Reform, by signing his anti-tax pledge. Norquist says their participation in this effort violates the terms of that promise because the legislation would increase taxes on oil companies. ==References External links == *'Gang of 10' Introduces Bipartisan Energy Proposal, Sen.

It involves the quenching of singlet excited state chlorophylls (Chl) via enhanced internal conversion to the ground state (non-radiative decay), thus harmlessly dissipating excess excitation energy as heat through molecular vibrations. NPQ occurs in almost all photosynthetic eukaryotes (algae and plants), and helps to regulate and protect photosynthesis in environments where light energy absorption exceeds the capacity for light utilization in photosynthesis. ==Process== Carbon assimilation (red line) tends to saturate at high light intensities, while light absorption (blue line) increases linearly The relationship between irradiance and carbon assimilation for a monoculture of the plankton Woloszynskia halophila at different pH When a molecule of chlorophyll absorbs light it is promoted from its ground state to its first singlet excited state. The excited state then has three main fates. Either the energy is; 1. passed to another chlorophyll molecule by F√∂rster resonance energy transfer (in this way excitation is gradually passed to the photochemical reaction centers (photosystem I and photosystem II) where energy is used in photosynthesis (called photochemical quenching)); or 2. the excited state can return to the ground state by emitting the energy as heat (called non-photochemical quenching); or 3. the excited state can return to the ground state by emitting a photon (fluorescence). In higher plants, the absorption of light continues to increase as light intensity increases, while the capacity for photosynthesis tends to saturate. Therefore, there is the potential for the absorption of excess light energy by photosynthetic light harvesting systems. This excess excitation energy leads to an increase in the lifetime of singlet excited chlorophyll, increasing the chances of the formation of long- lived chlorophyll triplet states by inter-system crossing. Triplet chlorophyll is a potent photosensitiser of molecular oxygen forming singlet oxygen which can cause oxidative damage to the pigments, lipids and proteins of the photosynthetic thylakoid membrane. To counter this problem, one photoprotective mechanism is so-called non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), which relies upon the conversion and dissipation of the excess excitation energy into heat. NPQ involves conformational changes within the light harvesting proteins of photosystem (PS) II that bring about a change in pigment interactions causing the formation of energy traps. The conformational changes are stimulated by a combination of transmembrane proton gradient, the PsbS subunit of photosystem II and the enzymatic conversion of the carotenoid violaxanthin to zeaxanthin (the xanthophyll cycle). Violaxanthin is a carotenoid downstream from chlorophyll a and b within the antenna of PS II and nearest to the special chlorophyll a located in the reaction center of the antenna. As light intensity increases, acidification of the thylakoid lumen takes place. This acidification leads to the protonation of the PsbS subunit of PS II. Along with the activation of enzyme violaxanthin de-epoxidase which eliminates an epoxide and forms an alkene on a six-member ring of violaxanthin giving another carotenoid known as antheraxanthin. Violaxanthin contains two epoxides each bonded to a six-member ring and when both are eliminated by de- epoxidase the carotenoid zeaxanthin is formed. Only violaxanthin is able to transport a photon to the special chlorophyll a. Antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin dissipate the energy from the photon as heat preserving the integrity of photosystem II. This dissipation of energy as heat is one form of non- photochemical quenching. For further discussion, see Chlorophyll fluorescence and Plant stress measurement. ==Measurement of NPQ== Non-photochemical quenching is measured by the quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence and is distinguished from photochemical quenching by applying a bright light pulse to transiently saturate photochemical quenching thus removing its contribution from the observed quenching. Non-photochemical quenching is not affected if the pulse of light is short. During this pulse, the fluorescence reaches the level reached in the absence of any photochemical quenching, known as maximum fluorescence, F_m. For further discussion, see Measuring chlorophyll fluorescence and Plant stress measurement. Chlorophyll fluorescence can easily be measured with a chlorophyll fluorometer. Some fluorometers can calculate NPQ and photochemical quenching coefficients (including qP, qN, qE and NPQ), as well as light and dark adaptation parameters (including Fo, Fm, and Fv/Fm). == See also == *Chlorophyll fluorescence *Measuring chlorophyll fluorescence *Integrated fluorometer ==References== Category:Photosynthesis ","title":"Non-photochemical quenching"},{"id":"19316616","text":"James Flood Building, San Francisco Albert Pissis (1852‚Äì1914) was a prolific San Francisco architect who studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France and is credited with introducing the Beaux-Arts architectural style to San Francisco, California, designing a number of important buildings in the city in the years before and after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. ==Life and career== Pissis was born on April 26, 1852, to a French father and a Mexican mother in Guaymas in the Mexican state of Sonora. His father, a physician, moved the family to San Francisco, California, in the United States, when Pissis was six. He was one of the first Americans to study at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France. He returned in 1880 to San Francisco, which at the time was a fairly provincial western town despite its wealth, with buildings designed in a variety of architectural styles. In 1882 Pissis became a member of the American Institute of Architects and, with partner William P. Moore, designed a number of buildings in flamboyant Queen Anne and Eastlake styles. However, by the 1890s he was a major figure in the Neoclassical (Classical Revival) movement, particularly Beaux-Arts, and introduced that style to San Francisco beginning with the Hibernia Bank building in 1892. Initially considered revolutionary, the style became popular among the city's powerful commercial and banking concerns. The dome he designed for the Emporium Department Store, now part of the Westfield San Francisco Centre, is often considered a \\"masterpiece\\". Pissis played a major role in San Francisco's reconstruction following the Great Earthquake of 1906, both as a designer of a number of the city's landmark buildings, and as a member of the Committee of Fifty. He was also President of the local AIA chapter from 1907 to 1908. Although popular and internationally known at the time, Pissis's approach to design was derided by later critics as reactionary, and blamed for suppressing more original architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Sullivan in favor of imitation of older European traditions. However, in more recent years his buildings have been increasingly praised. Pissis died of pneumonia at age 62, in his suite at the St. Francis Hotel. He was survived by his widow, Georgia, who in 1920 sold land to Redwood City, California, that became Sequoia High School. ==Notable works== dome at the old Emporium department store in San Francisco Among the buildings Pissis designed are: *Hibernia Bank building at McAllister and Jones streets in San Francisco *The Emporium department store (originally called the \\"Parrot Building\\" and home of the California Supreme Court), now part of the Westfield San Francisco Centre. *James Flood Building at Market and Powell Street in San Francisco, California. *White House Department Store (now Banana Republic store and White House Garage) at Grant and Sutter Street, San Francisco, California. *Temple Sherith Israel in Pacific Heights, San Francisco *Mechanics' Institute Library, San Francisco, California *University House, Berkeley *the Bank of Eureka BuildingClarke Historical Museum ==References== Category:1852 births Category:1914 deaths Category:19th-century French architects Category:20th- century French architects Category:American alumni of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts Category:Architects from San Francisco ","title":"Albert Pissis"},{"id":"19316620","text":"Albert-Georges-Yves Malbois (17 November 1915 ‚Äì 12 February 2017) was a French prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. ==Biography== Malbois was born in Versailles, France, and was ordained to the priesthood on 29 June 1938 in the Diocese of Versailles.

Harris County, 529 U.S. 576 (2000), is a Supreme Court of the United States case holding that a county's policy of requiring employees to schedule time off to avoid accruing time off was not prohibited by the Fair Labor Standards Act. ==Background== The Supreme Court addressed in the case whether the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. ¬ß 201 et seq., forbids a public employer from requiring its employees to use their accumulated compensatory time, absent a pre-existing agreement authorizing compelled use. Compensatory time provides employees time off work with full pay and is granted to employees in lieu of a cash payment for overtime work. The FLSA provides a statutory cap specifying the maximum number of compensatory hours that an employee may accrue prior to an employer's obligation to provide an employee with a cash payment for overtime hours worked. See ¬ß 207(o)(3)(A). In particular, Title 29 U.S.C. ¬ß 207(o)(5) provides: > An employee ‚Ä¶ (A) who has accrued compensatory time off ‚Ä¶, and (B) who has > requested the use of such compensatory time, shall be permitted by the > employee‚Äôs employer to use such time within a reasonable period after making > the request if the use of the compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the > operations of the public agency. Here, the Sheriff's Department of Harris County, Texas, fearing a budget crisis due to the number of hours of compensatory time accrued by its deputy sheriffs, adopted a policy that required its employees to use their accrued compensatory time in order for the county to avoid being required to provide employees with a cash payment for overtime hours worked as pursuant to the statutory cap provision. Harris County wrote to the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor for advice on the merits of their policy as a legal matter in regard to the FLSA. In response, the Acting Administrator of the Division sent an opinion letter to the Harris County stating that the county's policy violated the FLSA. Consequently, petitioners, Edward Christensen and 128 other deputy sheriffs of Harris County, sued the county, claiming that the FLSA prohibited the implementation of the county's policy. The District Court agreed with the petitioners and ruled in their favor by granting summary judgement and entered a declaratory judgement that the county's policy violated the FLSA. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the District Court's decision, explaining that the FLSA did not address the particular issue raised in the county's policy regarding the compelled use of compensatory time and, as a result, held that the FLSA does not prohibit Harris County from implementing such a policy. The petitioners appealed. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in Christensen because there was division on the issue among the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth and Ninth Circuits. The Court decided Christensen on May 1, 2000. Just a few weeks later, on May 30, 2000, the Court granted certiorari in United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218 (2001). ==Decision== The Court held that an opinion letter from the Department of Labor, stating that an employer had to get the employee to agree first before it required the employee to schedule time off, did not receive Chevron deference and instead should receive the less deferential standard of Skidmore v. Swift & Co. The majority attempted to draw a bright line between formal agency documents (such as legislative rules) and less formal ones (such as opinion letters). Therefore, the opinion letter of the Department of Labor was not binding on the court. The court went on to state that there is nothing in the FLSA that prohibited the forced use of compensation time. Justice Thomas delivered the 6-3 decision of the court in favor of Harris County. In regards to the substantive issue, the Court holds: Section 207(o)(5) of the FLSA does not prohibit employers from requiring employees to utilize their accrued compensatory time.Christensen v. Harris Cty., 529 U.S. 576, 583 (2000); Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. ¬ß207(o)(5) In Section II of the opinion, J. Thomas addresses the Petitioners' statutory interpretation argument, that employers are statutorily prohibited under 207(o)(5) from requiring employees to utilize accrued compensatory time.Christensen v. Harris Cty., supra note 1, at 582-87 (J. Thomas‚Äôs majority opinion) While acknowledging that \\"nothing in the FLSA expressly prohibits a State or subdivision thereof from compelling employees to utilize accrued compensatory time,\\" both the Petitioners, and the United States as amicus curiae, argued that the FLSA implicitly prohibits such practice.Id. at 582 J Thomas states that Petitioner's argument of implicit prohibition relies on the canon of expressio unius est exclusio alterius.Id. J. Thomas further states that under such canon, the Petitioners contend that the \\"express grant of control to employees to use compensatory time‚Ä¶implies that all other methods of spending compensatory time are precluded.\\"Id. at 582-83 J. Thomas rejects the Petitioners‚Äô argument. Implying that the Court accepts the expressio unius canon of interpretation, J. Thomas cites to Raleigh & Gaston R. CO. v. Reid, decided in 1872, and states that the Court accepts the proposition that \\"[w]hen a statute limits a thing to be done in a particular mode, it includes a negative of any other mode.\\"Christensen v. Harris Cty., supra note 1, at 583 (citing Raleigh & Gaston R. Co. v. Reid, 13 Wall. 269, 270 (1872)) J. Thomas, pulling dicta from Reid, defines the \\"thing to be done\\" not as the \\"expenditure of compensatory time,\\" but rather as \\"a minimal guarantee that an employee will be able to make some use of compensatory time when he requests to use it.\\"Id. at 583 J. Thomas concludes that the proper implied prohibition is: in the absence of an agreement, an employer may not deny an employee's request for a reason other than \\"undue disruption.\\" Accordingly, the statute does not prohibit an employee from requiring employees to utilize accrued compensatory time.Id. J. Thomas supports this interpretation by discussing a number of statutory interpretation principles; first, the statutory schema supports the conclusion that the relevant statute is \\"better read\\" as a \\"safeguard\\" rather than an \\"exclusive method\\"; second, protections given in nearby provisions support such a reading; third, Petitioner's interpretation would effectively nullify amendments made to FLSA by Congress; fourth, the relevant statute is silent on the issue.Id. at 583-84 Lastly, J. Thomas argues that the FLSA in fact grants employers affirmative authority to regulate an employee's compensatory time: ‚ÄúFirst, employers remain free under the FLSA to decrease the number of hours that employees work. Second, the FLSA permits the employer to cash out accumulated compensatory time by paying the employee his regular hourly wage for each hour accrued.‚ÄùId. at 584-85 ===Concurring opinions=== Justice Scalia joined the judgment of the Court and all of its opinion except Part III. Justice Scalia deviated from the majority because the Court determined that the position of the Department of Labor warranted ‚ÄúSkidmore‚Äù deference rather than ‚ÄúChevron‚Äù deference. The Court explained an opinion letter does not carry the same effect as a formal adjudication or notice-and-comment rule which would receive ‚ÄúChevron‚Äù deference. Justice Scalia disagreed. He coined Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944) as an anachronism which has been since vitiated by Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Justice Scalia believed that Chevron deference was the only standard which could be applied. Footnote five illustrates this position: > deference can be inapplicable for only three reasons: (1) the statute is > unambiguous, so there is no room for administrative interpretation; (2) no > interpretation has been made by personnel of the agency responsible for > administering the statute; or (3) the interpretation made by such personnel > was not authoritative, in the sense that it does not represent the official > position of the expert agency. All of these reasons preclude Skidmore > deference as well. . . . Chevron establishes a presumption that ambiguities > are to be resolved (within the bounds of reasonable interpretation) by the > administering agency. Christensen, 529 U.S. at n.5. (emphasis added). > Therefore, argued that not only was no longer the standard but even if it > was still applicable there could was not a circumstance that would warrant > its application. Justice Scalia agreed with the Court that the Dept. of > Labor‚Äôs opinion letter was insufficient to trigger ‚ÄúChevron‚Äù deference, > however, there he believed there was other information available to warrant > application of the standard: But the Solicitor General of the United States, > appearing as an amicus in this action, has filed a brief, cosigned by the > Solicitor of Labor, which represents the position set forth in the opinion > letter to be the position of the Secretary of Labor. That alone, even > without existence of the opinion letter, would in my view entitle the > position to Chevron deference. Id. As such, Justice Scalia believed that the position of the Department of Labor should be given Chevron deference. One year later 5 Justices in the subsequent term the Court adopted Justice Thomas‚Äô opinion in Part III of Christensen v. Harris County which had the effect of summarily dismissing Justice Scalia's concurrence. Due to Justice Scalia's refusal to join Justice Thomas‚Äô opinion as it pertains to Part III, this part of the opinion does not represent the views of the Court but only the four justices who signed onto this part. Nonetheless, Part III is important to understand because it influenced the direction the Court took in future cases. In Part III of the opinion, Justice Thomas‚Äô concluded that the Department of Labor's opinion letter is not entitled to a Chevron deference because opinion letters are similar to ‚Äúpolicy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which lack the force of law‚Äù and, as such, are not entitled to a Chevron deference. Instead, Justice Thomas ruled that opinion letters are only ‚Äúentitled to respect‚Äù under a Skidmore deference only if the opinion is persuasive. Applying this rationale, Justice Thomas held that the Department of Labor's opinion letter are not persuasive and, as such, do not warrant a Skidmore deference. In reaching this conclusion, Justice Thomas argued that the opinion letter centered on the issue of compelled compensatory time, which is an issue that the regulation in question does not address. In particular, Justice Thomas pointed out that the regulation only provides that the ‚Äúagreement between the employer or employee may include other provisions governing the preservation, use‚Ä¶.of compensatory time.‚Äù Focusing on ‚Äúmay‚Äù, Justice Thomas concluded that since the regulation was written in a ‚Äúpermissive‚Äù tone and not a commanding term, the opinion letter's command that the employer must gain the employee's approval before mandating that employee's use their compensatory time is not persuasive and as such is not afforded a Skidmore deference. ==Dissent== Stevens J dissented: > In my judgment, the fact that no employer may lawfully make any use of \\"comp > time\\" without a prior agreement with the affected employees is of critical > importance in answering the question whether a particular method of using > that form of noncash compensation may be imposed on those employees without > their consent. Because their consent is a condition without which the > employer cannot qualify for the exception from the general rule, it seems > clear to me that their agreement must encompass the way in which the > compensatory time may be used. [...] The Court concludes that expressio > unius does not help petitioners because the \\"thing to be done\\" as prescribed > by the statute (and because of which all other \\"things\\" are excluded) is > simply a guarantee that employees will be allowed to make some use of > compensatory time upon request, rather than an open-ended promise that > employees will be able to choose (subject only to the \\"reasonable time\\" > limitation) how to spend it. Ibid. This description of the debate misses the > primary thrust of petitioners' position. They do not, as the Court implies, > contend that employers generally must afford employees essentially unlimited > use of accrued comp time under the statute; the point is rather that rules > regarding both the availability and the use of comp time must be contained > within an agreement. The \\"thing to be done\\" under the Act is for the parties > to come to terms. It is because they have not done so with respect to the > use of comp time here that the county may not unilaterally force its > expenditure. The case was argued on behalf of the United States by Matthew D. Roberts, for the petitioner by Michael T. Leibig and for Harris County, Texas by Michael P. Fleming. ==NotesSources== Christensen v.

Recurring games included the \\"Mother-Grams,\\" a series of poems that alluded to a historical or fictional character that the mother had to guess in order to win a small prize, and \\"Rhyme Games,\\" in which James would canvass the audience, get a mother to start a sentence, and James would have to finish it with a rhyme or else give the mother a prize (in the lone surviving episode, James complains that the same difficult-to-rhyme \\"trick words\\" would often come up day after day, which he would often reject if caught). The series was an early example of demographics and dayparting: as daytime television audiences were expected to be mostly stay-at-home mothers, Dumont commissioned the series specifically to target that audience. The series was sponsored by Bayer, who advertised Phillips' Milk of Magnesia Toothpaste, Double Danderine dandruff shampoo, and Bayer Aspirin on the existing 1950 episode. James often addressed the TV audience as \\"Mother\\", a practice he had begun when discussing the finer points of wrestling during his sports broadcasts. By addressing the TV audience this way, James avoided insulting sports fans at home or elsewhere about their knowledge of sports.Dennis James ==Episode status== One DuMont episode survives and is available on the Internet Archive, with \\"honor mother\\" Judith Doniger Lipsey (1912‚Äì2007) mentioning her upcoming New York City recital on October 12.

The film features Gast√≥n Pauls, Pablo Ribba, C√©sar Albarrac√≠n and Hugo Carrizo among others. It is based on a book written by a veteran of the war. The film was nominated for 22 awards and won 14 of them. ==Plot== Blessed By Fire is the story of two young men who were sent to fight the 1982 war in the Falkland Islands and who return home bearing the brutal scars of war. Twenty years after the war's end, journalist Esteban Leguizam√≥n (Gast√≥n Pauls) is informed that Alberto Vargas (Pablo Ribba), one of the men he served with, has attempted suicide after suffering from years of depression brought on by his experiences in the war. Esteban visits the comatose Vargas at the hospital, and in a series of extended flashbacks, revisits the scene of Argentina's \\"unwinnable war.\\" The film depicts Esteban and fellow soldiers Vargas (Pablo Ribba, the man in the coma) and Juan (Cesar Albarracin), who are living in foxholes on the remote, windswept Falklands, battling hunger, boredom, abuse, and the deprivations of war as they await the arrival of British forces. A series of harrowing battle scenes with British forces ensues, and the Argentines realise the futility and violence of their mission. They are cannon fodder, pawns in a futile political game. Back in the present, Esteban returns to the Falklands to come to terms with himself and the past. The emotional final scenes were shot on location in the Falklands, for the first time in Argentine film. As Esteban looks over the still off- limits battlefields filled with mines, live ammunition, and rusting military equipment, the futility of war is abundantly clear. ==Cast== * Gast√≥n Pauls as Esteban Leguizam√≥n * Pablo Ribba as Alberto Vargas * C√©sar Albarrac√≠n as Juan Chamorro * Victor Hugo Carrizo as Pizarro * Virginia Innocenti as Maria Vargas * Juan Leyrado * Arturo Bon√≠n == Release == The film was shown on the Australian TV channel SBS on March 17, 2009. ==Awards== Silver Condor: Graciela Fraguglia, Alejandro Brodersohn, Trist√°n Bauer, Edgardo Esteban, Miguel Bonasso, Gustavo Romero Borri, Virginia Innocenti. ==External links== * * * Iluminados por el fuego at the cinenacional.com Category:2000s war drama films Category:2005 films Category:Anti-war films Category:Argentine films Category:Argentine war drama films Category:Falklands War films Category:Films about journalists Category:Films about suicide Category:Films based on non- fiction books Category:Films set in Argentina Category:Films about hunters Category:Nonlinear narrative films Category:Films about post-traumatic stress disorder Category:Spanish films Category:Spanish war drama films Category:Spanish-language films Category:2000s political drama films Category:2000s buddy films Category:2005 drama films ","title":"Blessed by Fire"},{"id":"19316819","text":"Metal Storm (also known as MetalStorm.net, MetalStorm.ee, MetalStorm.eu or just MS) is a webzine specializing in various forms of heavy metal music. It is based in Tallinn, Estonia but caters to an international audience, symbolically recognized by the acquisition of an EU domain in 2008. As of June 2013, the website hosts 7,812 band profiles, 7,800 reviews, 553 interviews and 16,753 news items. ==CommunityMembers=== Metal Storm users can register for free and create a custom profile based on their specific preferences. The comprehensive profile format allows for users to display detailed information about their musical taste, activity on the site, and other miscellaneous information, including up to three photos. \\"Community Points\\" are awarded to users for contributing forum reports, band info, lyrics, news, events, reviews, and articles, with the number awarded depending on the value of the contribution. Users may also add albums to their \\"Collection,\\" an interactive list of albums acquired, of which statistics can be graphically visualized in the form of pie charts broken down by style and country. These lists, along with the favorite bands and ratings categories, are analyzed to compare users and match those with similar musical tastes in the \\"Neighbours\\" area of the Collection tab. ===Forum=== Metal Storm has a forum available to all registered members. The forum is divided into many categories, including sections for discussing specific metal styles, non-metal music, general discussion and community-related topics. All comments for publications on the site are also incorporated into the forum for the purpose of convenience. The forums are moderated for spam and illegal content such as pornography and copyright infringement but are otherwise uncensored. This has caused issues with a number of posters including at least one staff member engaging in both racist and misogynistic comments, including Islamophobia. ===Tradelist=== In each member's Collection section, they have the option of making the album part of their regular collection, their wishlist or part of their tradelist. Members can then browse other member's tradelists and privately negotiate the trade of albums. Metal Storm states that the trading of albums is to be done at the member's own risk and that the site won't be responsible for any outcomes. ==Bands database== Metal Storm features a database of metal bands, with each band having a detailed profile including such information as a biography, discography, lineup, genre categorization, photo, logo and more. All registered members are able to edit the database and submit information that is missing. Before being published, community edits are moderated by members of the staff. === Genre categorization === Heavy metal is divided into three broad sub-categories on Metal Storm. Bands that fall in between two sub- categories are usually allocated based on what elements are historically more prominent in their music though there is no strict enforcement of any rules. ;Melodic metal This sub-category includes the heavy metal genres such as heavy metal, power metal, progressive metal, glam metal, doom metal, gothic metal, folk metal, speed metal and symphonic metal. ;Extreme metal This sub-category includes the heavy metal genres such as black metal, death metal, grindcore, thrash metal, and groove metal. ‚ÄúExtreme doom metal‚Äù bands are also included in this sub-category. ;Alternative metal This sub-category includes the heavy metal genres such as alternative metal, nu metal, metalcore, stoner metal, sludge metal, post-metal, rap metal, industrial metal, avant-garde metal and drone metal. ===Accepted content=== Metal Storm is known for its relatively relaxed attitude towards accepting bands that are not unquestionably categorized as metal. The database allows for 'invisible' profiles, which is a term used for profiles that are either incomplete or of bands that do not have enough metal elements to have them featured on the site. These profiles are still publicly accessible; however, they are not promoted as much as those of bands that are unquestionably metal. Nevertheless, Metal Storm still has visible profiles for stylistically ambiguous bands such as Slipknot, Candiria and Led Zeppelin. Moreover, there are many reviews of stylistically ambiguous bands on the site, most commonly from the genres of gothic rock, noise rock, industrial music, hard rock, progressive rock, AOR and darkwave. This attitude is rationalized as being an attempt at promoting open mindedness amongst metal fans. Though this seems contradicted by Nu-Metal bands being deliberately excluded from the site. == Rating system and reviews == Members have the option to rate featured albums on a scale of 1-10, with the total votes from all members producing an average rating. Studio albums with over 200 votes are eligible to be included in the \\"Top 200 albums\\" list, while others that accumulate 20 votes are eligible for more specific lists including \\"Top 20 albums by year\\", \\"Top albums by style\\", and \\"Bottom albums\\" (The lowest-on- average user rated albums). Live albums and DVDs are also eligible for their respective lists after receiving 20 votes. Metal Storm has a team of official reviewers who receive albums from labels and bands and then post official reviews of them on the front page of the website. Nevertheless, all registered users are able to submit reviews of albums, provided that they are of music that has been released for at least 3 months. If accepted by the editors, these reviews are then posted as \\"Guest Reviews\\" with an appropriate disclaimer attached to them. As such quality of reviews vary in terms of writing style, subjectivity and even standards of spelling and grammar. This is especially the case with past reviews. The number of reviews on the website has declined in recent years with much of the emphasis being on promoting staff favorite bands as opposed to providing a more broad outlook. An event is considered a \\"Supported Event\\" by Metal Storm if the organizers allow for Press Accreditation for an official reviewer from the website. The event then receives an official review with photographs. Like album reviews, concert reviews are also accepted from users; however, such events are not considered Supported Events. In 2008 MetalStorm became one of the official partners of the French festival HellFest and a number of the interviews conducted by MS staff on the festival will feature on the upcoming HellFest DVD. The partnership is continued in 2009. == Metal Storm Awards == Metal Storm hosts an annual award, where they appoint the album of the year for the different genres of metal. The official 10 nominees of each category are decided by the staff members and receives a brief description and if available a link to an official MetalStorm review. In additions to the official nominees, the users have the opportunity to supply \\"write-in\\" votes for bands not officially nominated. There has been some controversy in how the official nominees are chosen with staff deliberately trying to steer voting away from releases by popular bands in favour of their own preferences. This has included putting albums in incorrect categories. For example 2015 awards saw the official nomination of Tribulation's The Children of the Night album in death metal category despite the album not having any of the stylistic components associated with death metal. There is also a special award each year called \\"Best drama\\". It's given to the band, who is considered to have provided a good drama the year in question. The drama award is generally only in sarcasm and not considered a \\"serious award\\". In 2007, the award was given to Gorgoroth for the fight over the rights to the name Gorgoroth. In 2008, the award for best drama went to \\"Metal Storm vs. Wikipedia,\\" or, as the nomination reworded it, the conflict between \\"the staff of Metal Storm and the uberposeurs of Wikipedia.\\" This revolved around the \\"drama\\" with the conflict about Metal Storm's Wikipedia page reaching Wikipedia's standards of notability. It was the first year that this award has been able to be voted for by Metal Storm users, with various dramas listed as nominees. In the past the Metal Storm staff have just chosen the drama award themselves. Every year Metal Storm contacts all the bands nominated for awards in each category and a lot of bands post their nomination and award wins as news on their official websites.Ensiferum news section Kamelot news archive Regarding the 2008 awards, news of Oceans of Sadness' victory in the avant- garde metal category was printed in the Belgian/Flemish newspaper \\"Gazet Van Antwerpen.\\" The online version of the newspaper also published it. The Metal Storm Awards in 2008 was the fourth year that the awards have been running. ==References * Metal Storm official site * Metal Storm European Domain Category:Heavy metal publications Category:Online music magazines Category:Magazines established in 2000 Category:Estonian music websites Category:Mass media in Tallinn Category:2000 establishments in Estonia ","title":"Metal Storm (webzine)"},{"id":"19316823","text":"Abraham Barak Salem (1882‚Äì1967) was an Indian nationalist and Zionist,PANEL 39: Nationalisms and their Impact in South Asia - European Association of South Asian Studies a lawyer and politician, and one of the most prominent Cochin Jews of the twentieth century. A descendant of meshuchrarim, he was the first Cochin Jew to become an attorney. He practised in Ernakulam, where he eventually used satyagraha to fight the discrimination among Jews against his people. An activist in the trade union and Indian national causes, he later was attracted to Zionism. After visiting Palestine in the 1930s, he later helped arrange the migration of most Cochin Jews to Israel by 1955. He stayed in Kochi for the remainder of his life. ==Early life== Salem was born in 1882 to a Jewish family in Cochin (Kingdom of Cochin ), then a princely state in British India and now part of the Indian state of Kerala. His family were regarded as meshuchrarim, a Hebrew word used, sometimes neutrally and sometimes with derogatory intent, to denote a manumitted slave or her descendants. The Paradesi [foreign] Jews of Cochin had arrived there since the 16th-century following the expulsion of Jews from Spain. They discriminated against the meshuchrarim in their community who were relegated to a subordinate position in the Paradesi Synagogue in Cochin. Given the cultural differences between them, the Paradesi (or \\"White\\") Jews and the older communities of Malabari Jews also maintained ethnic distinctions for centuries, which became associated historically with differences in skin colour. Brought up by his mother, Salem attended the Maharaja's College in Ernakulam. He moved to Chennai to earn his Bachelor of Arts degree, becoming the first university graduate among the meshuchrarim.Katz 2000:67 Whilst in Chennai he also earned his law degree, the first Jew from Cochin to do so,T. V. R. Shenoy, \\"The Jewish Gandhi and Barack Obama\\", Rediff, 8 September 2008 before returning to practise as a lawyer in the Cochin Chief Court in Ernakulam. ==Activism== The Malabari Jews had seven places of worship; the White Jews had one, the Paradesi Synagogue, which for centuries had been barred to those whom they considered impure. The contemporary historian Edna Fernandes calls it \\"a bastion of white purity\\".Fernandes 2008:155 The White Jews practised endogamous marriage, which excluded both the meshuchrarim and Malabari Jews (who also practised endogamy that excluded the other groups). The meshuchrarim had to sit in the back of the synagogue or outside. The separation resembled Indian discrimination against lower castes, which was sometimes repeated in Christian churches in India. Salem fought against this discrimination by boycotting the synagogue for a time. He used satyagraha (or non-violent protest) as a means of combating discrimination within the community. This led some people to later refer to him as the \\"Jewish Gandhi\\".\\"A Kochi dream died in Mumbai\\", Indian Express, 13 December 2008 By the mid-1930s, Mandelbaum reported that many of the old taboos had fallen, reflecting wider changes in Indian society as well.Fernandes 2008:164 Salem served in the Legislative Council in the princely state of Cochin from 1925 to 1931 and again from 1939 to 1945. A supporter of the nascent trade union movement in Kerala and an active Indian nationalist, at the end of 1929 he attended the Lahore session of the Indian National Congress. It passed a resolution calling for complete independence from the Raj. After visiting Palestine in 1933, Salem was attracted to the Zionist cause. After Indian independence, he worked to promote aliyah to Israel among the Cochin Jews. In 1953, he visited Israel to negotiate on behalf of Indian Jews who wanted to migrate. This also helped to diminish the divisions among the Cochin Jews.Chiriyankandath 2008:21 After emigration they were all considered foreigners to Israel, and many struggled to assimilate. Although most of Cochin's ancient Jewish community eventually left for Israel by 1955 (and, in the case of many White Jews, for North America and England), Salem lived in Cochin until his death in 1967. He was buried in the White Jewish cemetery in Jew Town in Cochin. ==Honours== *The road adjacent to the White Jewish Cemetery in Kochi was named after Salem. ==FootnotesReferences== *James Chiriyankandath (2008). \\"Nationalism, religion and community: A.

The island of Eilean Ceann na Creige, off the south shore, is connected to the mainland by a causeway. It is the ferry terminal for Islay. ==History== Around the year 1093, Magnus Barefoot, King of Norway had his longship dragged across the isthmus at Tarbert between West Loch Tarbert and East Loch Tarbert as part of a campaign to increase his possessions in the Hebrides. He made an arrangement with King Malcolm III of Scotland that he could take possession of land on the west coast around which a ship could sail. Magnus declared that Kintyre had \\"better land than the best of the Hebrides\\", and by taking command of his ship's tiller and \\"sailing\\" across the isthmus he was able to claim the entire peninsula, which remained under Norse rule for more than a dozen years as a result.Murray, W.H. (1977) The Companion Guide to the West Highlands of Scotland. London. Collins. p. 100. ==Ferry services== In the 1960s, Western Ferries began operating a car ferry, with a simple stern-loading ramp, from Kennacraig on the south shore. This served Port Askaig on Islay, in competition with the mail steamer, operated by MacBraynes from West Tarbert near the head of the loch. The new service soon won a significant share of the traffic and stimulated MacBraynes to modernise the Islay route. In January 1970, hoist-loading MV Arran was transferred from the Clyde. She gave two daily return sailings, one each to Port Ellen and Port Askaig, as well as sailings to Craighouse on Jura, Gigha and Colonsay. Over the winter 1972/73, Arran's hoist and side-ramps were removed, along with the superstructure aft of them. She was converted to a stern-loading vessel, with a stern ramp and an open car deck. In this guise, she took on a new timetable ‚Äì three double crossings a day between modified terminals at Port Ellen and West Loch Tarbert. Port Askaig was left to Western Ferries. With the introduced of in August 1974, CalMac started to win back Islay traffic. Over the next five years Pioneer became well established, running to Port Ellen and Gigha. In 1978, Caledonian MacBrayne took over the Western Ferries terminal at Kennacraig, with the deeper-draught MV Iona, again providing a service to both Port Ellen and Port Askaig, as well as calling at Gigha.

It was produced by and starred Dev Anand. It co-starred Suraiya, who also recorded the playback singing for the film. The film was based on Nikolai Gogol's play The Government Inspector. Afsar was the first film produced under the Navketan Films banner. == Plot == The story is skillfully set in the last era of British rule when after several historical land reforms in the subcontinent, the government faced the gigantic problem of assessing the actual incomes of landlords to net them in for state revenues. For purpose of direct assessments revenue officers were deputed, while for a larger number of indirect assessments, persons were sent and dispersed to villages in disguise of varying professions and for longer periods to secretly make their own assessment of on the spot realities and of actual sources and incomes. Dev Anand a smart but long unemployed city youth unaware of the fact that persons have been secretly deputed in disguise to villages, goes along with an illiterate quirky assistant and with no equipment, bare straw furniture and with not even the barest of medical knowledge goes to a village and sets up a dispensary as a last attempt at livelihood. Soon the ludicrous village simpletons of various sizes and shapes with rustic attires, accents and ways, a real entertainment to watch in the film, finding Dev Anand far removed from their lot, start spying on his activities, peeping in the dispensary through its falling windows and holes, and begin to spin up tales of him being of the disguised agents rumored to have been sent to assess incomes and their sources, and cook up their stories so convincingly that the owner of the entire village, the landlord, already under fear of losing some of his income and even property to the state, believes his men and their tales. He invites Dev Anand to his impressive haveli, gives him a reception and respect and starts discussions on some medical issues. However the unconvincing, na√Øve and evasive replies of Dev Anand on medicine further leads the landlord to believe that he is really the agent sent by the state to rope him and his vast income. He offers Dev Anand to stay at his haveli and Dev by now having realized what his is being mistaken for, starts skillfully playing his mistaken identity or rather misperceived identity. The landlord introduces Dev Anand made purposely as a permanent guest to his daughter who is learning dancing and music, and she entertains Dev Anand with some classical songs and dances which are a part of the film. Without much time and effort while staying at the haveli Dev Anand seduces her by his charms into a relationship without thinking of the consequences. The landlord had been advised by his men that whatever reports Dev Anand sends to his superiors in the city will necessarily go through the village post office where by design it can be checked and brought back to the landlord to have him see its contents. Call it misfortune or climax to come Dev Anand sends a letter to a friend in his city, narrating to him how he is enjoying in the village due to a mistaken identity. He also comments on each, the landlord his daughter and village folk, and their idiosyncrasies in the most humorous and somewhere disparaging words. This letter by scheme lands back in the hands of the landlord and read in a village gathering. Dev Anand is also informed by some one of the letter falling into the villagers hands, and he plans to escape. However he confides to the landlords daughter that he is not the one they all are thinking to be, but is just an unemployed miserable young man, who had come to set up a dispensary in the village. The heroine says she accepts him as he is and will always be his companion, and both plan to run away from the village and make for the small railway station. In the meantime the villagers, who had read the letter exposing Dev Anand, and his sarcastic comments about all in the village, and knowing that he has fled with the landlord's daughter, run towards the railway station. While they are after him, chasing the pair ferociously, Dev and his eloping lady miss the train by a few minutes. What happens can be well imagined, but the end is not within the memory of this writer. == Cast == *Dev Anand as Kapur *Suraiya as Bimala *Rashid Khan *Krishan Dhawan *Ruma Guha Thakurta *Kanhaiyalal as Village Tehsildar *Manmohan Krishna *Anand Pal *Mohan Segal *Zohra Sehgal == Music == {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" !

It is an audava rƒÅga (or owdava rƒÅga, meaning pentatonic scale), as it does not have all the seven musical notes (swaras). It is a janya rƒÅga (derived scale). The equivalent of Madhyamavati in Hindustani music is Madhumad Sarang.Raganidhi by P. Subba Rao, Pub. 1964, The Music Academy of Madras It is considered a very auspicious rƒÅgam and every Carnatic music concert ends with either a song in Madhyamavati or the ending of the last song is sung in this rƒÅgam.Ragas in Carnatic music by Dr. S. Bhagyalekshmy, Pub. 1990, CBH Publications It is very suitable for elaboration and exploration due to even spacing of notes. The scale uses the first three notes of the cycle of fifths S, P and R2 and fourths S, M1 and N2. Madhyamavati is considered a janya rƒÅga of Kharaharapriya, the 22nd Melakarta rƒÅga, though it can be derived from other melakarta rƒÅgas, Charukesi, Natabhairavi or Harikambhoji, by dropping both gƒÅndhƒÅram and dhaivatam. ==Structure and Lakshana== Madhyamavati scale with shadjam at C Madhyamavati is a symmetric rƒÅga that does not contain gƒÅndhƒÅram or dhaivatam. It is a pentatonic scale (audava-audava rƒÅgam in Carnatic music classification - audava meaning 'of 5'). Its ' structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see swaras in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms): * : * : This scale uses the notes chatushruti rishabham, shuddha madhyamam, panchamam and kaisiki nishadam. Madhyamavati is considered a janya rƒÅga of Kharaharapriya, the 22nd Melakarta rƒÅga, though it can be derived from other melakarta rƒÅgas, Charukesi, Natabhairavi or Harikambhoji, by dropping both gƒÅndhƒÅram and dhaivatam. == Popular compositions == Madhyamavati rƒÅgam lends itself for extensive elaboration and exploration and has many compositions.

Graha bhedam is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the shadjam to the next note in the rƒÅga. For more details and illustration of this concept refer Graha bhedam on Mohanam. === Scale similarities === *Kedaragaula is a rƒÅgam\\\\ which has the ascending scale of Madhyamavati and descending scale of Harikambhoji.

Turner (born September 14, 1947), is a former Democratic member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, serving eleven terms from 1991 to 2013. Turner currently serves on the City of Racine Police and Fire Commission. ==Biography== Turner was born in Columbus, Mississippi and moved with his family to Racine. He was employed by the J.I. Case Company, and served four years in the United States Air Force Security Police during the Vietnam War, from 1967 through 1970, including service during the 1968 Tet Offensive. He was elected to the City Council in 1976, and was elected to the State Assembly in 1990. He left the City Council in 2004 after serving concurrently as City Councilmember and State Assemblymember for 14 years. After the arrest and resignation of Racine Mayor Gary Becker in 2009, Turner announced his candidacy for the special election to fill the remainder of Becker's term. Turner passed the primary, but was defeated in the runoff by John Dickert. Turner had previously defeated Dickert in the 1990 and 2002 primary elections for Wisconsin Assembly. He announced his retirement from the Assembly in 2012, after redistricting dramatically reshaped the Racine-area senate and assembly districts. His retirement cleared the way for Cory Mason to run in the redrawn 66th District, which was composed of the southern part of Turner's old 61st District and the eastern part of Mason's old 62nd District. In 2018, Cory Mason, now Racine Mayor, nominated Turner to the Racine Police and Fire Commission. Turner is a life member of the Vietnam Veterans of America, the American Legion, and a 33rd degree Mason. ==Electoral historyWisconsin Assembly (1984)===  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" Primary Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background- color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election ===Wisconsin Assembly (1990-2008)===  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" Primary Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" Primary Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background- color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text- align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" Primary Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" Primary Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" Primary Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background- color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text- align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" Primary Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" Primary Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" Primary Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background- color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text- align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" Primary Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" Primary Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election ===Racine Mayor (2009)===  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text- align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" Primary Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election ===Wisconsin Assembly (2010)===  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text- align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" Primary Election  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election ==References *Representative Robert L.

As of 2012, there were approximately 80,000 people born in South Africa who were living in the United States (according to the OECD). As of 2019, there were approximately 85,000 people born in South Africa who were living in the United States. ==History== Free South Africans began arriving in the United States as early as the late-nineteenth century. The first groups were Afrikaner miners who arrived in California. Significant numbers of South Africans, typically of British Isles heritage, arrived in the mid-twentieth century. Immigration by black South Africans was limited, as although the standard of living for black Africans in South Africa was higher than for most people living on the African continent, political and economic conditions still made immigration difficult, as blacks were forced to escape to other African nations before they could emigrate to the country of their choice. Following the Soweto uprising in 1976, there was a significant increase in South African immigration to the United States. Many of the immigrants were South African Jews, who formed a community in the northern suburbs of Chicago.http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1167.html Although emigration policies during apartheid made immigration difficult, there were a small number of black students and political refugees who emigrated to the US. During the 1980s and 1990s, many South Africans entered the US for political reasons, to be with family members, or to access professional opportunities not available in their home country. The largest wave of South African emigration was in 1994, after the election of Nelson Mandela as the President of South Africa. Many White South Africans, especially Afrikaners, emigrated after the acquisition of political power by the black population.Encyclopedia Chicago.Posted by Tracy Steffes.

According to Statistics South Africa, between 2006 and 2016, the United States and the U.S. territory of American Samoa received a combined 17.8% of all South African emigrants relocating overseas. This made the United States the third most popular destination after first place Australia and the second place United Kingdom. == Demography == The majority of South Africans who emigrated went to Australia and New Zealand, countries with similar cultural and linguistic heritage, as well as similar climates and latitude positioning. There were also a large number of South African immigrants that went to the US. Many White South Africans, both before and after the end of apartheid, emigrated to Midwestern states such as Minnesota and Illinois. Atlanta, Georgia, has a large population of South African Jews. Also, a number of South Africans live in New York City and Mid-Atlantic states such as Maryland. Many South African immigrants in the US are White people of European origin. Of the 82,000 South Africans that were living in this country between 2008‚Äì09, about 11,000 of them were Black South Africans.New Streams: Black African Migration to the United States. Posted by Randy Capps, Kristen McCabe, and Michael Fix. In the 2000 Census, 509 South African Americans reported their ethnic origins as Zulu. The majority of these immigrants are English speaking, with a moderate proportion of these being South African Jews. In the US, South Africans in general‚Äîboth white and black‚Äîlive in the US individually, rather than in communities of South African Americans. One area with many South Africans in the US is San Diego, California, while smaller populations reside elsewhere in the Western United States, including the Pacific Northwest. ===South African-born population=== South African-born population in the US since 2010:PLACE OF BIRTH FOR THE FOREIGN-BORN POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES.

It was founded in the 1990s and sponsors community events and activities. In addition, this organization allows the exchange of information through a web site and a mailing list, keeping South Africans informed about international and local events. The South African consulate in Chicago has close ties with many expatriates and hosts regular events and speakers, including an annual celebration of Freedom Day on 27 April. In 2001, the hosts founded the African Group of the U.S. Women's Action to boost the knowledge and understanding of South Africa among Americans. The South Africans are also in many other forums, such as informal parties, religious activities and rugby matches. ==Notable people== * Adam Rose, professional wrestler * Andrew Parkinson, soccer player * Andrew Pattison, tennis player * Angela Hawken, academic * Arnold Vosloo, actor * Ben Viljoen, Boer general, politician and author * Candice Pillay, singer, songwriter * Caron Bernstein, model and actress * Charlize Theron, model and actress * Cliff Drysdale, tennis player * Colin Cowie, lifestyle guru * Da L.E.S, hip hop artist and record producer * Daniel Mindel, cinematographer * Dave Matthews, musician * Dave Wittenberg, anime and video game voice actor * David DeCastro, American football player * David O.

Starting off his career by socializing in game advertisements, Ramsay made his Bollywood debut in Family: Ties of Blood (2006) and was nominated a Filmfare Best Male Debut Award for his performance. Following through with acclaimed performances in films like Good Luck! (2008) and Ek Aadat (2010), which was his only commercial and critical success movie yet, even though he believes that \\"a few bumps, that's when you hit the jackpot!\\" ==Early life== Aryeman was born on 22 August 1980, by Keshu Ramsay (part of the Ramsay Brothers) whose family are Sindhis. He attended Mithibai College, in Mumbai. His big break came when his father offered him a role in his action drama film, Family - Ties of Blood (2006), in which he co-starred with Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan, although the film failed, he still got nominated for a Filmfare Best Male Debut Award. ==Film career== Aryeman basically started his acting career by playing a small role as a child-artist in 1991 in the romance film Saugandh, which starred Akshay Kumar. He then debuted as an adult in his home-production, Family - Ties of Blood, co- starring Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar again and Bhumika Chawla. Even with a multi-strong cast and crew, the film flopped badly at the box office in India. He then starred in the 2008 comedy film Good Luck!, along with Sayali Bhagat, Lucky Ali and Ranvir Shorey. Good Luck! was an official remake of the 2006 Hollywood film Just My Luck. Even though Just My Luck was a blockbuster on Box office Mojo, Good Luck! was an absolute disappointment at Box Office India. The film was typed to be the biggest flop of the year 2008 and it seems Good Luck! did not have any luck at all. In 2010, he starred in the romantic comedy film Ek Aadat. The film received mix reviews, but mostly negative, and still was Aryeman's first critical and commercial success at the box office. He was filming on 2 films for 2011, Main Osama, where he plays MI chief Karan Choudhary, and Tom, Dick, and Harry Rock Again! which is a sequel to the 2006 comedy flick Tom, Dick, and Harry!

Tickets are purchased on the bus and only cash is accepted. Problems arose in the mid-2000s when the company lost its operating licenses for intercity, charter and school buses in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick after government transport regulators were informed of safety problems and maintenance issues resulting from DRL Coachlines service, in addition to tax problems that the company was facing. DRL Coachlines has also faced several complaints about its inter-city bus services in Newfoundland and Labrador, where it has a monopoly.

Sadiq. The film was produced by Jaimani Dewan for his Dewan Productions banner, with music composed by Vinod. The film starred Karan Dewan, who was known as a \\"jubilee star\\" with most of his films becoming box-office successes. He was the younger brother of producer Jaimani Dewan. Karan's co-stars were Meena Shorey (credited, as she was in all her films, as just Meena), Nirmala, Gope, Madan Puri and Gulab. The story was written by D. N.

Madhok, came in for harsh criticism stating that they had \\"insulted all cinegoers\\" by making this film. The photography by Ratanlal Nagar was praised as \\"the only man who has done his job well\\", as was actor Gope in his comic role \\"the only artiste who gave a good performance\\". ==Music== The soundtrack was composed by Vinod, with lyrics by D. N. Madhok. Vinod used Talat Mehmood in Anmol Rattan as Talat's first venture in Hindi films. However, since Arzoo (1950) was released earlier the credit of Talat's first song goes to composer Anil Biswas for the song \\"Ae Dil Mujhe Aisi Jagah Le Chal\\". The popularity of that ghazal had Vinod choose Talat for one more film Wafa (1950).

Vos is the President of National Conference of State Legislatures. == Early life and education == Vos was born on July 5, 1968, in Burlington, Wisconsin, in the southwest corner of Racine County. He graduated from Burlington High School in 1986. Vos attended the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìWhitewater, where he studied political science and public relations. While at Whitewater, he roomed with Reince Priebus, who later became Chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, and the 27th White House Chief of Staff. In 1989, Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson appointed Vos as a student representative on the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents. Vos graduated in 1991. == Career == After graduation, Vos worked as a legislative assistant to State Representatives Jim Ladwig and Bonnie Ladwig. 1994 Vos was elected to the Racine County Board of Supervisors. He remained on the board for the next 10 years. After the election Vos worked as district director for State Representative Mark Neumann. In 1996 Vos purchased the RoJos Popcorn Company in Burlington.\\"Robin Vos, the man amidst the controversy\\", journaltimes.com; accessed November 15, 2014. His popcorn business, Robin J. Vos Enterprises, received more than $150,000 in coronavirus relief during the coronavirus pandemic of 2020. In 2004 Vos ran for the Wisconsin State Assembly to succeed Ladwig in the 63rd district. He was unopposed in the 2004 primary and general elections. After Republicans won full control of government in Wisconsin in 2010, Vos rose to prominence pushing the controversial budget restructuring act alongside Governor Scott Walker. The law curtailed collective bargaining rights and public education funding in Wisconsin, and led to massive protests around the state, culminating in the 2012 Wisconsin gubernatorial recall election. In 2013, Vos was elected Speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly. Between 2014 and 2018 he received about $57,000 in travel and perks from lobbyists and organizations. He said he was certain he had followed ethics rules with his travel.Patrick Marley. \\"Assembly Speaker Robin Vos received $57,000 in travel and other perks since 2014\\".

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, April 12, 2018. Vos supports deregulating the payday loan industry. He opposes Medicaid expansion. In 2016 Vos endorsed Marco Rubio for president. After Rubio dropped out of the race, Vos endorsed Ted Cruz. In February 2019 Vos defended Brian Hagedorn, a judge of the Wisconsin Court of Appeals running for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, amid reports that Hagedorn had founded a school in 2016 that allowed for the expulsion of students and faculty if they were gay. Vos said he believed Hagedorn could rule fairly on LGBT issues. In July 2019 Vos was widely criticized for refusing to prohibit overnight floor sessions or allow paralyzed Democratic lawmaker Jimmy Anderson, who is in a wheelchair, to phone into committee meetings. He later accused Anderson of political grandstanding and attempting to sabotage him as Vos took on his new national role as head of the National Conference of State Legislatures. In August 2019 Vos became the 47th President of the National Conference of State Legislatures. === Curbing the powers of the Evers administration === After Democratic nominee Tony Evers won the 2018 Wisconsin gubernatorial election, defeating incumbent Republican governor Scott Walker, Vos was the first public official to propose curbing the incoming governor's powers. He claimed it was to restore a balance of power between the governor and the legislature, despite having previously voted to expand gubernatorial power. Vos also said the changes were intended to lock in laws passed by Republicans and to prevent the incoming Democratic administration from fulfilling its campaign pledges, particularly a pledge to withdraw Wisconsin from a lawsuit seeking to overturn the federal Affordable Care Act. The Republican-led legislature was called into a December lame duck session and passed laws decreasing the powers of the incoming governor, limiting early voting, and giving the legislature more control. Outgoing governor Walker then signed the bill. Christopher Beem of the McCourtney Institute of Democracy at Pennsylvania State University described Wisconsin Republicans' power grab as a \\"deeply undemocratic act.\\" While it could be legal, Beem said, it erodes democratic norms: \\"Wisconsin‚Äôs GOP lawmakers are using power that the majority of the electorate has just taken away from them in order to make it more difficult for the incoming administration to undertake actions that the majority has just shown that it wants.\\" In June 2019 the conservative majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the December 2018 laws, ruling that extraordinary sessions are constitutional.https://madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/wisconsin- supreme-court-ruling-upholds-lame-duck- laws/article_3ca70585-a462-5faa-97c7-37b1e25543b9.htmlRobin Vos on election day during the COVID-19 Pandemic === COVID-19 pandemic === In April 2020, amid the coronavirus pandemic, Vos opposed calls by Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, to delay the state's primary election from early April to late May, to make it a mail-in election, and to mail ballots to all registered voters. The legislature adjourned without taking action on any of those proposals. When the governor then issued a last-minute emergency order to suspend in-person voting, Vos and the state senate majority leader appealed the order to the state supreme court, which overturned it, and the election was held as scheduled. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, it was estimated that many voters would be effectively disenfranchised, and in-person voting was also considered a public health risk. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \\"Vos had no answer to how local election officials are supposed to keep people safe as a massive shortage of poll workers has resulted in the closure or reduction of polling locations, forcing more people to vote at a single site.\\" Vos said, \\"If you are bored at home and sick of watching Netflix, volunteer to go and help at the polls.\\" On election day, Vos served as an election inspector. While dressed in full-body personal protective equipment, he said it was \\"incredibly safe\\" to vote at the polls. Epidemiologists and public health experts said that it was not possible to definitively determine the extent to which the virus spread among Wisconsin voters at polling places, due to a lack of testing and contact tracing; the difficulty of determining the location where an infected person acquired the virus; and asymptomatic transmission. Due to the Republican-controlled Wisconsin legislature's slowness to waive a requirement that unemployed Wisconsites wait a week before they can be reimbursed unemployment benefits, Wisconsin lost $25 million in federal funding from the CARES Act. Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald had been warned that this would happen if the waiver was not passed in time. Also during the pandemic, Vos sued Evers for implementing a face mask mandate to hinder the virus's spread. The legislature could convene a session to strike down Evers's mandate, but Wisconsin Republicans opted to sue instead, so as to prevent vulnerable Republican legislators from having to vote against face mask mandates just before an election. == Electoral history Wisconsin Assembly (2004, 2006, 2008)===  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election, November 2, 2004  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text- align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election, November 7, 2006  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election, November 4, 2008 ===Wisconsin Assembly (2010, 2012, 2014)===  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election, November 4, 2010  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background- color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election, November 6, 2012  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" Republican Primary, August 26, 2014  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election, November 4, 2014 ===Wisconsin Assembly (2016, 2018, 2020)===  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election, November 8, 2016  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text- align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election, November 6, 2018  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\" General Election, November 3, 2020 ==Awards and memberships== The seventh annual Children's Champion Policy Awards from Children‚Äôs Hospital of Wisconsin were given to Vos and State Representatives Steve Doyle and Patrick Snyder for their work with the Speaker's Task Force on Foster Care.

He has previously played for Leyton Orient, Preston North End and Stevenage, and has had loan spells with Coventry City, Rochdale and Colchester United. ==Club careerEverton=== Born in Kirkby, Merseyside, Jones signed his first professional contract with Everton on 4 July 2007. In the 2007‚Äì08 season he managed some reserve games but failed to secure a new contract at Everton and so left the club at the end of the season and signed a contract with Leyton Orient. ===Leyton Orient=== On 30 June 2008 Jones signed a two-year contract with League One side Leyton Orient. He signed for the club stating that he was happy to be fighting for a starting place with fellow goalkeeper Glenn Morris. He made his debut in a League Cup match against Southend United. He made his league debut in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Scunthorpe United. On 10 October 2009, Jones was knocked unconscious after receiving a blow to the head by teammate Ben Chorley after a goalmouth scramble. He was stretchered off the pitch and taken to hospital. After Glenn Morris' departure from the club, Jones was promoted to the No. 1 shirt from his previous No. 12. During a League One fixture at Swindon Town in November 2013, a spectator ran onto the pitch and aimed punches at Jones. Jones was unhurt, the match continued, and the perpetrator was arrested and later convicted. Jones played in 179 games for Leyton Orient. ===Preston North End=== Jones signed a two-year deal with Preston North End on 6 June 2014 after turning down an extension of contract at Leyton Orient. Rochdale (loan) Jones playing for Rochdale in 2015 On 26 February 2015, Jones signed for Rochdale on a loan until the end of the season. Jones made his Rochdale debut on 28 February 2015, in a 1‚Äì0 defeat against Bristol City. He made his home debut on 3 March, in a 4‚Äì0 win against Crewe Alexandra, keeping a clean sheet. On 18 April, in a game against Gillingham, Jones charged out of his box and brought down Gillingham's striker Cody McDonald, with players from both sides piling into the melee which followed. It had also looked like Jones aimed a punch at one of the Gillingham's players in the scuffle and was sent off. He played his last game for the club in 2‚Äì3 defeat against Milton Keynes Dons on 25 April 2015. He played 13 times for Rochdale in the league that season, as they finished a very credible 8th place, their highest-ever league placing. Colchester United (loan) On 11 September 2015, Jones joined League One side Colchester United on a 3-month loan. ===Wigan Athletic=== On 7 August 2017, Jones signed for League One side Wigan Athletic on a one-year contract after rejecting a new contract at Stevenage. Wigan entered into contract talks with him at the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season. ==Career statistics== {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"7\\"Leyton Orient 2008‚Äì09 League One 20000002Appearances in the Football League Trophy0220 - 2009‚Äì10 League One 360001020390 - 2010‚Äì11 League One 350402010420 - 2011‚Äì12 League One 6000000060 - 2012‚Äì13 League One 260201040330 - 2013‚Äì14 League One 28010206Three appearances in the Football League Trophy and three in the League One play-offs0370 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !151!!0!!7!!0!!6!!0!!15!!0!!179!!0 - rowspan=2Preston North End 2014‚Äì15 League One 170102000200 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !16!!0!!1!!0!!2!!0!!0!!0!!20!!0 - Coventry City (loan) 2014‚Äì15 League One 40colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî0040 - Rochdale (loan) 2014‚Äì15 League One 130colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî00130 - Colchester United (loan) 2015‚Äì16 League One 170100000180 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Stevenage 2015‚Äì16 League Two 170colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî0000170 - 2016‚Äì17 League Two 36010201Appearances in the EFL Trophy0400 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !53!!0!!1!!0!!2!!0!!1!!0!!57!!0 - Wigan Athletic 2017‚Äì18 League One 150101010180 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !270!!0!!11!!0!!11!!0!!17!!0!!309!!0 } ==Honours== Wigan Athletic *EFL League One: 2017‚Äì18 ==References * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:People from Kirkby Category:Footballers from Merseyside Category:English footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Everton F.C. players Category:Leyton Orient F.C. players Category:Preston North End F.C. players Category:Coventry City F.C. players Category:Rochdale A.F.C. players Category:Colchester United F.C. players Category:Stevenage F.C. players Category:Wigan Athletic F.C. players Category:English Football League players ","title":"Jamie Jones (footballer)"},{"id":"19317071","text":"The Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway was an English railway company which built and operated a standard gauge railway in Cumberland, England intended to open up the hematite orefield to the south-east of Whitehaven. It opened for goods traffic in 1855 and for passenger traffic in 1857. ==HistoryPromotion and construction=== A prospectus for the company promoting the railway was issued in December 1853. The line was to run for four and a half miles from a junction with the Whitehaven and Furness Junction Railway at Mirehouse, two miles south of Whitehaven to Egremont via Moor Row, and iron ore mines at Bigrigg and Woodend; a two-mile branch was to run from Moor Row to Frizington, serving an ironworks in Cleator Moor, and assorted ore mines in the district. The line was supported by the principal landowners (including the Earl of Lonsdale) and was predicted to be highly profitable. It was claimed that five to six hundred carts were employed to transport over a hundred thousand tons of ore a year raised in the area the railway would serve to Whitehaven; because of this traffic, the yearly rent of the tollgate at Hensingham had increased from ¬£820 a year to ¬£2770 a year over the previous decade An act was obtained the following summer, and work promptly began on the Mirehouse-Frizington section; by December 1855 it was possible to run a trial train over this, particular attention being paid to the demonstration that trains could safely be stopped and started on the steep climb from Mirehouse to Moor Row. Opening for general mineral traffic followed in January 1856; the safety of the steep descent to Mirehouse being again insisted upon in a contemporary report: \\"This incline was descended at the rate of six miles per hour without the appliance of any break except to the engine. This is sufficient to set at rest any doubts which may have been entertained by any one respecting difficulty arising from the gradient on this section of the line.\\" The Egremont branch was sufficiently complete by May 1856 that the directors were taken on an inspection tour of the entire line and the workers treated to a cask of ale at the 'Ship Launch' in Egremont but a Board of Trade inspection of the line in August 1856 insisted on better siding accommodation at the Whitehaven & Furness's Corkickle station and a more permanent arrangement with the W&FJR; before passenger services could be authorised.mineral traffic continued, although it arguably affected the safety of passenger traffic on the W&FR; \\\\- The WC&ER; contributed ¬£2000 towards the required work and the agreement with the W&FJR; was extended to ten years. Formal opening ceremonies took place 16 July 1857, but passenger services had been running since the start of the month. In the last week of July 1858, about 6,400 tons of ore were transported by the WC&ER;, three-quarters of this being shipped to Wales through Whitehaven harbour, despite its inadequate provision for the export of ore. An embankment failed at Woodend in October 1858, an adjoining viaduct was then condemned because of mining subsidence and (January‚ÄìFebruary 1859) services on the Egremont branch terminated at Woodend whilst the suspect section of viaduct was replaced by an embankment. The railway was so profitable that it was decided to pay the ¬£500 cost of this out of current revenue, which still allowed an interim dividend of 4% for the first half of 1859. In 1862, Frizington branch services terminated at Cleator, again because of subsidence. === Expansion === The powers and authorised capital obtained by the 1854 allowed only very limited operations, and further acts were obtained; in 1857 increasing the capital (and hence authorised borrowing) of the company;(advertisement) in 1861 authorising the doubling of the line from Mirehouse to Frizington and (the shareholders having voted against its inclusion in the 1857 bill) a 'Lamplugh Extension' which did not run to the village of that name, but to Collier Yeat (near Rowrah) in Lamplugh parish.(advertisement) - Passenger services on the extension began 1 February 1864; the WC&ER; preferred to let new track bed down thoroughly under mineral traffic before seeking a Board of Trade inspection and mineral traffic over (part of) the extension had been running since 15 September 1862. Six hundred and thirty thousand tons of ore a year were now being hauled over a line projected on the basis of a hundred thousand tons a year and ¬£20 shares of the WC&ER; (regularly paying dividends of 10% or more) were traded at ¬£50. In 1863, an act was sought for extension of the Frizington branch to a junction with the Cockermouth and Workington Railway at Bridgefoot,(advertisement) thus removing the need for ore to be exported through the tunnel at Whitehaven; authorisation of deviation in the Cleator area to avoid subsidence was also sought. Objectors to the bill drew attention to the high mileage rates charged by the WC&ER; and claimed the extension was being promoted primarily to protect the WC&ER;'s monopoly by preventing other companies accessing the orefield, but the WC&ER; got its act. Mineral traffic over the Marron extension began 15 January 1866, it being claimed that it reduced carriage costs by 1s. 6d. per ton, compared to the route via Whitehaven: the line opened for passenger traffic 2 April 1866,(advertisement) - but provision was limited, and the revenue from mineral traffic dwarfed that from passengers and parcels; reports revenues for the week ending 18 June 1870 to have been: passengers and parcels ¬£64 , goods and minerals ¬£1265 the WCE&R; \\"although chiefly a railway for the conveyance of iron ore, also holds itself out to carry passengers\\" was the comment of counsel for a passenger injured in an accident on the line. By 1871, mineral traffic on the Marron extension was so heavy that the directors thought it necessary to double the line. Hearing of plans of the Whitehaven and Furness Junction to build a branch from Sellafield to Egremont to give a more convenient route for south-bound ore, the WC&ER; took steps to promote a line of their own (to give a better basis for opposition to the W&FJR;'s project) An Act for the Sellafield-Egremont line (as the Cleator and Furness Railway - a joint line of the W&FJR; and the WC&ER;) was obtained in 1866. === Local neighbours taken over; overtures from LNWR rejected === Also in 1866 the W&FJR; was absorbed by the Furness Railway, and the Cockermouth and Workington by the London and North Western Railway, but the WC&ER; had suitable safeguards on tolls and powers inserted in the relevant Acts. An offer from the L&NWR; to lease the WC&ER; was rejected by the directors; the dividend having dropped to a mere 8% there were stormy scenes (and a motion for a committee of inquiry into the management of the railway) at the next half-yearly shareholders' meeting, a year later the dividend had recovered to its traditional 10%, and the shareholders' meeting passed off smoothly. === 'Great Dissatisfaction Among the Shareholders' === In February 1870, however, a shareholders'meeting voted for a committee of inquiry, passed a motion of no confidence in the board and called upon it to resign: this followed the admission that the company solicitor had been so dilatory in his completion of land purchases that the owners of land taken for construction of the original line some sixteen years ago had not yet received the purchase money, and were instead being paid interest at up to 10% per year on the sum owed them. The board did not resign, admitting to procrastination by the company solicitor, but pointing out that the effect on company finances (and in particular the dividend, which had averaged over 10%) had been minimal: instead they called another meeting to affirm confidence in the board. Although the meeting was again stormy the directors had exerted themeselves sufficiently to gather enough proxies to reverse the earlier vote. ===LNWR rebuffed again=== By the end of August 1870, almost all the purchases had been satisfactorily completed, a dividend of 11% a year was declared, and harmony was restored, a proposal by the LNWR to lease the line, guaranteeing a dividend of 10% in perpetuity, being the main subject of discussion. Against the chairman's advice (and although the Furness Railway - the only alternative suitor- supported the LNWR offer) the WC&ER; board sought to negotiate an even better deal but the LNWR (who were so confident of acceptance that they had already given notice of the necessary legislation) then withdrew their offer before it could be put to WC&ER; shareholders(advertisement) - and the chairman resigned. The next half-yearly meeting approved a dividend of 14% (revenue in the half-year was ¬£35,000 and expenses ¬£14,000, leaving (after transferring ¬£3,000 to reserves) ¬£21,000 to cover the dividend) but dissatisfaction was expressed that ¬£3,000 of profit had been overlooked when declaring the previous half-year's dividend. ===Amalgamation=== Many iron- and steel-works had set up in West Cumbria to be close to the orefield; their owners (faced with increased competition in the mid-1870s) thought the high dividends of the WC&ER; indicated that its freight charges were too high; they were sufficiently united, determined, and able to secure local support, that their promotion of the Cleator and Workington Junction Railway obtained its parliamentary Act in 1876, despite the opposition of the WC&ER;, the LNWR, and the Furness Railway. Since the choice of railway routing lay with the consignee, not the consignor, the C&WJR; (the 'track of the ironmasters') was thought likely to take considerable traffic from the WC&ER;, which therefore now accepted the LNWR's offer of amalgamation in return for a guaranteed 10% dividend. This alarmed both the C&WJR; and the Furness, which now joined forces and both objected to the amalgamation Bill. The C&WJR; came forward with a further Bill for extension to a junction with the Cleator and Furness at Egremont and with the Maryport and Carlisle at Dearham; the system was to be operated by the Furness (which supported the Bill). A compromise was reached between the LNWR, the Furness and the C&WJR;, and the WC&ER; amalgamation Act was obtained in June 1877 (the LNWR having to promise the ironmasters a significant reduction of the freight rates): as envisaged by the compromise, the C&WJR; did not proceed with its extensions, and a further Act was passed the following year making the WC&ER; system a joint line of the LNWR and the Furness. At the final shareholders' meeting of the company it was noted that the value of WC&ER; ¬£100 shares had been ¬£170 before the intention to amalgamate had been announced; now that amalgamation was complete they were worth ¬£230; by 1879 the Furness chairman was reporting a loss on the Furness's half-share of ¬£9000 during the first half of the year because of the reduced freight rates and a downturn in the iron trade. At the 1923 grouping, both the LNWR and the Furness Railway (and therefore also the WC&ER;) were absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The LMS became part of British Railways at nationalisation in 1948. == Geography of the WCE&ER; system == From a junction with the Whitehaven and Furness Junction Railway (absorbed into the Furness railway in 1866) at Mirehouse Junction, one mile south of Whitehaven (Corkickle) the line climbed steeply to Moor Row where the company had its engine shed and works. Just beyond Moor Row was a junction, from which one arm of the system headed north and east through Cleator Moor to Frizington. This arm originally terminated at the Parkside mines in Frizington, but as a result of subsequent extensions it eventually ran to a junction with the LNWR's Cockermouth-Workington line at Marron Junction. Stations on this arm were Cleator Moor - Frizington - Eskett (later Yeathouse) - Winder - Rowrah - Wright Green (later Lamplugh) - Ullock - Branthwaite - Bridgefoot - Marron Junction. From Moor Row junction, the other arm ran south to Egremont, with an intermediate station at Woodend. The southern arm was later extended (by the Cleator and Furness Railway - jointly owned by the WC&ER; and the Furness Railway) via Beckermet where there was an intermediate station to a junction with the Furness's Whitehaven-Barrow line at Sellafield There was no north-south curve at the Moor Row junction. Various deviations from the original line were found necessary because of mining subsidence: most notably a new route through Cleator Moor (and a new Cleator Moor station) had to be built, although the old alignment was retained as the Crossfield branch (and the old station used as a goods station). The purpose of the WC&ER; was to serve the mines that sprang up on the ore-field (and later the iron- and steel-works of the area), and therefore there was an extensive system of mineral railway branches running to mines and works (the Bigrigg, Beckermet, Eskett, Ehen Valley, Gillfoot, Mowbray, Pallaflat, and Ullcoats Branches). The Gilgarran Branch ran from a north-facing junction just north of Ullock to a colliery at Gilgarran, but was then extended via Distington, where it served an ironworks, to a south-facing junction with the main LNWR line along the coast at Parton. ==Closures== As mines closed, the branches serving them were closed. Passenger services over the system were withdrawn in the 1930s (northern arm 1931, southern arm 1935) The northern arm beyond a quarry at Rowrah was closed in 1954 (the track was lifted in 1964). After 1970, the southern arm was open only as far as the Florence iron ore mine at Egremont. British Steel ceased operations at the Rowrah quarry in 1978, and at Florence mine in 1980; complete closure of the line followed soon thereafter. ==See also== * Cumbrian Coast Line (history) ==ReferencesNotes= External links == * Route in Google Maps * W McGowan Gradon's Furness Railway.

The Parlementary Act for this new railway was obtained in June 1864 and it was to be known as the Cleator and Furness Railway.

The railway would open as the joint properties of the Furness Railway and the Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway. It was worked by the WC&ER; until the company sold out to the London & North Western Railway when the FR disputed the purchase. In 1866 the London & North Western Railway purchased two small railways in West Cumberland and the Furness Railway insisted the former company expanded no further in the Whitehaven area. An agreement was reached and it was this agreement that the Furness Railway maintained had been ignored when in 1878 the London & North Western Railway purchased the WC&ER; lines. The following year an agreement was reached where the WC&ER; would become the joint property of the Furness Railway and the London & North Western Railway after which the Cleator and Furness Railway became part of the LNWR & FR Joint Lines. ==See also== * Furness Railway * London & North Western Railway * Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway. ==Sources== Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1878 Category:British companies disestablished in 1878 Category:British companies established in 1864 Category:Railway companies established in 1864 ","title":"Cleator and Furness Railway"},{"id":"19317087","text":"Craterellus tubaeformis (formerly Cantharellus tubaeformis) is an edible fungus, also known as yellowfoot, winter mushroom, or funnel chanterelle. It is mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic associations with plants, making it very challenging to cultivate. It is smaller than the golden chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius) and has a dark brown cap with paler gills and a hollow yellow stem. C. tubaeformis tastes stronger but less fruity than the golden chanterelle. It has a very distinctive smokey, peppery taste when raw. It grows in temperate and cold parts of Northern America and Europe, including Scandinavia, Finland, Russia, and the British Isles, as well as in the Himalayas in Asia, including Assam, in the central parts of the Indian Subcontinent, and in Thailand. C. tubaeformis is a yellowish-brown and trumpet-shaped mushroom found in great numbers late in the mushroom season, thus earning the common name winter mushroom. The cap is convex and sometimes hollow down the middle. The gills are widely separated, and of lighter color than the cap. It grows on moss or rotten wood, and in Northern America it is found mostly in conifer bogs.http://www.mushroomexpert.com/craterellus_tubaeformis.html retrieved 10 Mar 2015 It is an excellent food mushroom, especially fried or in soups, and is easily dried for preservation. Molecular phylogenetics has shown that C. tubaeformis deserves its reclassification from Cantharellus to Craterellus. Additionally, it appears that there are two distinct genetic populations that have traditionally been called tubaeformis: one in Europe and eastern North America, and another in western North America. If these two groups are defined as separate species, the \\"eastern\\" yellowfoot would retain the scientific epithet tubaeformis due to the origin of the type specimens in Sweden. The western North American C. tubaeformis has been shown to make ectomycorrhizal relationships with western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). It is also most common in forests with a large amount of well-rotted coarse woody debris. ==Edibility== Though small, the mushroom is choice and grows in groups. It can be eaten with meat, in soups, pasta, and other dishes. ==Similar species== Craterellus lutescens differs only in colours, but is more rare, and is found only from very wet places.

Later, during the ministry of Charles Anthony, Prince of Hohenzollern, he led the government in all but name. ==Biography== Auerswald was born in Marienwerder (Kwidzyn), West Prussia. He was a member of a Meissen family of nobility, first mentioned in 1263, from Auerswalde, now part of Lichtenau, Saxony. His father was the official Hans Jakob von Auerswald, while his brothers were the general Hans Adolf Erdmann von Auerswald (1792-1848) and the politician Alfred von Auerswald (1797-1870). A friend of Prince William, much of Auerswald's youth was spent in K√∂nigsberg. After the completion of his education he entered the 1. Leibhusarenregiment of the Prussian Army. In 1812 as part of Napoleon's invasion of Russia, Auerswald participated in campaigns in Livonia and Courland under the command of Yorck. He also served from 1813-15 during the wars against Napoleon. Auerswald remained in the military until 1821, when he was discharged as a cavalry captain. Auerswald married his cousin Countess Adela Dohna-Lauck in 1817. After his discharge from the military he acquired an estate in the Heiligenbeil District of East Prussia, where he became Landrat (district administrator) in 1824. Auerswald became General-Landschaftsrath of the Province of Prussia in 1835 and Oberb√ºrgermeister (roughly Lord Mayor) of K√∂nigsberg in 1835. Auerswald was a member of the knighthood of the East Prussian provincial diet, sometimes with the role of parliamentary marshal (Landtagsmarschall). During a diet paying homage to King Frederick William IV of Prussia, Auerswald was one of the politicians who reminded the new king of the 1815 promise of his predecessor, Frederick William III, to grant a constitution. Auerswald became Regierungspr√§sident of Regierungsbezirk Trier in 1842. Eleven liberals: Back (l-r): Carl Mittermaier, David Hansemann, Maximilian von Schwerin-Putzar, Rudolf von Auerswald, Franz Leo Benedikt Waldeck, Friedrich R√∂mer; Front row (l-r): Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann, Ludolf Camphausen, Hermann von Beckerath, Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch and Karl Welcker Berlin democrats attacking Prime Minister Auerswald's Wilhelmstra√üe hotel on 21 August 1848 (contemporary drawing) After the outbreak of the March Revolution in 1848, Auerswald was named Oberpr√§sident in K√∂nigsberg of the Province of Prussia by Prime Minister Ludolf Camphausen. After Camphausen resigned, Auerswald became Prime Minister on 25 June, as well as Foreign Minister. A constitution for the Kingdom of Prussia was proposed during Auerswald's term; its model was the liberal Belgian Constitution of 1831, which had strongly influenced Rhenish liberalism. However, it was not accepted by the Prussian National Assembly, which created its own constitutional committee instead. Auerswald's ministry collapsed on 8 September when the National Assembly called for the government to demand the resignation of conservative members of the military. After his resignation, Auerswald returned to his post as Oberpr√§sident in K√∂nigsberg. After the dissolution of the National Assembly, the imposition of the constitution of the Kingdom of Prussia and the vote for a new parliament of Prussia led Auerswald to return to national politics. He served as president of the First Chamber (later the Prussian House of Lords) until 1850. Auerswald also participated in the Erfurt Parliament. In 1850 he became Oberpr√§sident of the Rhine Province, but was forced to resign a year later for remarks critical of the conservative government. Auerswald then spent almost two years out of public office, traveling to Paris, Italy, and North Africa. Auerswald became a member of the Second Chamber (the Prussian House of Representatives) in 1853 as part of the liberal opposition, owing to his friendship with Crown Prince William. After William's assumption of the Prussian regency and the end of the Manteuffel government, William named Charles Anthony, Prince of Hohenzollern, as Prime Minister. Auerswald served as a minister without portfolio, although he led the government in all but name. Hopes for a more liberal era ended, however, in the face of resistance from the civil service, the court of Regent William, and especially from the House of Representatives. The military budgetary crisis of 1860 brought Auerswald in opposition to his own liberal party, but he sought a middle ground between William and parliament. The inability to form a compromise caused a splintering of the liberals in 1861. The lack of a liberal majority led to the resignation of Auerswald and a number of ministers in March 1862. The next government was led by Otto von Bismarck. Auerswald resigned from politics completely. Despite his liberal views and the defeat of the Prussian liberals, he was not disgraced, and a court position as lord burgrave of Marienburg (Malbork) was created for him instead. Auerswald died in Berlin, Brandenburg. ==References== * Category:1795 births Category:1866 deaths Category:People from Kwidzyn Category:Prussian nobility Category:Prussian Army personnel of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Members of the Prussian House of Representatives Category:People from West Prussia Category:People of the Revolutions of 1848 Category:Prime Ministers of Prussia Category:Prussian Army personnel Category:Foreign ministers of Prussia ","title":"Rudolf von Auerswald"},{"id":"19317095","text":"Bari Behen is a Hindi film directed, written and produced by D.

It has an area of more than 1300 km2.Van Deventer, M. and J.A.J. Nel. 2006. Habitat, food, and small mammal community structure in Namaqualand. Koedoe 49(1): 99‚Äì109. Pretoria. ISSN 0075-6458 The park is part of Namaqualand, an area covering 55,000 km2 located within the semi-desert Succulent Karoo biome. This biome is a biodiversity hotspot with the largest concentration of succulent plants in the world. The park also has an arid environment with succulent plants. The park was created to protect its flowers. During the spring, wildflowers bloom there in a spectacular fashion. The park's main tourist attraction is this abundant spring bloom of brightly coloured wildflowers. == Geography and climate == Namaqua National Park is located in Northern Cape Province, near South Africa's border with Namibia. The park is located approximately 495 km north of Cape Town and 22 km northwest of Kamieskroon. It was officially gazetted in August 1999. Skilpad Nature Reserve, formed in 1993 to protect Namaqualand's plant life, formed the nucleus of the new national park with the addition of 500 km2 of land to create the park. 270 km2 has since been added to the park, and it now has an area of more than 700 km2. The park is semi- desert, with hot and dry summers and cold winters with variable, generally sparse rainfall. Most precipitation occurs between May and August. The eastern part of the park receives more rainfall than the west. == Biodiversity == The park is located in Namaqualand, which lies within the Succulent Karoo. Namaqualand has an area covering 55,000 hectares, located in the northwest corner of Northern Cape Province. ===Biome=== The park is part of the semi- desert Succulent Karoo biome, one of the most unusual biomes in the world. This biome is a biodiversity hotspot with the greatest biodiversity and the highest concentration of succulent plants of any of the world's arid regions. The biome has an area of about 107,200 km2, stretching along South Africa's and southern Namibia's western coasts, and includes most of the Richtersveld. There are more than 5,000 plant species in this biome, including more than a third of all the succulent species in the world. Approximately 40% of the biome's plant species are endemic and 18% are threatened. The biome also has diverse invertebrate and reptile species, some of which are endemic. Illegal plant harvesting, overgrazing, and mining threaten endemic species. Only a very small percentage of the Succulent Karoo's area is formally protected, including the Knersvlakte Nature Reserve, the Richtersveld Community Conservancy, and Namaqua National Park. ===Flora=== During most of the year, very little flora except hardy shrubs can be seen in Namaqualand's arid landscape. However, in August and September, after the winter's rains, wildflowers bloom in a spectacular fashion over hundreds of square kilometres. These many-coloured flowers include daisies, lilies, aloes, and perennial herbs. Namaqualand is famous throughout the world for the spectacular sight of its many coloured wildflowers during the spring. About 4,000 plant species grow in this area, and Namaqualand has more than 1,000 types of flowers that do not grow anywhere else in the world. It has many species of succulent plants, for example vygies which have attractive blooms. The plump leaves of many types of succulents retain moisture, and many of them grow low to the ground and have a stone-like appearance. Some species of trees here can store water in the dry environment, such as the quiver tree's fat trunk. The flowers' blooms are dependent on the amount of rainfall that the area receives. The flowers are sensitive to sunlight and many will only open when there is bright sunshine. The flowers face the sun, and they generally open completely from about 10 am to 4 pm. Hot winds can cause the blooms to quickly shrivel. ===Fauna=== The speckled padloper, the smallest tortoise in the world, can be found in the park. Many insect species are attracted to the flowers. By 2017, arachnids from 21 families have been sampled in the park, which included 60 species of spiders. Hottentotta arenaceus, is a pale orange- yellow scorpion which occurs in the park's coastal section. Diaphorocellus biplagiatus and Asemesthes affinis occur, the latter species only found again in Angola. Xysticus cribratus has been recorded, though it has an extensive global range. == Tourism == An estimated 100,000 tourists visit Namaqualand every year. 65% of these visitors are South African and 35% are from other countries. The government has identified tourism as a means to improve the region's economy, and tourism in this area has been promoted through marketing. However, the region's residents continue to have very low incomes and there is a high unemployment rate. Namaqua National Park has the ecological tourist attractions of the wider Namaqualand region. The bloom of spring flowers in disused wheat fields is the park's main tourist attraction. Tourist facilities include a 5 km long scenic route, two nature walks, places to picnic, and an information centre for visitors. The park has not yet been fully developed and the Skilpad area of the park can only be visited by tourists during the flower season in the spring. Most of the wildflower species are protected under law, with the possibility of fines for those who pick them. There are now 4 chalets available for overnight accommodation, 1 of which is accessible to disabled persons. Accommodation is for 2 adults with provision for 1 adult or 2 children on a sleep couch. These are very well equipped and all have an awesome view from the stoep area. There is 220 V electricity but guests will need to bring all their own provisions, as the nearest basic shop is 22 km distant. ==Gallery== file:Namaqua_NP1.jpgSpring flowers in the park file:Namaqua_NP2.jpg file:Namaqua_NP3.jpg == References == Category:IUCN Category II Category:Protected areas established in 1999 Category:National parks of South Africa Category:Protected areas of the Northern Cape ","title":"Namaqua National Park"},{"id":"19317103","text":"F44 or F-44 may refer to : * BMW 2 Series (F44), a compact car released in 2019 * F-44 (Michigan county highway) * F44 (classification), a para-athletics classification for track athletes with leg amputations or reduced function in one or both legs * INS Tabar (F44), a 2001 Indian Navy Talwar class frigate * the FAA identifier for Athens Municipal Airport in Athens, Texas and also : * the ICD-10 code for dissociative (conversion) disorders * the JP-5 jet fuel NATO code ","title":"F44"},{"id":"19317120","text":"Girandola (from Italian) may refer to: *Girandola (candlestick) *Girandola (firework) *Anthony Girandola ","title":"Girandola"},{"id":"19317145","text":"Banwra is 1950 Bollywood film directed by G.

The Baroque artist became known as the \\"Silesian Rembrandt\\", \\"Silesian Apelles\\" or \\"Silesian Raphael\\" and has been called the greatest Silesian painter of the baroque period. ==Life== Portrait of Arnold Freiberger, Abbot of Leubus Orpheus playing a harp Jacob's ladder Willmann was born in K√∂nigsberg (Kr√≥lewiec; today Kaliningrad), Duchy of Prussia a fief of Kingdom of Poland. He was educated by his father, the painter, Christian Peter Willmann. His family was impoverished Calvinist nobility. Michael went to the Dutch Republic in 1650 to learn from the masters, and he was inspired by the works of Rembrandt, Peter Paul Rubens, and Anthony van Dyck. For financial reasons he was unable to afford studying at the studio of a well-known painter. He therefore studied on his own, often copying works of the artists he was inspired on. His early style was particularly influenced by the style of Rembrandt. While he is often described as self-thought, he studied for a time under Jacob Adriaensz Backer. After two years in the Netherlands, mostly spent in Amsterdam, in 1653 Willmann returned to K√∂nigsberg, passed his master's examination, and began to travel. After visiting Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), Willmann went to Prague, where he stayed from 1653-55\\\\. He then spent about a year in Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw). Willmann's first known painting, Landscape with John the Baptist, commissioned by Abbot Arnold Freiberger of the Abbatia Lubensis abbey in Leubus (LubiƒÖ≈º), Lower Silesia, dates from 1656. Leubus, a village in the Silesian part of the Holy Roman Empire, would become the setting of much of Willmann's creativity. From 1657-58 Willmann was in Berlin as the court painter of Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. He painted mythological scenes for the elector, presumably for his residence at K√∂nigsberg Castle. In 1660 Willmann returned to Leubus, which allowed him a large workshop. Willmann's workship, modeled after those of the Dutch painters, quickly spread his fame. The extensive family studio included his son , his daughter Anna Elisabeth, and Anna Elisabeth's husband Christian Neuenhertz and son . Willmann's studio also counted Johann Kretschmer from Glogau (G≈Çog√≥w), from Breslau, the Cistercian from Gr√ºssau, and Willmann's stepson Jan Kry≈°tof Li≈°ka. Willmann became the leading painter of Silesia through his expressiveness, technical dexterity, and speed. Willmann worked on orders from the patriciate of Breslau, as well as churches and monasteries throughout Silesia, Bohemia and Moravia. He received contracts for the Cistercian monasteries in Gr√ºssau, Heinrichau, Kamenz, Rauden, and Himmelwitz. With the assistance of his students and assistants, Willmann produced 500 paintings and frescos during his life; about 300 or so have survived till modern day. Most of his frescos were created after the 1680s. On 26 November 1662 Willmann married Helena Regina Lischka (Li≈°ka) from Prague. In May 1663 he converted from Calvinism to Roman Catholicism and took the baptismal names Leopold (after the emperor) and Lukas (after the patron saint of painters). Willmann's prosperity allowed him in 1687 to acquire a manor near Leubus and sponsor the educations of his son and stepson in Italy. Willmann was detailed in Academia, the 1683 Latin edition of Joachim von Sandrart's Teutsche Academie der edlen Bau-, Bild und Malereik√ºnste. Willmann died in Leubus in 1706, and was buried in the abbey's crypt alongside the abbots. Because his son died shortly before his father, the studio passed to Willmann's stepson J. K. Li≈°ka until 1712, and to Willmann's grandson Georg Wilhelm Neunhertz until 1724, after which it closed. Willmann's house was destroyed in a fire in 1849. == Works == Willman's style was inspired by artists such as Rembrant, Rubens, van Dyck and Pietro da Cortona. His distinctive style comes from background sketching technique and the adjustment of details. This style has been continued by his students. Painters influenced by Willmann include Wenzel Lorenz Reiner, Petr Brandl, Johann Michael Rottmayr, and Franz Anton Maulbertsch. Perhaps his most famous work is the series of paintings from The Martyrdom of the Apostles cycle. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Colmar Gr√ºnhagen: Willmann, Michael Lucas Leopold .

It was produced under the Ambitious Pictures banner at Shree Sound Studios. For the music, Sharma persisted with music director Roshan, in spite of several demands from film distributors to have him removed following his failure as a composer in an earlier film, Neki Aur Badi (1949). The music became popular and is stated to be the reason for the film's success. One of the noteworthy songs that popularised playback singer Mukesh was \\"Teri Duniya Mein Dil Lagta Nahin\\", composed in Raga Darbari Kaanada. Bawre Nain is cited as Roshan's \\"first big hit\\" as a music composer. The film starred Raj Kapoor, Geeta Bali, Vijayalaxmi, Prakash, Darpan, Pessi Patel, Jaswant and Cuckoo. Both Raj Kapoor and Geeta Bali were Sharma discoveries, with Raj Kapoor's first film being Sharma's Neel Kamal and Geeta Bali's Sohaag Raat. The film was a success and is cited as a \\"classic\\", with special mention for Sharma's \\"exceptionally worded lyrics\\". Roshan's music, with songs like \\"Khayalon Mein Kisi Ke\\" became a favourite with \\"millions\\", starting him on \\"a glorious career\\". ==Plot== Chand lives in a small rural town in India. He is unable to pay the rent, and his landlord evicts him. He re-locates to another town and meets with a young woman named Tara. Both are attracted to each other. Chand is unable to secure employment in this town, and moves elsewhere. Tara waits for several months, but does not hear anything from him. So she decides to go and look for him, hoping to re-kindle her love. She is shocked and surprised to find him with an attractive woman named Rajni, who claims that Chand is her betrothed and both are to get married soon. ==Review and reception== Meghnad Desai, in his book \\"Pakeezah\\" described it as \\"a very thin story is used to drape stunning melodies\\" composed by music director Roshan. According to Ausaja, Geeta Bali \\"received rave review for her performance as a village belle\\", and \\"the music of this film made it a classic, with the song \\"Khayalon Mein Kisi Ke\\" becoming \\"a hit of millions\\". The reviewer in the Motion Picture Magazine (November 1950) published in India, lamented the endless use by film-makers of the \\"boy-meets-girl, boy- loses-girl, boy-gets/loses-girl formula\\". He termed it \\"a vicious little circle\\" with no \\"avenue of escape from it\\". The \\"hackneyed theme\\", with \\"stark raving melodrama\\" and too many coincidences, was described as a disappointment from someone of Kidar Sharma's stature, who had earlier made the praise-worthy Jogan (1950). Geeta Bali's performance was written as her best so far, with Raj Kapoor being just satisfactory. The music director Roshan came in for special mention for composing \\"lilting\\" songs. Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, authors of the book Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, called the film an \\"extraordinary melodrama distinguished by Geeta Bali's innovative acting.\\" ==Cast== * Raj Kapoor as Chand * Geeta Bali as Tara * Vijay Laxmi as Rajni * Jaswant * Pesi Patel * Manju as Gangu * Sharda H. Rai * Bankey * Nazira * Prakash * Siraj * Darpan * Kanta * Cuckoo ==Casting== Raj Kapoor was given a break by Kidar Sharma when he hired him as an assistant director. Sharma then went on to create \\"highly stylized romantic characters\\" for him. Kapoor's first was his debut role in Neel Kamal (1947), opposite Madhubala. The second was Bawre Nain. Geeta Bali was a discovery of Sharma's, who describes meeting her and her family in lowly circumstances while a young teenager in his book The One And Lonely Kidar Sharma. He cast Bali in her debut film and repeated her as the girl searching for her beloved in Bawre Nain. Vijayalaxmi played the role of Rajni, a \\"modern\\" educated girl; the sort of character utilised to showcase the \\"vamp\\" in Hindi films of that time. ==Music== Roshan's entry as a music director was with Sharma's 1949 film Neki Aur Badi (1949). However, despite the \\"nightmarish debut as a composer\\", Sharma retained him to compose the music for Bawre Nain. This, according to Vittal and Bhattacharjee was done against the wishes of the film distributors who had offered to increase their price to Rs. 25,000 per territory if Sharma dropped Roshan and took anyone else as the composer. Sharma refused to accept the offer and continued with Roshan. Mukesh's varying tonal effects and soothing quality was put to good use in the song \\"Teri Duniya Mein Dil Lagta Nahin\\", which was composed in Raag Darbari Kaanada. It effectively captured the \\"mood of the song\\". This song is cited to have helped Mukesh \\"grow\\" as a singer, while becoming popular as a playback singer for Raj Kapoor in his films such as Awaara (1951) and Shri 420 (1955). Shamshad Begum's versatility as a singer, according to Ranade, was matched only by Asha Bhosle in later days. In the song \\"Ichak Bichak Bhurr\\" Shamshad brought out a high-pitched trill on the word \\"bhurr\\", while in another part she had \\"two consecutive trills, one octave apart\\" in quick succession. Rajkumari's rendition of \\"Sun Bairi Balam Sach Bol Re\\" was another popular number from the film, matching \\"Geeta Bali's \\"on-screen zest\\". Mohammed Rafi and Asha Bhosle had a duet with the song \\"Mohabbat Ke Maaron Ka Haal\\". The lyricist was Kidar Sharma himself, with Anantharaman citing two duets which were exemplary. The first was \\"Khayalon Mein Kisi Ke\\", sung by Mukesh and Geeta Dutt. The other was \\"Sun Bairi Balam Sach Bol Re\\", by Raj Kumari and Mukesh, which was also Raj Kumari's \\"biggest hit\\" in this film. ==Soundtrack== Songlist: {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" !

A. Belden House, a Queen Anne Victorian in the Pacific Heights section on Gough Street Between Clay and Washington Streets. The house is on the National Register of Historic Places in San Francisco. The architecture of San Francisco is not so much known for defining a particular architectural style; rather, with its interesting and challenging variations in geography and topology and tumultuous history, San Francisco is known worldwide for its particularly eclectic mix of Victorian and modern architecture. Bay windows were identified as a defining characteristic of San Francisco architecture in a 2012 study that had a Machine learning algorithm examine a random sample of 25,000 photos of cities from Google Street View. Icons of San Francisco architecture include the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz Island, Coit Tower, the Palace of Fine Arts, Lombard Street, Alamo Square, Fort Point, the Transamerica Pyramid, and Chinatown. Included below are summaries of the historical significance of some of these great San Franciscan architectural achievements. == Fort Point == The fort from the Golden Gate Bridge deck At the foot of the Golden Gate bridge is Fort Point, built to protect the Bay from naval attacks. Designed to allow cannons to hit enemy ships at water level, Fort Point is the only one of its kind in the west. It was originally constructed under the leadership of Spanish Lieutenant Jose Joaquin Moraga. Moraga had been sent up from Monterey, about 100 miles south of San Francisco, to build fortifications in the San Francisco Bay in order to secure Spanish control over the whole area. In 1792, he built a Presidio style fort, which had sufficient fortifications, but was clearly not strong enough to truly act as the main defense of the harbor. In 1796, Moraga redesigned the fort and gave it the name, Castillo de San Joaqu√≠n. Unfortunately, the fort was built from adobe brick and constructed on sand, meaning that the adobe cracked when one of the cannons was fired and that each winter the Fort would be heavily damaged from the weather. After the Mexican War of Independence in 1821, the Spanish were forced to abandon all of posts in California, including the Castillo. Once the fort was abandoned, the Mexican government attempted to maintain it and others of its kind, but the young government simply did not have the resources to do so. All of the forts in California were abandoned by 1835. After California was granted statehood in 1850, the fort still sat unused until 1856, when the United States government allotted $500,000 (about $14 million in today‚Äôs money) to install fortifications in California. The people in charge of the fortifications decided to rebuild The Castillo de San Joaqu√≠n, but using much more modern materials and building techniques. The fort was built on a granite foundation with masonry walls 12 feet thick. The fort was loaded with weapons and renamed Fort Point. At the time, the fort was incredibly impressive and served as the main fortification protecting the San Francisco bay. It was also the most powerful heavily fortified fort on the west coast when it was built. However, after the civil war, masonry forts of its type were rendered technologically obsolete, leaving Fort Point as simply a testament to San Francisco‚Äôs pre-Civil War military might. == The Golden Gate Bridge == The Golden Gate Bridge The Golden Gate Bridge is the most instantly recognizable structure in the city of San Francisco. The bridge spans almost two miles across the Golden Gate, the narrow strait where San Francisco Bay opens to meet the Pacific Ocean, connecting the city with Marin County, California. The concept of a Golden Gate Bridge started with a journalist named James Wilking. Wilking promoted the idea that a bridge across the Golden Gate would bring many benefits. The idea for this bridge had surfaced forty years earlier, but over time people had lost interest, at least until Wilking revived the idea. In 1919, authorities commissioned Joseph Strauss to conduct a survey of the proposed site for the bridge. The main argument in favor of the bridge‚Äôs construction was that it would help encourage development north of San Francisco. Strauss became fascinated with the bridge, and began drawing up plans and making calculations for the bridge‚Äôs construction. After 10 years of planning, the Golden Gate Bridge Company was formed and Strauss was appointed chief engineer for the project. Engineers Charles Alton Ellis and Irving Morrow also joined the project, with Ellis being appointed as the San Francisco representative. These three men can be credited for the design elements featured in the Golden Gate today. By 1930, the Golden Gate project had gained sufficient support from the public to ensure passage of a $35 million bond to finance the construction of the bridge. Construction of the bridge started in 1933 and would last until May 27, 1937. It was the longest suspension bridge in the world upon its completion and was considered a masterful feat of architectural engineering, designed to hold 5,700 lb/ft on its roadway and 2,000 lb/ft on its walkways. == Gallery See also== * History of San Francisco * Neighborhoods in San Francisco * List of tallest buildings in San Francisco * Painted Ladies * William Abbenseth, photographer of San Francisco architecture ==References * Golden Gate Bridge * Great Buildings Online: Architecture of the San Francisco Bay Area * San Francisco Architectural Heritage, SF nonprofit * List of Official SF Landmarks at Friends of 1800 Market website * List of SF Landmarks with Photos at NoeHill.com * San Francisco Historical Photograph Collection at SF Main Library * * San Francisco Architecture Profiles on individuals and firms practicing during the first 100 years of San Francisco's growth. * Rising Steel: Two Centuries Of San Francisco Architecture (From San Francisco City Guides: Walking Tour Descriptions) Category:Architecture in California Category:Architecture in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Culture of San Francisco ","title":"Architecture of San Francisco"},{"id":"19317278","text":"Dale Fritz (born ) is an Australian former rugby league footballer who played in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. ==Playing career== Fritz played for the Illawarra Steelers, the Western Suburbs Magpies, Western Reds and the North Queensland Cowboys in Australia.

Sarah Palin, while serving as Governor of Alaska, was nominated as the first female candidate of the Republican Party for Vice President of the United States. Following the nomination, her public image came under close media scrutiny, particularly regarding her religious perspective on public life, her socially conservative views, and a perceived lack of experience. Palin's experience in foreign and domestic politics came under criticism among conservatives as well as liberals following her nomination.John F. Harris and Beth Frerking.\\"Clinton aides: Palin treatment sexist\\"; Politico, September 11, 2008 A poll taken by Rasmussen Reports just after the Republican National Convention in the first week of September 2008 found that Palin was more popular than either Barack Obama or John McCain; however, this perception later reversed. At the same time, Palin became more popular among Republicans than McCain.\\"Palin More Popular With GOP Voters Than McCain\\" . Rasmussen Reports. November 4, 2008. A February 2010 ABC News/Washington Post poll showed 71% of Americans felt Palin lacked the qualifications necessary to be President of the United States.Mcauliff, Michael. \\"Poll reads Palin's palm: no chance in 2012; 71% of Americans don't think she's qualified to be prez\\", The New York Daily News, February 11, 2010. Retrieved 2011-01-19. ==Qualifications for higher office== Then-Governor Sarah Palin at the annual blessing of the fishing fleet in Dillingham, Alaska in 2007. Prior to the Republican National Convention, a Gallup poll found that most voters were unfamiliar with Sarah Palin. 39% said she is ready to serve as president if needed, 33% said she is not, and 29% had no opinion. This was \\"the lowest vote of confidence in a running mate since the elder George Bush chose then-Indiana senator Dan Quayle to join his ticket in 1988.\\" Republicans cited her tenure in executive office, high popularity, past focus on ethics and energy issues, her personal life, as well as her command of the Alaska National Guard and Alaska's proximity to foreign countries among reasons for the choice of Sarah Palin. ===Suitability for Vice President=== Criticism focused on her limited foreign policy experience and work on major policy issues and claims of low amount of actual responsibility as well as alleged misconduct during her time in office. Her readiness to step in should the president be incapacitated was also questioned. ===Suitability for President=== A February 2010 poll for ABC News and The Washington Post showed 71% of Americans felt Palin lacked the qualifications necessary to be President of the United States. In a poll in October 2010, the number dropped to 67%, with 27% seeing her as qualified and with self-described Tea party members split evenly. ===Foreign policy experience=== Sarah Palin cited Alaska's proximity to Russia and her dealings with foreign trade delegations as showing her the importance of foreign policy. Palin later agreed that her comments were \\"mocked\\" and reiterated her view that this proximity enhanced her foreign policy credentials. Her interviews and particularly her response to explaining the Bush Doctrine as Bush's \\"worldview\\" were criticized. Subsequently, a survey found likely voters were divided on whether Palin had the personality and leadership qualities a president should have. ==Impact on the 2008 election== After announcing Palin as the presumptive vice- presidential nominee, the McCain campaign received $7 million in contributions in a single day, and the Obama campaign garnered more than $8 million by the next day. During the campaign, Palin evoked a more strongly divided response than Joe Biden among voters and was viewed both more favorably and unfavorably when compared to her opponent. A plurality of the television audience rated Biden's performance higher at the 2008 vice-presidential debate. Following the presidential election, 69% of Republicans felt Palin had helped John McCain's bid, while 20% felt Palin hurt. In the same poll, 71% of Republicans stated Palin had been the right choice. ==Perceptions of Palin's political positionsEnergy and environment=== Environmental organizations, including the Center for Biological Diversity, the Sierra Club Alaska, and Greenpeace strongly opposed Palin's positions on issues of energy and environment and criticized Palin for her skepticism regarding humans as the cause of global warming and her administration's positions on wildlife, including the attempt to have the federal designation of the polar bear as a threatened species removed. They also criticized Palin's support of oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. ===Religion in public life=== After being nominated, Palin's religious views came under scrutiny from the media.Alexi Mostrous. Sarah Palin, the pastor and the prophecy: judgment day is not far away\\"; Times Online, September 10, 2008\\"Pastor: GOP may be downplaying Palin's religious beliefs\\"; CNN, September 12, 2008 Palin spoke to a group of graduating ministry students at her former church, where she urged them to pray \\"that our leaders, our national leaders, are sending [U.S. soldiers] out on a task that is from God,\\" and in the same remarks asserted that \\"God's will\\" was responsible for the Alaskan national gas pipeline project. Following the Republican National Convention, the McCain campaign told CNN that Palin \\"doesn't consider herself Pentecostal,\\" raising the possibility for commentators that she might be downplaying her faith. A Rassmussen poll taken after the convention found that Palin was a draw with Catholic voters; the poll found that 54% favor Palin and 42% find her unfavorable, a 12% difference, while Joe Biden was viewed favorably by 49% to 47%. Republican Jewish Coalition Executive Director Matt Brooks commented: \\"As governor of Alaska, Palin has enjoyed a strong working relationship with Alaska's Jewish community. She has demonstrated sensitivity to the concerns of the community and has been accessible and responsive.\\" The Republican Jewish Coalition publishes a page on its website debunking what it calls \\"smears\\" about Sarah Palin, as well as an endorsement from Governor Linda Lingle, Hawaii's first Jewish and first female governor.\\"Smears Debunked: The Truth about Gov. Sarah Palin \\", Republican Jewish Coalition, September 9, 2008. ===Women's issues=== On September 16, 2008, the National Organization for Women (NOW) gave its endorsement in the Presidential race to Democratic candidate Barack Obama and his running mate Joe Biden. The Independent of London reported: \\"The feminist organisation almost never supports a presidential candidate, but the Alaska governor's Christian fundamentalist faith and her opposition to abortion rights has forced its hand.\\"Leonard Doyle.'Hillary's women' reject McCain's VP choice\\"; The Independent September 17, 2008 Gandy explained, \\"as the chair of NOW's Political Action Committee, I am frequently asked whether NOW supports women candidates just because they are women.

Will there be some turned off by the whole pre- marital sex thing? Of course but this type of story doesn't sink her at all with Evangelicals\\".\\"Palin‚Äôs 17-Year-Old Daughter is Pregnant\\"; CBN News, The Brody File, September 1, 2008 Evangelical leader Richard Land said of Palin's seventeen-year-old daughter's pregnancy, \\"Those who criticize the Palin family don't understand that we don't see babies as a punishment but as a blessing.\\" Bill O'Reilly expressed support for Palin: \\"As long as society doesn't have to support the mother, father or baby, it is a personal matter.\\" Hillary Clinton \\"Hillary is missing in action from the Palin-hating brigade,\\" opined a writer for The Weekly Standard. Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton referred to Palin's VP nomination as \\"historic,\\"\\"Palin Thinks Obama Regrets Not Choosing Clinton for VP\\"; ET, September 12, 2008 stating, \\"We should all be proud of Governor Sarah Palin's historic nomination, and I congratulate her and Senator McCain.... While their policies would take America in the wrong direction, Governor Palin will add an important new voice to the debate.\\" Wisconsin Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin expressed a different view: \\"To the extent that this choice represents an effort to court supporters of Hillary Clinton's historic candidacy, McCain misjudges the reasons so many voters rallied around her candidacy. It was Senator Clinton's experience, skill and commitment to change, especially in the areas of health care and energy policy, that drew such strong support. Sarah Palin's opposition to Roe v. Wade and her support of big oil will not draw Democrats from the Obama-Biden ticket.\\"Jon Nichols. \\"Clinton Praises Palin Pick\\"; The Nation, August 30, 2008 The president of NOW, Kim Gandy, said: \\"What McCain does not understand is that women supported Hillary Clinton not just because she was a woman, but because she was a champion on their issues. They will surely not find Sarah Palin to be an advocate for women.\\" Palin and Clinton were compared and contrasted with one another in the media. A New York Times article explained: \\"Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Palin have little in common beyond their breakout performances at the conventions and the soap opera aspects of their family lives. Mrs. Clinton always faces high expectations; Ms. Palin faced low expectations this week, and benefited from them. Mrs. Clinton can seem harsh when she goes on the attack; Ms. Palin has shown a knack for attacking without seeming nasty. Mrs. Clinton has a lot of experience; Ms. Palin, not so much. Mrs. Clinton is pantsuits; Ms. Palin is skirts.\\"Patrick Healey.\\"The Real ‚Äô08 Fight: Clinton v.

Howard Dean, the former Chair of the Democratic National Committee, said that Palin \\"just made that up. Just like the 'Bridge to Nowhere' that she supposedly didn't support.\\" Republicans were divided. Former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich agreed with Palin, saying that \\"there are clearly people in America who believe in establishing euthanasia, including selective standards.\\" Palin's \\"death panels\\" comment was selected as the \\"Lie of the Year\\" by PolitiFact.com, the fact-checking website of the St. Petersburg Times. Palin was also criticized for having invoked her infant for political purposes.

Palin was early on accused of dissimulation in her approach to campaigning during the 2008 elections. An Associated Press journalist reported: \\"Day after day she said she had told Congress 'no thanks' to the so-called Bridge to Nowhere, a rural Alaska project that was abandoned when critics challenged its costs and usefulness. For nearly a week, major news outlets had documented that Palin supported the bridge: \\"In her nomination acceptance speech and on the campaign trail, Palin has often said: \\"I told the Congress 'thanks, but no thanks,' for that Bridge to Nowhere.\\": Although Palin was originally a main proponent of the Gravina Island Bridge, McCain-Palin television advertisements claim Palin \\"stopped the Bridge to Nowhere.\\" These claims were widely questioned or described as misleading in several newspapers across the political spectrum when running for governor in 2006, noting that she turned against it only after it became an object of ridicule in Alaska and a symbol of Congress's out-of-control earmarking... (The campaign) equated lawmakers' requests for money for special projects with corruption, even though Palin has sought millions of dollars in such 'earmarks' this year. The Washington Post reported that \\"critics, the news media and nonpartisan fact checkers have called [Palin's claim] a fabrication or, at best, a half-truth.\\" Palin compared herself to Harry Truman, the vice- president who succeeded Franklin D. Roosevelt, contributing to the impression that for a time the race was between Palin and Obama. Indeed, for many Palin was the main attraction at McCain-Palin rallies; there were often \\"a sizable number of people making their way towards the exit\\" after Palin left the podium.Adam Aigner in First Read After the McCain-Palin ticket lost the elections, media coverage focused on rumors of infighting within the McCain campaign, reporting that campaign staffers stated Palin had refused preparation for her interview with Katie Couric, was at times emotionally intractable, could not list the three members of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and was unaware that Africa is a continent rather than a country, had scheduled an interview with French President Nicolas Sarkozy which turned out to be a radio station prank, spent far more than the reported amount on her campaign wardrobe, and asked to make her own concession speech on election night.Kate Snow.\\"Palin Aide Fires Back at Reported McCain Camp Slams\\"; ABC New November 6, 2008 Although Palin disputed the accusations as \\"foolish,\\" she said she bears no ill will towards the McCain staff who anonymously leaked the accusations to the press.The Canadian Press: Knives come out for Sarah Palin The Globe and Mail, Nov 6, 2008.

Pls see my Facebook page.\\"McCormick, John. \\"'Don't Retreat, Reload,‚Äô Palin Urges Republicans (Update2)\\", Bloomberg (April 9, 2010). Palin critics said she was inciting violence.

Palin referred to the targets as \\"a bullseye icon\\" in a post-election tweet. In the immediate aftermath of the 2011 Tucson shooting, where Giffords was among those who were shot, Palin was the subject of press and political criticism about her style of political rhetoric, which was disputed by defenders of Palin in the media. Palin removed the controversial graphic from her website, but later restored it. On Glenn Beck, an e-mail said to be from Palin was read, saying \\"I hate violence. I hate war. Our children will not have peace if politicos just capitalize on this to succeed in portraying anyone as inciting terror and violence.\\" Following the 2011 Tucson shooting, a Palin aide stated that death threats against the former Alaska governor had risen to \\"an unprecedented level.\\" As more details of the shooting emerged, The Christian Science Monitor reported: \\"The suggestion that the shooting of Rep.

A public opinion survey commissioned by USA Today and conducted by Gallup January 14‚Äì16, 2011, showed that Palin was perceived favorably by 38% of those polled and unfavorably by 53%, the highest unfavorable rating since Palin entered national politics. ===Approach to governance=== Palin came under fire in congress and the media as a result of her support for the Gravina Island Bridge \\"Bridge to Nowhere,\\" often called an emblem of pork-barrel spending and excessive earmark requests. Some media outlets repeated Palin's statement that she \\"stood up to Big Oil\\" when she resigned after just 11 months as the head of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission because of abuses she witnessed involving other Republican commissioners and their ties to energy companies and energy lobbyists, and again when she raised taxes on oil companies as governor; in turn others said that she is a \\"friend of Big Oil\\" due to her fervent advocacy of oil exploitation, including her push to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling and effort to de-list polar bears as an Endangered species since this could hinder oil speculation.\\"Palin sought more taxes and more development from oil companies\\"; Politifact, Saint Petersburg Times, August 29, 2008\\"Is Palin foe of big oil or a new Cheney?\\"; Reuters, September 12, 2008 Similarly, some called Palin a \\"small-town foe of 'good old boys' politics and a champion for ethics reform,\\" as evidenced by her run-ins with Ted Stevens, while others argued that Palin's record \\"undermined arguments that Palin has broken from Alaska's Republican machine, including Stevens.\\"Apuzzo, Matt. ‚ÄúCampaign money hurts Palin's outsider image‚Äù, Associated Press (September 2, 2008) Still others point to nepotistic hiring tendencies and question her firing policies.

Retrieved 2010-12-15. ==Persona== Soon after the 2008 Republican National Covention, Palin quickly became a favorite subject of satire and derision. According to Lara Spencer, host of the tabloid show The Insider, Palin was part of a big cross-over between politics and pop culture in the 2008 election.Insider: Public Loves Politics, Pop Culture Mix , Walt Belcher, Tampa Tribune, November 7, 2008, via TBOExtra.com. Retrieved November 13, 2008. During the campaign Spencer conducted the only live broadcast interview with Palin's husband, Todd Palin. Palin's status as a mother of a child with Down syndrome was initially a focus for some pundits and reporters during her national emergence in 2008. CNN's John Roberts pondered: \\"Children with Down's syndrome require an awful lot of attention. The role of vice president, it seems to me, would take up an awful lot of her time, and it raises the issue of how much time will she have to dedicate to her newborn child?\\" William Kristol of The Weekly Standard wrote: \\"There she is: a working woman who's a proud wife and mother; a traditionalist in important matters who's broken through all kinds of barriers; a reformer who's a Republican; a challenger of a corrupt good-old-boy establishment who's a conservative; a successful woman whose life is unapologetically grounded in religious belief; a lady who's a leader.\\" ===Appearance=== A great deal of attention was paid to Palin's physical appearance during the 2008 election. According to Vogue magazine, \\"Besides being telegenic, [Palin] had a tough-girl Alaskan r√©sum√© that most politicians could only dream of‚Äîthe protein her family eats comes from fish she has pulled out of the ocean with her own hands and caribou she has shot.\\" Others were quick to point out striking resemblances of Palin to actress Tina Fey, who would impersonate her on Saturday Night Live, and Peggy Hill, a character on Fox Network's cartoon series King of the Hill. Regarding her appearance, Palin has said, \\"I've been taken aback by the nasty criticism about my appearance. I wish they'd stick with the issues instead of discussing my black go-go boots. A reporter once asked me about it during the campaign, and I assured him I was trying to be as frumpy as I could by wearing my hair on top of my head and these schoolmarm glasses.\\" According to the Los Angeles Times of October 23, 2008, \\"the news that the Republican National Committee has bought Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and her family nearly $150,000 worth of clothing since September has fueled charges of hypocrisy by her detractors and sparked questions about the legality of the expenditures\\". It reported that \\"Election-law experts are split on whether the RNC's expenditure is allowable under federal laws, which prohibit the use of campaign funds for personal use.\\" Tracey Schmitt, Palin's traveling press secretary responded by saying \\"It was always the intent that the clothing go to a charitable purpose after the campaign.\\" \\"I am an Obama supporter, but when I heard that for $150,000, they dressed her, her children and her husband, I thought, 'that's not much',\\" said Vicki Sanchez, a costume designer who dressed Geena Davis as the first female U.S. president on the short-lived TV show Commander in Chief.\\" She continues on to say \\"When you start buying $3,000 suits, boots that cost anywhere from $800 and up, and designer shoes, which cost $500 at least, it goes fast.\\" ===Oration=== A profile in The New Yorker described Palin's oratorical style as \\"simultaneously chatty and urgent,\\" and noted that \\"she reinforces her words with winks and nods and wrinklings of her nose that seem meant to telegraph intimacy and ease.\\" The article's author, Philip Gourevitch, characterized Palin as being \\"high-spirited, irrepressible, and not in the least self-conscious.\\" Features of the Minnesotan dialect are prominent in the Mat-Su Valley where Palin grew up because the area was settled by farmers from Minnesota during the Great Depression. Palin's dialect is Upper Midwestern, and she speaks with a characteristic North Central American English dialect. Her dialect is often tied in with her persona, and often reinforces her \\"folksy\\" image. ===\\"Refudiate\\"=== In July 2010, amidst the Cordoba House controversy, Palin on Twitter asked Muslims to \\"pls refudiate\\" support for the mosque. She was then mocked by bloggers and media outletsNPR: Refudiate? Repudiate? Let's Call The Whole Thing Off. August 3, 2010. for using \\"refudiate,\\" which is not a word. Palin later responded on Twitter, saying that \\"English is a living language.\\" and \\"Shakespeare liked to coin new words too.\\" According to Michael Shear of The New York Times, the record suggests the original Twitter message was no typo. Just days earlier in a Fox News appearance, Palin had combined \\"refute\\" and \\"repudiate\\" into \\"refudiate.\\" The word was chosen as new word of the year for 2010 by the New Oxford American Dictionary, with the statement \\"From a strictly lexical interpretation of the different contexts in which Palin has used 'refudiate,' we have concluded that neither 'refute' nor 'repudiate' seems consistently precise, and that 'refudiate' more or less stands on its own, suggesting a general sense of 'reject.'\\" ===Palin's children=== In June 2009 David Letterman told a joke that Sarah Palin's daughter was \\"knocked up\\" by a baseball player during a Yankees game. Palin then issued a public statement condemning Letterman's joke. A campaign then began to have David Letterman fired or to force him to apologize for his actions, with several Republicans organizing a boycott of Letterman sponsors. On June 16, Sarah Palin accepted Letterman's apology. In June 2009, Palin responded to a blogger for posting a photo in which her son Trig's face was altered, calling the change \\"malicious.\\" The image superimposed was of a local Alaskan right-wing radio show host and was implying that he was her \\"baby\\" regarding his positive coverage of her governorship foibles. ===Palin and the media=== In July 2009, Palin threatened to sue any media outlet that printed rumors that she was being investigated by the FBI on corruption charges involving inappropriate contracts. The head of the FBI in Alaska said that she was not being investigated. Some reports stated that the statute of limitations on the contract incident would have passed. She also criticized the media in an op-ed in The Washington Post in which she said \\"many in the media would rather focus on the personality-driven political gossip of the day than on the gravity of these Cap and Trade challenges. So, at risk of disappointing the chattering class, let me make clear what is foremost on my mind and where my focus will be.\\" The Palin residence on Lake Lucille Palin herself, the Los Angeles Times, and other commentators have accused Newsweek of sexism for their choice of cover in the November 2009 issue discussing Palin's book, Going Rogue: An American Life. The cover depicted her posing in gym-clothes and was captioned \\"How do you solve a problem like Sarah.\\" \\"It's sexist as hell,\\" wrote Lisa Richardson for the LA Times. Taylor Marsh of The Huffington Post called it \\"the worst case of pictorial sexism aimed at political character assassination ever done by a traditional media outlet.\\" David Brody of CBN News stated: \\"This cover should be insulting to women politicians.\\" The cover came from a photo of Palin used in the August 2009 issue of Runner's World. In March 2010, Palin starred on a travelogue reality television series on the Discovery Channel called Sarah Palin's Alaska, produced by Mark Burnett. A Palin series on Fox News called Real American Stories generated some controversy since several of the guests shown \\"interviewed\\" by her claimed to have never met her: L.L. Cool J and Toby Keith both complained that footage taken from an interview with someone else was recycled for this. ===Paul Revere remarks=== During a 2011 bus tour, titled \\"One Nation,\\" across the Northeastern states and paid for by her PAC, Palin visited the Paul Revere House in Boston. When asked what she had learned during her visit, Palin replied with a comment to the effect that Paul Revere had warned the British that Americans would not let them confiscate American arms, and that Revere's warnings involved ringing bells and firing guns. The remark was widely seen as a gaffe and not accepted by the news media, but she declined to withdraw her assertion. Historian Brendan McConville stated that Palin's account was \\"essentially right\\" and Cornell law professor William Jacobson said Palin's critics are the ones in need of a history lesson. \\"It seems to be a historical fact that this happened, A lot of the criticism is unfair and made by people who are themselves ignorant of history.\\" On the other hand, Revere biographer James Giblin disagreed with some of Palin's remarks, characterizing her comment about warning the British as a \\"blooper.\\" A director from the Paul Revere House also disagreed with historical descriptions made by Palin. Robert Allison, the chair of the history department at Suffolk University, commented in an interview with NPR that Revere did not personally ring bells nor were gunshots involved, but he did ride as part of the militia warning system, intending the ringing of church bells as a sign of American solidarity and a warning to the British not to impound the colonists' weapons. Allison said that Palin was correct on the whole. ==Parodies== Palin became a subject of parody and satire soon after her nomination for Vice President on the Republican Party ticket for the 2008 presidential election. ===2008 Presidential election=== Immediate comic reaction Leone Sextus Tollemache.

Tina Fey and Saturday Night Live Tina Fey as Sarah Palin (left) and Amy Poehler as Hillary Clinton (right) On September 13, 2008, Tina Fey appeared in a comedy skit, \\"A Nonpartisan Message from Governor Sarah Palin & Senator Hillary Clinton,\\" on Saturday Night Live as Sarah Palin, alongside Amy Poehler as Hillary Clinton. The sketch was written by Poehler, Fey, and head writer and Weekend Update anchor Seth Meyers. The following year Fey won an Emmy in the category of Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her impersonation of Palin. Due to its popularity, additional sketches with Tina Fey as Sarah Palin were seen in later SNL episodes leading up to the weekend before the election, with Fey ultimately performing her impersonation alongside both the real Palin and John McCain. Palin has said that, before her national prominence, she once dressed up as Fey on Halloween. Palin herself has appeared several times on Saturday Night Live or its primetime specials; a couple skits have featured guest stars mistaking Palin for Fey. Nicole Parker and MADtv On September 27, 2008, Nicole Parker portrayed Sarah Palin during a mock Q&A; session in a live audience. On October 4, 2008 MADtv aired a Special Election Presidential Special where it featured Parker once again appearing as Palin.

Her co-host, Regis Philbin, impersonated Joe Biden. (video) Caribou Barbie Following her nomination, Palin was often tagged with the epithet \\"Caribou Barbie,\\" a play on Malibu Barbie, owing to her background as a beauty pageant contestant in her home state of Alaska.Chris Weigant, \\"My 2008 'McLaughlin Awards'\\" Huffington Post, December 26, 2008.David Freddoso, \\"‚ÄòCaribou Barbie‚Äô\\", National Review Online, September 5, 2008.

Baldwin later referred to Palin as \\"Bible Spice\\" in an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman. The epithet Caribou Barbie has been contrasted with Palin's usage of Mama grizzly to describe herself and later to describe other moms seeking political office. Country music singer Ray Stevens issued a YouTube music video entitled Caribou Barbie on March 11, 2010 which gently parodies Palin's image but at the same time denounces her critics and urges voters to think of her in 2012 should she decide to run for the U.S. Presidency. ===Post- resignation=== William Shatner In addition to his career on Star Trek, actor William Shatner is also known for his spoken word performances. On July 27, 2009, Shatner gave a \\"spoken word\\" interpretation of Palin's farewell address on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. He returned to the Tonight Show on July 29, 2009 and performed a few of Palin's \\"Tweets\\" on Twitter. Shatner then appeared on the show on December 11, 2009 to recite Palin's Going Rogue: An American Life, but was followed by an appearance from Palin herself reading excerpts from Shatner's autobiography, Up Till Now.

Thin Lizzy drummer Brian Downey referred to White as \\"really an Ian Gillan clone\\".Mark Putterford, \\"Philip Lynott: The Rocker\\", Castle, 1994 Thin Lizzy did not have a keyboard player in their lineup, so Elmer Fudd's keyboardist Dave \\"Mojo\\" Lennox, later in Blodwyn Pig, was also asked to participate. Thin Lizzy guitarist Eric Bell stated that White and Lennox were each paid \\"around ¬£60\\" to travel to De Lane Lea Studios in London to record the album. ==Recording== The makeshift band rehearsed for \\"two or three hours\\", according to Downey, before recording the whole album in one day. Nine tracks were recorded, with five being Deep Purple covers. Three others were loosely improvised instrumentals; \\"Dan\\" ‚Äì a version of \\"Londonderry Air\\" or \\"Danny Boy\\" by Bell in a Jimi Hendrix style; \\"Rising Sun\\" ‚Äì a cover of \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\" made popular by The Animals; and the original composition \\"Palamatoon\\". The last track on the album was \\"Corina\\", credited to Leo Muller, as were the other non-Deep Purple songs. The album was released in the UK and the USA on the Stereo Gold Award label, and on the Sonic Records label in Germany. For the German release, the band's name was changed to \\"The Rock Machine\\" with the album title being changed to \\"The Rock Machine Play the Best of Deep Purple\\".Thin Lizzy Guide - discography In its original edition, the album was available at Woolworths for 50p. Thin Lizzy were paid ¬£1000 for the recording but their name was entirely omitted from the album, and a photo of a different band was featured on the cover, namely Hard Stuff, who were signed to Deep Purple's own label. ===Especially for You...=== Another album was released by Muller in 1973 using the Funky Junction name, titled Especially for You..., credited to Gladys Knight & the Pips featuring Funky Junction, also on the Stereo Gold Award label. However, Gladys Knight & the Pips did not perform on the record, and the two tracks credited to Funky Junction, \\"Talking Trash\\" and \\"Road's End\\", were recorded by an entirely different band and did not involve Lynott, Bell, Downey, White or Lennox. ==Funky Junction Play a Tribute to Deep PurpleAlbum track listing=== #\\"Fireball\\" (Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Jon Lord, Ian Paice) #\\"Dan\\" (Leo Muller) #\\"Black Night\\" (Blackmore, Gillan, Glover, Lord, Paice) #\\"Palamatoon\\" (Muller) #\\"Strange Kind of Woman\\" (Blackmore, Gillan, Glover, Lord, Paice) #\\"Hush\\" (Joe South) #\\"Rising Sun\\" (Muller) #\\"Speed King\\" (Blackmore, Gillan, Glover, Lord, Paice) #\\"Corina\\" (Muller) ===Personnel=== *Eric Bell ‚Äì guitar *Phil Lynott ‚Äì bass guitar *Brian Downey ‚Äì drums *Benny White ‚Äì vocals *Dave Lennox ‚Äì keyboards ==References * Category:Irish hard rock musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1972 Category:Tribute bands ","title":"Funky Junction"},{"id":"19317560","text":"Umm al-Nasr Mosque () or Beit Hanoun Mosque is the oldest mosque in the Palestinian city of Beit Hanoun in the Gaza Strip, located in the center of the city. ==History== The Umm al-Nasr Mosque was built 1239 by the Ayyubids to commemorate their soldiers who had died in the battle on the mosque site between them and the Crusaders.

Rayner attended schools in Yorkshire and Wales before studying philosophy and law at the University of Cambridge. He has worked as an editor at Time Out Magazine, in London, and later on the literary magazine Granta, then based in Cambridge. ==First book== Rayner is the author of nine books. His first, Los Angeles Without A Map, was published in 1988. Part-fiction, part-travelogue, this was turned into a movie L.A. Without a Map (for which Rayner co-wrote the screenplay with director Mika Kaurism√§ki) starring David Tennant, Vinessa Shaw, Julie Delpy, Vincent Gallo, and, in an uncredited part, Johnny Depp. ==1996‚Äìpresent== In 1996, Rayner published The Blue Suit, a memoir about his early life that won an Esquire Non-Fiction Award in the UK, and was described as 'a beguiling portrait of the artist as a writer and a crook' by the New York Times. Novels like The Cloud Sketcher and Devil's Wind followed. Murder Book, another novel, grew out of a time that Rayner spent riding with the Los Angeles Police Department. In 2009, Rayner published A Bright And Guilty Place, a non-fiction historical narrative set in Los Angeles in the late 1920s and early 1930s, featuring various true-life tabloid crimes of the era. Rayner is a prolific journalist and short-story writer. He has published in The New Yorker, The Los Angeles Times, Esquire, The Times, The Guardian, The Observer and Granta Magazine among others. He wrote about the Los Angeles Riots for Granta Magazine, and about the post- Rodney-King Los Angeles Police Department for the New York Times Magazine. His non-fiction work for the New Yorker has included a profile of Robert Redford, and a story about how a Finnish entomologist helped put leaves back on pest- ravaged Beijing trees in time for the 2008 Olympics. Rayner wrote and presented 'Back to Bradford', a documentary for UK Channel 4 about returning to his home town. Rayner wrote a monthly column entitled Paperback Writers for the Los Angeles Times. His work has been translated into more than twenty languages. He is married to a Finn, P√§ivi Suvilehto, and the couple have two sons, Harry and Charlie. He has lived in Venice, California since 1992. Rayner is the writer and co-creator, with Don Handfield, and executive producer, of the historical drama Knightfall, concerning the downfall and legend of the Knights Templar, which aired in the USA on the History channel, starting late 2017. The show stars Tom Cullen, Jim Carter, and Julian Ovenden, and was shot in Prague in 2016 and 2018. Rayner co-wrote 'The Rift', the first episode of the Steven Spielberg produced reboot of 'Amazing Stories' for Apple TV, aired in April 2020. Rayner has taught creative writing at King's College Cambridge and the University of Southern California. Currently he teaches in the Theater, Film and Television Department at UCLA. ==PublicationsNovels=== *Los Angeles Without A Map (1988 - adapted for film in 1998) * The Elephant (1991) * Murder Book (1998) * The Cloud Sketcher (2001) * The Devil's Wind (2005) ===Non-fiction=== * The Blue Suit (1995), Review: \\"Portrait Of The Artist As A Writer And A Crook\\" by Michuko Kakutani, New York Times, October 27, 1995 * Drake's Fortune (2002) about the con artist Oscar Hartzell * The Associates: Four Capitalists Who Created California (2008) features profiles of Collis Huntington, Charles Crocker, Mark Hopkins and Leland Stanford * A Bright And Guilty Place (2009) about the murderer of Los Angeles underworld figure Charles H.

As New York's major independent recording studio for almost 40 years, Associated was used by all types of musicians, singers, songwriters, producers and publishers in New York's thriving music industry. First located on Broadway, Associated moved a few blocks to a larger space in 1961 at 723 7th Avenue, near 48th Street, at the northern end of Times Square. Associated was owned and operated by Nathan ‚ÄúNat‚Äù Schnapf and Paul Friedberger, who met while working as radar technicians at Western Electric during World War II. As a major independent studio, Associated was available to anyone with a recording need. It was used by talent from the entire range of New York's music industry: opera, jazz, broadway, pop, blues, and even country. Beyond pure entertainment, the studio recorded political ads, advertising jingles, comedy albums ‚Äì just about anything; including a rare field recording of a speech by Albert Einstein. With the ascendency of Rock and Roll in the 1950s and 1960s, Associated's staple business became making ‚Äúdemo‚Äù records for up and coming singers and bands, and for New York's large community of songwriters, publishers and producers seeking to strike it rich with a hit song. Much of the material covered by the artists of the 1950s and 1960s was written by the many great songwriters of the day. These songwriters acted independently of the major record labels, often working for one of the large number of publishing companies inhabiting the Brill Building and surrounding area. Taking the idea for a song, the writers/publishers/producers would come to Associated to cut a demo, often adapting and improvising along the way, which would then be used to try to entice a known artist to cover the song. In most instances, once an act's success was established it would sign with a record label and typically, would thereafter use the label's private studio. Accordingly, making recordings for established artists was only a small portion Associated's business. Nonetheless, many major ‚Äúhits‚Äù where recorded there. Some by up and coming artists who went on to long, successful careers; others by ‚Äúone hit wonders.‚Äù In addition to providing the recording space and equipment, Associated provided engineers and, if requested, hired studio musicians, many of which were enormously talented. It maintained a large assortment of standard and exotic instruments ‚Äì from penny whistles to Hammond organs, and its engineers were always willing to experiment with new recording techniques to get that new sound many artists were looking for. Associated was never involved in mass production of records or tapes. In most cases the end product of a recording session was a session tape and a record made using a lathe to cut a groove on a lacquer-covered aluminum disk. The 1970s and 1980s brought major changes to the recording industry which impacted Associated business. During this time, recording technology was changing and developing quickly, and more and more recording artists began writing their own material, cutting the roll of independent songwriters. Ultimately, these factors led the Associated's owners to shut down as they neared retirement age. The following is a partial list of artists, songwriters and others who are believed to have used Associated's facilities: Al Caiola, Al Hirt, Al Martino, Albert Einstein, Andy Williams, Archie Bleyer, Art Garfunkel, Arthur Godfrey, Barbra Streisand, Barry Manilow, Barry Mann, Bette Midler, Beverly Ross, Bill Charlap, Blood Sweat & Tears, Bo Diddley, Bob Hilliard, Bobby \\"Boris\\" Pickett, Bobby Darin, Bobby Goldsboro, Bobby Susser, Brian Hyland, Bryan Adams, Burl Ives, Burt Bacharach, Buster Poindexter, Carole King, Cat Stevens, Charles Strouse, Charlie Tobias, Connie Francis, Cy Coleman, Danny Davis, Danny Kaye, Dave Blum Trio, Dee Dee Warwick, Dick Van Dyke, Dionne Warwick, Doc Pomus, Don Costa, Donnie Hathaway, Duo Tones, Eleanor Steber, Ellie Greenwich, Elvis Costello, Ethel Merman, Eydie Gorme, Fats Domino, Firefly (Brooklyn local folk-pop band), Frank Sinatra, Gene Autry, Gerry Mulligan, Ginger Rogers, Gwen Verdon, Hal David, Hank Williams Jr., Henry Mancini, Herb Alpert, Herbie Hancock, Hoagy Carmichael, Howard Greenfield, Ike & Tina Turner, Jack Keller, Jake LaMotta, Janis Ian, Jerry Herman, Jerry Keller, Jo Jo Starbuck, Joe Harnell, John Sebastian, John Wayne, Johnny Marks, Jonathan Winters, Jule Styne, Kay Starr, Kenny Karen, Kenny Rogers, King Curtis, Leiber & Stoller, Lesley Gore, Lewis & Clark, Link Cromwell, Liza Minnelli, Louis Jordan, Marlene VerPlanck, Mary Ford, Mary Martin, Melba Moore, Mickey & Sylvia, Miles Davis, Milton DeLugg, Mitch Miller, Moose Charlap, Mort Shuman, Napoleon XIV, Neil Diamond, Neil Sedaka, Norman Bergen, Noro Morales, Ornette Coleman, Oscar Brand, Oscar Peterson, Otis Blackwell, Pat Boone, Patti Duke, Patti Page, Paul Evans, Paul Robeson, Paul Simon, Peggy Fleming, Peggy Lee, Perry Como, Pete Fountain, Pete Seeger/The Weavers, Peter Criss, Peter Duchin, Peter Dunfield, Peter Nero, Peter, Paul and Mary, Petula Clark, Pink Floyd, Polly Bergen, Prairie League, Ricky Dee, Roberta Flack, Rocky Graziano, Rod McKuen, Ron Dante, Sandy Stewart, Screamin‚Äô Jay Hawkins, Sheb Wooley, Shel Silverstein, Sherman Edwards, Stan Lebowski, Steely Dan, Steve Allen, Steve Lawrence, Steve Neilson, Teresa Brewer, Terry Bradshaw, The Bell Notes, The Belmonts, The Chipmunks, The Delfonics, The Four Lads, The Four Seasons, The Kalin Twins, The Ronettes, The Shirelles, The Three Suns, Thelonious Monk, Tiny Tim, Tito Puente, Tom Glazer, Tommy Edwards, Vic Damone, Walter Carlos, Woody Guthrie. ==References== See, for example, David Simons, Studio Stories, Backbeat Books, San Francisco, 2004; Ken Emerson, Always Magic in the Air ‚Äì the Bomp and Brilliance of the Brill Building Era, 2005, Viking Press.

He obtained his Bachelor of Arts (B. A.) and Master of Arts (M. A.) qualifications from the Madras Christian College, Madras. His first job was as librarian at the Mysore Oriental Library (now, the Oriental Research Institute, Mysore) which he joined in 1891. He was instrumental here in curating 1653 printed works and 1358 manuscripts - many of them in ancient Sanskrit and Kannada. He would again visit Madras to secure a Licentiate in Teaching (L. T.) qualification, thus enabling him to teach in academic institutions. Upon his return to Mysore, he joined the Government Normal School as a teacher in 1896 and eventually became a Head-Master by 1907. Upon recommendation from the first Vice Chancellor of the University of Mysore - H. V. Nanjundaiah, Hiriyanna was appointed as Lecturer in Sanskrit at Maharaja College, Mysore in 1912. He was promoted to the post of Assistant Professor of Sanskrit by 1914. Here, he came in contact with A. R. Wadia - who was heading the Department of Philosophy at Maharaja College, Mysore. S. Radhakrishnan was also on the faculty of this department at this time. The two scholars shared an in-depth interest in the study of Indian and Western Philosophies. In fact, it was S. Radhakrishnan who suggested publishers Allen & Unwin to publish in book form the class-room notes of M. Hiriyanna, which ultimately came out as \\"Outlines of Indian Philosophy\\". M. Hiriyanna was made Professor of Sanskrit Studies at Maharaja College, Mysore by 1919. He held Professorship for the next eight years and retired from the University of Mysore in 1927. His illustrious teaching career spanned more than two decades. == Personal life == L-R: M. Hiriyanna's wife Lakshmidevamma and daughter Rukkamma M. Hiriyanna led a life of frugality. He was married to Lakshmidevamma at a young age. They had a daughter by name Rukkamma. Hiriyanna was an introvert by nature and spent days on end studying at his house in Mysore. Post retirement, he declined many an invitation from universities across India to chair their Departments of Philosophy and Sanskrit Studies. His love of English literature was well known and he was an avid reader of \\" The Times Literary Supplement\\" and \\"Illustrated London News\\". Hiriyanna had a close relationship with Palghat Narayan Sastry in Mysore and the two scholars deliberated deeply on the finer aspects on Indian philosophical Thought, Vedanta and The Upanishads. Hiriyanna was also in correspondence with the eminent Sanskrit scholar - Kuppuswamy Sastry at Madras. Upon M. Hiriyanna's demise, his vast collection of books was donated to the ‚ÄúKuppuswamy Sastri Research Institute‚Äù at Mylapore. == Scholarship == M. Hiriyanna with S. Radhakrishnan & A. R. Wadia at S. Radhakrishnan's Farewell from University of Mysore Hiriyanna wrote extensively across five decades on topics ranging from the 'Art of Teaching' [Bodhana Krama \\\\- 1906] to his treatises on ‚ÄúIshavasyopanishad‚Äù (1911), ‚ÄúKenopanishad‚Äù (1912), ‚ÄúKatakopanishad‚Äù (1915) and ‚ÄúBrhadaranyakopansihad ‚Äì Part 1‚Äù in 1919. His interests included Sanskrit Language (linguistics), Sanskrit prose & poetry, comparative grammar, Vedic and post-vedic philosophical thought in India and different schools of philosophies - namely Charavaka Materialism, Buddhist School of Philosophy, Nyaya-Vaisesika, Sankhya-Yoga, Purva-Mimamsa and Vedantic Schools - Advaita, Visistadvaita and Dvaita, Indian Aesthetics, Dhvani Theory & Study of Art. His years with Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Ardeshir Ruttonji Wadia at the University of Mysore saw him interpolate, compare and elucidate finer points of Western Philosophy in relation to accepted notions on Indian philosophical thought. Hiriyanna presided over the All India Oriental Conference held in Mysore in 1935. In 1939, he was requested to chair the All India Philosophy Conference at Hyderabad. In 1940, he delivered the prestigious Miller's Memorial Lecture on Philosophy at Madras. Hiriyanna made sterling contributions to the world of Sanskrit. In recognition of this, the Madras Sanskrit Academy conferred him with the title of \\"Samskrutasevadhurina\\" the same year. Hiriyanna's contributions to comparative philology, Sahitya (Literature), Alamkara (Figures of Speech) and Vyakarana (Grammar) and several Darshanas were credible. He was undeniably the earliest to translate Bhasa's \\"Svapnavasavadattam\\" to English, which he titled \\"The Dream Queen\\". His works on Advaita are authoritative and his \\"Naishkarmya-siddhi\\" and \\"Vedanta-sara\\" are examples to this. His \\"Ishta- siddhi\\" is without doubt his finest piece on the Advaitic school of thought. His grasp of the Western philosophical doctrines is brilliantly clear in his \\"Mission of Philosophy\\" (1960) where he discusses at great length Immanuel Kant's ideas on \\"Duty\\", \\"Ideal of Perfection\\", \\"Moral good vs. Non-moral good\\", \\"Promotion of Oneself\\" and \\"Rectification of the Will\\". He had of course, made a comparative study of Socrates and Plato. Hiriyanna's foreword to V. Raghavan's \\"The Number of Rasas\\" gives one a glimpse of his grasp of the \\"Rasa Theory\\" and his perspectives on \\"Alamkara Shastra\\". This is clearly expounded in his article titled \\"Art Experience\\" published in \\"The Aryan Path\\" in 1941. ==Writings== M. Hiriyanna wrote at a prolific pace. Many of his works did not see publication until years after his passing. His English translation of the Upanishads was the beginning of what would become three decades of tireless toil. Many of his papers which he presented at various Oriental Conferences would in themselves qualify as works of considerable value. His works on Indian aesthetics form the bedrock of modern Indian writings and perspectives on that subject. His writings combined an authoritative command on the Sanskrit language with a philosopher's viewpoint on matters of ethereal and metaphysical importance. ===List of his works=== *Hiriyanna, M - Bhasha Prabodhini *Hiriyanna, M - Bodhana Krama (1907) *Hiriyanna, M - Ishavasyopanishad (1911) *Hiriyanna.

His works find place even today in libraries around the world. His translation of the Upanishads are some of the finest ever done. His erudition and contribution to the world of Sanskrit Language and Literary Studies earned him the title of \\"Samskrutasevadhurina\\" from the Madras Sanskrit Academy. He was made President of the All India Oriental Conference held in Mysore in 1935. He was additionally requested to preside over the All India Philosophy Conference at Hyderabad in 1939. He delivered the prestigious Miller's Memorial Lecture on Philosophy at Madras in 1940. His vast library of books collected and carefully curated find place in Kuppuswami Sastri Research Institute at Chennai. His students and contemporaries brought out a Felicitation Volume in his honour in 1952 titled \\"Prof M. Hiriyanna Felicitation Volume\\". To mark his birth centenary (1871-1971), a birth centenary commemoration volume was brought out in 1972. Both these volumes contain some scholarly articles on topics dear to Hiriyanna's forte, as written by luminaries like P. T. Narasimhachar and M. V. Seetharamiah among others. A generation of writers, scholars, linguists and of course philosophers in India and abroad remember him for his erudition, dedication to teaching, nobility of spirit and simplicity. P. T. Narasimhachar's description of his teacher is as follows: In 2018, Prekshaa Pratishtana in collaboration with W.I.S.E.

By the medium of Dr Duvernoy in the year 1721 he came to the University of St. Petersburg, where he studied medicine, physiology and anatomy, his main subject, which he taught students from the academic grammar school, associated with the Russian Academy of Science. This academy accepted him as a member in 1725. Later, on 22 January 1730, he was appointed ordinary professor of physiology at this university, but in 1743 he underwent the danger to be released despite best credentials due to the expiry of his agreement but until 1746 he could remain in his position with a freelance contract. Finally due to an intervention of the count Alexei Grigorevich Razumovsky his employment contract could be renewed and Weitbrecht was appointed Full Professor of anatomy in January 1747. Shortly after having restarted officially his work he suddenly died due to the takings resulting from the above mentioned uncertain situation. In his time Josias Weitbrecht was considered one of the most important anatomists. He described first and foremost the construction and function of the intervertebral disc. Some special foramina, ligaments, cartilages and fibres were named after him. Furthermore in winter 1738 he recalibrated the Delisle thermometers, which usually had 2400 graduations, to a new Delisle scale with 0 degrees as the boiling point and 150 degrees as the freezing point of water. The Delisle thermometer remained in use for almost 100 years in Russia. Altogether 21 articles, where he described his researches, are the basis of new cognitions and he used an excellent style of the Latin language. Josias Weitbrecht married Katharina Sophia Duran from Copenhagen, and with her had two sons and two daughters. ==Works (optional) == *Syndesmologia sive historia ligamentorum corporis humani quam secundum observationes anatomicas concinnavit et figuris ad objecta recentia adumbratis illustravit.

It is in the Isle of Ely, adjacent to Grunty Fen, Wentworth lies south of the A142 between Witchford and Sutton, approximately 5 miles west of Ely. The village is centred on St. Peter‚Äôs Church and a number of Listed Buildings at the junction of Main Street and Church Road. Residents travel to nearby settlements, including Ely for many goods and services. In 2015, there was no public transport serving the village. However, as of 2017, there is a limited bus service and the nearest railway serving the village is in Ely. In the 1870s, Wentworth, Cambridgeshire was described as: > \\" a parish in Ely district, Cambridge; 4¬Ω miles W by S of Ely r. station. > Post town, Ely. Acres, 1,437. Real property, ¬£2,653.

It is, however, also > possible that the name referred to a settlement inhabited only in winter.\\" The Domesday entry for Wentworth suggests that the village was then a fairly large one. Later, however, it declined in size. == Demographics == The population of the civil parish at the 2011 Census was 200. According to the 2011 Census there were 78 Males and 122 Females living in the Parish. In the first national Census of 1881, the total population was recorded as 115. The population has remained very small since that time. It had dropped to 81 by the 1931 Census and now stands at 200. The time series graph below shows the change in population, 1801-2011.http://cambridgeshireinsight.org.uk/ There was no Census conducted in 1941: The population breakdown by age as at 2011 is shown in the table below: {  ! colspan=\\"4\\" Resident population by age - Age (years) Number % of total District % - 0-4 13 6.5 6.6 - 5-9 12 6.0 6.0 - 10-14 16 8.0 5.7 - 15-19 13 6.5 5.4 - 20-24 9 4.5 4.9 - 25-44 43 21.5 27.6 - 45-59 45 22.5 20.1 - 60-64 15 7.5 6.5 - 65-74 20 10.0 9.0 - 75-84 11 5.5 5.8 - 85-89 2 1.0 1.5 - 90+ 1 0.5 0.8 } These statistics have been compiled by Cambridgeshire County Council using data published by the Office for National Statistics to develop an excel data base for ease of access. == Industry == The tables below show: The population breakdown by occupation in Wentworth by gender, 1881 (left).

There has been a church on the site since the 12th century. This was extended in the 13th and 14th centuries and extensively restored and partially rebuilt in 1868. The church site now also serves as a venue for the Village Hall and is located in the centre of the village. === School === Wentworth had a small dame-school in 1789. (fn. 44) In 1846-7 it was reported that a Sunday-school, attended by 8 boys and 15 girls, was held in the chancel of the church. The parish clerk taught the pupils, and also held classes on weekday evenings in summer. In 1899, the average attendance was only 38 and in 1922 only 16. In the latter year, the County Council, in the face of much local protest, closed the school. Children now attend school at Witchford. == Present day == In 2011, the household summary statistics were as follows: * Resident population - 200 * Number of households - 72 * Number of dwellings (approx) - 74 * Average household size (people) - 2.78 In 2010, the village was fortunate to receive funding for a new playpark from both the East Cambs. District Council Pathfinder Scheme, and the National Lottery. == Local Plan == The current Local Plan for East Cambridgeshire District Council (dated 2015) sets out a general blueprint for future growth (including Wentworth) up to 2031. It says that growth during this period will continue with an estimated 11 new dwellings, which will increase the total number of dwellings to 119. The Plan aims to prevent sprawl into the open countryside unless there are exceptional circumstances, such as essential dwellings for rural workers, or affordable housing. It also says that new employment proposals will be supported in principle, noting that there are no business premises in the village, though a handful of businesses are run from residential properties. It also aims to resist the loss of any community facilities and secure funding for improvements where possible.286x286px ==References *St Peter's Church on the Corpus of Romanesque Sculpture in Britain & Ireland (CRSBI) Category:Villages in Cambridgeshire Category:Civil parishes in Cambridgeshire Category:East Cambridgeshire District ","title":"Wentworth, Cambridgeshire"},{"id":"19317802","text":"Decision lists are a representation for Boolean functions which can be easily learnable from examples.

Served warm and sliced, with butter, it was first recorded in 1780Merriam-Webster https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Sally%20Lunn Retrieved 28 March 2018 in the spa town of Bath in southwest England. The same name has been applied to various unrelated breads in the United States since the early 20th century. == Origins == The origins of the Sally Lunn are shrouded in myth. One theory is that it is an anglicisation of \\"Soleil et lune\\" (French for \\"sun and moon\\"), representing the golden crust and white base/interior. The Sally Lunn Eating House in Bath, England, claims that the recipe was brought to Bath in the 1680s by a Huguenot refugee called Solange Luyon, who became known as Sally Lunn, but there is no evidence to support this theory. \\"Food Britannia\\" reiterates the Solange Luyon theory but cites the \\"tea shop which sells them\\" as the source of the information. A 2015 report by The Daily Telegraph states \\"It is a charming tale, but, sadly, a fictitious one ‚Äì there is little evidence for Mademoiselle Luyon, whatever the museum in the restaurant‚Äôs basement might tell you\\". There is a passing mention of \\"Sally Lunn and saffron cake\\" in a 1776 poem about Dublin by the Irish poet William Preston.Preston, William Heroic Epistle to Mr. Twiss, by Donna Teresa Pinna y Ruiz in The first recorded mention of the bun in Somerset is as part of a detox regime in Philip Thicknesse's 1780 guidebook to taking the waters at Bath. Thicknesse describes how he would daily see visitors drinking 2-3 pints of Bath water and then \\"sit down to a meal of Sally Lunns or hot spungy rolls, made high by burnt butter!\\" He recommends against the practice as his brother died after this kind of breakfast:Thicknesse (1780), p12\\"Such a meal, few young men in full health can get over without feeling much inconvenience\\". There is little historical evidence for Sally Lunn as a person. The Gentleman's Magazine of 1798 uses Sally Lunn as an example during a discussion of foods named after people‚Äî\\"a certain sort of hot rolls, now, or not long ago, in vogue at Bath, were gratefully and emphatically styled 'Sally Lunns'\\". But it is not until 1827 that a historical person is described by a correspondent of William Hone using the pseudonym \\"Jehoiada\\", who says she had sold the buns on the street \\"about thirty years ago\\". A baker called Dalmer had bought out her business and made it highly successful after he composed a special song for the vendors, who sold the buns from mobile ovens. The earliest evidence of commercial production is an 1819 advertisement for the Sally Lunn \\"cakes\\" sold by W. Needes of Bath, bread and biscuit maker to the Prince Regent. Sally Lunns were mentioned together with muffins and crumpets by Charles Dickens in 1844 in his novel The Chimes. A year later, in 1845, Eliza Acton gave a recipe in Modern Cookery for Private Families, describing it as a version of \\"Solimemne - A rich French breakfast cake, or Sally Lunn\\". Solilemmes is a kind of brioche that is served warm and popularised by the great Parisian chef Marie-Antoine Car√™me in a book of 1815. Car√™me claimed the solilem originated in Alsace but there is no evidence to support that claim; he may have taken the idea from contacts in Bath and then tried to disguise the origins of a recipe that came from France's great enemy. ==Sally Lunn's house== The medieval building now known as the Sally Lunn Eating House is at 4 North Parade Passage (formerly Lilliput Alley) in Bath The site was originally occupied by the south range of Bath Abbey and the lowest floor level dates to the reconstruction of the abbey after a great fire in 1137. The masonry oven in the basement dates from this time. After the Reformation it came into the hands of the Colthurst family of Wardour Castle who sold it to John Hall of Bradford on Avon in 1612. In 1622 Hall leased the site to George Parker, a carpenter who built the current house. The Hall estate was later acquired by the 2nd Duke of Kingston, who sold the house to William Robinson in 1743. There may have been baking on a small scale during the 1700s but it only became the main commercial use of the building around the turn of the century. The building was acquired in the 1930s by Marie Byng-Johnson who opened it as a tea-room specialising in Sally Lunn buns, promoted with a story that she had discovered an ancient document in a secret panel above the fireplace explaining that Mlle. Sally Lunn was a young French Huguenot refugee who brought the recipe to Bath around 1680. The property has been a Grade II* listed building since June 1950. The summary states that \\"Sally Lunn, a pastry cook and baker, was tenant in 1680\\" but cites no source to confirm that information. ==In popular culture== Sally Lunns are mentioned alongside muffins and crumpets by Charles Dickens in his novel The Chimes, first published in 1844 and frequently reprinted. \\"Sally- lunn\\" is also mentioned in the Anthony Trollope short story \\"The Lady of Launay.\\" The Sally Lunn was later mentioned in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Sorcerer: :CHORUS: :Now to the banquet we press; now for the eggs and the ham; :Now for the mustard and cress, and now for the strawberry jam! :Now for the tea of our host, now for the rollicking bun, :Now for the muffin and toast, and now for the gay Sally Lunn! :WOMEN: The eggs and the ham, and the strawberry jam! :MEN: The rollicking bun, and the gay Sally Lunn!

There are currently 2,500-3,500 Armenians in Italy mainly residing in Milan, Rome and Venice; another main centre of Armenian culture and history is Padua.Armenians in Italy: a centuries-long presence Besides the general population, there are monastic communities on the island of San Lazzaro degli Armeni (Venice) as well as Armenian clergy at the Holy See (Vatican). ==History== Armenians in Italy have had a presence since ancient Roman times. Teacher and rhetorician Prohaeresius was sent by the Emperor to Rome, where he became an object of popular veneration, culminating in the erection of his statue, which bore the inscription Regina rerum Roma, Regi Eloquentiae i.e. \\"(from) Rome, the queen of cities, to the king of eloquence\\".Armenians in Italy Justinian's Armenian general Narses successfully attacked resistance to Roman rule wherever it was located and remained a celebrated governor of Venice. Later, in the 9th-10th centuries, a great number of Armenians moved to Italy from Thrace and Macedonia. They were the descendants of Paulicians chased from Armenia by emperor Constantin. An Armenian Byzantine princess, Maria Argyra, became Dogaressa of Venice in 1003. Palazzo Surian Bellotto in Venice As to Armenian communities, they were formed in Italy in the 12th-13th centuries, when active trade was going on between Cilician Armenia and Italian big city-republics as Genoa, Venice and Pisa. Under Cilician Armenian king Levon II (1187‚Äì1219) (also known as King Leo II of Armenia), treaties were signed between the two parties, according to which Italian merchants had the right to open factories and to develop industrial activities in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia and Armenian merchants could do the same in Italian towns. These treaties were periodically renewed, as long as the Cilician Armenian Kingdom existed. In the 13th century the number of Armenians in Italy increased because of the new wave of emigrants after the invasion of Tatars and Mongols. Leonardo da Vinci made drawings of Armenians living in Italy.The Hidden Language of Symbols in Oriental Rugs ‚Äì Page 23, by Harry M. Raphaelian ‚Äì 1953 Surians were a Venetian patrician family of Armenian origin and members of the Great Council of Venice. Antonio Surian was the Patriarch of Venice from 1504 to 1508.A Companion to Venetian History, 1400-1797, BRILL, 2013 - p. 960 Michel Surian was instrumental in assisting Pope Pius V with creating the Holy League, which gathered its fleets to defeat the Turkish armada in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. Another Antonio Surian, who was widely known as \\"The Armenian\\", was the Serene Republic's ambassador to England. The Palazzo Surian Bellotto was built on the Cannaregio Canal by Surians in the 17th century. They were also famous for reorganising Venetian Arsenal.The Armenians in Venice The Armenian Church of Livorno The Seriman family from Isfahan had gained importance in Venice during the 17th century and owned the Palazzo Contarini-Sceriman.Liceo Scientifico Statale Giovanni Battista Benedetti , entry on Armenian Sceriman family. Art historians like Josef Strzygowski write about Armenian impact on Italian architecture. For example, he writes: \\"Brunelleschi may be said to have completed the Gothic cathedral of Florence in the Armenian style. Looking at the East end from without, one might take it for the work of an Armenian architect\\".Strzygowski, Josef. Origin of Christian Church Art, New Facts and Principles of Research. 1923. Reprint. London: Forgotten Books, 2013. Beginning with the 15th-16th centuries the process of catholicizing Armenians was strengthened in Italy which greatly contributed to their assimilation with Italian people. Nevertheless, some Armenian organizations continued to function with the aim to preserve national identity. According to Italian historical sources, it was more common to hear the Armenian language on the cosmopolitan lanes and canals of the Veneto than to hear English or German.Persona Non Grata: End of the Great Game ‚Äì Page 18, by Avery Mann ‚Äì 2015, p. 17 As a result, the first Armenian books were printed in Venice. Besides, in the beginning of the 18th century the Armenian Congregation of the Mechitarists (, also spelled Mekhitarists), was founded in Venice, on the St. Lazzaro Island (San Lazzaro degli Armeni). It exists up till now with its monastery, library, manuscripts depository and publishing house, and is considered as a centre of Armenian culture in Italy. Villa degli Armeni in Treviso There was also the reputable Moorat-Raphael College in Venice for general education with student body from Armenians from many countries, which was founded in 1836 and functioned until 1997, and the Collegio Armeno (The Pontifical Armenian College) in Rome for preparation of clergy in the Armenian Catholic Church. In 1895 the whole complex of Villa Contarini degli Armeni in Asolo became the ownership of the Mechitarists of Venice. Two streets in Venice are bearing Armenian names, Ruga Giuffa (Julfa Street), and Sotoportego dei Armeni. In Livorno, also there are streets with Armenian names. The Church of St Bartholomew of The Armenians built in 1308 in Genoa, Italy is known for the Holy Face of Genoa kept in the church. In 1924 a village for Armenian exiles, Nor Arax, was founded in the countryside of Bari. In 1968 a Department of Armenian Studies was opened at the Polytechnic University of Milan. In June 1976 the Centre for the Study and Conservation of Armenian Culture (CSDCA) was established by Prof. Adriano Alpago Novello in Milan.The great heritage of Armenian culture, OASIS Center Since 1986 the Padus-Araxes Cultural Association organizes annual summer intensive courses of Armenian language and culture at Ca' Foscari University of Venice.Padus-Araxes, About Us ===San Lazzaro Island=== 19th century postcard of San Lazzaro degli Armeni San Lazzaro (Saint Lazarus) near Venice, Italy, headquarters of the Mechitarists The Monastic headquarters of the Mekhitarist Order is on the island of St. Lazarus in Venice (San Lazzaro Monastero Armeno in Italian). It is located on San Lazzaro degli Armeni, (, ), a small island in the Venetian Lagoon, lying immediately west of the Lido; completely occupied by an Armenian Catholic monastery that is the mother-house of the Mekhitarist Order. It is considered as one of the world's foremost centers of Armenian culture. The beginnings of the island's Armenian history started when Mekhitar da Pietro and his seventeen monks built a monastery, restored the old church, and enlarged the island to its present 30,000 square metres, about four times its original area. Its founder's temperament and natural gifts for scholarly pursuits immediately set the Mekhitarist Order in the forefront of Oriental studies: the monastery published Armenian historical, philological and literary works and related material, renowned for their scholarship and accuracy as well as for the beauty of the editions, on its own multilingual presses. The island also houses a 150,000-volume library, as well as a museum with over 4,000 Armenian manuscripts and many Arab, Indian and Egyptian artifacts collected by the monks or received as gifts. The Mekhitarist Order also publishes the longest-running Armenian periodical, the academic \\"Pazmaveb\\". ===Collegio Armeno in Rome=== Gregory XIII in 1584 had decreed the erection of a college for the Armenians (Bull \\"Romana Ecclesia\\"), but the plan fell through. When the Collegio Urbano of the Propaganda was founded later, there were always some places for Armenian students to study. Finally, in 1885, thanks to the generosity of some wealthy Armenians and of Leo XIII, the Collegio Armeno (The Pontifical Armenian College) was granted the Church of S. Nicola da Tolentino in the street of that name and the original wishes and decree of Gregory XIII realized after so many years. The president of Collegio Armeno is an Armenian prelate; the students numbering from 20 to 25 study and attend lectures at the Collegio Urbano of the Propaganda, and wear red sashes and large-sleeved Oriental cloaks. ===Moorat Raphael College in Venice=== Moorat Raphael College Two wealthy Armenians from India, namely Mkertich Murat and Edward Raphael made donations to establish an Armenian college in Venice that was named Murat-Raphael College (Collegio Armeno Moorat Raphael) in honour of the donors. The property housing the college was the Palazzo Zenobio, built in a Baroque style in 1690, and a subtle example of Venetian art and life in the 17th century, as testified tp by the beautiful Sala degli Specchi and Sala degli Stucchi. The college also maintained a high academic level of education, a reputable teaching staff, both clergy and laity, and the college had beautiful gardens. Moorat Raphael College has been closed recently, and the location serves as a motel, but occasionally art exhibitions, summer schools and workshops are organized to keep the special artistic atmosphere of the college. ===Cardinal Agagianian and the Vatican=== The Armenian Cardinal Gregorio Pietro Agagianian (Krikor Bedros Aghajanian ) (September 18, 1895 -May 16, 1971) was a leading prelate of the Armenian Catholic Church. He served as Patriarch Catholicos of Cilicia for Armenian Catholics from 1937 to 1962, and Prefect of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples) in the Roman Curia from 1958 to 1970. Agagianian was elevated to the cardinalate in 1946 by Pope Pius XII. Cardinal Agagianian was born in Akhaltsikhe (in modern Georgia), he studied at the seminary in Tbilisi and the Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome. He was ordained as a priest on December 23, 1917. He entered the teaching Faculty of the Pontifical Armenian College in Rome in 1921; he became later the Rector of the same college from 1932 to 1937. Appointed Titular Bishop of Comana on July 11, 1935, he was elected Patriarch Catholicos of Cilicia of All Armenians by the Armenian Catholic Synod, on November 30, 1937, with the name of Gregory Peter XV. On February 18, 1946, he was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope Pius XII. During the 1958 papal conclave, following the death of Pius XII, Agagianian received a large number of votes, eventually approaching the majority needed for election. This was confirmed by the elected pope himself, Pope John XXIII. The newly elected pope John XXIII appointed Cardinal Agagianian to be a member of the leading body of the Second Vatican Council together with Cardinals Leo Joseph Suenens, Julius D√∂pfner and Giacomo Lercaro. Aghajanian was Pro-Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith from 1958 and full Prefect from July 18, 1960, to October 19, 1970. He died in Rome on May 16, 1971. ==Famous Italians of Armenian Origin== According to Kostan Zarian, the Armenians built 34 churches and monasteries in Italy, and eleven Saints of Italy had Armenian origin.Leonardo da Vinci and Armenia // Havatamk monthly, Saint Petersburg, #9, 2015, p. 11, by Kostan Zarian Armenian prince Saint Minias (3rd century) is venerated as the first Christian martyr of Florence. The church of San Miniato al Monte is dedicated to him. Cristoforo Armeno was the author of The Three Princes of Serendip, published in 1557. Among the most famous Armenian names in Italy in earlier centuries was Gjuro Baglivi (Giorgio Baglivi), whom the Enciclopedia Italiana (known as Treccani) holds to be \\"one of the most eminent men in the history of medicine\\". Baglivi was the name of a doctor of Lecce who adopted him as an orphan of a Julfa family.The Armenians, by Adriano Alpago Novello - 1986, p. 67 Other famous Italians of Armenian origin are the Venetian engineer Anton Surian, the Venetian abbot and author Zaccaria Seriman, the poet Vittoria Aganoor and the chemist Giacomo Luigi Ciamician. Domenico Serpos was a ballet dancer, librettist and choreographer of the early 19th century.Armenians on the International Dance Scene, by Artsvi Bakhchinyan, 2016, p. 18 In spite of their small numbers, the Armenians in Italy have achieved notable successes in the country's cultural life. For example, often mentioned are the book and film critic Glauco Viazzi (Jusik Achrafian, 1921‚Äì1981), the art critic Eduardo Arslan (Yetwart, 1899‚Äì1968), the poet and writer Gostan Zarian, the musician Angelo Ephrikian (1913‚Äì1982), the Arslan family of ear, nose, and throat specialists in Padua and Genoa, and Alessandro Megighian (1928‚Äì1981), former president of the European Academy of Gnathology. The first three were commemorated in a praiseworthy initiative from 1982 to 1984 in Venice, under the general title \\"Armenians in Italian culture.\\" Italian-Armenian poet and playwright Tovmas Terzian is the author of Arshak II opera libretto. Giorgio Nurigiani was a writer, linguist, and historian. Hrand Nazariantz was a poet and translator whose candidacy was proposed for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953. Gregorio Sciltian was a painter. L√©on Gurekian was an architect, writer and political activist. His son Ohann√©s Gurekian was an architect, engineer, and alpinist. A prominent living writer and academic is Antonia Arslan from Padua. Laura Ephrikian is an actress. Among the well known Italians with Armenian ancestry are the showman Paolo Kessisoglu (1969), whose grandfather, born Keshishian, moved from Anatolia to Genoa at the beginning of 20th century fearing aggressions in Turkey (though having already changed his surname to a more Turkish version); Gevorg Petrosyan, a kickboxer and Muay Thai fighter living in Italy and fighting out of the Satori Gladiatorium in Gorizia; and the Italian fashion designer Giorgio Armani.http://news.1tv.am/en/2017/07/24/Forbes-Women-Giorgio- Armani-is-Armenian/66047 Writer Arthur Alexanian was awarded by the XI European authors competition's first prize for his Il bambino e i venti d'Armenia book.–ê—Ä—Ç—É—Ä –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω—è–Ω: ¬´–ê—Ä–º—è–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –±—ã—Ç—å –∏ —à—ë–ª–∫–æ–≤–æ–π –Ω–∏—Ç—å—é, –∏ —Ü–µ–ø—å—é¬ª ==Community== In 2000, the issue of Recognition of the Armenian Genocide was floored as a bill in the Italian Parliament that went on to recognize the Armenian Genocide.

Its primary purpose was to initiate an international effort among global trading nations to overhaul the structure and mechanisms of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) while preserving the considerable progress and success achieved by that system since its inception in 1948. Disagreements, largely between developed and developing economies, emerged over four issues initiated by this conference; afterward, these were collectively referred to as the \\"Singapore issues\\". ===Second ministerial conference=== Was held in Geneva in Switzerland. ===Third ministerial conference=== The third conference in Seattle, United States ended in failure, with massive demonstrations and police and National Guard crowd control efforts drawing worldwide attention. ===Fourth ministerial conference=== The fourth conference was held in Doha In Persian Gulf nation of Qatar. The Doha Development Round was launched at the conference. The conference also approved the joining of China, which became the 143rd member to join. ===Fifth ministerial conference=== The ministerial conference was held in Canc√∫n, Mexico, aiming at forging agreement on the Doha round. An alliance of 22 southern states, the G20 (led by India, ChinaFive Years of China WTO Membership.

The talks broke down without progress. ===Sixth ministerial conference=== The sixth WTO Conference Ministerial was held in Hong Kong from 13 December - 18 December 2005. It was considered vital if the four-year-old Doha Development Agenda negotiations were to move forward sufficiently to conclude the round in 2006. In this meeting, countries agreed to phase out all their agricultural export subsidies by the end of 2013, and terminate any cotton export subsidies by the end of 2006. Further concessions to developing countries included an agreement to introduce duty-free, tariff-free access for goods from the Least Developed Countries, following the Everything But Arms initiative of the European Union -- but with up to 3% of tariff lines exempted.

He played for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Washington Senators, Cincinnati Reds, New York Yankees and Chicago Cubs. Born in Kansas City, Missouri, Bright stood tall, weighed , and threw and batted right-handed. ==Versatile journeyman== During his minor league playing career, Bright was known for his versatility in the field, his batting ability, and (during the era before free agency in baseball) his frequent changes of address. He played every infield position, caught and played the outfield. In a 12-year stretch, 1947 through 1958, he played for 14 different minor league teams and at least four different MLB organizations. At the plate, he led the Class C West Texas‚ÄìNew Mexico League in batting average in 1950 with a .413 mark. Two years later, as the 22-year-old playing manager of the Janesville Cubs of the Class D Wisconsin State League, Bright led the league in runs batted in with 101 ‚Äî although Janesville finished seventh in the eight-team WSL. Bright's best minor league season came when he was a 30-year-old veteran playing for the 1960 Salt Lake City Bees in the Pacific Coast League. He slugged 27 home runs, led the PCL with 119 RBI and batted .313. Bright was a fixture in the Pacific Coast League of the 1950s, having played three and a half seasons for the Sacramento Solons (1955‚Äì58). He became a resident of Sacramento, California, and later managed the Solons in 1975. ==Major League career== Bright's first major league trials came with the Pittsburgh Pirates, where he played in parts of the 1958 and 1960 seasons, and spent all of 1959 on the Pirates roster, appearing in 40 games in a utility role. On December 16, 1960, he was traded to the American League's new expansion franchise, the Washington Senators, where he played two full seasons and enjoyed his most sustained success. In 1962, he appeared in 113 games, mostly at first base, swatted 17 homers, knocked in 67 RBI and batted .273. But at season's end, the Senators swapped the 33-year-old Bright to the Cincinnati Reds for a young first baseman, Rogelio √Ålvarez. Bright batted only once for the 1963 Reds before his contract was sold on April 21 to the defending world champion New York Yankees, who were seeking a right-handed hitter off their bench. He stuck with the club all season long, batting .236 with seven homers in 157 at-bats as the Yanks copped another AL pennant. ==1963 World Series== Then, in Game 1 of the 1963 World Series, Bright made history when he was sent up as a ninth- inning pinch hitter against Sandy Koufax of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Bright struck out, enabling Koufax to set a new mark (broken five years later by Bob Gibson) for strikeouts (15) in a World Series game. Said Bright: \\"It's a hell of a thing. I wait 17 years to get into a World Series. Then I finally get up there, and 69,000 people are yelling ‚Äî yelling for me to strike out.\\" \\"K is for Koufax\\", Time Magazine, October 11, 1963 To compound matters, the game was played in Bright's home ballpark, Yankee Stadium. Bright struck out again in his only other World Series at bat and by mid-May 1964 he had returned to the minors with the Triple-A Richmond Virginians. His MLB career ended in 1965, as a pinch hitter for the Chicago Cubs. All told, Bright appeared in 309 MLB games over all or parts of eight seasons, batting .255 with 214 hits, 31 doubles, four triples, 32 homers and 126 RBI. ==Post-playing career== In 1967, Bright \\"resumed\\" his minor league managerial career in the Cubs' farm system after a 15-year hiatus, taking over the reins of the Quincy Cubs of the Class A Midwest League, a decade and a half after his stint as playing skipper of the Cubbies' Janesville affiliate. He later managed in the Kansas City Royals, Oakland Athletics, Milwaukee Brewers and Atlanta Braves organizations, and scouted for the Montreal Expos. He died in Sacramento at the age of 70. ==References== * Spink, C.C. Johnson, ed., The 1965 Official Baseball Register.

The Manor covers the area from the western-side of Borough High Street, Southwark, to the borders of Newington and Lambeth. The manor originally lay in Surrey.Southwark and the City pp10-25, David Johnson OUP 1968Medieval Southwark pp 18-22 Martha Carlin, Hambledon Press 1999 The City of London acquired the ‚Äòborough of Southwark‚Äô from the Crown in 1327, nicknamed the 'Guildable Manor' since 1377. In 1550 the City purchased from Edward VI's government the manors to the south of this on the west and the east of the high street. The City's royal charter of 1550 makes difficult reading because the three manors being described are referred to as 'The Town and Borough of Southwark' (Guildable), 'Our Lordship and Manor of Southwark' (King's) and 'Our Manor and Borough of Southwark' (Great Liberty), all three together are termed ‚ÄòThe Borough and Town of Southwark and all of its parishes and precincts aforesaid‚Äô (all text in Latin).Reproduced and translated as Appendix in Johnson ibidText reproduced with Referenced Commentary in Guildable Manor Annual Court Leet Report: 2005 by Tony Sharp Today the City officers refer to the three manors as the 'Town and Borough of Southwark', as stated on the Courts Leet summons, on which none of the nicknames appear.Summons to Southwark Courts Leet issued from Central Criminal Court at Old Bailey == Earliest beginnings: The 'Abbot of Bermondsey's manor of Southwark' == At the time of Domesday Book in 1086 the Southwark and Bermondsey areas were owned by the king and by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the latter‚Äôs holding was the manor along the eastern side of the high street. The king owned the northern bridge-head or borough area and the land on the western side of the highway, over to Lambeth and also the areas of Bermondsey and Rotherhithe to the east of the Canterbury manor.sa 'Southwark' in Domesday Before Henry VIII acquired the manor in 1536 it belonged to Bermondsey Abbey.Carlin ibid A fascinating early plan-map, discovered in the Duchy of Lancaster archive, shows Southwark at some point between the Dissolution and the 1550 charter. Perhaps it was prepared with reference to the jurisdictional disputes with the king‚Äôs agents, the City and its manor of the Guildable, as the boundary points are shown on it. A date of 1543 has been assigned to this. On this plan the City‚Äôs manor at the northern end of the high street is called ‚Äòthe lyberte off the mayre. The later nicknames 'King's manor', and occasionally the 'Queen's manor', for the western Bermondsey Abbey manor, are used only after the crown had sold it to the City; the nickname probably derives from the prominent royal mansion/ mint there; Henry VIII only held it from 1536. This western manor area is delineated, ambiguously, as the liberte off the manor. In fact the plan refers to the eastern manor acquired from Canterbury, the so called ‚ÄòGreat Liberty‚Äô, as the kynges lyberte. In John Silvester's (Recorder~High Steward in 1807) notes and procedures of the Southwark manors he also uses the abbreviations of the borough for the Guildable, the manor for the King's and the liberty for the Great Liberty.'Plan of Southwark ca 1543; Duchy of Lancaster The first post Domesday fracture of this extensive royal estate is a result of the creation by one Aylwin ‚ÄòCild‚Äô of a priory at Bermondsey in 1082, but he also assigned rents from properties in the City to a Cluniac house in France, presumably for the purpose of supporting this church. Members of the Order arrived in Bermondsey in 1089 to formalise the relation. The priory was dedicated to ‚ÄòSt Saviour‚Äô. We know little of this benefactor save that he was a London merchant but seems to have been (by name and title) an Englishman rather than a Norman.Annales Bermundsei It has been suggested that the mercantile dynasty of the early mediaeval period called ‚ÄòAilwyn‚Äô were his descendants and that Henry Fitz- Ailwyn, the first known Mayor of London (ca 1189) was one of these; we know that his daughter in law was interred in the Priory church.Survey of London \\"Bermondsey\\" John Stow 1590 The Priory‚Äôs, (from 1399 an Abbey) main site can be identified today by Abbey Street and Bermondsey Square. In Domesday 'Bermondsey' is described as ‚Äòheld‚Äô by King William I but before him by 'Earl' Harold i.e. Harold Godwinson. According to the Annals of the Abbey, King William Rufus gave the manor of Bermondsey (along with Rotherhithe) to the Priory in 1092.Domesday ibid The priory became exceptionally well endowed and eventually as an abbey had lands all over the country. However, one of its earliest forays was into local real estate but it was constrained by the neighbouring manors, including Walworth to the south, held by Canterbury. Nevertheless, it approached Henry I in 1103/04 to acquire what was held directly by the crown there. This was all of the territory on the western side of the high street, designated by this writer the ‚ÄòRoyal Manor‚Äô for convenience; it was described as ‚Äòthe hide of Southwark‚Äô, i.e. of one hide, as a part of the king‚Äôs demesne.Annales Bermundsei This transaction did not include the far north-western part of the area. This, presumably, had already been granted by the crown to another party. It was later described as 'Wideflete' or 'the Wyldes', this was very poor quality low-lying flood-plain as its original name indicates. The priory had this granted to them, shortly afterwards, by Robert Marmion in 1113. He was the hereditary King's Champion and certainly a direct tenant of the Norman kings. It was described as of \\"one hide, seventy acres and a mill\\". It was later to be called 'Paris(h) Garden' and is best identified today as the northern part of Blackfriars Road. Therefore, by 1113, Bermondsey Priory had control of most of the Southwark area, all of that which had previously constituted the 'Royal Manor', except the borough. There is an anomaly to this territory: The Canterbury holding on the eastern side of the high street has a small part detached from it. This, at least in part, derives from what was the small de Ardern family property which occupied the corner of the junction of the high street, Long Lane and 'old' Kent street (Tabard Street), presumably this had been acquired from Canterbury after 1086. It may have been a hamlet that had congealed at what is the junction of the Roman roads now known as Stane Street and Watling Street. This too was given to Bermondsey priory in 1122, by the Ardern‚Äôs along with St George‚Äôs church which is in that precinct. It clearly is in the ‚Äòwrong‚Äô manor as the high street is the natural border. However, at the period under scrutiny it was just a small part of the extensive combined area held by the Priory occupying the western side of the high street, which as shown above was already owned by it. This area is coincident with St George's ancient parish. Obviously, this largely open area was assigned to that church as an administrative convenience. The Rectors were appointed by the Priory/Abbey until the transfer to Henry VIII in 1536. The main open ground, sparsely populated, of the manor was assigned to this church as its outlying parish and hence it acquired the alternative epithet of 'St George's Fields'. To use the post-Reformation titles of these areas we can see that by 1122 Bermondsey Abbey owned all of the so-called 'King's', 'Clink' and 'Paris Garden' manors, as well as Bermondsey and Rotherhithe. Canterbury owned Walworth as well as the 'Great Liberty'. The crown controlled only the western side of the 'borough' or 'Guildable' manor, the eastern part being controlled by the de Warrennes successors to the Godwins' sub manor. From this large combined area Bermondsey Priory divided a part which was let-out to one Ordgar the Rich; just when is not clear. However, it was from Ordgar (with the consent of Bermondsey Priory) that the Bishop of Winchester acquired it, no earlier than 1144/49, this was for the creation of a palace near London to enable the Bishop to carry out his political duties. The part acquired by Winchester was the nucleus of the manor later known as 'The Clink'. The parts remaining to Bermondsey Priory were 'Wideflete' and the remnant of the 'Royal Manor' (i.e. less the 'Clink') along with the Ardern property. The 'Wideflete'/ Paris Garden was demised to the Templars (on the opposite side of the river to their 'New Temple') in 1166. The manorial area that was left was informally referred to as 'le weste socne' (i.e. the 'soke' west of the 'high' street) in the thirteenth century and as the 'Abbot's manor' later. From some point in the fifteenth century the Brandon family became the King‚Äôs Marshals; as such they controlled the two ancient royal prisons on the eastern side of the high street, the King's Bench and the Marshalsea. As they became more prominent at court they grew wealthier and acquired parts of the western side of the high street from the Abbey to create a large mansion and grounds including, notably, Moulton Close which is now the park around the Imperial War Museum. The house became known as Brandon Place. Charles Brandon, the last of the male line, became Marshal in 1510 and was created Duke of Suffolk in 1514; he married Henry VIII's sister in 1516. The mansion then becomes known as Suffolk Place. Henry took an interest in Suffolk Place and acquired it from Charles in 1536. Shortly after, in June 1536, the St Saviour's Abbey of Bermondsey was induced to 'grant' its land to the king, part of the Dissolution process, hence he now owned all of the Abbey‚Äôs manor west of the high street. However, Henry gave this building to Queen Jane Seymour in 1537, mother of Edward VI, who died of post-natal complications shortly after his birth. In 1538 Henry acquired from Thomas Cranmer the Archbishop of Canterbury's manor on the eastern side of the high street; it seems it was his intention to create a new hunting park out of the two areas and the Brandon mansion was to act as its lodge. The mansion is shown on the 'Lancaster Plan' of 1543 and there called De manor place. In any case Henry seems to have lost interest in the project before his death in 1547. From 1545 until 1551 it was the Mint, supplementing the main mint at the Tower of London. This part of the borough is still called 'the Mint'. These manors belonged to the king for only fourteen and twelve years respectively, as in 1550 the City acquired both of the properties. The building then reverted to being a royal mansion; in 1554 Queen Mary I stayed overnight with her new husband King Philip II of Spain as part of their progress to London. In 1556 she granted it to the Archbishop of York for his London house, but it was soon leased out in parts for income. Unfortunately, although the park behind it and various buildings at its lodge or gatehouse were transferred to the City the mansion and garden were retained by the king; this curtillage might be what is delineated by the semi-circular line around the building in the 'Lancaster Plan'. These had been specifically excluded from the City‚Äôs jurisdiction by clauses in the charter. This allowed it to become a haunt and refuge for undesirable persons and activities (see Alsatia). So notorious a place did it become that it was included in an Act of 1697 to allow the Sheriff a power of 'posse comitatus' (a writ to raise an armed group) and enter into it to evict its inhabitants. However, it reverted to its bad ways and another, specific, Act of 1723 was required to clear it out for good. The City's jurisdiction was now complete. == Annual Court Day == \\"The Court Leet and View of Frankpledge with the Court Baron of the Lord Mayor and Commonalty of the City of London\\" is now summoned for each of the three City manors once a year, usually on the second Wednesday in November, i.e. following the Presentation of the Lord Mayor (see Lord Mayor's Show). == References == Category:History of the London Borough of Southwark Category:History of the City of London ","title":"King's Manor, Southwark"},{"id":"19318003","text":"Rabbi Ya'akov Moshe Toledano (, 18 August 1880 ‚Äì 15 October 1960) was an Israeli rabbi who served as Minister of Religions for two brief periods between 1958 and 1960. He also served as chief rabbi of Cairo, Alexandria and Tel Aviv. ==Biography== Toledano was born on 18 August 1880 in Tiberias, then in the Ottoman Empire. He was the son of Rabbi Yehuda Toledano and grew up to become known as a public figure in Tiberias. He was a member of the city council and the head of the Mizrachi party in the city. For four years, Toledano lived among the Jewish minority in the Galilee, where he was among the founders of a Hebrew school in Peki'in. During World War I Toledano received French citizenship after being expelled by the Ottoman authorities and lived in Corsica with 800 other members of the Galilee's Jewish community. He served as rabbi for the local Jewish community on the island, and dedicated himself to improving Jewish life there. In 1920 the French government allowed Toledano to return to Tiberias, where he purchased land from the local Arabs around the Tomb of Maimonides and the Tomb of Rabbi Akiva, building a wall around the Tomb of Maimonides and financing the establishments of several new neighborhoods. Between 1926 and 1928 Toledano was a member of the Chief Rabbinate in Tangier, and was a member of the Beit Din for the Jewish community of the city. By 1941 he had been appointed as the head of the Beit Din and the deputy Chief Rabbi of Cairo, the head of the Beit Din in Alexandria and the member of the Beit Din of Egypt, roles in which he served in until his election as the Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv in 1942. He held this position until 1958, and along with the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi, Isser Yehuda Unterman, helped found the Special Court of Agunot. He left this job to become Minister of Religious Affairs in the eighth government on 3 December 1958, despite not being a member of the Knesset. He held the post until 30 November the following year. When David Ben-Gurion formed the ninth government on 17 December 1959, Toledano returned to his ministerial role, serving until his death from cardiac arrest in October 1960. In July 1960, only a month before he died, he married Mary Sebag, a 20-year-old from moshav Tirosh. This marriage caused Toledano to receive criticism from much of the Israeli media, from which Toledano defended himself by saying that the marriage was legitimate because he had complied with the Jewish law that stated a man must wait for two holidays after the death of the first wife. Toledano also stated \\"I'm a man of eastern tradition, and did not base my marriage on European Jewish tastes, but according to Jewish law.\\" Toledano has a street named after him in the Bavli neighborhood of Tel Aviv, along with the Prize for Jewish literature established by the Tel Aviv Religious Council. ===Famous works and teachings=== Toledano collected and studied many ancient manuscripts of the Jews of Spain and North Africa. One of the most famous manuscripts that he discovered was the commentary of the Rambam on the Mishnah in Arabic, as it had been originally written, which Toledano discovered along with his brother Baruch Toledano in Damascus. When he was living in Israel, Toledano collaborated with archaeologist Nahum Slouschz to help discover the hot springs in Tiberias built by the Romans. In 1950, Toledano was sent by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem to Morocco where he discovered several more ancient manuscripts. Toledano was sympathetic to Zionism and wrote several commentaries pertaining to his opinion of the Three Oaths, in which he stated that Zionism does not contradict the Three Oaths. He supported the concept of Hebrew labor and stated that it was preferable for Jews to hire other Jews, including secular Jews in his ideas. Toledano also wrote a ruling in which it was forbidden for Jews to sell weapons to non-Jews in the state of Israel. He supported the creation of a high court in Jerusalem, and under appropriate conditions supported the revival of the Sanhedrin. Rabbi Toledano wrote several religious commentaries, winning the Rav Kook Prize in 1957 in the Special Award Category for his work. ==External links== * * Category:1880 births Category:1960 deaths Category:Sephardic Haredi rabbis in Israel Category:Chief rabbis of Tel Aviv Category:Sephardi Jews Category:People from Tiberias ","title":"Ya'akov Moshe Toledano"},{"id":"19318016","text":"\\"Baby, Baby I Need You\\" is a 1963 song recorded by The Temptations for the Gordy (Motown) label. It was written by Smokey Robinson, and was later used as the B-side to their Top 40 1964 hit \\"Girl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue)\\".Williams, Otis and Romanowski, Patricia (1988, updated 2002). Temptations. Lanham, MD: Cooper Square. . The song is about one's devotion to the one they love; it's narrator telling the girl he's falling for that if she let their ‚Äúhearts combine‚Äù that he vows to always let her know how much he needs, wants, and loves her. A fusion of Gospel and Doo-Wop, the song is mostly an ensemble piece, with all the original members singing most of the song's lead vocal in unison (with Eddie Kendricks' higher falsetto voice making him the primary vocal in song). It is on the song‚Äôs bridge and outro where Kendricks and Paul Williams each sing a few lead lines out front while Elbridge \\"Al\\" Bryant sings harmony vocals behind Kendricks and Williams (and throughout the song's bridge). All the group members get a chance to also be heard outfront when they sing the last word of each of the song's three verses in a five-part harmony (Bryant, Williams, Kendricks, Otis Williams, and Melvin Franklin respectively). This B-side is the last single released to feature Bryant's vocals (he was fired several months prior), and the last to feature Paul Williams' signing lead that would be released while he was still the group's main lead singer (although he would still record a few more leads). With the release of the single \\"My Girl\\", newest member David Ruffin would become The Tempts' new main lead (more or less replacing both Williams and Kendricks in the role). Although \\"Baby, Baby I Need You\\" did not chart nationally, the song was a regional smash hit in some parts of the country. It was a favorite of fans of the group (and the group itself) and became a part of the Temptations' onstage repertoire. The song was performed by the \\"classic five\\" members on the group's first live album, Temptations Live! where it received a standing ovation. In 1966, The Wailers, featuring Bob Marley, covered the song (retitled \\"I Need You\\") which was released as a single and included on the 1966 compilation album, The Wailing Wailers. The Wailers also recorded a different song of the title \\"I Need You\\" in 1964, and so recent releases have retitled this cover as \\"I Need You So\\". ==Personnel== * Lead & background vocals by Eddie Kendricks (verses; bridge), Paul Williams (verses; bridge), Al Bryant (verses; harmony vocals on bridge), Melvin Franklin (verses), and Otis Williams (verses) * Instrumentation by The Funk Brothers ==Notes== Category:1963 songs Category:1964 singles Category:The Temptations songs Category:Songs written by Smokey Robinson Category:Gordy Records singles ","title":"Baby, Baby I Need You"},{"id":"19318037","text":"The 1995 Valencia Open was an Association of Tennis Professionals tennis tournament held in Valencia, Spain and played on outdoor clay courts.

Herbert was granted the style and precedence of the younger son of an earl by Royal Warrant on 30 May. Herbert was brought up at the family house at Wilton House, in Wiltshire.Sir Tresham Lever, The Herberts of Wilton (Murray, 1967) ==Career== He joined the Diplomatic Service, and was posted to Paris, aged 21, on 1 June 1879, where he was appointed Third Secretary in March 1880, and Second Secretary in November 1883. Herbert was trained in the diplomatic service by Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons, then British Ambassador to France, and was a member of the Tory-sympathetic 'Lyons School' of British diplomacy. He was transferred to Washington DC on 31 August 1888, where he served as Secretary and twice acted as Charg√© d'affaires. In September 1893 he transferred to The Hague, and in August the following year was promoted to Secretary of Embassy at Constantinople. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1896. Following a brief posting to Rome in 1897, he was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary in Paris in 1898. ===British ambassador to the United States=== Herbert ended his career as the second British Ambassador to the United States, in succession to Lord Pauncefote, who had died in office in May 1902.

He was sworn a member of the Privy Council at Buckingham Palace on 11 August 1902, before leaving Liverpool for Washington in late September. As ambassador, he created with the U.S. Secretary of State John Hay a joint commission to establish the border between the U.S. district of Alaska and British interests in the Dominion of Canada, where gold had been found in the 1890s, which resulted in the definitive Alaskan boundary treaty of 1903.

The show featured some continuity from the LBC days, with callers from the previous station contributing similar output on the new show, for instance Barry from Watford. == Regular features == The Sunday Night Show had several regular features including \\"Answerphone Messages\\", where best bits of messages left during the week on the answerphone were playedhttp://www.absoluteradio.co.uk/djs_shows/shows/sunday_night_show/show_hatred.html and \\"Triple M\\", the part of the show (broadcast at approximately 12.30 am) when calls went straight to air with no screening. However, as this may lead to inappropriate utterances from callers, the show was broadcast with a seven- second delay. \\"Win Win or Lose\\" was a former feature where Lee gives away items he has received that week. Occasionally, he has given away other items as prizes, e.g. unwanted presents from relatives. The feature was not strictly speaking a competition but a game of chance ‚Äì the only criterion needed to win was to be on hold on the right line(s) when the feature was played. The format has recently been changed to allow more than one person to play, however there is still no element of competition ‚Äì if two callers partake, then the \\"winners\\" split the items equally, and may have been given the chance to swap prizes on air. The \\"Col-Lee-Seum\\" (conceived by XTC guitarist Andy Partridge) was a feature when two listeners both argue separate issues. Following this the first five people to call in and vote for one of the contestants meant that contestant wins. Although the game was meant to be serious, due to the contestants and issues chosen, for instance chocolate or vanilla, the feature normally became a rabble. ==References== Category:Virgin Radio (UK) Category:British talk radio programmes ","title":"Sunday Night Show"},{"id":"19318272","text":"Card Sharks is a television game show.

Massif was produced by Santana Motors from 2007 to 2011 and its rebadged and restyled version of the Santana PS-10. In 2010, due to poor sales and Fiat Group's ability to serve the European 4√ó4 market with imported Jeep vehicles, Iveco decided to stop the agreement with Santana. In 2011 the owner of Santana, the Government of Andalusia, decided to close down the company and its car factory and 1,341 people were laid off or retired prematurely. From 6,692 cars made in 2007, the company manufactured 1,197 in 2009 and no more than 769 in 2010. ==Overview== The Massif was produced in Linares (Spain) by Santana Motor Company‚Äôs and was marketed by Iveco (the commercial section of the Fiat motor company) and competed with the Land Rover Defender at the utility end of the 4√ó4 market. The Massif is essentially a revamped and restyled version of the Santana PS-10, which (like the Defender) is itself a derivative of the Land Rover Series which Santana formerly built under licence. The Massif was part of a joint venture between Iveco and Santana; Iveco announced in Madrid in May 2006 that it was essentially taking over the PS-10 product. Iveco already supplied the engine and drive-train to Santana for its PS-10 model so this seemed a logical progression. The Massif was produced alongside the Santana PS-10. ==Specification== The Massif was styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro and the Iveco Style Centre. The Massif bears a clear family resemblance to its sister product the Santana PS-10 which itself was heavily based on the Land Rover Series. Beyond the modernized front clip, the family resemblance to the Land Rover Defender is strong. The Massif was available with two versions of Iveco‚Äôs 3.0 litre diesel engine taken from the Iveco Daily van. A HPI version with of torque and a HPT version with of torque were available. The extra horsepower of the HPT version comes from a variable geometry turbocharger. Both engines met Euro IV emissions standards. The Massif is fitted with a 6-speed ZF 6S400 overdrive manual gearbox with high and low range ratios. No automatic was available. The Massif also has selectable four-wheel drive, like its forebear the Land Rover Series (but unlike the Land Rover Defender which has permanent four-wheel drive). This was intended to reduce fuel consumption, claimed as ‚Äúup to 10%‚Äù by Iveco. The decision to have selectable four-wheel drive is believed to be because Iveco suggested permanent four-wheel drive is unnecessary for the majority of driving conditions. The Massif is usually in four-by-two, rear-wheel drive unless four-wheel drive is engaged. The Massif is also fitted with manual- locking free-wheeling hubs on the front axles which prevent the rotation of front axle components, supposedly to reduce wear. An optional limited slip rear differential was also available to improve off-road ability by reducing the chance of getting cross-axled. The Massif has all round disc brakes with ventilated discs on the front axle and simple discs on the rear axle. The hand brake is also a disc brake, operating on the transmission. The Massif is fitted with parabolic suspension all round, as opposed to the coil springs of its contemporary the Land Rover Defender. The parabolic suspension system is arranged with double bladed springs on the front axle and four bladed springs on the rear axle. The Massif is fitted with hydraulic dampers on the front axle, gas dampers on the rear axle and anti-roll bars at both front and rear to give a compromise of on-road handling and off-road ability. The parabolic suspension system can be regarded as a cost-effective compromise between the simplicity and load carrying ability of leaf springs and the better comfort and axle articulation (and thus off-road ability) of coil springs. The Massif is built as a body-on-frame construction with a ladder chassis, rather than a monocoque construction which is now common with most modern 4√ó4s. The chassis is based on the chassis used for the Iveco Daily van range. This layout is another similarity with Land Rover‚Äôs Defender. The rear door of the Massif was designed to have a full metre-wide opening to allow a standard Euro pallet to be comfortably carried in the rear of the vehicle ‚Äì intended as a unique selling point of the vehicle because of its anticipated market of the utility/commercial sector. The Massif can also be specified with a variety of transmission or transfer box power take-off units and electrical connections on the body work to increase its attraction to commercial users further. The interior of the Massif had been overhauled from the Santana PS-10 version to make it more competitive with the recently updated Land Rover Defender. ==Models== Servizio Civile Nazionale Iveco Massif at Italy's 2007 Army Parade. The Massif was available in long () and short wheelbase () variants. A hard top, station wagon, pick up and chassis cab were available. The long wheelbase station wagon seats up to 7 people. A \\"heavy duty\\" version of the Massif with a 3.5 tonne GVW and towing capacity was also in development for commercial users. The Massif was also aimed at the service sector and the Iveco website showed computer generated models of the Massif with custom bodywork to allow the Massif to be used as emergency service vehicles such as ambulances and fire-fighting vehicles for off-road use; traditionally a sector that the Land Rover Defender with its specially dedicated Land Rover Special Vehicles division has dominated. Launch models had been heavily promoted with advertising showing the All Blacks New Zealand Rugby Union squad as Iveco had signed up as the main sponsor of the team. Launch vehicles were displayed with black body work and the \\"tribal\\" graphics associated with the team. Iveco also announced that a military specification of the Massif would have been available, being fully air-portable similarly to its sister vehicle the Santana PS-10. Although the PS-10 was available in left- and right-hand drive models, the Massif was available only as left-hand drive and only in mainland Europe. Iveco had initially intended the Massif to be launched in the UK in early 2009. ===Campagnola=== Hearkening back to the Fiat Campagnola, Iveco launched a luxurious version of the three-door model sold as the Iveco Campagnola in 2008, with deliveries beginning in 2009. This model received standard ABS brakes, power locks, air conditioning, a body-coloured roof, and a rear wiper, amongst other extras. An original \\"Opening Edition\\" of 499 cars was planned. ==References External links == *https://web.archive.org/web/20080913051821/http://www.massif.iveco.com/?lang=en *http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2008/04/04/109983/video-and-pictures-santana- off-roader-becomes-the-iveco-massif.html *http://www.channel4.com/4car/news/news-story.jsp?news_id=17266 *http://www.commercialmotor.com/latest-news/first-drive-iveco-massif Category:Off-road vehicles Massif Category:Vehicles introduced in 2007 ","title":"Iveco Massif"},{"id":"19318295","text":"Joseph Karakitie Azigbo (1918-1986) was the olorogun of Okpe Kingdom in Nigeria. In the 1950s, he achieved success as an industrialist and became one of the richest men in Nigeria. During the Nigerian Civil War, most of his properties were seized or vandalized by the Nigerian army. He continued his career in business after the army but he was unable to regain the wealth and success he had achieved before the war. ==Early life and career in business== Azigbo was born in Orereokpe on December 29, 1918. He worked with the United African Company UAC in Jos, Plateau state before establishing his mining business (Azigbo Brothers Limited). He soon became very successful in the mining field and became one of the richest men in Nigeria in the 1950s. He was the biggest miner of tin and columbite in the whole of West Africa, owning over 150 mining sites. At the outbreak of the Nigerian Civil War in 1967, he moved part of his business from Jos, Plateau state to Sapele, in the Niger Delta. There he established a palm produce export business. He also built a Sawmill factory on the exclusive Elder Dempster Embankment by the River Ethiope. ==Seizure of property by the Nigerian army== After the war, on his return to Jos, most of Azigbo's properties had either been vandalised or commandeered by the Nigerian army, others had been occupied by locals who laid claims to them. Among these was his private residence in Anglo Jos a part of which was turned into the Nigerian Air force office at the junction of Bukuru road/Miango road. His attempts to regain possession of his properties from the Nigerian government dragged on for decades. This was a huge financial blow from which chief J.K. (as he was referred to) never really recovered. He had spent most of his early adult life working and investing heavily in Jos and he must have assumed that after the war, it would be business as usual. ==Return to Niger Delta== In the face of these setbacks, Azigbo left his eldest son, Raymond, in charge of the mining business and returned to the Niger Delta. Leaving his son, Raymond, in charge, turned out to be one of the worst decisions he ever made. Raymond was a pampered child; his father really loved him and made sure that he had the best in life. He never worked even for a day in his life. He lived a sheltered life and, being put in charge of Azigbo Brothers Limited brought out the worst in him. There is a saying that money brings out the worst in some people; in the case of Raymond, power and money sent him on a destructive course - he started selling off properties and company vehicles. By the time word got to the Azigbo, a lot of financial damage was done. He quickly issued a disclaimer in most of the newspapers in northern Nigeria, including The Nigerian Standard in Jos against Raymond Azigbo. Azigbo now had a new enemy; it was neither the Nigerian government nor the locals in Jos, this was an enemy from within. Azigbo still lived a wealthy life, he had servants and stewards, some of whom migrated with the family from Jos but, he was now a shadow of his former self. He was no longer ranked as one of the richest men in the country. Gone were the days when he would be met by the governor of Plateau State at the airport on his return from trips abroad. ==Death== He died on 11 July 1986 at the age of 68. He was survived by 18 children, amongst whom is Edesiri Azigbo (former Member of the Federal House of Representatives). ==References== * The Nigerian Standard Newspaper, 1963, Jos, Nigeria Category:1918 births Category:1986 deaths Category:20th- century Nigerian businesspeople Category:Nigerian miners ","title":"Joseph Karakitie Azigbo"},{"id":"19318302","text":"Richard Henyard (June 26, 1974 - September 23, 2008) was an American murderer executed in Florida for the double murder of 7-year-old Jamilya Lewis and 3-year-old Jasmine Lewis in January 1993 in Eustis, and the rape of the sisters' mother during the same day. ==Crimes== On the evening of January 30, 1993, Dorothy Lewis and her daughters arrived at a Winn-Dixie supermarket in Eustis. As Lewis, the eventual survivor, and her daughters, the victims, entered the Winn-Dixie, she noticed a few people sitting on a bench near the doors. After Lewis exited the store with Jamilya, age 7, and Jasmine, age 3, she walked to her car and placed her daughters in the front passenger seat. As Lewis crossed the rear of the car to get to the driver's side, she noticed Alfonza Smalls approaching her. As Smalls neared, he revealed a gun tucked into his waistband. Lewis and her daughters were ordered into the back of the car as Smalls and Henyard entered the front. The Lewis car left town with Henyard driving and Smalls issuing directions. Prior to the abduction of Lewis and her daughters, a female witness observed Henyard and Smalls loitering outside of the Winn-Dixie. During the drive, Smalls repeatedly demanded that Lewis keep her crying daughters quiet. Later, Henyard pulled the car over at a remote area and pulled Lewis from the car. Henyard forced Lewis against the trunk and raped her. Henyard then told Lewis to sit on the ground. She hesitated, and Henyard shot her in the leg and forced her to the ground. He then shot her an additional three times at close range, wounding her in the mouth, neck, and on the forehead between the eyes. After she was unconscious, Henyard and Smalls rolled her over to the shoulder of the road. Lewis survived, however, and several hours later regained consciousness and went to a nearby house for help. The occupants contacted the police and Lewis collapsed and waited for the officers to arrive. As Henyard and Smalls drove away from the scene of the shooting, Jamilya and Jasmine Lewis repeatedly asked for their mother. Henyard pulled the car over after a short period of time and removed the girls from the car. Henyard and Smalls took the girls away from the road, out of the clear view of passersby, and killed both Jamilya and Jasmine with a single bullet to the head. Henyard and Smalls then threw their bodies into some brush over a fence. Smalls, Henyard, and a third individual arrived at the home of Bryant Smith in a blue car. Henyard boasted about raping and killing Lewis, unaware that she was still alive. He also showed Smith the gun he used. Later that evening, Henyard went by the Smalls' residence where Colinda Smalls, Alfonza's sister, noticed blood on Henyard's hands. He explained that the blood was from a minor knife accident. On January 31, the next day, Henyard's aunt, Linda Miller, agreed to drive him to Smalls' residence so that Henyard could speak with Smalls. Henyard made a trip to the Eustis Police Department that same Sunday claiming to have information concerning the Lewis case. He offered knowledge of the crime, and claimed that he was present at the scene of the crime. Henyard's initial story pointed to Smalls and another individual as the perpetrators. However, when an officer noticed blood spots on Henyard's socks, he admitted to kidnapping, raping and shooting Lewis, yet maintained that he did not shoot her daughters. The police apprehended Smalls and discovered the murder weapon after a search of his bedroom. The autopsies of the girls confirmed that they were killed by a single gunshot wound at close range and that Jasmine's eyes were open when she was shot. Analysis of the blood spots indicated that Henyard was less than four feet from the victims when they were shot. ===Autopsies of victims=== The autopsies of Jasmine and Jamilya Lewis showed that both girls died of gunshot wounds to the head and were shot at very close range. Powder stippling around Jasmine's left eye, the site of her mortal wound, indicated that her eyes were open when she was shot. One of the blood spots discovered on Henyard's socks matched the blood of Jasmine Lewis. \\"High speed\\" or \\"high velocity\\" blood spatters found on Henyard's jacket matched the blood of Jamilya Lewis and showed that Henyard was less than four feet from her when she was killed. Smalls' trousers had \\"splashed\\" or \\"dropped blood\\" on them consistent with dragging a body. DNA evidence was also presented at trial indicating that Henyard raped Lewis. ==Execution== Henyard was sentenced to death on August 19, 1994, and put in lockdown. Henyard's death warrant was signed on June 9, 2008. Henyard was the 66th execution in the state since the death penalty was reinstated in the United States in 1977. Henyard was executed on September 23, 2008, by lethal injection. The execution was delayed by two hours because Henyard had two appeals before the U.S. Supreme Court trying to block the execution; both were denied. ==See also== * Capital punishment in Florida * Capital punishment in the United States * List of people executed in Florida ==References== Category:1974 births Category:2008 deaths Category:21st-century executions by Florida Category:1993 murders in the United States Category:American kidnappers Category:American murderers of children Category:American rapists Category:American robbers Category:American people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Florida Category:People executed by Florida by lethal injection Category:21st-century executions of American people Category:People executed for murder ","title":"Richard Henyard"},{"id":"19318304","text":"In 2009, the Miss Mundo Dominicana pageant was cancelled due to lack of money and sponsors.

She is a leading proponent of variation theory,Herk, Gerard (2001). \\"Shana Poplack\\" in Concise Encyclopedia of Sociolinguistics (ed. Mesthrie, Rajend, Elsevier: 901) the approach to language science pioneered by William Labov. She has extended the methodology and theory of this field into bilingual speech patterns, the prescription- praxis dialectic in the co-evolution of standard and non-standard languages, and the comparative reconstruction of ancestral speech varieties, including African American vernacular English. She founded and directs the University of Ottawa Sociolinguistics Laboratory. ==Biography== Born in Detroit, Michigan, and raised in New York City, she studied at Queens College and New York University, then lived in Paris for several years, studying with Andr√© Martinet at the Sorbonne before moving to the University of Pennsylvania, where she took her PhD (1979) under Labov's supervision. She joined the University of Ottawa in 1981. == Work == Poplack's work privileges the use of large-scale digitized databases of unreflecting, vernacular speech and variable rule statistical methodology. Much of her research has involved the empirical testing of popular opinions on language, particularly as pertains to received wisdom surrounding language 'quality' or 'purity'. ===Language contact=== Poplack's many studies on language contact (examining multiple language pairs) have demonstrated that borrowing has no lasting structural effects on a recipient language and that many changes attributed to language contact can be alternately explained by internal language change. During three years as a researcher at the Centro de Estudios Puertorrique√±os, City University of New York, her studies of code-switching among Puerto Ricans in New YorkPoplack, Shana (1980) Sometimes I'll start a sentence in Spanish y termino en espa√±ol: toward a typology of code-switching.

He was also the Fifth Count of Pezuela de las Torres, near Alcal√° de Henares. ==Biography== He was born at Seville. As a young soldier, Jaime de Guzm√°n y Spinola fought for Philip of Bourbon in the War of Spanish Succession and participated in the attack on Sardinia and Sicily during the War of the Quadruple Alliance. After the war he became an important diplomat and was embassador to France between 1736 and 1740. In 1738 he was made a Knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece. At the outbreak of the War of the Austrian Succession he joined the Spanish army in Italy and played an important role in the Battle of Madonna dell'Olmo. After the disastrous 1746 campaign, he replaced the Count de Gages as Supreme Commander of the Spanish troops in Italy until the end of the war. In 1749 he was appointed Captain General of Catalonia, a function he exercised for the next 10 years till the death of King Ferdinand VI of Spain in 1759, but the new King Charles III of Spain, former King in Naples, kept him on doing so, for another eight years, until his death, something very unusual. During his term of power he developed a good school of Military Engineers in Barcelona, the Academia de Matem√°ticas de Barcelona, now a prestigious center for the actual chocolat guild masters. He did much to approve the access to the city from land and sea, the water supply and the street lighting. His most important works were the construction of Barceloneta, the San Fernando Castle in Figueras and the reconstruction of the Montjuich fortress. He was buried in the Barceloneta \\"San Miguel del Puerto Church\\", an area much decayed along the times but now flourishing again after the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games.

The cylinders contain short fragments of actual operatic performances from the Italian, German and French repertoires. Despite their variable quality of sound (some are quite good while others are nearly inaudible), the cylinders have great historical value thanks to the unique aural picture they document of pre-World War I singers in performance at an opera house with a full orchestra. Other contemporary recordings only capture singers as recorded with piano or a severely truncated orchestra in a boxy commercial recording studio. The Mapleson cylinders also feature the only recordings known to exist of a number of famous singers and conductors who were never recorded commercially.Much of the content of this article is derived from The Mapleson Cylinders, 72-page booklet accompanying 6-LP set. New York: New York Public Library, 1985. They include legendary tenor Jean de Reszke, soprano Milka Ternina, and conductor Luigi Mancinelli. ==History== On March 17, 1900, Lionel Mapleson, the librarian of the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, purchased an Edison ‚ÄòHome‚Äô phonograph, which, like most cylinder phonographs, could be used to make records as well as play them. Mapleson was apparently enchanted with the acoustic device, and on March 21, 1900, his friend, the cellist and occasional composer Leo Stern, presented him with attachments for it: Bettini recorder and reproducer units. By the end of the month, Mapleson had persuaded the soprano Marcella Sembrich to record her vocalization of Johann Strauss's \\"Fr√ºhlingsstimmen\\" into it. The following year, Mapleson came up with the idea of putting the recorder in the prompter's box of the Met. His first effort recorded Nellie Melba singing a scrap of music during a performance of Massenet's Le Cid on January 16, 1901. He recorded several more times during performances, still utilizing the prompter's box, but often with unsatisfactory results. After a short cessation and with the commencement of the 1901‚Äì1902 season, he resumed his recording activity from the Met's fly system. This time, he employed a huge recording horn that could capture the sounds emanating from singers and orchestra stationed below. He was thus able to unobtrusively record bits of many stage performances from 1901 through 1903. The morning after his recording 'session', he would invite the artists involved to listen to playbacks of their performances.Rose Heylbut and Aim√© Gerber, Backstage at the Opera (New York: Crowell, 1937 [reprinted New York: Arno, 1973]), 152-53. His recording activity continued until the end of the 1902‚Äì1903 season. At that point Mapleson either lost interest or was forbidden by the Met's management from continuing his recording activities (although a few cylinders exist of orchestral rehearsals or concerts dating from 1904). ==IRCC== Alerted to the cylinders' existence from an article published in the December 28, 1935, issue of The New Yorker,Russell Maloney, The Talk of the Town, \\"Librarian,\\" The New Yorker, December 28, 1935, p. 12. William H. Seltsam, secretary (actually head) of the International Record Collectors' Club (IRCC), met with Mapleson a few months before his death on December 21, 1937. Mapleson offered two cylinders with the challenge to derive something from them. Seltsam's experiment met with success and after Mapleson's death, was able to borrow 120 cylinders from his estate for the purpose of releasing them on IRCC issues. Over the remainder of Seltsam's lifetime, the IRCC was able to issue about 60 sides on 78-rpm records and LPs. After Mapleson's death, a number of cylinders were found in a junk store in Brooklyn, and were purchased by various collectors. ==New York Public Library and CD reissue== With the co-operation of collectors, by 1962 eventually all existing Mapleson Cylinders had become the property of The Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound, a division of The New York Public Library. In 1985, under the direction of David Hall, the library transferred all the existing cylinders to six LPs which were released with a 72-page booklet containing translations and extensive historical and biographical notes.Jane Boutwell, The Talk of the Town, \\"The Mapleson Cylinders,\\" The New Yorker, December 9, 1985, p. 36 In 2000, David Hamilton and Seth Winner gave a lecture-demonstration to determine if any more sound information could be retrieved from the cylinders using the most modern technology then available. Their verdict was that the cylinders were then too deteriorated to retrieve much more information than previous dubbings. A number of the cylinders have been reissued on CD by the Romophone and Marston record labels as part of wider anthologies devoted to individual singers. A comprehensive but unauthorized CD transfer of the cylinders was issued in 1987 by the British company Symposium Records (catalogue number: Symposium 1284). For its reissue, Symposium used the IRCC 78 rpm recordings. == References  External links == * The Mapleson Cylinders (for purchase from the New York Public Library) * The Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound at NYPL. * The Mapleson Cylinders, digitized version of 72-page booklet accompanying six-LP set, with selected digitized examples.

This retrograde motion with an orbital inclination of 103¬∞ suggests that it is the missing link between its source in the Hills cloud and Halley-type comets, thus providing further insight into the evolution of the outer Solar System. The object measures no more than across. With a semi-major axis of 42 AU, it takes about 269 years to complete an orbit around the Sun. Officially discovered on 31 May 2008, the discovery was announced on 16 July 2008, by the Canada‚ÄìFrance Ecliptic Plane Survey team led by Brett Gladman. The discovery team nicknamed \\"Drac\\" after Count Dracula. == Discovery and naming == The discovery of was announced on 16 July 2008 by the Canada‚ÄìFrance Ecliptic Plane Survey team led by Brett Gladman from the University of British Columbia. The announcement was made during the \\"Asteroids, Comets, Meteors\\" meeting held in Baltimore, Maryland, followed by a Minor Planet Electronic Circular on the same day and an IAU Circular on 18 July. The discovery was made using images obtained on 31 May from the 3.5 meter Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, followed by further observations until 8 July from the Whipple Observatory and Cerro Tololo. The discovery team nicknamed Drac because of its high inclination in reference to its orbital plane resembling Count Dracula's ability to walk on walls. == Orbit == is the first trans-Neptunian object (TNO) with a retrograde orbit to be discovered. With a semi-major axis of 41.7 AU, it was discovered while at a distance of 32 AU and has a perihelion at roughly the distance of Uranus. The object's 103-degree inclination makes its almost perpendicular to the ecliptic, and is, as of July 2017, one of only six objects known to have inclination (i) > 60¬∞ and perihelion (q) > 15 AU.

Its discovery may reveal the source regions for Halley-type comets which also have an retrograde orbit, but their origin remains unknown. itself is believed to be in an intermediate stage towards becoming a comet, thus helping to further explain the formation and evolution of the outer Solar System. Orbits of and ===Planet Nine=== may even provide evidence of Planet Nine. (called drac in reference) The Kozai effect inside the mean-motion resonances with Planet Nine may cause a periodic exchange between its inclination and its eccentricity.

Located north of Fells Point, originally the neighborhood was home to Baltimore's dock workers. By the 1880s canneries and factories provided employment to new immigrants, including Irish, Italians and Poles. In the early 1900s these new Americans were joined by Jews, Lithuanians and Greeks. Today its tidy brick rowhouses and tree-lined streets are home to both old-timers and young urban professionals. It is also the heart of Baltimore's growing Latino community and is sometimes called \\"Spanish Town\\". Although most Hispanics in the neighborhood are Mexicans, there are significant populations of Salvadorans, Puerto Ricans, Hondurans, Dominicans, Guatemalans, Colombians, and Cubans, as well as many others. It is bordered by S. Broadway on the west, S. Patterson Park Avenue on the east, E. Lombard Street on the north and Eastern Avenue on the south, Upper Fells Point's central location puts residents within walking distance of Patterson Park, the dining and nightlife of Fells Point, Little Italy and Canton, and Johns Hopkins Hospital. It is also just a water taxi ride from Baltimore's Inner Harbor as well as Federal Hill. In 2006 the Baltimore City Paper selected Upper Fells Point as Baltimore's Best Neighborhood. The neighborhood was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 21, 2007. It is within Baltimore National Heritage Area. ==History== Prior to 1729, the town of Fells Point consisted of three homes, several tobacco houses, an orchard, and a mill. The name \\"Fell's Prospect\\" derives from the name given to the area in 1730 by an English Quaker, William Fell, who bought land on a marshy hook that jutted into the Patapsco River. He called his tract of land \\"Fell's Prospect,\\" sensing the Point's possibilities for shipping and shipbuilding. The river offered a deep-water anchorage, which enabled seagoing vessels to send smaller boats back and forth from shore with cargo. In 1797 Fells Point was incorporated into Baltimore town as the Debtor Hundred, a parcel of land that included all the Fell family holdings, both the Point and the higher ground to the north then known as Fells Prospect, often referred to as Upper Fells Point. Fells Point was largely responsible for shaping the ethnic character of Upper Fells as it exists today. The first wave of immigrants were the Irish, establishing the second Catholic Church in Baltimore, St. Patrick's, in 1792. A few years later, this was the site of the first free school in Baltimore. It was academically rigorous and admitted poor children of all races and religions. The Irish and African-Americans lived side by side with the newer German immigrants. By 1860, one quarter of the population of Baltimore was German. By the 1880s East Baltimore canneries and clothing sweatshops were providing employment to hordes of newcomers. Czechs from Bohemia, Scandinavians, Italians, and Poles found work and lodging in Upper Fells Point. These groups were joined by the Lithuanians and Greeks in the early 1900s. The Depression caused many of the larger homes in the area to be divided into multi-family dwellings. Adding to the neighborhood's ethnic diversity are Hispanic immigrants who began to arrive in the 1960s and 1970s and Lumbee Native Americans who migrated from the Carolinas.http://www.fellsprospect.org/About-History.html ==Population== As of 2010, Upper Fells Point was 37.7% white, 36.9% Hispanic, 16.8% African American, 7.4% Asian, and 1.2% other. ==References *, including updated photo and boundary map, at Maryland Historical Trust Category:Baltimore National Heritage Area Category:Ethnic enclaves in Maryland Category:Hispanic and Latino American culture in Baltimore Category:Federal architecture in Maryland Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Baltimore Category:Neighborhoods in Baltimore Category:Southeast Baltimore ","title":"Upper Fell's Point"},{"id":"19318751","text":"The Men's Freestyle 82 kg at the 1980 Summer Olympics as part of the wrestling program were held at the Athletics Fieldhouse, Central Sports Club of the Army. == Medalists == {  -  -  -  } == Tournament results == The competition used a form of negative points tournament, with negative points given for any result short of a fall.

It was the worst rail accident in Yugoslavia's history to that date and remains one of the worst in Europe's history. ==The accident== The accident occurred when all nine cars from a passenger express train derailed and rolled over at the entrance to Zagreb's main train station, from the entrance to Track IIa. At 22:33 hours the locomotive entered the station via Track IIa without any of its carriages. Many of the passengers died immediately, as many as 41 of whom could not be identified and were buried in a common grave at the Mirogoj Cemetery. The surviving passengers reported that the train had not slowed while passing through the stations at Ludina and Novoselec, about an hour before reaching Zagreb Main Station, and that it had been leaning dangerously. The passengers found were mainly gastarbeiters from West Germany and their families, including many children. The driver and driver's assistant remained unharmed, and the locomotive intact. The locomotive is now on display in the Croatian Railway Museum. The train was arriving in Zagreb from Vinkovci at 19:45 local time.

Born near Loud√©ac to a noble family, Eudon, as he was originally called, was briefly an Augustinian monk taking up a hermit's life in the Broc√©liande (Br√©cheliant). Around 1140, during the reign of Conan III of Brittany, √âon took up residence in the abandoned priory of Moinet, but he did not remain there long. According to his own story, one day while attending the mass, he heard the priest say Per eum qui venturus est judicare vivos et mortuos (\\"by him whose it is to judge the living and the dead\\") and interpreted this as applying to himself, hearing his name in the eum of the liturgy.William of Newbury says that sermone Gallico Eun diceretur (\\"in Gallic parlance he was called Eun\\"), cf. XXXX 328. It appears that Eun, or Yun, was the Old French form of Eudo. The name is not related to a Gnostic tradition or neo-Manichaeanism as Norman Cohn believed, cf. Zacour, 329 n10. He thereafter went by the name √âon. Considering himself a prophet and messiah, he soon gathered about himself a body of faithful who met at his priory. He became renowned for his magic, the glow which supposedly surrounded him, his ability to be in many places at once, and the sumptuous feasts to which he treated his guests. He secured the loyalty of the poor by granting them great riches, stolen from castles and monasteries. As an article of faith, the established Church was worldly, its wealth, its sacraments, and its offices worthless and ineffectual. √âon's band of followers attacked the rich and redistributed their wealth amongst themselves, eventually dressing themselves in the highest finery and eating lavishly. Members were ranked as \\"angels\\", \\"apostles\\", etc. Their principal message was of the Parousia. √âon and his followers spread their message throughout northern Brittany and as far as Gascony. √âon's epithet, de l‚Äô√âtoile (\\"of the star\\"), derives from a comet which appeared in 1148. Generally considered bad omens in the Middle Ages, a comet often signified the downfall of an illustrious person. Under Pope Eugene III, the Council of Reims in 1148 condemned √âon's movement as heresy (h√©r√©sie √©oniste). The prelates ordered him arrested and brought before an ecclesiastical tribunal, though the first men sent to arrest him were themselves converted by his extravagant lifestyle.Zacour, 328. When √âon was first brought before the council he carried with him a forked branch, which he said would point heavenward if God were to have two thirds of the world and he a third and earthwards if their shares were to be reversed. The council is said to have burst into laughter upon hearing this. He was tortured into confessing his messiahship and condemned to life imprisonment. He was handed over to the custody of Archbishop Samson of Reims and sent to the Abbey of Saint-Denis, where he died in 1150. His followers (with names like Wisdom, Knowledge, and Judgement) were hunted down, with difficulty, and burnt at the stake, for none would disavow their master. ==Sources== *Avril, Jean-Loup.

Initially an anti-Axis resistance organization it gradually shifted its focus towards anti-communism, collaborating with the Axis authorities against EAM and its affiliates. Following the end of the Axis occupation, it played an active role in the persecution of communist sympathizers during the White Terror and various military operations of the Greek Civil War, most notably the Dekemvriana. ==Foundation and activities during the Occupation== Georgios Grivas Organization X was founded in 1941 by Colonel Georgios Grivas, a Greek Cypriot by birth with the intention of gathering intelligence for the Allied cause, minor anti-German actions and transport of volunteers to the Middle East. However, with the EAM's meteoric rise to prominence within the Greek resistance movement, X shifted its attention towards combating EAM and other affiliated communist groups.Dimitris Kousouris, pp. 100-101 Following the Italian surrender to the Allies in September 1943, X began purchasing weapons from the Axis authorities, transforming into an militant anti-communist organization.Dimitris Kousouris, pp. 100-101 In November 1943, Organization X, Rumelia-Avlona-Nisoi (RAN), National Committee, National Action and other minor right wing resistance organizations formed the Panhellenic Liberation Coalition (PAS); with the intention of preventing a communist takeover of the country within the first 20 days following the end of Axis occupation. In August 1944, members of collaborationist organizations such as the EEE and Security Battalions began enlisting into X and EDES en masse in order to avoid persecution as liberation seemed imminent.Dimitris Kousouris, p. 82, 115 Grivas concentrated his efforts in the wealthy districts of Athens and expanded X to between 2,000 and 3,000 men in 1944. He recruited his men and arms from officers who were retained on the active list by the quisling government.John Louis Hondros, Occupation & Resistance: the Greek Agony (New York: Pella, 1983), p. 142 Before the German departure fortified a base near the ancient temple of Thiseion.Heinz Richter, British Intervention in Greece (London: Merlin Press, 1985) p. 167; David Close, The Origins of the Greek Civil War (London: Longman, 1995), p. 114; Neni Panourgia, Dangerous Citizens New York: Fordham University Press, 2009), pp. 58-59. Towards the end of the Occupation, X received British arms and uniforms from Middle East Command representative in Athens Panagiotis Spiliotopoulos. X then enacted armed patrols from the eastern coast of Attica to the Athens city center.Dimitris Kousouris, pp. 100-101 ==The Dekemvriana== In the weeks between the departure of the Germans and the events of December 1944 (the Dekemvriana), X played an active part in the campaign of provocation of Athenians orchestrated by the British, according to ELAS' members.Orestis Makis, Œü ŒïŒõŒëŒ£ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒëŒ∏Œ∑ŒΩŒ±œÇ (Athens: Synchroni Epochi, 1985); ŒïœÄŒµœÉŒ±ŒΩ Œ≥ŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑ ŒñœâŒ∑ (Athens: KKE, 2004); Manos Ioannidis, Œ¶Œ±Œ∫ŒµŒªŒøœÇ ŒùŒø9745/Œí (Athens: Medousa, 2005).

On 3 December 1944 a 250,000-strong (but unarmed) demonstration was shot at by Greek police under the police chief Angelos Evert, with between 22 and 28 people killed and hundreds wounded.Constantine Tsoukalas, The Greek Tragedy (Baltimkore: Penguin, 1969) (Tsoukalas gives a figure of 28 dead). In the early morning hours of 4 December, ELAS reservists began operations in the Athens‚ÄìPiraeus area, attacking Grivas' X forces.Charles R. Shrader, The Withered Vine: Logistics and the Communist Insurgency in Greece, 1945-1949, Praeger, 1999, p. 39. In the evening, a peaceful demonstration by EAM members cum funeral procession took place. This time government forces took no action but the procession was attacked by Chites led by Colonel Grivas, with over 100 dead. There followed the Dekemvriana, in which X supported the British and Greek government forces.Charles R. Shrader, The Withered Vine: Logistics and the Communist Insurgency in Greece, 1945-1949, Praeger, 1999, p. 39. ==X during the White Terror== In accordance with the Treaty of Varkiza of February 1945, ELAS disarmed, leaving its supporters vulnerable to attacks from right-wing forces, during a period known as the White Terror. The White Terror was conducted by an informal alliance of army officers, National Guards, policemen, armed gangs, political organizations and people from families who had victims during the occupation and Dekemvriana seeking revenge. The majority were determined to prepare the way for a rigged plebiscite and the return of the king. Anyone deemed to be left-wing, or who had supported the communist-led resistance (EAM or ELAS) in any way was subjected to random beatings, repeated arrests, torture, murder or rape. Many people left their villages for safety either in the big towns or in the mountains. Civil war now appeared to be inevitable. X played an active role in the White Terror, and even in the weeks before Varkiza British officials were complaining of police using elements of X and EDES to make political arrests under warrants issued by a police magistrate who was a member of X.Hondros, p. 249. Hondros‚Äôs reference is R1373/4/19 Leeper to FO, January 18YT6h. British authorities estimated Xs ranks to have swelled to over 200,000 men at the time.Dimitris Kousouris, p. 194 One of the significant events involving X occurred in January 1946 when 1000 Chites under the bandit Manganas took over the town of Kalamata in the Peloponnese. They released 32 right-wing prisoners and terrorized the town during the night killing 6 people. In 1948 Manganas resumed a career of banditry in the Olympia region. During 1945 attempts were made to coordinate persecution of the Left. Much of the liaison was conducted by X, which from May 1945 sent agents into the provinces to recruit members, and accepted affiliation from numerous other organizations. The local right- wing organizations rigged the electoral process and compiled lists of people to be arrested in the event of a coup.David Close, p. 114. As the general election approached early in 1946 the role of X diminished. Themistoklis Sophoulis‚Äôs government closed X‚Äôs national offices in January, and its successor did not allow them to reopen. Members of the organization formed the \\"Party of X\\" and took part in the elections of 1946, without electing any MP. By 1946 X was regarded as an embarrassment as it discredited the Greek government in international eyes.David Close, p. 157. X was officially recognized as a National Organization of Internal Resistance by a royal decree of March 10, 1950.Papadopoulos Omiros 2000, Organosis X: Tria Hronia Tris Eones, Nea Thesis, Athens, pp. 166 (The biggest resistance organisation EAM- ELAS was not recognised until 1982.ŒíŒ±Œ≥Œ≥Œ≠ŒªŒ∑œÇ Œ§Œ∂ŒøœçŒ∫Œ±œÇ, Œó Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒΩœéœÅŒπœÉŒ∑ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒïŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒëŒΩœÑŒØœÉœÑŒ±œÉŒ∑œÇ\\", œÉœÑŒø Œí.ŒíŒ±ŒºŒ≤Œ±Œ∫Œ¨œÇ-Œ†.

He played for the Kilkenny senior hurling team for five seasons, during which time he usually lined out as a right wing-back or at midfield. Dowling began his hurling career at club level with O'Loughlin Gaels. He broke onto the club's top adult team as a 16-year-old in 1994 and enjoyed his first success the following year when the club won the 1995 Kilkenny Junior Championship. He won a Kilkenny Intermediate Championship title in 1996 and promotion to the top flight of Kilkenny hurling. Dowling went on to make numerous championship appearances at senior level and was at left wing-back on O'Loughlin Gaels' Leinster Club Championship-winning team in 2003. His club career ended as a result of a hip injury in 2010, by which time he had also won two Kilkenny Senior Championship titles. At inter-county level, Dowling was part of the Kilkenny minor team that won back-to-back Leinster Minor Championships in 1995 and 1996 before winning the All-Ireland Under-21 Championship in 1999. He joined the Kilkenny senior team in 2001. From his debut, Dowling lined out as a half-back or a midfielder and made a combined total of 25 National League and Championship appearances in a career that ended with his last game in 2005. During that time he was part of two All-Ireland Championship-winning teams ‚Äì in 2002 and 2003. Dowling also secured three successive Leinster Championship medals and three National Hurling League medals. He was dropped from the panel in June 2005. ==Career statistics== {   - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Team !rowspan=\\"2\\"Year !colspan=\\"3\\"National League !colspan=\\"2\\"Leinster !colspan=\\"2\\"All-Ireland !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Score!!Apps!!Score!!Apps!!Score!!Apps!!Score - rowspan=\\"5\\"Kilkenny 2001 rowspan=\\"1\\"Division 1B 50-0010-0000-0060-00 - 2002 rowspan=\\"4\\"Division 1A 20-0010-0000-0030-00 - 2003 20-0010-0220-0050-02 - 2004 30-0110-0240-0180-04 - 2005 30-0000-00colspan=2‚Äî30-00 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Total !15!!0-01!!4!!0-04!!6!!0-01!!25!!0-06 } ==Honours== ;O'Loughlin Gaels *Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship (1): 2003 *Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship (2): 2001, 2002 *Kilkenny Intermediate Hurling Championship (1): 1996 *Kilkenny Junior Hurling Championship (1): 1995 ;Kilkenny *All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (2): 2002, 2003 *Leinster Senior Hurling Championship (3): 2001, 2002, 2003 *National Hurling League (3): 2002, 2003, 2005 *All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship (1): 1999 *Leinster Under-21 Hurling Championship (2): 1998, 1999 *Leinster Minor Hurling Championship (2): 1995, 1996 ==References== Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:O'Loughlin Gaels hurlers Category:Kilkenny inter-county hurlers Category:All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship winners ","title":"Se√°n Dowling"},{"id":"19319035","text":"A Portuguese statue of Eugene III, who called the council In 1148, a Council of Reims was called by Pope Eugene III to consider a number of regulations, or canons, for the Church, as well as to debate some other issues. Originally the summons for the council went out in October 1147 and it was supposed to be held in Trier, which is now in Germany, but conditions in Trier were such that it was moved to Reims, in France, for February 1148. A number of the summoned bishops and other church officials did not attend and Eugene suspended many of the non-attendees, excepting the Italian ecclesiastics, who were excused. The council lasted 11 days, and convened on 21 March 1148. From 400 to 1100 ecclesiastics are considered to have attended, although this number does not include the various servants and officials of the attendees, who would have swelled the numbers. After the conclusion of the council, Eugene held a consistory trial of Gilbert of Poitiers, the Bishop of Poitiers, who was accused of heretical teachings. In the end, Gilbert was allowed to return to his bishopric. ==Preliminaries and attendees== The council was first called on 11 October 1147 by Eugene, who ordered the bishops and others summoned to the council to assemble at Trier on 21 March 1148. This is from a letter sent to Henry Zd√≠k, the Bishop of Olmuetz by the pope. However, a letter sent by the pope on the next day, 12 October 1147, to Eberhard, Archbishop of Salzburg, named Troyes as the location for the council. It is likely that Troyes, however, was a scribal error, as a further letter of Eugene's, to Suger, Abbot of St Denis, dated 6 October 1147, named Trier as the location also, thus confirming the location given in the letter of 11 October. The papal entourage arrived in Trier on 30 November 1147, but shortly after arrival the pope decided to move the proceedings because of complaints from the residents of Trier, and announced in February 1148 that the council would move to Reims, but still on the date given before. A feature of the council was that the pope ordered the attendance of the various bishops and other officials. Although some requested attendees were excused, it was mostly due to ill health, not to the need to see to the business of their offices. Those who did not attend were suspended from office. The Italian bishops, however, were mostly excused from attendance, as Eugene held a council at Cremona in July 1148 where the Reims decrees were announced. Although the number of Spanish bishops who attended is unknown, the Archbishop of Toledo, Raymund, did attend. King Alfonso VII of Le√≥n and Castile interceded with the pope to lift the sentences against those bishops who did not attend. King Stephen of England refused permission for any of the English bishops to attend, except for the bishops of Hereford, Norwich and Chichester. It was the papal summons which caused the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theobald of Bec, to quarrel with his king, after Stephen refused the archbishop permission to go to the council. Theobald instead managed to evade the guards placed on him and hired a fishing boat to take him across the English Channel to attend the council. The precise number of bishops, archbishops, and abbots who attended is unknown. Estimates range from 1,100 to 400, with the lower number being much more likely. The attendees were from what were later the countries of France, Germany, England, and Spain, and in keeping with the times, would have included not just the prelates who were summoned, but also their servants and officials, making the true number of people in Reims impossible to know. ==Council== Cathedral at Reims The opening of the council took place on 21 March 1148 at Reims Cathedral on a Sunday. Eugene and his attendants had arrived in Reims by 9 March. The main business of the council was the debate on a number of canons, or rules, for the church that would be announced. Most of these were not new decrees, having been promulgated by Eugene's predecessor at the councils of Reims in 1131 and at the Lateran council of 1139. All of the proposed canons were approved, except for one on clerical attire which was opposed by Rainald of Dassel and other German ecclesiastics. This canon had prohibited cloaks made of fur. Another canon condemning clerical marriage was greeted with amusement, as the council members felt that all clergy should already know that marriage was forbidden to them. The Reims council also condemned and ordered the arrest of √âon de l'√âtoile, a Breton heretic. He was eventually tortured into confession and imprisoned until his death in 1150. Further decrees condemned the Anacletans, supporters of an earlier antipope, who had previously been condemned in 1136. Further side business was the settling of a dispute between two Norman abbots ‚Äì Eustachius of Jumi√®ges Abbey and Robert of the Abbey of St. Vincent, Le Mans, which was handed to two cardinals to decide. The two prelates reached a decision on 5 April. Other disputes, including ones between abbots, were also handled at the council, although not necessarily during the council deliberations. Also included in the council's business was the confirmation of the excommunication of the Bishop of Dol and the Bishop of Brieux. Although it was reported that the Bishop of Orl√©ans and the Bishop of Troyes were deposed by the council, this is erroneous, and probably stemmed from the number of ecclesiastics who were suspended for non- attendance. A number of ecclesiastics died at or shortly after the council, including Robert de Bethune, the Bishop of Hereford, who fell ill on the third day of the council and died on either 14 or 16 April 1148. The Bishop of Angoul√™me died in June, after attending the council. The Archbishop of Trier, Albero de Montreuil, was so ill he was carried to the council on a horse litter. The council is said to have lasted 11 days in total, but it is likely that it was shorter, given the large increase in the population of Reims, which would have strained the resources of the town. This gives an end date of the council of 1 April 1148. ==Consistory== Although the council probably ended on 1 April, Eugene asked a number of attendees to stay after the formal close of the council to consider the case of Gilbert of Poitiers, who was under investigation for heresy, connected with his teachings. The main concern against Gilbert seems to have been his convoluted vocabulary and style of writing, which led to his writings being easily misunderstood. The specific problem came when Gilbert's writings attempted to explicate the relationship between God and his \\"divinity\\", which led to his opponents claiming that Gilbert was attempting to create two Gods, rather than just one. His opponents claimed that this occurred in Gilbert's treatise on Boethius' theological work De Trinitate. Gilbert had previously been investigated by Eugene at Paris in April 1147, but this hearing came to nothing for two reasons. One was that Gilbert's opponents were not unified in what they opposed in Gilbert's teachings. The second reason was that no one had a copy of the treatise on Boethius by Gilbert that was in dispute. Prior to the second hearing at Reims, Bernard of Clairvaux, who was opposed to Gilbert's teachings, held a private meeting with a number of the attendees, where Bernard attempted to pressure them to condemn Gilbert. This offended the various cardinals in attendance, who then proceeded to insist that they were the only persons who could judge the case. Although connected with the council, Gilbert was tried after the council closed, at a consistory held in the Archbishop of Reims' chambers. A consistory was a specialized form of trial held to investigate questionable theological teachings, and was beginning to be used for this purpose in this period. The consistory lasted two days, and included John of Salisbury, who had previously been a student of Gilbert's, but was now in Eugene's service. The trial likely took place on 2‚Äì3 April 1148, as it lasted took two days, and most accounts state that it took place during the week before Palm Sunday, which was 4 April that year. As the consistory took place after the closing of the council on 1 April, that only allows 2 and 3 April for the trial. However, if the council closed earlier than 1 April, then the trial could have taken place on 29‚Äì30 March 1148. In the end, no verdict of heresy was placed against Gilbert, who remained Bishop of Poitiers until his death in 1154. Besides Bernard, other ecclesiastics in opposition to Gilbert were Robert of Melun and Peter the Lombard. Robert was a teacher at both Paris and Melun, and later became Bishop of Hereford. Another opponent was Otto of Freising, who was unable to attend the trial. No official records of the trial were kept, which led to considerable confusion in the future. ==Notes== Category:1148 in Europe Reims,1148 Reims,1148 ","title":"Council of Reims (1148)"},{"id":"19319058","text":"Joan Silber is an American novelist and short story writer.

The homily is paraphrased from a 17th-century sermon of Isaac Barrow, Against Detraction ‚Äî \\"Good nature like a bee, collects honey from every herb. Ill nature, like a spider, sucks poison from the flowers.\\" \\"The Gods of the Copybook Headings\\" is a poem by Rudyard Kipling, characterized by biographer Sir David Gilmour as one of several \\"ferocious post-war eruptions\\" of Kipling's growing reactionary sentiment about the state of Anglo-European society. It was first published in the Sunday Pictorial of London on October 26, 1919; in America, it was published as \\"The Gods of the Copybook Maxims\\" in Harper's Magazine in January, 1920. In the poem, Kipling's narrator counterposes the \\"Gods\\" of the title, who embody \\"age-old, unfashionable wisdom,\\" against \\"the Gods of the Market-Place\\" who represent the \\"habits of wishful thinking\\" into which society had fallen in the early 20th century. The \\"copybook headings\\" to which the title refers were proverbs or maxims, often drawn from sermons and scripture extolling virtue and wisdom, that were printed at the top of the pages of copybooks, special notebooks used by 19th- century British school-children. The students had to copy the maxims repeatedly, by hand, down the page. The exercise was thought to serve simultaneously as a form of moral education and penmanship practice. == Modern critical interpretation == Kipling's narrative voice contrasts the eternal wisdom of these commonplace texts with the fashionable and na√Øve ideas of \\"the Market-Place,\\" making oblique reference to feminism (\\"the ... Feminian Sandstones\\"), Lloyd George and Liberal efforts at disarmament (\\"the Cambrian measures\\"), and socialist policies advocated by trade-unionists, many of whom were coalminers (\\"the Carboniferous Epoch\\"). In a footnote to a philosophical essay, Francis Slade compared Kipling's theme to Horace's Epistles I.10 (\\"The Advantages of Country Life\\") in which the Roman poet says: > Drive Nature off with a pitchfork, she‚Äôll still press back, And secretly > burst in triumph through your sad disdain. According to Slade, while the poem's verbosity is \\"far removed from Horace's elegant succinctness,\\" it does \\"make the same point with some force.\\" A writer on economics has described the poem as \\"beautifully captur[ing] the thinking of Schumpeter and Keynes.\\" T. S. Eliot included the poem in his 1941 collection A Choice of Kipling's Verse. ==PoemReferences * Gods of the Copybook Headings hosted at kipling.org.uk * The Gods of the Copybook Headings by Rudyard Kipling, 1865-1936 (includes a reading in MP3 format) Category:Poetry by Rudyard Kipling Category:1919 poems ","title":"The Gods of the Copybook Headings"},{"id":"19319085","text":"William Steele (born 19 May 1956 in Dunfermline) is a Scottish former footballer who played as a striker.

He is the director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany, and an internationally recognized expert in experimental psychology, cognitive psychology and philosophy of mind. He is the founder of the common coding theory between perception and action that has a significant impact in cognitive neuroscience and social cognition. ==Background== Wolfgang Prinz studied Psychology, Philosophy and Zoology at the University of M√ºnster (Germany) from 1962‚Äì1966, and was awarded a doctorate from the Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany, in 1970. Prinz was a director of the Max Planck Institute for Psychological Research Munich, Germany, from 1990 to 2004. Since 2004 he has been a director at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Germany. ==Memberships in Research Councils and Societies== Academia Europea; German Academy of Natural Scientist Leopoldina, Halle (Saale), Germany; Scientific Advisory Board of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research (ZiF), University of Bielefeld, Germany; Advisory Board of the Dean, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Jacobs University Bremen, Germany; Honorary Member of the European Society of Psychology (ESCoP); Psychonomic Society; German Society of Psychology (DGPs). ==Academic achievements== Prinz is the father of the common coding theory. This theory claims parity between perception and action. Its core assumption is that actions are coded in terms of the perceivable effects (i.e., the distal perceptual events) they should generatePrinz, W. (1997). Perception and action planning. European Journal of Cognitive Psychology, 9, 129-154.Prinz, W. (2003). Experimental approaches to action. In J. Roessler & N. Eilan (Eds.). Agency and Self-awareness (pp. 175-187). Oxford: Oxford University Press.Hommel, B., M√ºsseler, Aschersleben, G. and Prinz, W. (2001). The theory of event coding (TEC): A framework for perception and action planning. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 24, 849-937. Performing a movement leaves behind a bidirectional association between the motor pattern it has generated by and the sensory effects that it produces. Such an association can then be used backwards to retrieve a movement by anticipating its effects.Hommel, B. (2004). Event files: feature binding in and across perception and action. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 8, 494-500. These perception/action codes are also accessible during action observation (for an historical account of the ideo-motor principle, seeStock, A. & Stock, C. (2004). A short history of the ideo-motor action. Psychological Research, 68, 176-188. Observation of an action should activate action representations to the degree that the perceived and the represented action are similar.Knoblich, G. & Flach, R. (2001). Predicting the effects of actions: interactions of perception and action. Psychological Science, 12, 467-472. Such a claim suggests that we represent observed, executed and imagined actions in a commensurate manner and makes specific predictions regarding the nature of action and perceptual representations. First, representations for observed and executed actions should rely on a shared neural substrate. Second, a common cognitive system predicts interference effects when action and perception attempt to access shared representations simultaneously. Third, such a system predicts facilitation of action based on directly prior perception and vice versa. The common coding theory has received strong support from a variety of empirical studies in developmental psychology,Sommerville, J. A., & Decety, J. (2006).

Twin Peaks: An ERP study of action planning and control in co-acting individuals. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 18, 859-870. This theory is at the core of what has been called Motor cognition. In neuroscience, evidence for the common coding theory ranges from electrophysiological recordings in monkeys in which mirror neurons in the ventral premotor and posterior parietal cortices fire both during goal- directed actions and observation of the same actions performed by another individual,Rizzolatti, G., Fogassi, L., & Gallese, V. (2001). Neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the understanding and the imitation of action. Nature Review Neuroscience, 2, 661-670. to functional neuroimaging experiments in humans which indicate that the neural circuits involved in action execution partly overlap with those activated when actions are observed.Decety, J., & Gr√®zes, J.

The Griffins are a nuclear family consisting of the married couple Peter and Lois, their three children Meg, Chris, and Stewie and their anthropomorphic dog Brian. They live at 31 Spooner Street in the fictional town of Quahog, Rhode Island. Their family car resembles a red sixth-generation Ford Country Squire. They were created by Seth MacFarlane, in model of his two animated films, The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve. The family debuted on January 31, 1999, after Super Bowl XXXIII, in the episode \\"Death Has a Shadow\\". Alongside the six main family members, there are a number of other major and minor characters in their family. The most commonly recurring characters are Lois's parents Carter and Barbara Pewterschmidt, and Peter's now-deceased parents Francis and Thelma Griffin. Other recurring family members include Lois's two siblings, Carol and Patrick, as well as Brian's cousin Jasper. ==Creation== MacFarlane conceived the idea for Family Guy in 1998, developing it out of his two short films. MacFarlane caught the attention of Fox, and was given $50,000 to make a pilot. MacFarlane completed the 11-minute pilot after six months of hand animation. Upon review, Fox gave the green light to Family Guy as a series. Although Family Guys cancellation was initially announced after the second season, Fox decided to make a third season, after which it was cancelled in 2002. However, reruns on Adult Swim drove up interest in the show, and its DVD releases did quite well, selling over 2.2 million copies in one year, which renewed network interest. Family Guy returned to production in 2004, making four more seasons (for a total of seven) and a straight-to-DVD special, Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story. The show celebrated its official 100th episode during its sixth season in November 2007, resulting in the show's syndication. The show is contracted to continue producing episodes. ==Casting== MacFarlane voices three of the show's main characters, Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin and Stewie Griffin. He has stated that he already knew what kind of voice he was looking for the main characters so it was easier to do it himself. Peter's voice is inspired by the voice of a security guard MacFarlane overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, particularly on Harrison's performance in the 1964 musical drama film My Fair Lady. Brian's voice is MacFarlane's regular speaking voice. In addition MacFarlane provides the voice of various recurring and one-time characters, most prominently those of the Griffin's neighbor Glenn Quagmire, news anchor Tom Tucker and Lois' father Carter Pewterschmidt. Alex Borstein voices Lois Griffin, Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa, Loretta Brown and Lois' mother Barbara Pewterschmidt. Borstein was asked to provide a voice for the pilot while she was working on MADtv. She had not met MacFarlane or seen any artwork and said it was \\"really sight unseen\\". At the time, she was doing a stage show in Los Angeles, in which she played a redhead mother, whose voice she had based on one of her cousins. The voice was originally slower, when MacFarlane heard it, he replied \\"Make it a little less annoying and speed it up, or every episode will last four hours\\". Seth Green primarily plays Chris Griffin and Neil Goldman. Green admittedly did an impression of the Buffalo Bill character from the thriller film The Silence of the Lambs during his audition. His main inspiration for Chris' voice was how \\"Buffalo Bill\\" would sound if he worked at a drive-thru in a McDonald's (speaking through a PA system). Mila Kunis and Lacey Chabert have both played the voices of Meg Griffin. Chabert voiced Meg Griffin for the first production season (15 episodes). However, because of a contractual agreement, she was never credited. Chabert left the series due to time constraints with her acting role in Party of Five, as well as schoolwork, while Kunis won the role after auditions, a slight rewrite of the character and because of her performance on That '70s Show. MacFarlane called Kunis back after her initial audition asking her to speak slower; she was called back again later, this time instructed to enunciate more. Kunis said that she had it under control, and MacFarlane hired her. In an interview with a Sun Media correspondent in 2007, Kunis was asked about her character and said: \\"She's the scapegoat\\". \\"Meg gets picked on a lot. But it's funny. It's like the middle child. She is constantly in the state of being an awkward 14-year-old, when you're kind of going through puberty and what-not. She's just in perpetual mode of humiliation. And it's fun.\\" ==Main family== The show revolves around the adventures of the family of Peter Griffin, a bumbling, but well-intentioned, blue-collar worker. Peter is an Irish-American Catholic born in Mexico with a prominent Rhode Island and Eastern Massachusetts accent. His wife Lois is a stay-at-home mother and piano teacher, and has a distinct New England accent from being a member of the Pewterschmidt family of wealthy socialites. Peter and Lois have three children: Meg, their teenage daughter, who is frequently the butt of Peter's jokes due to her \\"homeliness\\" and lack of popularity; Chris, their teenage son, who in many respects, appears as a younger version of his father; and Stewie, their diabolical infant son of ambiguous sexual orientation who has adult mannerisms and speaks fluently with an upper-class affected English accent and stereotypical archvillain phrases. Living with the family is Brian, the family dog, who is highly anthropomorphized, drinks martinis, smokes cigarettes, drives a car, and engages in human conversation, though he occasionally acts like a normal dog, for example, he cannot resist chasing a ball. ===Peter Griffin=== Peter Griffin, voiced by Seth MacFarlane. Peter is the father of the Griffin family, a stereotypical blue-collar worker. Leader of the Griffin family, he is Irish-American Catholic. Peter is also an obese and bespectacled man who is just a big child. He has other roots beside his Irish ones, including African American, Spanish, Scottish and German. In an interview with The Advocate, MacFarlane described him as \\"Archie Bunker without the knowledge of what he's doing. He has the mind of a child, basically, and a source of big laughs is when he does not realize he's doing something inappropriate.\\" In the season four episode \\"Petarded\\", Peter takes an IQ test, and discovers that his low intellect places him in a category slightly below mentally retarded, but higher than a creationist. He is incredibly jealous of other attractions Lois has in her life, an attitude that tends to get out of hand in most cases, even assaulting a whale that kissed Lois at SeaWorld. In the season three episode \\"Stuck Together, Torn Apart\\", Peter and Lois split up because of Peter's jealousy only to discover that Lois has the same character flaw and the two decide to live with their mutually jealous nature. Peter has a very short attention span and frequently ends up in bizarre situations, as Chris points out in \\"Long John Peter\\", after Peter's parrot dies \\"He will get over it pretty quickly and then move on to another wacky thing\\", to which Peter finds a pipe organ and forgets about his parrot. ===Lois Griffin=== Lois Patrice Griffin (n√©e Pewterschmidt), voiced by Alex Borstein. Lois is the mother of the Griffin family. Lois's morals are often questionable, as she went through a brief period of kleptomania in the episode \\"Breaking Out Is Hard to Do\\", for which she went to prison. She also showed a gambling addiction when the family went to an Indian casino in \\"The Son Also Draws\\" during the first season. Various episodes have hinted that Lois is an avid drug user, but this is shown most clearly in \\"Deep Throats\\", where she revealed that she smoked marijuana when she was pregnant with Stewie, a claim backed-up by series creator Seth MacFarlane on a DVD commentary. Also, when asked by Peter where she got a tattoo on her lower back, she replied, 'Oh, I don't know Peter, meth is a hell of a drug' (\\"Prick Up Your Ears\\"). When Meg is thought to have become pregnant, Lois tells her to \\"smoke and drink a lot\\" (when Meg does not want to have an abortion, which Lois hinted at beforehand) \\"but don't start, then chicken out halfway throughout the pregnancy, 'cause then you'll wind up with Chris,\\" which implies she smoked and consumed alcohol while pregnant with Chris. ===Meg Griffin=== Megan/Megatron \\"Meg\\" Griffin, voiced by Mila Kunis. Meg is a self-conscious and emotionally vulnerable teenage girl. She is currently 18 years old and enrolled at James Woods Regional High School. Her numerous insecurities cause her to desperately try to be part of the \\"in-crowd\\", but this only results in her getting rebuffed by Connie D'Amico, the bullying head cheerleader of her school. Initially valued to the family in earlier seasons, her standing in the family's \\"pecking order\\" is now much more similar to that of the stereotypical \\"middle child\\" (despite being the oldest of the Griffin children by age) such as being the butt of Peter's jokes due to her \\"homeliness\\" and lack of self-confidence, despite frequently proving to be more responsible and reasonable than the rest of the family. Despite all this, another student named Neil Goldman has a crush on her. At times, she has been shown to be so self-conscious about herself that she engaged in dangerous sexual behavior just for attention. ===Chris Griffin=== Christopher Cross \\"Chris\\" Griffin, voiced by Seth Green. Chris is a friendly and laid-back teenage boy. Physically, he is a younger version of Peter, but intellectually, he often shows better potential, as shown from moments of articulation and coherence within his speech, and makes good points when especially talking about films, TV series, actors and actresses, etc. Similar to Meg, Chris deals with the problems that most teenage boys face: acne, girls, and school. He is currently 15 years old and, like Meg, is enrolled at James Woods Regional High School. On the volume 1 DVD box set, it stated that Chris \\"would not hurt a fly, unless it landed on his hot dog.\\" Chris is also willing to take drastic measures to get what he wants or needs, especially when it comes to getting good grades. He, at one point, believed that he got a bad grade on a mathematics test when he tickled his brain by sticking an army man's rifle into his nose and accidentally puncturing a lobe. ===Stewie Griffin=== Stewart Gilligan \\"Stewie\\" Griffin, voiced by Seth MacFarlane. Stewie is the youngest Griffin family member at one year old. Stewie originally served as the main villain of the show. Though he was originally an antagonistic child-genius sociopath, hell-bent on killing his mother and taking over the world, in more recent episodes he is a much more friendly yet flamboyant (and possibly homosexual) character, though nonetheless still rambunctious and disrespecting towards his elders and peers. Despite having a rivalry with the family dog, Brian, this seems to have ended as he and Brian now share a very close friendship, and they admitted that they loved each other, in the episode \\"Brian & Stewie\\". Stewie is considered to be the show's breakout character. Wizard magazine rated him the 95th-greatest villain of all time. ===Brian Griffin=== Brian Griffin, voiced by Seth MacFarlane, is the Griffin family's pet dog. Brian has lived with the Griffin family since Peter picked him up as a stray. Peter is his best friend, despite Brian's superior intelligence. Brian is often the voice of reason for the family, frequently reminding Peter how stupid or corrupt his ideas are. He also has a very close friendship with Stewie, and the two of them have been at the center of some of the most critically acclaimed episodes during the series, most notably the Road to... episodes. Seth MacFarlane has once described Brian as \\"a dog who has a wit as dry as the martinis he drinks.\\" MacFarlane also revealed that Brian is his favorite character from the series, as he feels most comfortable when playing that role. Brian was (temporarily) killed off, after he was hit by a car in the season 12 episode \\"Life of Brian\\". Brian, however, returned two episodes later, in \\"Christmas Guy\\", after Stewie went back in time to save him. In his brief absence Brian was replaced by another dog named Vinny, who was voiced by Tony Sirico and was never seen again after Brian's return (until the season 15 premiere, \\"The Boys in the Band\\", where he makes a cameo). ===Peter Griffin Jr.=== Peter Griffin Jr. was a possible infant son of Peter and Lois Griffin named after his father. His grave is seen in \\"The Juice Is Loose\\". Peter shook him until he stopped crying, killing him. In an attempt to comfort Lois he explains, if he shook him enough he would stop crying. ==References== Category:Family Guy characters Category:Fictional families Category:Television characters introduced in 1999 ","title":"Griffin family"},{"id":"19319234","text":"The Plaxton Pointer (originally known as the Reeve Burgess Pointer, and later as the TransBus Pointer and Alexander Dennis Pointer) was a single-decker bus body manufactured during the 1990s by Reeve Burgess, Plaxton and latterly built by Alexander Dennis. ==History== With the launch of the Dennis Dart in 1989, Plaxton launched the Pointer body on the short 8.5 metre chassis. It was initially built by its Reeve Burgess subsidiary, before moving to Plaxton's Scarborough factory.\\"Deregulation Darts\\" Bus & Coach Preservation May 2018 page 26 Launched in 1991, at 2.3 metres wide, this proved popular with many operators, and they sold in big numbers to London Regional Transport.Our History Alexander DennisTeam makes a point Commercial Motor 7 February 1991 The modular nature of both chassis and body meant for various permutations in length, with 8.5, 9.0 and 9.8 metre variants being manufactured. The Pointer became the most successful midibus body. The Pointer was also available with Volvo B6 chassis. The introduction of the Super Low Floor version of the Dennis Dart, the Dart SLF, in 1995 saw the Pointer body redesigned with a 2.4 metre width, with a step-free entrance, giving easy access for the disabled. This redesigned Pointer bodywork was also built on the Volvo B6LE, one for the UK and the other 20 for Citybus of Hong Kong. The low floor Plaxton Pointer 1 and the Plaxton Pointer 2 have a rounded roof dome (more rounded than the step entrance Pointer) with a double-curvature windscreen. Not long after, the body received an all-new lower front end design, and alterations to the rest of the body - the Pointer 2 was born, and has proved to be just as successful. This was also available in a range of lengths to suit individual needs - 9.3 m, 10.1 m, 10.7 m, 11.3 m \\"Super Pointer Dart\\" (SPD), and after 3 years of production, the 8.8 m \\"Mini Pointer Dart\\" (MPD). The 11.3 m \\"Super Pointer Dart\\" (SPD) is considered as a full-sized single-decker bus. The Pointer 2 was built almost exclusively on Dart SLF chassis, except for a single prototype - NK53TJV, delivered to Arriva North East - which was built on the experimental Blue Bird LFCC9 chassis.http://buslistsontheweb.co.uk/ In 1998, the Mayflower Group, owner of Alexander Coachbuilders, took over Dennis. The future of the Pointer at that time appeared uncertain as it was thought the Dart may be solely bodied by Alexander. As a result, Plaxton built two Pointer bodies on the Volvo B6BLE chassis known as Bus 2000, but the project was scrapped when Mayflower also purchased Plaxton, forming TransBus International. Certain design features of the scrapped Bus 2000 project have since been used on other designs, most notably the Alexander Dennis Enviro300 and Enviro500. With the collapse of TransBus in 2004 and subsequent restructuring by the administrators, Plaxton and Alexander Dennis were sold to different parties. As Pointer production had been transferred to the former Alexander plant at Falkirk, it became an Alexander Dennis product. Plaxton, once again an independent company, signalled its return to the bus market by developing the Centro on VDL and MAN chassis in 2005 to join its Primo low-floor minibus in competition with the Pointer.Serious about buses Bus & Coach Professional 14 February 2006 In August 2006 Alexander Dennis launched the Enviro200 Dart as a replacement for the Pointer Dart. ==Gallery== File:Penzance - Market Jew Street 401 Western National (L401VCV).jpgPreserved Western National Plaxton Pointer bodied Dennis Dart in Penzance in April 2014 File:Target Travel SUI8206 (5869498409) (cropped).jpgTarget Travel Plaxton Pointer bodied Dennis Dart in Plymouth in June 2011 File:Arriva Guildford & West Surrey 3091 P291 FPK.JPGArriva Guildford & West Surrey Plaxton Pointer 1 bodied Dennis Dart SLF in Dorking in July 2009 File:First Hampshire & Dorset 40784.JPGFirst Hampshire & Dorset Plaxton Pointer 2 bodied Dennis Dart SLF in Southampton in September 2008 ==References * *Alexander Dennis Pointer product website - Web archive Pointer Category:Full-size buses Category:Low- floor buses Category:Midibuses Pointer Category:Vehicles introduced in 1991 ","title":"Plaxton Pointer"},{"id":"19319238","text":"VFTS 102 is the most rapidly rotating star ever found - ~ 200 times faster than the sun, or with a speed of A relativistic star is a rotating star whose behavior is well described by general relativity, but not by classical mechanics.

Relativistic stars are one possible source to allow gravitational waves to be studied. Another definition of a relativistic star is one with the equation of state of a special relativistic gas. This can happen when the core of a massive main-sequence star becomes hot enough to generate electron-positron pairs. Stability analysis shows that such a star is only marginally bound, and is unstable to either collapse or explode. This instability is believed to limit the mass of main-sequence stars to a couple of hundred solar masses or so.

As an installment of the My Coach series, the game teaches Japanese through a series of lessons and games. It was released on October 14, 2008. ==Gameplay== According to Ubisoft, My Japanese Coach (MJC) will develop a player's Japanese knowledge by lessons which teach the player the correct ways to pronounce words in Japanese. Players can compare their pronunciation to that of native speakers using the Nintendo DS's microphone, as well as using the touch screen and stylus to allow players to trace and correctly practice writing Japanese characters. A digital character in the game, called Haruka, acts as your teacher for learning Japanese. There are various stages that you work your way through after having taken a small multiple choice, placement like test to see if you knew any Japanese prior to starting the game. If you miss two questions in a row on the placement test, the test ends.

It has shared the Wood Terrace ground with South Shields Cricket club to this day. The club was formed when Charlie Green and his friends, all aged 16 to 19, crossed the River Tyne on the Tyne ferry after winning a match against Tynemouth, a prominent local rugby club at the time. In 2005, South Shields Westoe RFC, to the interest of South Shields, had a notable Intermediate Cup run. In the semi-final, being the underdogs, they beat much fancied Staines for a passage to Twickenham the national stadium, taking many travelling fans. Unfortunately in the final the first team were beaten by giants Morley R.F.C. from Yorkshire.

The Carlton Theatre was wired for sound in 1929 and increasingly went over to being used as a full-time cinema. It was originally built and owned by Paramount Pictures and was operated by them until 1954 when it was leased to Twentieth Century Fox as their West End showcase for CinemaScope films. Fox continued to operate the Carlton until 1977 when they withdrew from cinema operations in London (they had also run the Rialto, Coventry Street). The cinema was taken over by Classic and the former stage area was sold for demolition and redevelopment. The auditorium was divided into three screens and reopened on 11 January 1979 as the Classic Haymarket.

From the 14th century the land was covered in extensive forest used for hunting, with a hunting lodge on Shipley Hill. From the 16th century, coal mining began to provide income for the owners.Derbyshire County Council leisure facilities Shipley Hall was built in 1700, and by 1722 coal mining was an important activity on the Shipley estate. The Hall became the property of the Miller- Mundy family who in around 1765 started running the mines themselves. The Nutbrook Canal opened in 1796 to serve the Shipley Colliery, and the income led to extensive development of the estate. The Hall was rebuilt in 1799 (the building in the above photo) to the design of William Linley of Doncaster,York through the Eyes of the Artist (York City Art Gallery) 199.) and the grounds were landscaped by William Emes, a follower of Capability Brown. ==19th century== Derby Lodge In the late 19th century, under Alfred Edward Miller Mundy, the colliery was becoming increasingly prosperous, especially with the opening of the Midland Railway. Miller Mundy was regarded as an excellent employer by the standards of the time, with a hands-on approach. Further developments were the building of a model dairy and farm, and the water tower to feed it, designed by W. E. Nesfield, a doubling of the size of the hall and the creation of a cricket ground. The Lodges and gates were designed by Sir Walter Tapper. In 1887 there was a scandal when Captain Miller Mundy's wife, Ellen, ran off with Charles Chetwynd-Talbot the 19-year-old Earl of Shrewsbury, and then left the country with her three brothers who had skipped bail. They were accused of drawing lots to decide who would kill the eldest brother and heir of Alfreton Hall if he did not sign over outstanding inheritances.\\"Strange British Crime\\", 29 January 1888, New York Times, accessed 30 May 2008 Captain Mundy was able to entertain King Edward VII at one of the lavish house parties prior to World War I.Bygone Derbyshire The History of Shipley Country Park - Miner's dial is a pointer... A cricket ground, created in 1899, is still functioning today, and as of 2018 is the home of Shipley Hall Cricket Club. ==20th century== Shipley Hall's foundations are marked out on Shipley Hill After Captain Miller Mundy died, the Hall was sold to the Shipley Colliery Company, which his family had founded, who took over complete control of the mines and the family moved out mainly because life at the Hall was seriously affected by the noise and pollution of the colliery. After the collieries were nationalised in 1948, the National Coal Board decided that the Hall was too damaged by subsidence to be worth keeping, and demolished it. The Woodside and Coppice coalpits, regarded as uneconomical, were closed in the 1960s,ending over 250 years of deep mining at Shipley. There was a residual legacy of spoil heaps, derelict buildings, polluted lakes and thirty abandoned mine shafts. ===Shipley Country Park=== In the late 1960s Derbyshire County Council decided to create a Country Park as a memorial to mining in the area. The National Coal Board reclaimed land near the closed collieries by opencast methods between 1970 and 1974. Two years were spent contouring the site, planting trees, seeding fields and meadows, and building facilities for the public: Shipley Country Park opened to the public on 26 May 1976.Derbyshire County Council leisure facilities In the 1980s the County Council controversially agreed to the use of part of the park and a lake to form a theme park, initially as Britannia Park. That business closed soon after and the park re-opened as The American Adventure. The last incarnation of this park closed in 2007 and has been partly demolished. The future of this area of the Shipley Country Park, which contains the site of the former Woodside Colliery, is still uncertain. Shipley Country Park includes a visitor centre, children's play areas, a wildlife garden, wildlife and nature walks, a cafe, disabled access, bridleways, geocaching, cycling, fishing, jogging, a Parkrun, bird watching, photography, picnicking, dog walking, a cricket club and wayfaring. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1700 Category:Houses completed in 1799 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1943 Category:Country houses in Derbyshire Category:Tourist attractions in Derbyshire Category:Former country houses in the United Kingdom Category:British country houses destroyed in the 20th century Category:1700 establishments in England ","title":"Shipley Hall"},{"id":"19319328","text":"Kaixin001 () is a social networking website launched in March 2008.http://www.fiercemobilecontent.com/story/ericsson-partners- kaixin001-mobile-social-apps/2009-10-19# https://venturebeat.com/2010/04/07/china‚Äôs-top-4-social-networks-renren- kaixin001-qzone-and-51-com/ In 2015, Kaixin001 ranks as the 743rd most popular website in China and 7,277 overall according to Alexa Internet.

He served as a member of the Knesset for Yisrael Beiteinu between 2006 and 2015, and also held the posts of Minister of Tourism and Minister of Public Security. He is currently Chairman of IMI Systems. ==Biography== Yitzhak Aharonivich was born in Jerusalem to Holocaust survivors from Kaunas. He grew up in moshav Dishon and studied at a yeshiva in Safed. In 1968, he began his mandatory military service in the Israel Defense Forces, and served as a deputy company commander and instructor at a training base. He later studied history at the University of Haifa and graduated with a BA. In 1972, he joined the Israel Border Police, and during the 1973 Yom Kippur War he was stationed on the border with Lebanon. Aharonovich lives in Even Yehuda with his family. ==Military and police career== In the 1980s he headed the northern command of the Israel Border Police, and led rescue operations during the two Tyre catastrophes. He continued to rise through the ranks, and in 1993 he was promoted to Major General and appointed commander of the Border Police. He later served as a representative of the Israel Police in the Americas for two years. In 1998 was appointed head of police in the West Bank, and became head of the Southern District police in 2001. From 2002 to 2004 he was deputy police commissioner. In 2004, he left the police, and served as director- general of the Dan Bus Company from 2004 to 2005. ==Political career== In 2006 he was elected to the Knesset on Yisrael Beiteinu's list. In March 2007, he was appointed Minister of Tourism, but his tenure ended in January 2008 when the party left Ehud Olmert's coalition government. He retained his seat in the 2009 elections, for which he was placed fourth on the party's list. Upon the formation of the Netanyahu government on 31 March 2009, he was appointed Minister of Public Security. On 16 June 2009, Aharonovich attracted controversy over a comment he made during a meeting with an undercover police detective in Tel Aviv's Central Bus Station. After the detective apologized for being untidy while meeting Aharonovich, Aharonovich replied that he looked as dirty as an \\"Araboosh\\" a Hebrew slur roughly translating as \\"dirty Arab\\".

It lives in the tropical waters of the Indo- west Pacific. ==Description== The orange band surgeonfish is a deep-bodied, laterally-compressed oval fish, rather over twice as long as it is deep, with a maximum length of , although a more typical length is . Both dorsal and anal fins are long and low, extending as far as the caudal peduncle. The dorsal fin has nine spines and 23 to 25 soft rays while the anal fin has three spines and 22 to 24 soft rays. The tail fin is crescent-shaped, the points growing longer as the fish gets older. The adult fish is greyish-brown; a sharp vertical line usually separates the paler front half of the fish from the darker hind portion. There is a distinctive orange bar, surrounded by a purplish-black margin, immediately behind the top of the gill cover, and blue and orange lines at the bases of the fins. Like all surgeonfish, this species has a pair of scalpel-like scales that project upward from the caudal peduncle. Larger males develop a convex snout which clearly differentiates them from females. Juvenile fish are yellow. ==Distribution and habitat== This fish is found in the tropical eastern Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from Christmas Island and the Cocos Keeling Islands to southern Japan, Western, Northern and Eastern Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Hawaii. It is associated with reefs, often on outer slopes and in more exposed locations. As an adult, it is a solitary fish or sometimes joins schools, with a depth range of between about , but juveniles are found in shallower water in sheltered locations in small groups. ==Ecology== The orange band surgeonfish feeds on detritus and on algae growing on the seabed, as well as the film of diatoms and filamentous algae that grows on sand and other substrates. It often forms schools with parrotfish, tangs and other species of surgeonfish, which all have similar diets; their grazing is important in maintaining biodiversity by keeping rocks free from excessive growth of algae so that coral larvae can find suitable habitat to settle. The fish can change colour from dark to pale almost instantaneously. ==Status== The orange band surgeonfish has a wide distribution in the tropical Indo-Pacific region and is moderately common. It is sometimes found in fish markets and in the aquarium trade but is not a species targeted by fisheries. No particular threats have been recognised, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed its conservation status as being of least concern. ==References * Orangespot Tang care sheet at FishGeeks * Encyclopedia of Life: Acanthurus olivaceus (Orange Shoulder Tang) * Category:Acanthurus Category:Fish of Hawaii Category:Fish described in 1801 ","title":"Acanthurus olivaceus"},{"id":"19319421","text":"Gua may refer to: == Biology == * GUA, a codon in the genetic code * Gua or Guanine, a nucleobase found in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA == Telecommunications == * GUA, Global Unicast Address == Languages == * Gua language, a Guang language of coastal Ghana * ISO 639:gua, the Shiki language of northern Nigeria == Music == * Gua, a 2004 album by Emmanuel Jal * \\"Gu√°\\", a track on the 1975 album J√≥ia by Caetano Veloso *\\"Gua Time\\", hit song by the 80's boy band Mancha Manchew == People == * Gua Ah-leh (born 1944), Chinese actress and singer * Alan Gua, a mythical figure from The Secret History of the Mongols * Ali Gua Gua, former member of Argentine band Kumbia Queers == Places == * G√∫a, a parish in Somiedo, Asturias, Spain * Gu√†, a commune in Alessandria, Piedmont, Italy * Gua, Jharkhand, a census town in India * Gua (Tanzanian ward), a ward in Chunya District, Tanzania * GUA, IOC and UNDP country codes for Guatemala * GUA, station code for Guadalupe station, in Santa Barbara County, California, United States * MX-GUA, the ISO 3166-2 code for the Mexican state of Guanajuato *Gua, a pub in Manchester known for its \\"special Gua evenings\\" * GUA, IATA code for La Aurora International Airport, serving Guatemala City * GUA, station code for Guaianases on Line 11 (Coral) in S√£o Paulo, Brazil * Gua, a subdistrict of Lipis District in Pahang, Malaysia * Le Gua (disambiguation), the name of two different communes in France == Other uses == * Gua (chimpanzee) (1930‚Äì1933), a chimpanzee raised as though she were a human child * Gua, an alien race in the Canadian TV series First Wave ==See also== * Guas, a surname (including a list of people with the name) * Gau Island, an island in Fiji * GWA (disambiguation) * Le Gua (disambiguation) * Guha (disambiguation) * ","title":"Gua"},{"id":"19319433","text":"Pedro Reginaldo Lira, (September 7, 1915 - December 11, 2012) was an Argentine Bishop of the Roman Catholic Church. ==Biography== Lira was born in Salta, Argentina in 1915 and was ordained a bishop on September 21, 1938.

The 1st, 3rd, and 4th Ranger Battalions, the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion, and several other units were molded into a temporary regiment given the name \\"6615th Ranger Force.\\" Colonel William Orlando Darby, the former commanding officer (CO) of the famous 1st Ranger Battalion, became the regimental commanding officer.

It suffered very few casualties and moved into the city itself. After the U.S. VI Corps occupied Anzio, the corps commander, Major General John P. Lucas and the 3rd Division commander, Major General Lucian Truscott, met with Colonel Darby and decided to have the Rangers sneak behind the German lines and capture the town of Cisterna. The corps and division intelligence officers thought that there was a gap in the German lines. However, the German commanders, Field Marshal Albert von Kesselring and General Eberhard von Mackensen suspected an American attack in the vicinity of Cisterna and sent a large force of crack troops, armored units, and artillery to cut off the Rangers. On the night of January 30, 1944, the 1st and 3rd Ranger battalions made their way behind enemy lines and killed the German sentries in Cisterna. Suddenly, concealed German artillery and armor opened fire on the Americans. One of the first shells killed Major Miller, the 3rd Battalion commander. Major Dobson, the 1st Battalion C.O., took command of the two battalions. The Rangers took cover and started firing, but rifles were no match for the heavy German equipment. All of the Rangers fought bravely, killing a good number of Germans, but they suffered many more killed and wounded. Major Dobson was among the wounded. When Colonel Darby, Colonel Dammer, and the other staff officers in the 6615th Regimental Headquarters found out about the plight of the 1st and 3rd battalions, Lt. Colonel Murray's 4th Battalion, with armored and infantry support, fought a bitter, bloody battle with the Germans to try to save the surrounded Rangers of the 1st and 3rd. Many Germans were killed in the two-day battle that followed. However, the relief force was stalled too long to be of much help to their fellow Rangers. Out of the 767 Rangers who made it into Cisterna, only 6 made it out. The rest were either killed or captured. == After Cisterna == Cisterna marked the end of the 6615th as a complete regiment. The 4th Battalion was attached to the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment and then to the 1st Special Service Force. Colonels Darby and Dammer were given different assignments. Darby eventually became assistant division commander of the 10th Mountain Division and was killed by an artillery shell while he was riding in a jeep in northern Italy. After the Battle of Cisterna, the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion bore the brunt of a German counterattack. One of its companies was overrun, but the other companies fought valiantly and, with reinforcements from other regiments and divisions, was able to repulse the attack and took part in a parachute landing in Southern France.

Among the achievements are the creation of regional commercial utilities for urban areas to replace fragmented service provision by local governments; the establishment of a regulatory agency that has substantially improved the availability of information on service provision in urban areas; the establishment of a devolution trust fund to focus donor support on poor peri-urban areas; and an increase in the access to water supply in rural areas. Among the challenges are a low rate of cost recovery despite tariff increases in urban areas; limited capacity in the sector; insufficient progress in increasing access to sanitation; a high level of non-revenue water (44% as of 2010) in urban areas; a high rate of non-functioning rural water systems; and insufficient investment levels despite substantial foreign aid. == Access == Sub-Saharan countries, from 1990 until 2008. In 2015, 61% of the total population had access to an \\"at least basic water service\\", or 86% of the urban population and 44% of the rural population. WASHwatch However, around 6 million people in Zambia still lack access to \\"at least basic water\\". As for sanitation, in 2015, 31% of the total population had access to \\"at least basic sanitation\\" service. 49% of the urban population had access to basic sanitation and 19% of the rural population. There are still around 11 million people who lack access to at least basic sanitation. Moreover, in 2015, 15% of the population in Zambia, defecated in the open.WHO/UNICEF (2015) Progress on sanitation and drinking water - 2015 update and MDG assessment, Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation In earlier years (2010), the figures were as follows: 61% of the population of Zambia had access to an improved source of water supply and 48% had access to adequate sanitation, according to UN data calculated on the basis of national surveys, including most recently the Demographic and Health Survey of 2007. Concerning water supply, there is a stark contrast between urban areas (87% access according to the UN, 78% access according to the regulator in 2010) and rural areas (46% access according to the UN). For sanitation, access rates in 2010 were only slightly higher for urban areas (57% according to national surveys, 54% according to the regulator in 2010) and rural areas (43% according to the UN). In urban areas, 41% have access to water connections in their house or yard and 49% rely on water kiosks and standpipes. The share of those with access to house connections has actually declined, while the share of those served by kiosks has increased. According to National Water and Sanitation Council director Kelvin Chitumbo, Zambia has achieved the Millennium Development Goal for drinking water, but is off track to reach the goal for sanitation. Water kiosks, which were first introduced in Zambia in 2005, are operated by private individuals who have signed an agreement with water utilities and municipalities. The kiosk operators buy piped water in bulk and sell it at a slightly higher regulated price of about 1 US Cent per 20 litres to users who carry the water in jerry cans to their homes. The kiosk operators supplement their income by selling various other items of daily life. There were about 170 water kiosks in Zambia in 2008, providing water to 200,000 people. Another 100 kiosks were expected to be added in 2009.KfW:Zambia - Successful Water Kiosks, accessed on May 21, 2011DEG and kfw Entwicklungsbank:Wasser -elementar f√ºr Entwicklung. Jahresbreicht √ºber die Zusammenarbeit mit Entwicklungsl√§ndern 2008:Erfolgreiches Modell.Wasserkioske erleichtern den Alltag in Sambias Armenvierteln, p. 22, accessed on October 14, 2009 Concerning sanitation, 29% of the urban population are connected to sewers and 30% are served by septic tanks or improved household-level latrines. While these figures are low, they are actually higher than the average access in Sub-Saharan Africa. Lack of access to water and sanitation has significant negative social impacts, in particular on girls and women who are often in charge of collecting water for their villages and homes ‚Äì sometimes walking extremely long distances to do so. After that girls are too tired to come back home and concentrate on education. == Service quality == Drinking water quality. According to the regulatory agency, 94% of water samples collected in urban areas were in compliance with drinking water standards in 2010. Pollution from mines affects drinking water supply quality provided by the Mulonga and Nkana water and sewerage companies, where in some cases, the concentration of manganese was beyond treatable limits. Continuity. Water supply in urban areas is intermittent, with an average supply of 16 hours per day in 2010. The highest intermittency has been measured in the small Luapula Utility with 6 hours per day. The only utility providing continuous supply in 2007 was in Chipata, while in 2010 the only utility that provided near continuous supply was the Northwestern Water and Sewerage Company. Wastewater treatment. Wastewater treatment plants regularly do not achieve effluent standards. Capacities of plants like the Manchinchi in Lusaka and the Kanini in Ndola have been out-grown by the population. Stabilization ponds such as in Kaunda Square in Lusaka and Livingstone City are in a deplorable state and pose a serious environmental hazard. == Water resources == The Zambezi River, shown here at the Victoria Falls, is rich in water. However, most Zambians live too far from the river to benefit from it, so that water is often scarce during the dry season. Unlike many other countries in the region Zambia has more than adequate water resources, although during the dry season water resources may be scarce, especially in the southern part of the country. The annual rainfall averages between 1400 mm in the north and gradually declines to 700 mm in the south. The country is rich in rivers, such as the transboundary Zambezi and lakes Tanganyika, Mweru and Kariba. It is estimated that only 1.5% of the annual renewable water resources are being used at present. There are significant regional differences across the country with regard to place and time when water is available. Also groundwater availability is unevenly distributed.Zambia Water Sector Challenges for Integrated Water Resources Management in Zambia, by Peter Sievers, Programme Coordinator, Water Sector Coordination Unit, Royal Danish Embassy, Zambia, January 2006, p. 3 == Responsibility for water supply and sanitation == Responsibilities in the sector are clearly separated between the Ministry of Local Government and Housing (policy), National Water Supply and Sanitation Council (economic regulation) and local government as well as commercial utilities owned by local government (service provision in urban areas). === Policy === The Ministry of Local Government and Housing is in charge of sector policies. Within the Ministry the Department of Housing and infrastructure development (DHID) is responsible for water supply and sanitation infrastructure planning and resource mobilization. The DHID has established a specific Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Unit (RWSSU) in 2003 and shortly thereafter also a unit for peri-urban water supply and sanitation. According to the 1994 National Water Policy seven principles govern the state's policy in water and sanitation * Separation of water resources management from water supply and sanitation * Separation of regulatory and executive functions * Devolution of authority to local authorities and private enterprises * Achievement of full cost recovery for the water supply and sanitation services in the longrun * Human resources development leading to more effective institutions. * The use of technologies more appropriate to local conditions * Increased budget spending to the sector By 2008 at least the first three principles had been put into practice. However, full cost recovery was far from being achieved and budget spending remained far below what is needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals for the sector. In 2010 the national water policy was revised in order to take into account \\"current international developments\\", to integrate cross-cutting issues such as gender, HIV/AIDS and climate change, and to introduce modern principles of water resources management. === Regulation and Training === A woman carrying water in Chipata. Economic regulation of water supply and sanitation services is the task of the National Water Supply and Sanitation Council (NWASCO). It oversees tariff adjustments, minimum service levels, financial projection and investment planning and corporate governance. NWASCO has made \\"significant progress in benchmarking, reporting and engaging users\\" despite being \\"underfunded and understaffed\\". However, its effectiveness remains limited, among others because \\"the mechanisms for enforcing regulatory rules remain unclear\\".Hulya Dagdeviren and Simon A. Robertson:Policy Research Brief: Reforming without Resourcing: The Case of Urban Water Supply in Zambia, International Poverty Center, September 2008 NWASCO's is supported by water watch groups and part- time inspectors who monitor the quality of service on the ground. Water watch groups exist in 10 cities. They consist of volunteers who educate users about their rights and obligations, and assist users to resolve complaints. This has apparently reduced petty corruption and meter manipulation. According to research, while it is common in Zambia to pay bribes for a connection to the electricity grid, this type of bribe is almost absent for water connections.Water Integrity Network:Corruption risks and integrity in urban water supply and sanitation, WIN brief No. 4, 2011, Box 1:Participation in Action - Water Watch Groups in Zambia, quoting research by F. Boehm:\\"Is there an anti-corruption agenda in regulation? Insights from Colombian and Zambian Water Regulation\\" (2011) In 2010 the regulator dissolved water watch groups in Chingola, Kabwe and Lusaka \\"for non-performance\\", but all three were re- established a few months later. According to the German Technical Cooperation, NWASCO is so successful that it \\"can serve as a role model for other countries in the region\\". NWASCO reports to the Ministry of Energy and Water Development, not to the Ministry of Local Government and Housing that is in charge of sector policy.GTZ:Water and sanitation sector reforms in Africa, 2008 p. 22-23 The Water and Sanitation Association of Zambia (WASAZA), created in 1999, provides training, promotes the exchange of experiences on good practices and aims at increasing public awareness. It has more than 300 corporate and individual members. === Service provision === There are three forms of service provision in urban areas in Zambia: Commercial Utilities, Local Authorities and Private Schemes. In 2011 there were eleven commercial utilities, each covering between 3 and 17 municipalities. They are owned by the local authorities and provide water services to more than 86% of the urban population with access to improved water supply. The size of the utilities ranges from 3,000 to more than 75,000 connections. The capacity of the utilities differs considerably. In 2010 the Southern utility with its seat in Choma was ranked first and the Chambeshi utility in the Northeast was ranked last. The utilities have formed the Commercial Utility Association of Zambia (CUZA). A few local authorities still run their own water supply system, but they consider creating their own regional commercial utilities or to join existing ones. The 6 private schemes that are run by commercial entities whose core business is not water supply that supply water to their employees for free. These include the Konkola Copper Mines, the Nakambala Sugar Estate and the Chilanga Cement Factory, among others. In rural areas district councils are in charge of water supply with the assistance of provincial support teams. == History and recent developments Infrastructure boom (1964-1973)=== Much of Zambia's drinking water infrastructure was built between independence in 1964 and the mid-1970s at a time when economic growth was strong and export earnings from copper mining were high. Water was provided for free and little attention was given to the sustainability of services. Water supply was the responsibility of local authorities, with the exception of the mining belt where the state-owned copper company operated water systems for the settlements housing their employees. Following the example of other countries in the region during the 1970s and 1980s, such as neighboring Congo, Zambia considered the establishment of a National Water Authority with responsibility for water supply, sanitation and water resources management. However, those who preferred decentralized service provision prevailed and the proposal was shelved. There was no national strategy for the sector, and the responsibility for the sector was fragmented among several Ministries. Meanwhile, the infrastructure deteriorated: Handpumps in rural areas broken down, and urban systems provided water without disinfection on an intermittent basis. The few who had access to continuous water supply received it for free and wasted it, with consumption levels of 200 liter per capita per day, higher than in most European cities. There were 35 sewer systems in the country, but only nine had functioning wastewater treatment plants. ===Establishment of Commercial Utilities and a Regulator (1988-2000)=== The foundation for reforms was initially laid at the local level when the city of Lusaka created the country's first Commercial Utility (CU) in 1989. The utility charged water tariffs and was a legally and financially autonomous public entity to be operated based on commercial principles. A year earlier, a first study laying out options for the future institutional structure of the sector had been undertaken. But the reform process only gathered steam in 1991 when the first democratic multi-party elections were held. The government of Frederick Chiluba (1991‚Äì2002) initiated liberal economic reforms. At this time the current sector structure, consisting of regional commercial utilities and a national regulatory agency, gradually evolved. A Process of \\"tariff rationalization\\" began and significant tariff increases were implemented between 1992 and 1994, albeit starting from an extremely low level. In 1992 the second commercial utility was established in Chipata. In 1994 the new National Water Policy (see above) was approved by Cabinet and in 1997 the Water Supply and Sanitation Act was passed. It created the regulatory agency (NWASCO) and a Devolution Trust Fund (DTF) as a financing vehicle for low- income, peri-urban areas. In 2000 NWASCO became operational. Tariffs were once again increased substantially, and six new commercial utilities were created. Unlike the first two utilities, the new utilities were regional utilities grouping together the physical assets and personnel of several local authorities, usually in a single province. At that time a few local authorities had begun to make money from selling water, while neglecting the maintenance of the infrastructure. They were initially reluctant to lose this source of income, because in a commercial utility all revenues were to be used to maintain the assets, to improve service quality and extend access. Also, the tariff level within a commercial utility would be the same, which meant that in some localities tariffs would have to increase. ===Introduction of water kiosks (2004 onwards)=== Water kiosks in Chipata. When Levy Mwanawasa was elected President in 2002, the sector policies shaped under his predecessor basically remained in place. In 2004 the DTF became operational and two pilot projects in peri-urban areas were initiated in the Itimpi area in Kitwe and the Maiteneke area in Chingola with a total of 11 kiosks supplying 16,000 people. Both areas already had a piped water infrastructure. But it was so deteriorated that it provided no more water at all or so infrequently, so that the residents had reverted to the use of water from other sources including contaminated rivers. Some of those who received piped water got it through illegal connections. Those who had a legal the connection and got water did not pay for it. Water was resold from unmetered connections to neighbors. The commercial utilities paid to operate the system, but did not get any revenues. They were ready to give up the piped water systems in the peri-urban areas, and the residents had given up the hope that the authorities would provide proper piped services. There were also a few standpipes in the areas that provided water for free, but not on a regular basis. At the water kiosks the utility sold water in bulk to private operators who resold the water in buckets at a small profit. Under that system all bills to the utility were paid, while before 75% of bills were not paid. Illegal connections disappeared and leakage was reduced, because the length of the pipes was reduced. The pilots were considered successful by the utilities and the residents, and the system was thus scaled up to other areas and cities nationwide. ===Privatization and its aftermath in the Copper Belt (2001-2008)=== During indicents of water contamination, people sometimes revert to the use of shallow wells such as this one. In 2001, after the privatization of the state-owned mining company ZCCM, the responsibility for water supply and sanitation in the mining towns was entrusted to the private French water company SAUR under a management contract supported by the World Bank. However, this remained the only case of private sector participation in the Zambian water sector. A World Bank-supported study by Severn Trent conducted in 2002 recommended that a lease contract should be signed for Lusaka, but the government did not accept the recommendation. In 2005 the management contract in the copper mining area was terminated on the grounds that the privatized management did not perform better than publicly owned utilities. After a transition period of three years, service provision was entrusted to the three commercial utilities in the area. However, contamination of drinking water in the copper areas makes headlines. A similar contamination incident occurs in Chingola in 2006. During a second incident in January 2008, at least 13 people in Mufulira in northern Zambia were admitted to hospital after drinking water alleged to have been contaminated by the nearby Mopani Copper Mines. Residents were afraid to drink tap water and collected water from shallow wells or nearby streams.BBC:Zambia in water pollution scare, 3 January 2008 ===Recent developments (2010 onwards)=== In 2010 the National Water Policy was revised, but it maintained the same basic thrust concerning water supply and sanitation. In 2011 Parliament passed a new water resources management law. In September 2011 Michel Stata became President, who continued to pursue the established policies in the water sector. == Financial aspects and efficiency  Tariffs and cost recovery === Tariff structure. Urban tariffs for unmetered domestic users are set according to the category of housing (low, medium and high costs) for purposes of cross-subsidization. For metered users an increasing-block tariff is applied. The regulator NWASCO is financed through a 1-2% surcharge on water tariffs. Tariff increases and approval procedures. Tariffs were increased substantially between 1992 and 2006, between twofold and eightfold in real terms. The highest increase (+881% in these 14 years) was for the highest tranche for metered consumption in Lusaka, while the lowest increase (+61%) was for unmetered mid-cost housing in the Southern Province. The average collection efficiency in 2010 was 84%, indicating that 16% of users did not pay their bills. Tariff increases have to be approved by NWASCO based on tariff adjustment guidelines published, in their second and improved version, in 2005. Proposals for tariff increases can be submitted in advance for a period of up to six years. The approval process includes ten steps, including a public hearing with consumer representatives and an analysis of service quality and costs. The regulator can exclude costs from the proposal if it considers them unjustified, but otherwise the regulator mostly has to follow specific calculations that are specified in the guidelines. On the one hand, if the utility has not met previously agreed targets for the share of metered customers, water quality and service continuity the approved tariff will be lower than if the targets are met. On the other hand, if special efforts have been made to improve access, performance or efficiency, higher tariffs will be approved. Sanitation tariffs are usually 30 percent of water tariffs. In contrast to the detailed procedures for the approval of water tariffs, sanitation tariffs are set as a share of water tariffs without taking into account the performance of the sanitation services. Cost recovery. Financial viability in the urban areas has improved with six of the nine licensed commercial utilities operating in Zambia reaching operational cost coverage by the end of 2006. In 2010 the average operational cost recovery was 105%, varying from 46% to 130% in Mulonga. According to one study, higher levels of cost recovery are impeded by a high level of non-revenue water (44% in 2010) and low collection efficiency due to a large extent to the non-payment of water bills by public institutions. Cost recovery is almost nonexistent in rural areas where most communities do not pay anything. Affordability. The share of household expenditures for water among the poor varied from 2.5% to 9.9% in 2002‚Äì03. More than 60% of poor households paid more than 3% of their expenditures on water.Hulya Dagdeviren:Waiting for Miracles: The Commercialization of Urban Water Services in Zambia, Development and Change, Volume 39, Issue 1, Pages 101 - 121, 2008 === Investments and Financing === Actual investment. In 2002 total investments in water and sanitation were estimated at US$33.5 million, including US$33 million by donors and NGOs (98%) and US$0.5 million (2%) by the government using its own resources. Government capital expenditures had been budgeted at US$6.1 million for 2002, but only 9% of that amount was actually invested. Investment needs. The Water Supply and Sanitation Development Group prepared a medium-term development strategy to implement during 1994‚Äì2003. Their estimations suggested that the government had to invest between US$407 million (under a low-cost investment strategy) and US$1,553 million (under medium-cost investment strategy) every year during this period in order to rehabilitate the existing system and expand the network to avoid any reduction in access rates, i.e. without increasing access rates. Actual investments were only a small fraction (8% of the low-cost scenario) of investment needs. The investments required for rural areas were estimated at US$260 million in the National Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Programme (2006‚Äì2015). Financing. As pointed out above, 98% of investments in the sector are financed by donors and NGOs. The government has established a Devolution Trust Fund (DTF) to provide financing to increase access in poor urban areas through the use of low-cost technologies. The DTF financed water kiosks that provided access to clean water to 120,000 people at a cost of 643,455 Euro until 2006. The DTF assigns its funds based on proposals received from water utilities. === Efficiency === The average level of non-revenue water in the commercial utilities operating in urban areas was estimated at about 44% in 2010, varying among utilities between 34% for the Northwest and 67% in Luapula. Staff per 1,000 connections varies between 7 and 17, thus indicating significant overstaffing, since national targets are less than 5 or 9 staff per 1,000 connections depending on the size of the utility. Utility performance has constantly increased since NWASCO began its benchmarking exercise. == External cooperation == A large array of external public donors support the water and sanitation sector in Zambia. Donors coordinate their activities on the basis of a Joint Assistance Strategy covering all sectors and a Sector Advisory Group for the water sector. One donor has the function of speaker of the sector advisory group on a yearly rotating basis. There are also coordination groups for the three sub-sectors urban water supply and sanitation, rural water supply and sanitation as well as water resources management. Donors increasingly use basket funding, based on a basket for rural water supply and sanitation and a second basket for urban water supply and sanitation. Many NGOs, such as CARE and WaterAid, also support the sector. The activities of the main public donors are listed below in alphabetical order. === African Development Bank === In the Central Province the African Development Bank has been supporting the seven local authorities in institutional reforms and infrastructure rehabilitation under a project approved in 2003. In Nkana it supports water supply and sanitation under a project approved in 2008. Furthermore, a national rural water supply and sanitation program has been approved in 2006.African Development Bank:Zambia Water and Sanitation Portfolio, retrieved on August 28, 2011 === Denmark === Since 2004 DANIDA supports the Mulonga, Kafubu and Western Water and Sewerage companies. In 2006 it approved a EUR 32.8 million five‚Äìyear (2006‚Äì2010) Water Sector Support Program, which includes water supply and sanitation in rural and peri-urban areas, as well as integrated water resources management.IRC:Zambia:Denmark commits EUR 33 million to 5-year water programme, accessed on September 30, 2009 Denmark will end its support for the Zambian water sector in 2013. ===European Union=== Both the European Commission, which provides grants, and the European Investment Bank, which provides loans, are active in the sector. In 2012, a US$75 million loan from the EIB to the three commercial utilities in the Copperbelt was under appraisal. === Germany === Germany supports the water and sanitation sector in Zambia through financial cooperation carried out by KfW Development Bank and German Technical Cooperation carried out by GIZ. German aid has been particularly involved in expanding services to the urban poor through water kiosks, supported via the Devolution Trust Fund (DTF). A more recent pilot project for the construction of latrines is also being supported by Germany through the DTF.GTZ:Zambia: Violet‚Äôs Water Kiosk No. 7, accessed on September 30, 2009 GIZ has been active in strengthening the regulatory agency NWASCO, in setting up a sector information system, and in strengthening NWASCO's planning capabilities.GTZ:Reform of the water sector In the Eastern Province, which currently has only a single commercial utility in Chipata, the German government assists its partners in commercializing the service delivery in small towns outside of Chipata. Through the support of KfW 520 wells have been built or rehabilitated in eight Districts of the Eastern Provinces. Sanitation facilities have been built at schools and health posts, and measures to promote appropriate hygiene behavior have been supported. The Southern and North-Western commercial utilities have also benefited from German support. In all three commercial utilities training is carried out covering administration, institutional development, electrical engineering and water production/distribution.Deutscher Entwicklungsdienst:The DED in Zambia:Water and Sanitation, accessed on October 12, 2009 Concerning rural water supply, German aid is engaged in the Northwestern Province. The Project is working with the Councils of Kasempa, Kabompo and Mufumbwe District to reach out to a population of about 2.5 million people beginning in 2004 through the construction of boreholes and hand-dug wells. The project emphasizes the participation of the population in the communities, especially of women. Health education including malaria and HIV/AIDS are also part of the project. === Ireland === Ireland supports the Chambeshi commercial utility. === Japan === JICA provides grants for investments in groundwater development in Luapula Province (2008‚Äì2010), technical cooperation for the sustainable operation and maintenance of rural water supply (2007‚Äì2010) and capacity building for commercial utilities (2007‚Äì2009).JICA:Outline of Activities:Health and Water, accessed on September 30, 2009 === UNICEF === UNICEF supports water supply projects in cooperation with the Maureen Mwanawasa Community Initiative, the wife of the late President Mwanawasa.UNICEF:First Lady of Zambia: Clean water gets girls into school, 7 February 2005 UNICEF's activities in the Zambian water sector are supported by UKAid. ===United States=== The United States, through the Millennium Challenge Corporation, provides a $355 million grant for water supply and sanitation in Lusaka approved in March 2012.

He was the uncle of Pritzker Prize-winning architect J√∏rn Utzon. ==Career== Einar Utzon-Frank was born in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen in 1888, the son of Jens Christian Frank and Anna Cathrine Utzon. Utzon-Frank began his artistic life as a painter but changed direction to become a sculptor. He was admitted to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1906, where he became a close friend of the somewhat older Kai Nielsen. However, the two friends followed diverging paths through their creative careers, with Nielsen following a lush modernism in contrast to Utzon-Frank's clear, cool classical style which follows the tradition of Bertel Thorvaldsen. From 1912 to 1913 Utzen-Frank travelled around Europe, visiting Berlin, Dresden, Munich, Florence, Rome, Naples, Paestum, Paris and later Italy, Greece and England, and many of the classical influences from his travels are evident in his work. At the end of the 1930s he was commissioned to recast the Equestrian statue of Christian V ‚Äî originally erected between 1687 and 1688 on Kongens Nytorv and made from gilded lead by Abraham-C√©sar Lamoureux ‚Äî in bronze, which he did between 1939 and 1942. His work was part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. ==Academia== In 1918 at the age of 30, Utzon-Frank was appointed a professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen, a post in which he remained until 1955. In his teaching, he laid emphasis on solid craftsmanship skills. He was a teacher and educator of great importance and came to dominate several generations of sculptors, including Henry Heerup, Sigrid L√ºtken, Janus Kamban, Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen, Gestur √ûorgr√≠msson and Douglas Robertson Bisset. ==Private life== Utzon-Frank married Gerda Harriet Margrete Christensen on 4 December 1908. Their daughter Grete Utzon Frank was born on 8 February 1909 in Copenhagen, and she married painter and author William Flemming Bergs√∏e on 21 March 1930. ==Works== His best-known works include: * Kn√¶lende Aphrodite (1916) * Atalante (1919), depicting the woman Atalanta from Greek mythology.

Doha is also a specific poetic form. Various forms of these songs exist, including caryagiti (), or 'performance songs' and vajragiti (Sanskrit: vajragƒ´ti, Tibetan: rDo- rje gan-sung ), or 'diamond songs', sometimes translated as vajra songs and doha (Sanskrit: dohƒÅ, ‡§¶‡•ã‡§π, 'that which results from milking the cow'), also called doha songs, distinguishing them from the unsung Indian poetry form of the doha. According to Roger Jackson, caryagiti and vajragiti \\"differ generically from dohƒÅs because of their different context and function\\"; the doha being primarily spiritual aphorisms expressed in the form of rhyming couplets whilst caryagiti are stand-alone performance songs and vajragiti are songs that can only be understood in the context of a ganachakra or tantric feast. Many collections of songs of realization are preserved in the Tibetan Buddhist canon, however many of these texts have yet to be translated from the Tibetan language. Although many of the songs of realization date from the mahasiddha of India, the tradition of composing mystical songs continued to be practiced by tantric adepts in later times and examples of spontaneously composed verses by Tibetan lamas exist up to the present day, an example being Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche. The most famous Tibetan composer of songs of realization is Milarepa, the 11th century Tibetan yogi whose mgur bum, or 'The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa' remains a source of instruction and inspiration for Tibetan Buddhists, particularly those of the kagyu school. ==Caryagiti songs== A renowned collection of Buddhist caryagiti, or mystical songs, is the Charyapada, a palm-leaf manuscript of the 8th-12th century text having been found in the early 20th century in Nepal. Another copy of the Charyapada was preserved in the Tibetan Buddhist canon. Miranda Shaw describes how caryagiti were an element of the ritual gathering of practitioners in a tantric feast: > The feast culminates in the performance of tantric dances and music that > must never be disclosed to outsiders. The revelers may also improvise \\"songs > of realization\\" (caryagiti) to express their heightened clarity and blissful > raptures in spontaneous verse. ==Doha songs== Ann Waldman describes this poetry form: > the doha, a song of realization that acknowledges an encounter with a master > teacher, traditionally a guru or lama, and explores a particular wisdom or > teaching transmitted through a kind of call-and-response duet format. An example of a Doha song available in English translation, is by Rangjung Dorje (1284‚Äì1339). The Doha song is entitled Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom (Wylie: rnam shes ye shes ‚Äòbyed pa).Rangjung Dorje (root text); Venerable Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche (commentary); Peter Roberts (translator) (2001).

It took place at the Silverstone Circuit, Great Britain, on 14 September 2008. The race was attended by a record crowd of 53,000 spectators. Although Audi scored their first and only win of the season, an accident involving the then championship-leading Peugeots allowed Audi to win the Teams, Constructors, and Drivers Championships in the LMP1 category. Luc Alphand's team won the GT1 championship by merely finishing the event, and Virgo Motorsports and driver Rob Bell secured their second consecutive GT2 championship with a class victory. This was the first time in Le Mans Series history that none of the Peugeot 908s finished in the podium spots as well as in the top eight points positions (#8 finished 19th overall and 11th in LMP1; #7 did not finish at 44th overall and 15th (last) in class), which helped Audi to take the championship. The only other time that the Peugeot 908 did not finish in the podium was in the 12 Hours of Sebring earlier this year, when the lone 908 finished 11th overall and almost finished in the podium at 4th behind the two Audis and an Intersport Lola-AER. ==Race results== Class winners in bold.

He studied economics at The University of Oxford in 1912, and was also well known for his athletic prowess, playing ice hockey while there.Franks et al 2001, pp. 60‚Äì62. He returned home to Germany to enlist as a leutnant (lieutenant) in the 7th (Magdeburg) Cuirassiers \\"von Seydlitz\\" Regiment in 1913 as a one-year volunteer. At the start of World War I his regiment served on the Western Front, fighting in Belgium and the First Battle of the Marne. It was then transferred to the Eastern Front; Bolle seeing action in Poland and in Courland in Latvia.Franks, VanWyngarden 2003, pp. 74‚Äì75. By the end of 1915, Bolle had won an award for bravery, the Iron Cross, Second Class and transferred to the Luftstreitkr√§fte. ==Aerial service in World War I== He undertook his initial training at Johannistal, then was forwarded to FEA 5 in Hannover, Germany. Later he trained to become a fighter pilot at Valenciennes, France, at Jastaschule I. The standard German practice was to be trained initially at a Fliegerschule or an FEA (Flieger-Ersatz Abteilung = Pilot Replacement Unit) and serve initially in a two-seater unit, in this case Kagohl IV, and then later transfer for training as a fighter pilot at a Jastaschule where they would be closely tutored by experts with frontline experience. They also had access to captured British and French fighters to familiarize themselves with their opponent's aircraft. At any rate, upon completion, he was assigned to the bombing group Kagohl IV in July 1916. Bolle was wounded in October, 1916 in combat with five French fighters. He crash landed within friendly lines and despite his own injury dragged his injured observer safely out of the shell-fire directed at their downed aircraft. Upon his recovery, he had been assigned to Kampfstaffel 23 of KG IV; Lothar von Richthofen was assigned as his observer/gunner. It was about this time that Bolle was awarded the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg's 2nd Class Knight's Cross of the Friedrich Order. He was the only fighter ace to win this award. Bolle went to Jastaschule (fighter pilot's training) in early 1917. He joined Jagdstaffel 28 in April 1917, while still recuperating from a leg wound. While assigned as a non-flying adjutant, he began tutelage on the fighter pilot's craft with two aces, Karl Emil Schaefer and Otto Hartmann, as well as Bolle's friend, Max Ritter von M√ºller. In July he commenced operational flying with Jasta 28. His first victory was over an Airco DH.4 of 57 Squadron on 8 August 1917. He scored once more in August and victories in December 1917 and January 1918 made him an ace by 30 January. ==Bolle in command== He was then promoted to Oberleutnant and transferred to command Jasta 2 on 20 February 1918 at Marcke, France. This was the squadron that Oswald Boelcke had commanded as he invented the first fighter tactics, strategy, and organization. It was being re-equipped with Fokker Dr.I triplanes as it was being incorporated into Jagdgeschwader 3. It was a dispirited squadron, having lost three consecutive Pour le M√©rite holding commanding officers killed in action.Franks et al 2001, pp. 55‚Äì56. Bolle was destined to be Jasta 2's final commander. Despite seemingly modest credentials, Bolle set his mark upon the squadron. The Fokker Dr.I triplane supplied was a plane of limited speed but great maneuverability and climb rate. Its slower speed made it more difficult to close to short distance for gunnery against faster fighters. Bolle's solution was the use of an Oigee telescopic sight for his guns. He also painted distinctive white stripes on his upper wings, to denote his leadership role,Franks, VanWyngarden 2003, Back matter. along with a yellow fuselage band edged by black and white to honor his old cavalry regiment.Franks, VanWyngarden 2003, pp. 37, 74.VanWingarden et al 2007, p. 106. Bolle's command of English turned out to be handy upon occasion, when he questioned downed British Empire fliers. He opened his tally with Jasta 2 on 25 April 1918, as part of a huge air offensive launched to support ground assault on Kemmel Ridge. He then began a steady collection of single and double victories, with five in May, seven in June, nine in July\\"US Air Service over German Air Service\\" Query His 27th Victory July 28,1918 was a Salmson Observation aircraft of the U.S. 12th Aero Squadron: Pilot John C. Miller died of wounds and Observer Lt. Stephen W. Thompson was shot in the leg., and three in August. In August, 1918, when he had scored 28 victories, he received the Military Merit Cross, and the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern; the Pour le M√©rite (commonly known as the Blue Max) was bestowed on the 28th. Bolle did not score again until 1 November. On 4 November, he downed four British fighters. ‚Äîtwo RAF SE.5as of 56 Squadron and two Sopwith Snipes of 4 AFC. The Snipes (claimed with Leut.Ernst Bormann) were flown by aces Captain Thomas Baker (12 victories) and Lt. A. J. Palliser (7).Franks et al 1993, p. 83. These were Bolle's final victories. A week later, he and his pilots defiantly marked their Fokker D.VIIs with their names and victory scores before surrendering them into British hands at Nivelles, Belgium. Bolle's final score of 36 victories included a preponderance of wins over enemy fighters; he downed 25. The other 11 victories were two-seater reconnaissance, ground attack, and bomber aircraft. More importantly, he led Jasta 2 through the intense battles of 1918 to the second highest victory total in the German Air Force, with a total of 336 victories to the Jasta. ==Post World War I== After war's end, he became a flying instructor. He also became the Director of the Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule (German Air Transport School) in the 1920s. Subsequently, he helped in the covert training of pilots for the Luftwaffe. During World War II, he served as an advisor with the Luftwaffe, reporting to Hermann G√∂ring. Karl Bolle died in his native city of Berlin on 9 October 1955. ==Honors and awards== * Kingdom of Prussia's Pour le M√©rite: 28 August 1918 * Knight's Cross with Swords of the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern: August 1918 * Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin's Military Merit Cross with Swords: August 1918 * Prussian Iron Cross First Class * Prussian Iron Cross Second Class: 1915 * Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg's Friedrich Order, Knight Second Class with Swords ==Sources of informationReferences== * Franks, Norman; Bailey, Frank W.; Guest, Russell.

Great Stukeley is in Huntingdonshire which is a non-metropolitan district of Cambridgeshire as well as a historic county of England. It lies on the old Roman road of Ermine Street. The East Coast Main Line railway runs near to Great Stukeley and serves the nearby Huntingdon railway station. The church in Great Stukeley is dedicated to Saint Bartholomew and the village war memorial is contained within its grounds. ==History== Great Stukeley was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 in the Hundred of Hurstingstone in Huntingdonshire; the name of the settlement was written as Stivecle in the Domesday Book. In 1086 there were two manors at Great Stukeley; the annual rent paid to the lords of the manors in 1066 had been ¬£12 and the rent was the same in 1086. The Domesday Book does not explicitly detail the population of a place but it records that there were 27 households at Great Stukeley. There is no consensus about the average size of a household at that time; estimates range from 3.5 to 5.0 people per household. Using these figures then an estimate of the population of Great Stukeley in 1086 is that it was within the range of 94 and 135 people. The Domesday Book uses a number of units of measure for areas of land that are now unfamiliar terms, such as hides and ploughlands. In different parts of the country, these were terms for the area of land that a team of eight oxen could plough in a single season and are equivalent to ; this was the amount of land that was considered to be sufficient to support a single family. By 1086, the hide had become a unit of tax assessment rather than an actual land area; a hide was the amount of land that could be assessed as ¬£1 for tax purposes. The survey records that there were eight ploughlands at Great Stukeley in 1086 and that there was the capacity for a further eight ploughlands. In addition to the arable land, there was of meadows and of woodland at Great Stukeley. The tax assessment in the Domesday Book was known as geld or danegeld and was a type of land-tax based on the hide or ploughland. It was originally a way of collecting a tribute to pay off the Danes when they attacked England, and was only levied when necessary. Following the Norman Conquest, the geld was used to raise money for the King and to pay for continental wars; by 1130, the geld was being collected annually. Having determined the value of a manor's land and other assets, a tax of so many shillings and pence per pound of value would be levied on the land holder. While this was typically two shillings in the pound the amount did vary; for example, in 1084 it was as high as six shillings in the pound. For the manors at Great Stukeley the total tax assessed was 3.3 geld. By 1086 there was already a church and a priest at Great Stukeley. > 'In 1870‚Äì72, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales > described Great Stukeley like this: STUKELEY (Great), a parish, with a > scattered village, in the district and county of Huntingdon; 2 miles NNW of > Huntingdon r. station.

There are a national school, and charities ¬£16.' ==Governance== Great Stukeley and Little Stukeley are in the civil parish of The Stukeleys which has its own elected parish council that is responsible for providing and maintaining a variety of local services including the allotments, street lighting, play areas, grass cutting and tree planting. It helps to maintain and extend the paths in the built area and the countryside, provides the bus shelter, litter, dog-waste and salt bins. A committee of the parish council reviews all planning applications and makes recommendations to Huntingdonshire District Council, which is the planning authority for the parish. The parish council also represents the views of the parish on issues such as local transport, policing and the environment. The parish council raises its own tax to pay for these services, known as the parish precept, which is collected as part of the Council Tax. In 2015, The Stukeleys parish council had nine members; meetings were held on the first Monday of a month either in Great Stukeley Village Hall or in Little Stukeley Village Hall. Great Stukeley was in the historic and administrative county of Huntingdonshire until 1965. From 1965, the village was part of a new administrative county of Huntingdon and Peterborough. In 1974, following the Local Government Act 1972, Great Stukeley became a part of Cambridgeshire. The second tier of local government is Huntingdonshire District Council which is a non-metropolitan district of Cambridgeshire and has its headquarters in Huntingdon. Huntingdonshire District Council has 52 councillors representing 29 district wards. Huntingdonshire District Council collects the council tax, and provides services such as building regulations, local planning, environmental health, leisure and tourism. Great Stukeley is a part of the district ward of Alconbury and The Stukeleys and is represented on the district council by one councillor. District councillors serve for four-year terms following elections to Huntingdonshire District Council. For Great Stukeley the highest tier of local government is Cambridgeshire County Council which has administration buildings in Cambridge. The county council provides county-wide services such as major road infrastructure, fire and rescue, education, social services, libraries and heritage services.

The previous member of parliament was John Major (Conservative) who represented the constituency between 1983 and 2001. ==Geography== Great Stukeley is situated on the old Roman road of Ermine Street on a small hill to the north-west of Huntingdon. The village lies on a bedrock of blue-grey Oxford clay formed around 160 million years in the Jurassic period, together with alluvium (clay and silt) from the same period. The surface soil is characterised as Oadby Member Diamicton, formed within the last two million years during Ice Age conditions by glaciers scouring the land. The village, which is approximately above sea level, lies just to the north of the A14 road that runs from the Port of Felixstowe to the Catthorpe Interchange, Leicestershire. ===Location=Climate=== The climate in the United Kingdom is defined as a temperate oceanic climate, or Cfb on the K√∂ppen climate classification system, a classification it shares with most of northwest Europe. (direct: Final Revised Paper) Eastern areas of the United Kingdom, such as East Anglia, are drier, cooler, less windy and also experience the greatest daily and seasonal temperature variations. Protected from the cool onshore coastal breezes further to the east of the region, Cambridgeshire is warm in summer, and cold and frosty in winter. The nearest Met Office climate station to Great Stukeley is at Monks Wood near Alconbury, which is to the north. The average annual rainfall for the United Kingdom between 1981 and 2010 was but Cambridgeshire is one of the driest counties with around half of the national level. Regional weather forecasting and historical summaries are available from the UK Met Office.

Great Stukeley and Little Stukeley were combined into a single parish at some time between 1931 and 1951. In 2011, the parish covered an area of and so the population density for The Stukeleys in 2011 was 188.4 persons per square mile (72.7 per square kilometre). ==Transport== Great Stukeley has two bus stops on opposite sides of Ermine Street. The north bus stop provides services in the direction of Peterborough and the south bus stop provides services to Huntingdon, St Ives and further afield.

Little Stukeley lies approximately north-west of Huntingdon. Little Stukeley is in the civil parish of The Stukeleys. Little Stukeley is situated within Huntingdonshire which is a non-metropolitan district of Cambridgeshire as well as being a historic county of England. The Alconbury Weald development is taking place near Little Stukeley. ==History== In 1085 William the Conqueror ordered that a survey should be carried out across his kingdom to discover who owned which parts and what it was worth. The survey took place in 1086 and the results were recorded in what, since the 12th century, has become known as the Domesday Book. Starting with the king himself, for each landholder within a county there is a list of their estates or manors; and, for each manor, there is a summary of the resources of the manor, the amount of annual rent that was collected by the lord of the manor both in 1066 and in 1086, together with the taxable value. Little Stukeley was listed in the Domesday Book in the Hundred of Hurstingstone in Huntingdonshire; the name of the settlement was written as Stivecle in the Domesday Book. In 1086 there was just one manor at Little Stukeley; the annual rent paid to the lord of the manor in 1066 had been ¬£6 and the rent was the same in 1086. The Domesday Book does not explicitly detail the population of a place but it records that there were 19 households at Little Stukeley. There is no consensus about the average size of a household at that time; estimates range from 3.5 to 5.0 people per household. Using these figures then an estimate of the population of Little Stukeley in 1086 is that it was within the range of 66 and 95 people. The Domesday Book uses a number of units of measure for areas of land that are now unfamiliar terms, such as hides and ploughlands. In different parts of the country, these were terms for the area of land that a team of eight oxen could plough in a single season and are equivalent to ; this was the amount of land that was considered to be sufficient to support a single family. By 1086, the hide had become a unit of tax assessment rather than an actual land area; a hide was the amount of land that could be assessed as ¬£1 for tax purposes. The survey records that there were eleven ploughlands at Little Stukeley in 1086. In addition to the arable land, there was of meadows and of woodland at Little Stukeley. The tax assessment in the Domesday Book was known as geld or danegeld and was a type of land-tax based on the hide or ploughland. It was originally a way of collecting a tribute to pay off the Danes when they attacked England, and was only levied when necessary. Following the Norman Conquest, the geld was used to raise money for the King and to pay for continental wars; by 1130, the geld was being collected annually. Having determined the value of a manor's land and other assets, a tax of so many shillings and pence per pound of value would be levied on the land holder. While this was typically two shillings in the pound the amount did vary; for example, in 1084 it was as high as six shillings in the pound. For the manor at Little Stukeley the total tax assessed was seven geld. By 1086 there was already a church and a priest at Little Stukeley. ==Government== Little Stukeley is part of the civil parish of The Stukeleys, which has a parish council. The parish council is elected by the residents of the parish who have registered on the electoral roll; the parish council is the lowest tier of government in England. A parish council is responsible for providing and maintaining a variety of local services including allotments and a cemetery; grass cutting and tree planting within public open spaces such as a village green or playing fields. The parish council reviews all planning applications that might affect the parish and makes recommendations to Huntingdonshire District Council, which is the local planning authority for the parish. The parish council also represents the views of the parish on issues such as local transport, policing and the environment. The parish council raises its own tax to pay for these services, known as the parish precept, which is collected as part of the Council Tax. In 2015, The Stukeleys parish council had nine members; meetings were held on the first Monday of a month either in Great Stukeley Village Hall or in Little Stukeley Village Hall. Little Stukeley was in the historic and administrative county of Huntingdonshire until 1965. From 1965, the village was part of the new administrative county of Huntingdon and Peterborough. Then in 1974, following the Local Government Act 1972, Little Stukeley became a part of the county of Cambridgeshire. The second tier of local government is Huntingdonshire District Council which is a non- metropolitan district of Cambridgeshire and has its headquarters in Huntingdon. Huntingdonshire District Council has 52 councillors representing 29 district wards. Huntingdonshire District Council collects the council tax, and provides services such as building regulations, local planning, environmental health, leisure and tourism. Little Stukeley is a part of the district ward of Alconbury and The Stukeleys and is represented on the district council by one councillor. District councillors serve for four-year terms following elections to Huntingdonshire District Council. For Little Stukeley the highest tier of local government is Cambridgeshire County Council which has administration buildings in Cambridge. The county council provides county-wide services such as major road infrastructure, fire and rescue, education, social services, libraries and heritage services. Cambridgeshire County Council consists of 69 councillors representing 60 electoral divisions. Little Stukeley is part of the electoral division of Huntingdon and is represented on the county council by two councillors. At Westminster Little Stukeley is in the parliamentary constituency of Huntingdon, and elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Little Stukeley is represented in the House of Commons by Jonathan Djanogly (Conservative). Jonathan Djanogly has represented the constituency since 2001. The previous member of parliament was John Major (Conservative) who represented the constituency between 1983 and 2001. ==DemographyPopulation=== { style=\\"text-align:center;font-size: 9pt\\" - !width=\\"150\\"Parish !width=\\"30\\"1911 !width=\\"30\\"1921 !width=\\"30\\"1931 !width=\\"30\\"1951 !width=\\"30\\"1961 !width=\\"30\\"1971 !width=\\"30\\"1981 !width=\\"30\\"1991 !width=\\"30\\"2001 !width=\\"30\\"2011 - align=leftGreat Stukeley align=\\"center\\"352 align=\\"center\\"373 align=\\"center\\"354 align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" - align=leftLittle Stukeley align=\\"center\\"240 align=\\"center\\"228 align=\\"center\\"209 align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" - align=leftThe Stukeleys align=\\"center\\"592 align=\\"center\\"601 align=\\"center\\"563 align=\\"center\\"612 align=\\"center\\"2909 align=\\"center\\"2529 align=\\"center\\"2387 align=\\"center\\"931 align=\\"center\\"2052 align=\\"center\\"1340 - } ==Notable people== * Robert Ashington Bullen (1850-1912), geologist and authority on Mollusca was Rector here 1898-1899. *Pete Dyos, darts player. ==References== Category:Villages in Cambridgeshire Category:Huntingdonshire ","title":"Little Stukeley"},{"id":"19320257","text":"Ingrid Sandahl (5 November 1924 ‚Äì 15 November 2011) was a Swedish gymnast.

It is located from Pirot, and about from Belgrade. == Geography == The Visok region is characterized by steep valleys with mostly short rivers. It is of tectonic origin, but it was through intensive erosion, mostly fluvial erosion, that it was shaped. The drainage network of this region is well developed. The Visoƒçica River, with its tributaries, forms the densest drainage network in Serbia. Another very important hydrological feature of Visok is Lake Zavoj. == Climate == The southwestern slopes of the Old Mountain are characterized by a moderate/continental sub-mountain/mountain climate, which gets colder and more humid from lower to higher elevations. The coldest month is January, and the warmest is July. == Population == The region is depopulating and sparsely populated. The massive seasonal leave in search for work (peƒçalba) has been recorded from the late 18th century. The seasonal workers mostly worked in the construction business. In the second half of the 19th century the workers mostly left for Romania, Ottoman Empire and the Zagore region in Bulgaria. In Romania and Bulgaria they mostly worked in the villages, building houses made of ƒçerpiƒá (non-baked, Sun dried brick made of mud and straw), in the naboj style (compacted earth). They were spreading building influence so much, that the village architecture in the regions of Zagore and Visok is almost identical. From the late 19th century to the Balkan Wars, economic emigration intensified and the conditions in the Visok were so bad that even women travelled as seasonal workers, waving cloth. The agriculture is barely possible because of the harsh conditions, so famine developed occasionally. In 1909 there were even reports of the deaths caused by starvation. In the late 19th and early 20th century, workers travelled mostly to Bulgaria, in groups of 10-15 people, called tajve. The working season was beginning around the Saint George's Day in early May, when the migrations would start, and was usually ending around Saint Demetrius Day in early November. After 1918 and World War I, as travelling in the foreign countries became problematic, population mostly migrated to Belgrade and the Serbian central region of ≈†umadija, but stayed mainly in the construction business. == Settlements == The villages were divided in three groups, and not all has migrations of the seasonal workers. The groups were: \\"(very) hungry\\", \\"semi-fed\\" and \\"full fed\\" villages. First group (Dojkinci, Brlog, Jelovica, ≈†ugrin, Cerova) gave the largest number of workers, then came the second group (Ragode≈°, Bazovik), while the inhabitants of the villages from the third group, like Gostu≈°a and Topli Do could sustain its population with the agricultural products so there was no need for people to leave during the year. According to the urban- morphological structures, the villages in the region belong to the compacted type. The architecture in them mostly originates from the 19th and the first half of the 20th century and the older objects especially were influenced by the Oriental style and the Bulgarian old urban architecture. The houses are built from the natural, available materials, like wood or stone. The study made by the architects and conservators on protecting and preserving the village of Gostu≈°a was awarded by the European Commission in 2016. The typical household was enclosed with the stone wall (duvar). In the yard there were the central room (i≈æa), bridal room, barn, grain basket, henhouses, pigsties, etc. Central room had a hearth and could be seated by up to 12 people. For such a desolate and arid region, the village houses show major diversity: some are plain but the others have fa√ßade level porches, protruded porches, arches, upper floors, balconies, verandas (doksat), foundations shaped like a Cyrillic \\"–ì\\" letter, passages, bay windows (erkeri), etc. Larger estates included shepherd's huts (baƒçija), haylofts, etc. But as the region is depopulating fast, the objects deteriorate. In 2018 Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts organized an exhibition on the subject. The most distinctive specimen include: House of Mila Cenkov (Smilovci; built in 1912, demolished in 2017); House of Mita Angelov (Visoƒçki Odorovci; built in the early 1900s); House of Mira Mitiƒá (Topli Do; built in 1933). == References == Category:Geography of Southern and Eastern Serbia Category:Pirot District Category:Geographical regions of Bulgaria Category:Geographical regions of Serbia Category:Valleys of Bulgaria Category:Valleys of Serbia ","title":"Visok"},{"id":"19320354","text":"G√∂ta Elisabeth Pettersson (18 December 1926 ‚Äì 9 October 1993) was a Swedish gymnast.

During their advance through Belgium in 1914 the German Army massacred hundreds of civilians and burned down towns and villages in reprisal for acts of resistance, real or imagined, and to deter the population.\\" Stewart, Ian. War, Culture, and the Media. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1996. Page 57. Similar policies were followed later in France, the Russian-held area of Poland, and in Russia.March, Francis Andrew; Beamis, Richard J. History of the World War Plain Label Books, 1918. page 63 Under the traditional \\"laws of war\\" in Europe, military activity was to be confined to the regular, uniformed armies of each side. Civilians were to take no part in fighting, neither attacking or being attacked. Thus, when the uniformed army troops in a nation or region were all defeated, resistance was supposed to end. In practice, informal resistance by \\"partisans\\", \\"guerrillas\\", or \\"francs-tireurs\\" often continued after the \\"regular\\" troops had given up or withdrawn. These fighters, never officially enrolled in an army, and not wearing uniforms to identify them as combatants, attacked occupying troops by ambushes, surprises, and sniping. Conducting such operations out of uniform was considered perfidy, and those involved could be executed. Occupying armies sometimes responded to such attacks by reprisals against the local population: execution of local inhabitants, whether known to be guerrillas or not, or destruction (usually by burning) of homes and other structures. German army doctrine in force at the time called for such reprisals to be performed immediately and severely in any case of civilian resistance. It was argued that such schrecklichkeit would end resistance quickly with relatively little bloodshed, whereas restraint would encourage resistance, leading to greater destruction and death. When Germany invaded Belgium in 1914, the German high command expected to sweep through the country with negligible opposition. The German army was many times larger and stronger than the Belgian army, and the Germans therefore thought that any resistance by Belgium would be futile. German leaders had even suggested to the Belgian government that in the event of war, the Belgians should just line up along the roads and watch the Germans march through. Belgium's refusal to accept these German presumptions and its resistance to the German advance came as a surprise, and disrupted the German timetable for advancing into France.Tuchman, Barbara. The Guns of AugustRandom House, 2009. pp 130-132 This frustration was communicated to the German troops in Belgium. Anything which delayed the German advance was to be crushed mercilessly. The Belgians were viewed as irrational and even treacherous for their opposition. This led to exaggerated suspicions among German commanders of Belgian civilian resistance. It is possible that some Belgian civilians engaged in resistance, though none is documented. It is certain that on several occasions, German commanders declared (probably in unconscious error) that such acts had occurred when they had not. The Germans responded to these perceived acts of resistance with harsh measures. In several villages and towns, hundreds of civilians were executed. Many buildings were put to the torch. Priests thought guilty of encouraging the resistance were killed. Violence by German soldiers against Belgians, such as rape, was ignored or not seriously punished. The Belgian city of Leuven was largely destroyed. One German officer later wrote about the town, \\"We shall wipe it out...Not one stone will stand upon another. We will teach them to respect Germany. For generations people will come here and see what we have done.\\" These actions, taken in a period of near-panic as the German forces desperately tried to carry out their flanking march before Allied forces could respond, proved to be a propaganda disaster for Germany. The reports of them caused a wave of indignation which aided the Allied cause. ==Analysis== The German argument for many years was that the actions in Belgium were the result of civilian resistance. The Belgian government was to blame for this \\"illegal warfare\\". Echoes of this can be found as late as the 1990s in such works as Deutsche Geschichte of Thomas Nipperdey and in the 1996 edition of the Brockhaus Enzyklop√§die. John Horne and Alan Kramer in German Atrocities 1914: A History of Denial contest this. Based on several sources, they contend that the German Army faced no irregular forces in Belgium and France during the first two and a half months of World War I, but believed it did due to erroneous reports of civilian resistance and as a result responded inappropriately and with excessive force.Rachamimov, Alon. \\"The Etiology of War Crimes and the Complexities of Remembrance\\".

It is situated at the back of a farmstead, southwest of the market town of Peebles, at grid reference , on the A72 road. Access may be gained by permission from the adjoining farmstead, Nether Horsburgh Farm. == Description == The remains of Nether Horsburgh Castle consist of a ruined, 16th-century rectangular tower-house, at the foot of a rolling valley overlooking the River Tweed, with the Hope Burn flowing just a few meters to the east. Originally, the tower had an adjoining courtyard and ranges of buildings, traces of which can still be seen to the north of the tower. Only three walls still survive, reaching a height of about , with the east wall being completely ruined to ground level. The existing structure appears to have measured about by , with walls of about thick. It is thought that the tower rose to a height of four stories, with an entrance situated at ground level on the northeast side of the building. This led into a vaulted cellar, studded with slit window apertures. Evidence suggests that access to the upper floors was gained by a staircase situated in the east wall. A small courtyard was formed by a range of buildings continuing to the east for about , then north for about . All that remains of this is a small fragment of the northern segment, which now forms a part of the field boundary in which the castle stands. The site is protected as a scheduled monument. == History== The castle was built and occupied by the Borders family of Horsburgh, and was later sold to Sir Robert Stewart of Shillingshaws, due to diminished family fortunes. Other castles owned by the Horsburgh family are to be found in the same part of Peebleshire. Less than to the west, on a grassy knoll, stands the remains of a small tower and wing. This is Horsburgh Castle, also of the 16th century, and just north of Peebles, high on the side of Mailingsland Hill, stands the remains of Hutchinfield Tower. A very dilapidated oblong block, again this is of the 16th century. ==Photographs of the ruins== Image:Nether Horsburgh Castle 1, web.JPGThe castle from the east Image:Nether Horsburgh Castle 2.jpgSoutheast view Image:Nether Horsburgh Castle 2.JPGNorthwest view Image:Nether Horsburgh 02.JPGCastle is to the left of farm. == References == * *Salter, Mike (1985).

These small regions of high intensity are observed on T2 weighted MRI images (typically created using 3D FLAIR) within cerebral white matter (white matter lesions, white matter hyperintensities or WMH) or subcortical gray matter (gray matter hyperintensities or GMH). They are usually seen in normal aging but also in a number of neurological disorders and psychiatric illnesses. For example, deep white matter hyperintensites are 2.5 to 3 times more likely to occur in bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder than control subjects. WMH volume, calculated as a potential diagnostic measure, has been shown to correlate to certain cognitive factors. Hyperintensities appear as \\"bright signals\\" (bright areas) on an MRI image and the term \\"bright signal\\" is occasionally used as a synonym for a hyperintensity. Hyperintensities are commonly divided into 3 types depending on the region of the brain where they are found. Deep white matter hyperintensites occur deep within white matter, periventricular white matter hyperintensities occur adjacent to the lateral ventricles and subcortical hyperintensities occur in the basal ganglia. Hyperintensities are often seen in auto immune diseases that have effects on the brain. Postmortem studies combined with MRI suggest that hyperintensities are dilated perivascular spaces, or demyelination caused by reduced local blood flow. ==Causes== White matter hyperintensities can be caused by a variety of factors including ischemia, micro-hemorrhages, gliosis, damage to small blood vessel walls, breaches of the barrier between the cerebrospinal fluid and the brain, or loss and deformation of the myelin sheath. ==Cognitive effects== In most elderly people, presence of severe WMH and medial temporal lobe atrophy MTA was linked with an increase in frequency of mild cognitive deficits. Studies suggest that a combination of MTA and severe WMH showed more than a fourfold increase in the frequency of mild cognitive deficits. It's also been consistently shown that severe WMH is known to be associated with gait disorders, impaired balance and cognitive disturbances. Certain features of gait pattern associated with WMH are: slight widening of the base, slowing and shortening of stride length and turning en bloc. Speed of cognitive processes and frontal skills may also be impaired in people with WMH. Pathological signs of oligodendritic apoptosis and damage to axonal projections have been evident. Sufficient damage to the axons that course through WMH can cause adequate interference with normal neuronal functions. It is also thought that WMH patients have a negative impact on cognition in Alzheimer's disease population. In Alzheimer's patients, higher WMH are associated with higher amyloid beta deposits, possibly associated with small vessel disease and reduced amyloid beta clearance. ==See also== *Leukoaraiosis *Hypertensive leukoencephalopathy *Virchow-Robin spaces *Subcortical ischemic depression ==References *MRI database at www.bipolardatabase.org.

He was a nominee for the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005. __NOTOC__ ==BibliographyPoetry=== * La breve stagione (1967) * Il tempo differente (1974) * L'urlo della mente (1977) * Nascere nel '40 (1981), * Passaggio di sequenza (1986) * I luoghi persi (1994) * Nel tempo che precede (2002) * L'albero delle nebbie (2008) ===Anthologies=== * Per tempi e luoghi (1999) * El tiempo diferente (1999) * Selected poems (2002) ===Novels=== * L'uomo delle Cesane (1994) * L'estate dell'altro millennio (2001) * Olimpo (2006) * Co-author with Andrea Aromatico, Il poeta e il cacciatore (2008) ===Essays=== * L'ambigua presenza (1980) * Sul limite d'ombra (1989) * Il pensiero, il corpo (1986) * Il canto magnanimo (2005) ==Filmography== * L'et√† breve (1969‚Äì70) * Tre film-poemi (Sulle Cesane, 1982, Un'altra estate e Ritorno d'autunno, 1988) * Un poeta e la sua terra (DVD on Umberto Piersanti, directed by Massimiliano Napoli, Librialice.it ) ==External links == * Official website Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:People from Urbino Category:Italian poets Category:Italian male poets ","title":"Umberto Piersanti"},{"id":"19320500","text":"The men's K-1 1000 metres event was an individual kayaking event conducted as part of the Canoeing at the 1968 Summer Olympics program.

The event is also known as the Pogrom of Kalisz or Poland's Louvain (see Schrecklichkeit atrocities). On 13 February 1793, Kalisz and the Kalisz region became part of Prussia during the partition of Poland. After Napoleon's defeat on the Eastern front in 1812, it was taken over by Imperial Russia, which subsequently controlled the city for more than 100 years. The German army invaded Kalisz on 2 August 1914. The town was burnt down; only churches and public offices survived. A significant number of citizens were shot. Prior to the war, Kalisz had 65,000 inhabitants. Afterwards, it was left with 5,000 inhabitants.Leopold Wiess Palace in Kalisz, destroyed by the Germans in 1914 ==Outbreak of World War IThe Russians pull out=== The first inclination of the war reaching Kalisz was when the nearby border with the German Empire was closed at Neu Skalmiersch√ºtz and rail movements across the border to Germany were stopped. Russian officials began evacuating the city alongside military personnel. On August 2, 1914, at dawn, the Russian military retreated from the city without fighting, after setting fire to military warehouses near the railway station. It was set on fire as well as the trains and transport wagons. A civic committee was established by the citizens of the town which began to administer the city. Additionally, the Civil Guard was established to keep order, while workers tried to put the fire at the railway station out.\\\\- 1914 pogrom miasta Kalisz\\" Kaliskie Towarzystwo Przyjaci√≥≈Ç Nauk 1995 ==The Germans move inFirst German soldiers appear=== Around 14:00, on August 2, the first German patrols appeared along the railway tracks. As the patrols increased, crowds gathered. Altogether the atmosphere was neutral, some unfavourable comments could be heard from among the citizens of Kalisz. When a German officer arrived, mayor Bukowi≈Ñski gave him the keys to the city as a symbolic gesture. After ensuring that there were no Russian forces present, the German patrols withdrew to Szczypiorno. In later hours, other German soldiers started to arrive on bicycles. Many of them were Poles from the nearby town of Schildberg, and there was no hostility between them and the local Polish population. The German soldiers of Polish extraction (about 30 in number), quickly separated from the rest of the Germans and went to the market, where they engaged in conversation with the local population and drank beer with them. German soldiers remained separated and struggled to engage in conversations which were carried out in Polish. ===Arrival of the main German forces=== Only on the night of 2 and 3 of August around midnight, did the main German forces come from the Fifth Company of the 155th regiment of infantry in Ostrowo. The commander, Captain Keild, demanded lodgings for his troops and summoned the mayor. On the same night, forces of Major Hermann Preusker came to the city from the 2nd Battalion of infantry. Preusker immediately took over and named himself the commandant. At the selection of quarters, Preusker showed great displeasure and demanded the building housing the Musical Society and Christian Craftsmen in the city instead of the Russian military barracks. At dawn on 3 August, mortars were brought into the city. At the same time, Major Preusker started arguing with the city council, although they had fulfilled his every request. Some believed he was disappointed with the lack of resistance and the indifferent attitude to German soldiers by the Polish population, which had begun to establish personal connections with the ethnic Polish soldiers from the German-controlled part of the partitioned country. Some of those soldiers did not show any support for the war and even condemned the conflict. ==Executions and repression== In the late evening, a single shot was heard, which began panic and confusion among the city population; it was followed by machine gun fire. After this short event, peace returned to the area. During the night the firing resumed, when German soldiers started to shoot at each other, probably thinking that they were surrounded by Russian forces. Although the civilians stayed at home, 21 of them and six soldiers were dead and 32 soldiers were wounded. Major Preusker claimed that it was the local population that carried out the shooting. On August 4, Preusker took six citizens as hostages, 50,000 rubles of retribution, a curfew, a ban on publishing newspapers, and threatened to take further hostages and executions. Despite this, the Germans continued with further repression and executions. Civilians were brutally beaten, often with rifle butts; at any sign of resistance, people were shoved against a wall and shot. Many executions happened near the hospital where wounded people were taken. Several corpses were left in the street. Pedestrians were mistreated and any signs of opposition were quelled with such brutality and under such conditions that there were cases where soldiers refused to follow the orders of their officers. Up to 20 people were murdered in this way. ==Shelling and raids into the city== The Great Park in Kalisz, before 1914 After taking their hostages with them, the Germans started to retreat from the city in late afternoon. An hour later, artillery fire was laid down on the city from nearby hills. It was very efficient as Kalisz is located in a deep valley. Additionally, the Germans had ordered the day before that all citizens should illuminate their homes, which helped in directing the fire. This continued for several days, with the Germans staging short raids into the city. As the shelling started fires, general panic broke out, and even as the Germans threatened to kill anybody escaping, people tried to escape by whatever means they had. Large crowds of panic-stricken people, including children and the elderly with any possessions they could grab, were running from the city, which became almost deserted. On August 5, 10,000 people fled the shelled town. The Germans took additional hostages, mistreating them and even killing some. Only after the intervention of the Catholic Church, were some released and others sent to POW camps in Cottbus in Germany. ==Massacre of civilian population== As the situation seemed to calm down, new forces from Saxony arrived, while Major Preusker's soldiers were withdrawn. Another incident happened on August 7 on Main Market Square, when a lone horse ran free; as a result, German soldiers started shooting in a disorganised way, which led to the death of some of them. Artillery was positioned within the city and the Germans fired at civilian buildings for over an hour. About 100 civilians died in this incident. The Germans searched for survivors and when they found them, they stabbed them to death with bayonets. During the afternoon, City Hall was set on fire, and officials executed. The Germans retreated and shooting began again, which continued overnight between 7 and 8 August. On Saturday morning, the Germans returned to the city, taking 800 men prisoner and executing 80 of them on a nearby hill. The following day, the Germans started to systematically burn down the city. It is mentioned that in cases where civilians tried to fight the fire, they were murdered by German soldiers. The shootings, murderers, plunder of shops and homes as well as the burning down of the whole city lasted until 22 August, when the last home was set alight on Nowoogrodowska street. The Polish press in all territories of Partitions reported extensively on the event, some calling it \\"monstrous madness, that is unbelievable\\". The damage in Kalisz constituted 29,5% of the losses in the entire Congress Poland during World War I. The destruction has been compared to the massacre of Louvain, where a city was destroyed in similar manner by the Germans. Before the war Kalisz had 65,000 citizens; after the war, there were only 5,000 left. ==See also== *Expulsion of Poles by Germany *Planned destruction of Warsaw *Rape of Belgium *Schrecklichkeit *Mitteleuropa ==Notes and references== ;Inline ;Offline # H.

Imazapyr is absorbed by the leaves and roots, and moves rapidly through the plant. It accumulates in the meristem region (active growth region) of the plant. In plants, imazapyr disrupts protein synthesis and interferes with cell growth and DNA synthesis. Imazapyr is an ingredient of the commercial product Ortho GroundClear. A related herbicide, imazapic is an ingredient in Roundup Extended Control. Both chemicals are non-selective, long-lasting, and effective in weed control. They are, however, water-soluble, and depending on soil type and moisture they can move into parts of the landscape where they weren't sprayed.

In 1798 as a Lieutenant he commissioned the newly acquired . Under his command, Netley captured numerous French and Spanish privateers, including Egyptienne.

He was promoted to post captain on 29 April 1802. In June 1803 he received a command in the Sea Fencibles.

Grey designed many noted landmarks in Southern California, including the Beverly Hills Hotel, the Huntington Art Gallery, the Pasadena Playhouse and Wattles Mansion. He is credited with being one of the pioneers in the development of the new American architecture in the early 20th century, with a focus on harmony with nature and eliminating features not belonging to the local climate and conditions. Grey was also a noted artist whose paintings are in the permanent collection of the Chicago Art Institute. ==Architectural careerCareer in the Midwest=== Henry Huntington House in San Marino, designed by Hunt and Grey Grey was born in Chicago and educated in the Milwaukee public schools. He did not attend college and worked for the Milwaukee architectural firm of Ferry & Clas from 1887-1899. In 1890, the 18-year-old Grey won first prize in a competition for the design of a water tower and pumping station sponsored by a New York architectural publication. While at Ferry & Clas, he assisted in the design of the Milwaukee Central Library and the Wisconsin Historical Society in Madison, Wisconsin. When Grey went into practice on his own, he first attracted attention for his design of a summer home he built for himself on a bluff overlooking Lake Michigan at Fox Point, Wisconsin. Grey's Fox Point house was a great hit, being published widely in magazines and leading to Grey's elevation to Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. ===Health problems=== Another major commission during his years in Wisconsin was the Christian Science church in Milwaukee. It was shortly after those plans were finished that Grey later recalled that \\"my health broke down completely.\\" Grey wrote that his health problems had more to do with \\"nerves\\" rather than anything purely physical. Grey abandoned his Milwaukee practice and traveled to Florida, Philadelphia and then to Las Vegas, seeking to regain his health. He took up work on a ranch, hoping the hard work would build his strength. He eventually moved to California, spending time swimming, rowing, playing tennis and fishing on Catalina Island. When he read of a job working on a Hollywood citrus ranch for $25 a month plus board, he took the position. ===Partnership with Myron Hunt=== The Architectural Record In 1904, Grey became friends with a fellow Midwestern architect, Myron Hunt. The two rode horses together on Sunday mornings in Pasadena and formed a partnership in that city as Hunt and Grey. Grey later wrote that he began by working only a short time each day \\"until my nerves got in better shape.\\" Grey's health again failed during the early years of his partnership with Hunt, and he took a long trip to the South Sea Islands. Yet, it was during his partnership with Hunt that Grey produced some of his finest work. The two designed fine residences for the wealthy of Pasadena and also worked on larger projects, including schools, churches and hotels. In 1905, The Architectural Record published articles on both Grey and Hunt, noting: \\"Both Mr. Hunt and Mr. Grey stand for the attempt to naturalize in this country the best traditions of European architecture. Mr. Grey, for instance, believes that a very genuine American style is in the process of making; but that as yet it is only in its infancy.\\" From 1907-1908, Hunt & Grey designed a Beaux Arts mansion for railroad and finance magnate, Henry Huntington, in San Marino. The mansion, built with reinforced concrete, tile walls and a slab roof, was not completed until 1911. In his book, \\"Houses of Los Angeles,\\" Sam Watters wrote that the Huntington structure was \\"unique in Los Angeles for the ambition of its house.\\" While a French influence was requested by Mrs. Huntington, Hunt & Grey also added elements of a new California architecture by including a red-tile roof, unornamented plaster walls, and sage green window trim. The Huntington mansion was later converted into the main art gallery of the cultural center built around the Huntington Library. Hunt & Grey's larger commissions included work for Throop Institute in Pasadena, the school which would soon become California Institute of Technology. In 1911, they began plans for the new campus of Occidental College in the Eagle Rock district of Los Angeles. They also designed a dormitory and other structures for Claremont College and a master expansion plan for Pomona College. ===Association with the Arts and Crafts movement=== Hunt & Grey's design of Cochran House was praised by Gustav Stickley's The Craftsman In 1906, Hunt & Grey designed a home for Dr. Guy Cochran near Downtown Los Angeles that Gustav Stickley's The Craftsman magazine dubbed the \\"very best\\" of their work, with enormous windows \\"looking out upon the terrace and garden, giv[ing] such a sense of relationship between the two that there is almost no feeling of being enclosed within walls.\\" The Craftsman referred to Hunt & Grey as \\"pioneers in the development of the new American architecture,\\" which was \\"but a series of individual plans adapted to the climatic conditions and to the needs of daily living\\" and in harmony \\"with the natural environment and contour of the landscape.\\" The house reflected Grey's vision of California bungalow architecture, which he described in 1907 as follows: > \\"The best California bungalow schemes involve a garden or large outdoor > living space, incorporated as an integral part of the plan. By this we mean > that the main rooms of the house are arranged to face this out-of-door > living space ... It was once considered absurd to plan a house with the > kitchen toward the street, but now not so in California ... the street side > of [a man's] domicile is merely the side through which he enters.\\" In 1910, as the American Craftsman movement was in full bloom in Southern California, Grey wrote that California architecture was distinctive because local architects were simply trying to be \\"natural\\"‚Äînot so much \\"because our architects have striven to be unique in their designing as because they have tried to eliminate features not belonging to this climate and to local conditions.\\" Grey also emphasized simplicity, once writing that \\"the greatest fault that can be found with the architecture of Southern California is that which may be found with all American architecture to a greater or lesser extent, namely, a lack of simplicity.\\" Though often associated with the Craftsman movement, Grey's structures reflect a wide variety of styles, including Beaux Arts, Mission Revival and English Tudor. One Grey biographer wrote: \\"While Grey shared a number of beliefs with Stickley and the Arts and Crafts movement, his catholic, traditionalist taste and disposition would not allow him to become an exponent of any one movement. The woodsy, informal image of the Arts and Crafts house was simply one of many that he might employ. Like Charles and Henry Greene, he transformed the low-art Arts and Crafts dwelling into a sophisticated high-art object.\\" ===Later career=== Beverly Hills Hotel, 1911 drawing After his partnership with Hunt dissolved in 1910 or 1911, Grey went on to design the Pasadena Playhouse, the Beverly Hills Hotel, the Lincoln Shrine in Redlands, three buildings for the First Church of Christ Scientist, and many residences. After completing his first Christian Science church, Grey published an article about church design in which he wrote: First Church of Christ, Scientist, later used by Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple > \\"The commercial spirit of our age is so inclined to be a mad race for the > 'almighty dollar,' and commercial structures are so often built with the > idea of obtaining the most show for the least money that when religious > organizations build they should show that their aims are higher. The trend > of preachment or sermon in all churches is for the things of lasting value, > the real as against the seeming; so when a church builds, it should show > that it believes in putting such preachments into practice, that it demands > the real in architecture instead of that which only seems so.\\" The church Grey designed for the First Church of Christ, Scientist in Los Angeles was later used by Jim Jones and his Peoples Temple immediately prior to the 1978 Jonestown tragedy. ==Artist and author== Grey was also an artist who painted in both oils and watercolors. He painted Southern California landscapes, and his watercolors are on permanent exhibit at the Chicago Art Institute. Grey also wrote numerous articles on architecture and philosophy. For several years in the 1920s, Grey's nervous condition again forced him to cease working as an architect, though he returned to his practice in 1929. During the 1930s, he also tried to obtain work as a set designer in Hollywood. Grey moved his practice to Florida in 1941, where he was an instructor in mechanical drawing and also painted a 35-foot frieze at the Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Florida, depicting five episodes in the history and development of Florida. Grey later returned to Pasadena in his retirement; he died in November 1963 at age 91 in the Pasadena mansion he had built for himself. ==Grey's architectural works== Sixth Church of Christ, Scientist (Milwaukee, Wisconsin) 1902 Throop Hall, Pasadena Wattles Mansion, Hollywood Architectural drawing of the side view at First Church of Christ, Scientist.

The congregation, founded in 1816, is affiliated with the United Church of Christ. ==Architecture and history== The Elm Street Congregational Church is set on the east side of Elm Street, just south of Main Street and opposite Dresser Street. It is a single- story brick structure with elaborate high Victorian styling, oriented with its long side perpendicular to the street, and its main entrance in the transept near its far end. It has a steeply pitched roof with flanking pinnacles, decorative brickwork, and Gothic-arched stained glass windows. Its tower, located at the northeast corner, is square with buttressed sides, but lacks its upper stages, which were blown down in the 1938 New England hurricane and have not been replaced. The church is the only one of its type in the city, but is built of brick compatible with other nearby civic buildings. The congregation was established in 1816, separating from the town's first congregation, which was interdenominational. It first met in a hall built on the site of the old parish house in 1818, until a new church was built in 1822 at the present location. In 1884 that building's steeple was blown into the roof by a storm, and the present building was built to replace it the following year. The new building was built at a cost of $17,500 and dedicated on September 4, 1885. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Southbridge, Massachusetts *National Register of Historic Places listings in Worcester County, Massachusetts ==References *Elm Street Congregational Church web site Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in Massachusetts Category:Churches completed in 1885 Category:19th- century United Church of Christ church buildings Category:United Church of Christ churches in Massachusetts Category:Churches in Worcester County, Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Southbridge, Massachusetts Category:Churches in Southbridge, Massachusetts ","title":"Congregational Church (Southbridge, Massachusetts)"},{"id":"19320739","text":"Loras Joseph Watters (October 14, 1915 ‚Äì March 30, 2009) was an American bishop of the Catholic Church. He served as an auxiliary bishop in the Archdiocese of Dubuque from 1965 to 1969, and as the fifth Bishop of Winona from 1969 to 1986. ==BiographyEarly life and ministry=== Loras Watters was born in Dubuque, Iowa, the son of Martin and Carolyn (Sisler) Watters. He was a sick child at birth and he and his mother spent an extended period of time in the hospital. He received his first name from the sister who baptized him in the hospital, Sr. Loras, \\"much to his mother's chagrin.\\" Watters received his early education at St. Raphael‚Äôs Cathedral School and Loras Academy before completing his undergraduate degree at Columbia College in Dubuque. He studied for the priesthood at the Pontifical North American College and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome before World War II closed the school. He completed his studies at Theological College at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.. Watters was ordained a priest in the Archdiocese of Dubuque on June 7, 1941, by Archbishop Francis Beckman in St. Raphael's Cathedral. He served as the assistant pastor at St. Martin's Parish in Cascade from 1941 to 1944. He then served on the faculty of Loras Academy in Dubuque from 1944 to 1946. Watters returned to The Catholic University of America for post-graduate work before returning to Loras Academy briefly as principal. He then returned to Catholic University where he earned a doctorate in education. Upon returning to Dubuque he served on the faculty of Loras College in the Education Department from 1954 to 1956. He returned to Rome in 1956 where he served as spiritual director at the Pontifical North American College until 1960. He was named a Papal Chamberlain by Pope Pius XII and then a Domestic Prelate by Pope John XXIII during these years. After he returned to Iowa, Watters became the director of the North American Martyrs Retreat House in Cedar Falls. ===Auxiliary Bishop of Dubuque=== Watters was appointed Titular Bishop of Fidoloma and Auxiliary Bishop of Dubuque by Pope Paul VI on June 21, 1965. He was consecrated a bishop by Archbishop Egidio Vagnozzi on August 26, 1965, in St. Raphael's Cathedral. Archbishop James Byrne of Dubuque and Bishop James Casey of Lincoln were the co-consecrators. He attended the fourth session on the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II). During the time he served as auxiliary bishop Waters also served as the vicar general and superintendent of schools for the archdiocese and as the pastor of Nativity Parish in Dubuque. ===Bishop of Winona=== On January 8, 1969, Pope Paul VI appointed Bishop Watters the fifth Bishop of Winona and he was installed on March 13, 1969. His predecessor, Bishop Edward Fitzgerald, had also been an auxiliary bishop in Dubuque. Watters led the diocese in the years after Vatican II. He promulgated the document, \\"The Church in the Diocese of Winona,\\" which described the local Church and the roles of the clergy, religious, and the laity. He initiated the Diocesan Pastoral Council, which provided a pastoral leadership role for the laity in the Church. From 1972 to 1974 he served as the Chairman of the Bishops' Committee on Priestly Formation for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. He led the diocese in a spiritual renewal program called RENEW beginning in 1984, which encouraged the laity to participate in the life of their parish. This emphasis on the role of lay people helped in the years Watters was the bishop and after he resigned as the number of priests in diocese declined. He also established the Diocesan Tribunal, the Diocesan Finance Office, and reorganized the diocese of Winona into deaneries. During his years as bishop, he resided in a three-room apartment at the Diocesan Pastoral Center. ===Later life and death=== Watters remained as the Bishop of Winona until his retirement on his 71st birthday in 1986. He initially moved to St. Mary's College in Winona where he taught part- time and served as chaplain to the Brothers. He moved briefly to Pacific Grove, California to be near his sisters before returning to Winona in 2003 and resided at Callista Court at St. Anne's Extended Healthcare. Watters died there on March 30, 2009 at the age of 93. His funeral was held in the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart and he was buried in St. Mary's Cemetery in Winona. ==References *Dubuque Diocese *Winona Diocese Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Roman Catholic bishops of Winona Category:Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque Category:Participants in the Second Vatican Council Category:People from Dubuque, Iowa Category:1915 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Religious leaders from Iowa Category:Catholics from Iowa Category:Loras College alumni Category:Catholic University of America alumni Category:Loras College faculty ","title":"Loras Joseph Watters"},{"id":"19320776","text":"AC Active was a 24-hour music format produced by Dial Global Local (formerly Waitt Radio Networks).

The congregation was in practice Congregationalist, and was sometimes referred to derisively as the \\"Church of the Holy Supervisors\\". In 1921, with its enrollment declining, the company sold the building to the Holy Trinity Episcopalian congregation, which had been accumulating a building fund since 1909.

It was built from 1912‚Äì1916 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. ==History== Notre Dame Parish was founded in 1869 to serve the needs of the French Canadian community of Southbridge who migrated here beginning in the 1830s. A frame wood church was built shortly thereafter. The second Pastor Msgr Georges Elzar Brochu began to raise funds for a much larger church in the 1880s. In 1895 Msgr Brochu purchased land at the corner of Main and Marcy for the new church. Part of the purchase agreement stipulated that the church could not actually be built until after the death of Mr. Marcy, the prior owner. As a result, Msgr Brochu, who died in 1904 was unable to begin construction which was eventually undertaken by his successor, Msgr Louis O. Trigonne after Mr. Marcy died in 1908. Notre Dame Church was the last of three churches built in Massachusetts for French congregations by Canadian architect Joseph Venne. The others were St. Anthony Church in New Bedford, Massachusetts (Venne's earliest church in the US, begun 1902) and Notre Dame Church in Adams, Massachusetts. The building is 190 feet in length and the nave is 75 feet wide. The transept is 123 feet across and the ceiling is 55 feet high. The tower is 210 feet high and has extensive views of the Southbridge area. ==Music== The organ at Notre Dame Church was built in 1916 by the Casavant Fr√®res Pipe Organ Company of Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, Opus 649. The large French Romantic instrument of 4 manuals and 42 ranks is capable of performing the full spectrum of organ literature.

The complex, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989, is the second Roman Catholic parish (after Notre Dame) built to serve Southbridge's growing Franco-American population. The four buildings in the complex were built between 1909 and 1926 in the Colonial Revival style. The parish was formally established in 1908, and construction on its buildings began in 1909. The first two to be built were the rectory and convent. The rectory, at 40 Charlton Street, is a 2.5 story brick structure with a hipped roof which is pierced by a few gable dormers. Its front facade features a central rounded bay, and both side facades have projecting rectangular bays. The convent is of similar styling, except its front facade features two side rounded bays and a central porch. Its rear facade also features an entry porch. The school, which opened in 1910, was at first run by the Sisters of Nicolette, who also ran the Notre Dame parish school. The building is a large two story brick block, with projecting sections at the center of each side that rise up to the roof line on three sides, and above the main roof line on the front, which features three round Roman arched doorways. The main roof his hipped, as are the roof lines of the projecting sections. The church was not completed until 1926.

Over the next four weeks, her crew worked feverishly rearming fleet units as they pulled into the anchorage for provisions, fuel, and ammunition. In February, the ship began visiting other ports of call, rearming warships at Leyte Gulf, Guam, and Saipan in addition to Ulithi. Late in April, Bedford Victory joined a convoy of oilers bound for the Ryukyu Islands where the last campaign of World War II had already begun. On the 27th, she and her consorts became elements of Task Group (TG) 50.8, the mobile replenishment group supporting the U.S. 5th Fleet. For almost a month, she steamed in a holding area a day‚Äôs voyage to the east of Okinawa rearming various units of the 5th Fleet. At the end of the third week in May, she and the ammunition ship parted company with Task Group 50.8 and set course for Kerama Retto, the small group of islands just west of the southern end of Okinawa. The two ships entered the fleet anchorage on 21 May and began two weeks of ammunition distribution there. Enemy air attacks frequently punctuated her activities, but Bedford Victory emerged undamaged from Kerama Retto on 6 June. She steamed in convoy via Saipan and Ulithi to Leyte Gulf. She remained there through the end of the war and for about two months thereafter. Early in November, the ship embarked upon the long voyage home, and she arrived in Seattle, Washington, on the 17th. Bedford Victory remained at Seattle until the end of the first week in February 1946. ==Post- war decommissioning== At that time, she moved south to San Francisco, California, where she was decommissioned on 29 March 1946. She was returned to the Maritime Commission that same day. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 28 August 1946. ==Korean War== For the Korean War she served in the Hungnam Evacuation as a Military Sealift CommandService and Merchant Ship Participating in Hungnam Korea Redeployment.usmm.org, Hungnam Korea Redeployment ==Honors and awards== Bedford Victory earned one battle star for her World War II service.

Richardson also plays internationally for Great Britain. He is the younger brother of Lee Richardson who also played ice hockey at a professional level. Richardson began his career with his hometown team the Swindon Lynx. In 2003, Richardson moved to the Bracknell Bees in a two-year spell. Richardson's good performances during the 2004‚Äì05 season, which included nine goals and 18 assists for 27 points, saw him move to the Elite League for the Cardiff Devils. His first season of 10 points in 30 games was impressive for an Elite League rookie, but his second season saw him collect 33 points, including 24 assists in 54 games. Richardson moved to the Nottingham Panthers in 2007, in what was a slightly disappointing season for him, but still managed to collect 20 points in 46 games. In 2008, Richardson signed with the Basingstoke Bison. Shortly after the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season, with Basingstoke dropping out of the Elite League, Richardson re-signed for the Cardiff Devils as a defenceman. He moved briefly to Kazakhstan to sign for Arlan Kokshetau before re-joining Cardiff in 2012. He remained with Cardiff until 2020 but left the Elite League side over ongoing uncertainty about whether the 2020-21 Elite League season would go ahead.

Of Palaearctic origin, it was first found in North America in 1973 when it was accidentally introduced. The moth is now widespread throughout the northern half of the United States, southern Canada, northern Europe, and, more recently, New Zealand. The larval form grows to around 10 mm, while the adults wingspan is between 17 mm and 19 mm. It is best known for its use in biological control of the lethally toxic poison hemlock (Conium maculatum), which is eaten by its caterpillars (larvae). The toxicity of its host plant may actually benefit the caterpillar because it helps females recognize locations for oviposition. This species also uses the leaves of its host plant (C. maculatum) to form protective tubes around the caterpillar. == Identification == Adult moths are pale brown, almost tan, with a lighter colored area near the bottom of their wings and a few darker spots found near the edges of the wings. They have a distinguishing brown or reddish spot near the center of each wing. The hemlock moth can be confused with another moth of the family Depressariidae, Exaeretia canella, which is similar in coloration. However, E. canella does not have a reddish spot, and has a dark head. As eggs, they have a pale, off-white color. As caterpillars, they are yellow with a black head. After growing in size (to around 10 mm), the caterpillars are thin and have a light green color, with three prominent stripes on the sides of their bodies, which are a darker green. == Distribution  Range === A. alstroemeriana is a wide-ranging species native to Europe, that has more recently spread to North America and New Zealand. In North America, it is most common to the northeastern and northwestern United States, as well as the southern regions of Canada. It has spread inland in both nations, and can now commonly be found in the Midwestern states of the U.S. as well. The first North American sighting of the hemlock moth was of a caterpillar seen in Tompkins County, New York in 1973. After that, Agonopterix alstroemeriana spread quickly throughout the United States. It was found in the Pacific Northwest in 1983-1985, possibly spread by the accidental shipping of dormant moths. The moth was seen in the Midwest starting in 1990, when it was discovered near Columbus, Ohio. It was established in Illinois in 1993, after being identified by the rolled leaves of Conium maculatum, a characteristic indication of the presence of A. alstroemeriana. === Habitat === The poison hemlock moth can be found wherever its host plant (Conium maculatum) occurs. Thus, the moth is most commonly seen in open fields and roadsides in suburban and rural locations. In the U.S., A. alstroemeriana often winters under the bark of firewood; then flies away after being warmed up when the wood is brought into the house. Moths also may come inside buildings and housing during the night, as they are attracted to light. == Behavior  Leaf rolling === The caterpillars in earlier instars form tubes from the leaves of Conium maculatum by rolling the leaves together using a secreted webbing material. Older caterpillars make tubes from the flowers and seed heads as well as the leaves. Abandoned tubes can regularly be found on the poison hemlock plant because, if disturbed or attacked, the caterpillar will wriggle free of the tube and onto the ground as a predation defense mechanism. == Life cycle  Eggs === Around 200 small eggs are laid by the female, and they are placed on the underside of the leaves of their host plant, Conium maculatum. As eggs, they have a pale color. Agonopterix alstroemeriana larva in a later instar === Larvae === The eggs hatch into caterpillars about 6 days after being laid. Earlier instars are yellow with a black head capsule. After feeding on their hostplant and growing in size, the caterpillars have a light green color. After almost a month of growth, the caterpillars are around 10 mm long (.4 in). The last instar larva is green with three dark green stripes. Larvae often emerge in April and May. Hemlock moth larvae have been known to shelter together in high numbers, since the larvae seem to repel predators with toxic alkaloids obtained from its host plant. They also have the advantage of local predators being less familiar with the species because they are non-native. The caterpillar may also benefit from the toxic alkaloids present in the poison hemlock host plant because they may increase the ability of A. alstroemeriana to recognize Conium maculatum as the correct location for oviposition. === Pupae === They pupate for 2 weeks in the soil, usually from late May to early June. The color of pupa is red-brown, with fine hairs densely located. The length of pupae is approximately 6‚Äì7 mm. An image of an adult A. alstromeriana showcasing its coloration === Adult === After pupating, the moths emerge from the soil as adults. This adult emergence usually occurs in mid- to late- June. The adults must therefore stay alive through the winter in order to breed during the spring. Adults generally live from June to March, making A. alstroemeriana a relatively long-lived moth species. == Native predator emergence == Recently, A. alstroemeriana has been predated upon by a native wasp species, Euodynerus foraminatus, which is part of the family Eumenidae of Hymenoptera. This wasp is known for paralyzing the larvae of Lepidoptera, now including the hemlock moth, in order to feed it to its young. This newfound predator may limit the effects that A. alstroemeriana have in defoliating C. maculatum. == Biological control usage == A. alstroemeriana can now be found throughout the United States. In locations where it has intentionally been released as a biological control agent, the species has rapidly established itself. In already established areas for the moth, like the Pacific Northwest, A. alstroemeriana can cause serious damage to the poison hemlock plant; wherein hundreds of larvae exist on individual host plants. Large areas of Conium maculatum can be killed when caterpillars of A. alstroemeriana exist at these densities. === Biological control limitations === The use of A. alstroemeriana as a biological control method has been limited by the scarcity of information on its life history and feeding habits and the ability to harvest the larvae only in early to mid-spring. Due to C. maculatum‚Äôs ability to serve as a stock for a variety of plant diseases, and to overrun fields growing cattle feed, it has been implicated in killing multiple species of plants. Poison hemlock commonly overruns fields growing feed for livestock, which creates the possibility of killing the animals (through hay contamination). Therefore, agriculturalists have made it a priority to address the widespread nature of poison hemlock. Leaves of Conium maculatum, the hostplant of A. alstroemeriana The number of eggs that A. alstroemeriana lays is known to be associated with the dry weight of the leaf. However, oviposition was not correlated positively with the concentration of alkaloids in the poison hemlock, which varies widely among individual plants. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether increased alkaloids in the plant would increase or decrease the use of the hemlock moth as a biological control. === Behavioral and physiological effects of alkaloids === The effects that the alkaloids in Conium maculatum cause on the moth, both physiologically and behaviorally, are relatively unknown. Persons interested in the biological control capabilities of A. alstroemeriana see behavioral dependency on the host plant as an asset when using this moth as a biological control agent, because this reduces the possibility of the moth affecting other species besides the host plant. Preliminary research has not found any negative physiological effects caused by the high alkaloid toxicity of poison hemlock. The moth may actually benefit from the alkaloids present in its feeding behavior. ==References * Agonopterix alstromeriana at UKmoths Category:Agonopterix Category:Moths of North America Category:Moths described in 1759 Category:Moths of Europe Category:Taxa named by Carl Alexander Clerck ","title":"Agonopterix alstroemeriana"},{"id":"19321089","text":"Mary Hubler is an American attorney and who served as a state legislator in Wisconsin for more than 25 years.

A native of Chicago, Ronan has been a journalist for five decades, starting professionally while a sophomore in high school at age 14 at WKRS-AM in Waukegan, Illinois. He has covered and broken stories for print and broadcast outlets locally, nationally and overseas, since he first went on the air. At age 23, directly out of college, Ronan was hired as a producer at the Mutual Broadcasting System in Washington, D.C. Three of his five years at Mutual were spent as the overnight newsroom editor and later as ‚Äòcharge editor‚Äô responsible for the hourly and half-hourly newscasts during Larry King's all-night talk show, heard on more than 500 stations coast-to-coast. In 1988, Ronan joined CNN as a writer and in 1992 was promoted to the position of on-air network correspondent concerning business and economic stories for CNN and its sister network CNN/Financial News. He has also reported for CBS NewsPath (freelance) and leading stations in Dallas (WFAA-News 8), Atlanta (WAGA-Fox 5) and Washington, D.C. (WJLA-Channel 7).

Accessed August 2007. More specifically, an affirmation is a carefully formatted statement that should be repeated to one's self and written down frequently. For affirmations to be effective, it is said that they need to be present tense, positive, personal and specific.Affirmation Class May 2007. ==New Thought== The New Thought movement is not part of New Age but does share certain practices. This concept has grown popular due to Rhonda Byrne's The Secret (also a 2006 film) These books and teachers express similar ideas to Napoleon Hill's book Think and Grow Rich. Byrne was inspired in particular by Wallace D. Wattles' 1910 book The Science of Getting Rich. Affirmations are also referred to in Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP), Neuro Associative Conditioning \\"NAC\\" as popularized by Anthony Robbins, and hypnosis. A related belief is that a certain critical mass of people with a highly spiritual consciousness will bring about a sudden change in the whole population. And that humans have a responsibility to take part in positive creative activity and to work to heal ourselves, each other and the Earth.Accepting Total and Complete Responsibility: New Age NeoFeminist Violence against Sethna Feminism Psychology.1992; 2: pages 113‚Äì119 In 1984 Louise Hay a Religious Science Practitioner published You Can Heal Your Life, a guide to changing thoughts and beliefs. Hay's affirmations are designed to help the user re-program their thought patterns, the intention being that harmful underlying beliefs which Hay believes psychologically support illness will be replaced with healing beliefs, and thus remove a barrier to healing. ==New Age== Esther Hicks, author of the Law of Attraction series,The Law of Attraction: The Basics of the Teachings of Abraham, by (Spirit) Abraham, Abraham, Esther Hicks, Jerry Hicks, published by Hay House, 2006,, advocates using affirmations when one is already in a state of happiness and peace. New- Age affirmations come in different forms: * spiritual talks * lectures * classes * affirmative images,Various forms of New Age Affirmations Everyday Affirmations Organisation. Accessed February 2013. * affirmative words * affirmative videos * mantra chants Proponents of New-Age affirmations say that with our thoughts, desires and emotions, we create our world. https://www.amazon.com/Affirmations-Visualizations-The-Ultimate-Secret- ebook/dp/B008EDNAP2 Affirmations and Visualizations: The Ultimate Secret by Sakshi Chetana, Inner Light Publishers, 2012, ISBK 978-938-2123-15-6. According to Brendan Baker, founder of The Start of Happiness, affirmations work best when they encompass three elements: # visualisation of the affirmation in one's life # feeling the affirmation in one's physiology # vocalizing the affirmation in a way that one is already congruent with that affirmation. ==Rhonda Britten== According to Rhonda Britten, affirmations work best when combined with acknowledgements because the acknowledgements build up a backlog of results in one's mind to prove that one can do what one is affirming. For example, the acknowledgement \\"I bought a good pair of sneakers and some gym clothes\\" could complement the affirmation \\"I can reach my goal of losing 20 pounds.\\" The goal is to focus on steps one has taken toward accomplishing one's goals rather than criticizing oneself for what one has not yet accomplished, or could theoretically have accomplished but did not. ==Scientific research== A 2009 study found that present tense positive affirmation had a positive effect on people with high self-esteem, but a detrimental effect on those with low self esteem. Individuals with low self- esteem who made present tense (e.g. \\"I am\\") positive affirmations felt worse than individuals who made positive statements but were allowed to consider ways in which the statements were false. Individuals with low self-esteem who made future tense affirmations (e.g. \\"I will\\") saw positive effects. Some studies have found that self-affirmations, which involve writing about one's core values rather than repeating a positive self-statement, can improve performance under stress. An fMRI study in 2016 demonstrated the role of two reward and valuation brain regions (ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex) as primary pathways associated with self-affirmation. Self- related processing and prospection associated regions in the brain were further associated with objectively measured positive behavioral changes following future-oriented self-affirmations. ==See also== * Affirmative prayer * Autogenic training * Cosmic ordering * Creative visualization * Gratitude * Law of Attraction * Rationality * Self-esteem ==References== Category:New Age Category:New Thought beliefs ","title":"Affirmations (New Age)"},{"id":"19321237","text":"Gartland is a village in the municipality of Grong in Tr√∏ndelag county, Norway. It is located on the northwestern side of the river Namsen about north of the municipal center, Medj√•. The village sits along the main European route E6 and the Nordland Line. Directly across the river are the farm areas of Elstad and Rosset. The main sources of income for residents of Gartland is agriculture, forestry, and salmon fishing during the summer. Gartland is a scarcely populated area of about fifteen farms. There is one store in the area which sells building materials. View of the river Namsen, near Gartland In earlier days, the village of Gartland had a general store, post office, school, and Gl√∏shaug Church (the old church for the southern part of the parish of Harran). Now, only the church which is situated on a hill above Gartland, is still in use. The river Namsen is known for excellent salmon fishing. In the 1800s and 1900s, several Englishmen (some of those were noblemen) owned houses along the river at Gartland, where they lived during their stay in Grong. One was Thomas Merthyr Guest, a man of considerable wealth. He bought two Gartland farms and in 1873 the old Gl√∏shaug Church. Grong municipality wanted to tear down the old church and build a new church for Harran, but instead Mr. Guest restored it. The new Harran Church was put up at Fiskum in the village of Harran. Mr. Guest's widow sold the church in 1908 to a local farmer who in turn in 1910 gave the church to the municipality. ==Name== The meaning of the name Gartland (or historically \\"Galtland\\") is uncertain. Some think it is derived from the old name for the local river \\"Galta\\" or \\"Garta\\" (now called Gartlandselva), which flows down into the main river Namsen. Others consider that \\"Galta\\" is a form of the male name Galti.

Agone is set in the land of Harmundia ‚Äì also known as the Twilight Realms. The game was published in French starting in 1999 by the now-defunct company Multisim, which also translated five books into English starting in 2001. There are over 30 books and supplements for the game published in French. ==Materials published in English== Multisim published five products for the game in English. Agone: an Epic Roleplaying Game in the Twilight Realms comprises the rules of the game plus one 'drama' or adventure. The Grey Papers details several 'domains' or liege-lands, and includes one drama. The King of Spring includes rules for playing in a domain, and one drama in three parts. The Grimoire Volume One is a compendium of magic and also includes a drama. Gamemasters Pack includes a gamemaster's screen and a map of Harmundia. ==Setting information== > In the beginning there were Four Muses ‚Äì eternal beings that had the ability > to create substance from nothing. Working together the Muses created the > universe and ‚Äì primarily ‚Äì Harmundia. Seeking perfection they created many > life-forms until they finally create a new Eternal - the Masque. -Agone Core > Rulebook The setting and theme for the game and its world is very Shakespearean in tone. The world and all of its creatures were created by the four Muses. The Masque, the fifth Muse created by the first four, now tries to gain control of the world and everyone in it. Agone is set several millennia after the Masque was created, the Muses little more than a vague memory to most, and Harmundia is split into several kingdoms. The Muses have long ago split into various kinds of phenomena in order to hide from the Masque. All manner of humans and non-humans walk the streets. ==Rules== Unlike roleplaying games like Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition, where characters begin with little or no experience and gain it throughout the game, characters in Agone are meant to be of middle age and high rank. Most will hold offices of nobility or military status. Referred to as \\"The Inspired\\", they will have high scores and be fairly accomplished in their fields of expertise. Agone is more about intrigue than mere combat, and this is made clear from the very beginning, with the game focusing very much on a noire style of gameplay. This also means that PCs have a higher chance of succeeding at a task than is usual for a game, providing a very different style of gaming from Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition, for example. Inspired are very similar to White Wolf‚Äôs Exalted in this respect. All skills and checks are based on a d10 system of Attribute Skill Variable Modifier vs Difficulty or an opposing roll. This convention applies to all rolls in the system. ==Magic== There are three main types of magic in Agone - Ascendancy, The Magical Arts and Invoking. ===Ascendancy=== Ascendancy refers to the Dancers, a phenomenon brought about by the war between the Masque and the Muses. Dancers are small three inch tall humanoids that are essentially the living manifestation of magic. Capable of altering the universe with their eternal dancing, these little creatures are sought after by many mages across the length and breadth of Harmundia. Players can choose from three schools of magic if they desire to use Ascendancy. Jornist, Eclipsist and Obscurantist. Each school relates to how a mage uses Dancers and in turn defines what ‚Äúspells‚Äù are available. Jornists love and care for their Dancers, and as such can cast healing and supportive spells. Eclipsists are opportunists, who trade and negotiate with their Dancers, getting sneakier, subtler spells. Obscurantists torture and torment their Dancers, and so have access to the most aggressive magics. ===The Magical Arts=== The Magical Arts are only available to Inspired characters. This is magic via the use of the various arts of the Muses. Painting, Sculpture, Music and Poetry can be used to perform a series of magical effects ‚Äì again taken from a spell list. The system provides rules for improvised magic ‚Äì allowing a broader range of effects than initially listed. Furthermore, Concordists ‚Äì those who use the Magical Arts ‚Äì can take a higher difficulty to boost their spells to higher levels of effect. ===Invoking=== Invoking is the magic of using the Darkness to bring demons out of the Abyss in order to exchange services. Deals are put into writing on magical contracts called Connivances. Invokers can then bring the demons out of the Abyss by tracing, with magical inks, the shadows cast by the sun on the landscape. == References  *Roliste.com - A French site for the game, listing 31 French-language publications through 2008. *Agone.de - A German site for the game.

The Song of Los (written 1795) is one of William Blake's epic poems, known as prophetic books. The poem consists of two sections, \\"Africa\\" and \\"Asia\\". In the first section Blake catalogues the decline of morality in Europe, which he blames on both the African slave trade and enlightenment philosophers. The book provides a historical context for The Book of Urizen, The Book of Ahania, and The Book of Los, and also ties those more obscure works to The Continental Prophecies, \\"Europe\\" and \\"America\\". The second section consists of Los urging revolution. ==Background== During autumn 1790, Blake moved to Lambeth, Surrey. He had a studio at the new house that he used while writing what were later called his \\"Lambeth Books\\", which included The Song of Los in 1795. Like the others under the title, all aspects of the work, including the composition of the designs, the printing of them, the colouring of them, and the selling of them, happened at his home.Bentley 2003 pp.122‚Äì124 Early sketches for The Song of Los were included in a notebook that contained images were created between 1790 until 1793.Bentley 2003 p. 142 The Song of Los was one of the few works that Blake describes as \\"illuminated printing\\", one of his colour printed works with the coloured ink being placed on the copperplate before printed.Bentley 2003 pp. 149 The pages of the work and images were in size, the size of America a Prophecy and Europe a Prophecy, and the work was occasionally bound together with the other two works.Bentley 2003 p. 154 Only six copies of the work survived, and the work was not listed along with Blake's other works that he sold in either 1818 or 1827. There were no mentions of the work by either Blake's contemporaries or his early biographer Alexander Gilchrist.Bentley 2003 p. 156 ==Poem== ;Scans of Copy E of The Song of Los currently held at the Henry E.

The story of the work begins in Africa with Los singing of Adam, Noah, and Moses and how they were granted laws by Urizen. This involve abstractions being granted to Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato, gospel being given to Jesus, a bible for Mahomet, and a book on war given to Odin. These caused the world to fail, as they were chains that bound the mind:Bentley 2003 pp. 154‚Äì155 In the second half of the work, Asia, Orc creates fire in the mind that causes kings to be startled and an apocalypse of sorts to start: ==Themes== The Song of Los is connected to both America and Europe in that it describes Africa and Asia, which operate as a sort of frame to the other works. As such, the three works are united by the same historical and social themes.Bentley 2003 p. 154 The \\"Africa\\" section of the poem summarizes Blake's historical cycles, which describes a three-part tyrannous power of Egypt, Babylon and Rome. Of this summary, the line \\"The Guardian Prince of Albion burns in his nightly tent\\" appears, which is also the first line of America a Prophecy. The section \\"Asia\\" follows the actions in America a Prophecy and describes a worldwide revolution in an apocalyptic state.Frye 1990 pp. 215‚Äì216 There are many similarities between the way Orc is described within the poem, a pillar of fire that burns oppression away, and how Fingal of Macpherson's Fingal is described. Fingal, in the Ossian work, is a good character that defends the oppressed against the Norse and the Romans. As Fingal fights imperialism, Orc fights against Urizen's rationality, and they both seek to free their people.Mee 2002 pp. 83‚Äì84 The work closely follows the idea of biblical prophecy in that it is brief and concentrated. The first section condenses the history of religion, but does so in a non-chronological manner. His history relies on Urizen to establish the various historical moments as incidents, and the type of order within the poem is similar to the prophetic narrative.Mee 2002 pp. 24‚Äì25 The prophetic image is also embodied within the work by Los, who, when he submits to the system created by Urizen, loses his prophetic ability. In addition to the prophetic aspects, the work deals with religion as a whole. The first section describes the origin of priestcraft and the origins of religion, which is established through a bardic form of poetry.Mee 2002 pp. 104, 122‚Äì123 ==Critical response== Jon Mee claims that \\"Nowhere is Blake's interest in comparative religion more obvious than in The Song of Los\\".Mee 2002 p. 122 ==NotesReferences== *Bentley, G.

At his death, he was the oldest living Roman Catholic bishop from Italy and the fourth oldest in the world. At the time of his elevation to the rank of cardinal in 2014, he was the oldest member of the College of Cardinals. He served as the personal secretary to Pope John XXIII from 1958 to 1963. ==BiographyEarly life and priesthood=== Capovilla with Pope John XXIII. Capovilla was born in Pontelongo in 1915 as the son of Rodolfo Capovilla and Letizia Callegaro. He had one sister: Lia. He was baptized in Pontelongo. His father later died in 1922 and this in turn led Capovilla to move to Mestre in 1929 following a period of precariousness and wandering. Capovilla studied at the Patriarchal Seminary of Venice and was later ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Venice on 23 May 1940 by Cardinal Piazza, the Patriarch of Venice. He was made the capitular master of ceremonies in the Basilica of Saint Mark and also served as a catechist in middle schools. During World War II, Capovilla served in military aviation and later went on to become a Sunday preacher at Radio Venezia from 1945 to 1953. He was also made the director of the diocesan weekly La Voce di San Marco in 1949. He formed a close friendship with Cardinal Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli (later Pope John XXIII) when the cardinal was the Patriarch of Venice. He commenced his service under Roncalli on 15 March 1953. He claimed, however, to have never called himself Roncalli's friend, but considered him his bishop, his father and his patriarch. He remained at Roncalli's side as papal secretary after Roncalli's election to the papacy in 1958 until his death in 1963. Capovilla served as Roncalli's conclavist at the conclave of 1958 that saw the latter's election. He was confirmed as the new pope's secretary on the night of the election and was made a Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on 12 December 1958. After the death of John XXIII in 1963, Pope Paul VI appointed him as a prelate di anticamera and expert to the Second Vatican Council. ===Episcopate and cardinalate=== Capovilla was appointed bishop of the Archdiocese of Chieti-Vasto on 26 June 1967 and consecrated on 16 July 1967 by Pope Paul VI. The co-consecrators were Augusto Gianfranceshi and Jacques-Paul Martin. He chose as his motto the one used by Pope John XXIII. On 23 September 1971 he was appointed prelate to the Loreto Prelature and the Titular archbishop of Mesembria. His resignation from his position in Loreto was accepted on 10 December 1988. On 12 January 2014 Pope Francis announced that Capovilla would be elevated to the College of Cardinals on 22 February 2014. Capovilla said it was a \\"sign of attention to all those thousands of priests around the world who have spent their lives in silence, in poverty, in obedience, happy to serve God and our humble people, who need, as Pope Francis continually says, tenderness, friendship, respect and love.\\" Capovilla received a dispensation and did not attend the consistory where he was named cardinal. He said: \\"I'm not strong enough and I feel uncomfortable at the thought of meeting so many people.\\" He was named Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Trastevere. Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Dean of the College of Cardinals, bestowed the biretta and cardinal's ring upon Capovilla on 1 March. He died in Bergamo on 26 May 2016.Loris Francesco Capovilla, Pope John‚Äôs Aide and ‚ÄòSpiritual Son,‚Äô Dies at 100 For his entire cardinalate, he was the oldest living Cardinal. In 1964, he published a memoir, The Heart and Mind of John XXIII: His Secretary's Intimate Recollection (published by Hawthorn Books). As of 2013, he resided in Sotto il Monte Giovanni XXIII, about northeast of Milan. ==See also== *Cardinals created by Francis ==References *Loris Francesco Capovilla *Loreto Site *Chieti-Vasto Site * - - - Category:1915 births Category:2016 deaths Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Italian titular archbishops Category:Archbishops of Chieti Category:Participants in the Second Vatican Council Category:Cardinals created by Pope Francis Category:Italian cardinals Category:Italian centenarians Category:Regia Aeronautica personnel of World War II Category:Members of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre Category:Commanders Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany ","title":"Loris Francesco Capovilla"},{"id":"19321286","text":"Buhoodle (, ), also known as Bohotle, is a city in the Togdheer region of Somalia. It is a prominent border town for movements of goods to and from Somaliland, Somalia and the Somali region of Ethiopia. The surrounding district is rich in both livestock and fledgeling agriculture. It has primary schools, secondary schools and universities. Buhoodle is a medium-sized city that has clinics, hospitals, electricity and all the amenities required of a city. It is notable for being the birthplace of the father of the Somali nation, Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, (Mad Mullah).Hoehne, Markus V. \\"Dervish State (Somali).\\" The Encyclopedia of Empire (2016).The city is currently controlled by Khaatumo state. However, the autonomous administrations of Somaliland and Puntland both claim Buuhoodle. ==Overview== Buhoodle is located on the border between Somalia and Ethiopia. It serves as a commercial hub for the movement of goods to and from Bosaso, Garowe, Las Anod, Galkayo, Wardheer, Burao, the surrounding area, and the Ogaden. The city is rich in livestock as well as agriculture, and has grown considerably since 1993. Today, Buuhoodle has modern communication systems such as cell phones, land-line phones, and internet services. It also has modern hotels, as well as a new hospital constructed in 2008. Additionally, a water supply network was built in 2010 by young local residents. Buhoodle and its environs are disputed by the Puntland and Somaliland autonomous macro-regions of Somalia. Buhodle is a part of both Puntland and Somaliland administrations. Somaliland troops entered the city in May 2010 but failed to gain support from the local civilians in the town. The local Buuhodle civilians expressed support for Puntland state due to close clan kinship. A brutal conflict left at least 100 dead on 190 wounded. Conflicts later flared up again the following year, but were eventually resolved in early 2012, with the official withdrawal of Somaliland troops to a 50 km radius of the city's perimeter. In June 2014, the Puntland government launched a new tree-planting campaign in the state, with the regional Ministry of Environment, Wildlife and Tourism slated to plant 25,000 trees by the end of the year. Buuhoodle is among the 5 cities and towns earmarked for the reforestation initiative, which also include Garowe, Bosaso, Qardho, and Galkayo. The campaign is part of a broader partnership between the Puntland authorities and EU to set up various environmental protection measures in the region, with the aim of promoting reforestation and afforestation. ==Darwiish period== 1912 was a tumultuous year for the Dhulbahante clans inhabiting Bohotle and the Ain valley. The clans of Bohotle being allies of the British Empire, were set upon and attacked by Hassan and his Dervish army, forcing them to evacuate and seek refuge in Burao, Berbera and Haud among the Isaaq clans. British colonial governor Horace Byatt reported that 800 dhulbahante refugees arrived in Berbera, but feared that they could not be protected nor fed properly, stating that only 300 native infantry and 200 King's African Rifles were in Berbera and insufficient to hold off a Dervish attack. Byatt also raised concerns for the Dhulbahante refugees en route to British controlled territory and the possibility of them being looted by hostile clans, particularly the Habr Yunis. Baron Ismay's intelligence report on the Dervish raids on the Ali Gheri and the Dolbahanta clan's of Bohotle > No important move was made till November 1911, when he successfully attacked > the Ali gheri at Bohotleh. He followed this up in February 1912 with an > attack on the Dolbahanta at Eildab, In this engagement our people lost all > their stock and were reduced to starvation. They flocked to Berbera > demanding to be supported. Yet another attack on Bohotleh in March resulted > in the remaining Dolbahanta in that vicinity being looted and driven out. > Bohotleh remained in Dervish hands. Bristish colonial administrator Sir Douglas Jardine describing the plight of the Dhulbahante writes : > The most pitiful lot of all fell to certain sections of the Dolbahanta. > Ousted from their ancestral grazing grounds by the Mullah's advance and > bereft of all their stock, the remnants wandered like veritable Ishmaelites > in the Ishaak country, deprived of Asylum and almost all access to the > coast. The Mad mullah of Somaliland, p.158 These conditions were not limited to the Dhulbahante only but encompassed the entire territory of British Somaliland Protectorate. The British retreat to coastal outposts left the interior country in a state of power vacuum that heralded a period acute distress, scarcity and violence that came to be known locally as Xaaraame Cune \\"time of eating filth\\". An estimated one third of the entire population of Somaliland perished during this period. ==Demographics== The broader Buuhoodle District has a total population of 38,428 residents. Buuhoodle is primarily inhabited by people from the Somali ethnic group, with the Dhulbahante especially well-represented. ==Education== Buuhoodle has a number of academic institutions. According to the Puntland Ministry of Education, there are 12 primary schools, 3 high schools and 2 universities in the Buuhoodle District. Among these are H/dh Abu-Bakar Sadiq, H/dh Al-Najax, H/dh Al-Furqan and so on Secondary schools in the area include Howd and Samatar Bahman. For Health Education, Buhodle College Of Health Science. For higher studies, Buuhoodle is served by the East Africa University (EAU). The institution opened a seventh branch in the town on 18 April 2012 to serve pupils from the Cayn region. ==Notable residents== *Abdihakim Abdullahi Haji Omar ‚Äì Vice President of Puntland *Mohammed Abdullah Hassan ‚Äì leader of the Dervish movement *Saado Ali Warsame ‚Äì Singer & MP in the Federal Parliament of Somalia *Ismail Mire - Somali poet and Dervish movement general *Ali Dhuh - Somali poet *Saleban Essa Ahmed 'Xaglatoosiye' - Somaliland Minister of Health & former SSC militia leader ==NotesReferences== *Buuhoodle, Somalia Category:Ethiopia‚ÄìSomalia border crossings Category:Territorial disputes of Somalia Category:Populated places in Togdheer ","title":"Buuhoodle"},{"id":"19321312","text":"Figureheads Compilation is the sixth full-length album released by the Japanese music group Ellegarden.

A nightclub, music club, or club, is an entertainment venue and bar that usually operates late into the night. A nightclub is generally distinguished from regular bars, pubs, or taverns by the inclusion of a stage for live music, one or more dance floor areas and a DJ booth, where a DJ plays recorded music. The upmarket nature of nightclubs can be seen in the inclusion of VIP areas in some nightclubs, for celebrities and their guests. Nightclubs are much more likely than pubs or sports bars to use bouncers to screen prospective clubgoers for entry. Some nightclub bouncers do not admit people with informal clothing or gang apparel as part of a dress code. The busiest nights for a nightclub are Friday and Saturday night. Most clubs or club nights cater to certain music genres, such as house music or hip hop. Many clubs have recurring club nights on different days of the week. Most club nights focus on a particular genre or sound for branding effects. ==HistoryEarly history=== the Gruenwald (later Roosevelt) Hotel, New Orleans opened in 1912; said by some to be one of the first nightclubs in the United States In the United States, New York increasingly became the national capital for tourism and entertainment. Grand hotels were built for the upscale visitors.Justin Kaplan, When the Astors Owned New York: Blue Bloods and Grand Hotels in a Gilded Age (2006). New York's theater district gradually moved northward during this half century, from The Bowery up Broadway through Union Square and Madison Square, settling around Times Square at the end of the 19th century. Edwin Booth and Lillian Russell were among the Broadway stars.Lewis A. Erenberg, Steppin'Out: New York Nightlife and the Transformation of American Culture (1984) Prostitutes served a wide variety of clientele, from sailors on leave to playboys.Timothy J. Gilfoyle, City of eros: New York City, prostitution, and the commercialization of sex, 1790-1920 (1994). The first nightclubs appeared in New York City in the 1840s and 1850s, including McGlory's and the Haymarket. They enjoyed a national reputation for live music, dance, and vaudeville acts. They tolerated unlicensed liquor, commercial sex, and gambling cards, chiefly Faro. Practically all gambling was illegal in the city (except upscale horseracing tracks), and regular payoffs to political and police leadership was necessary. Prices were high and they were patronized by an upscale audience. Timothy Gilfoyle called them \\"the first nightclubs.\\"Timothy J. Gilfoyle, \\"Scorsese's Gangs of New York: Why Myth Matters.\\" Journal of Urban History 29.5 (2003): 620-630 at p. 624.Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace, Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898 (1999) p 1148 By contrast, Owney Geoghegan ran the toughest nightclub in New York, 1880‚Äì83. It catered to a downscale clientele and besides the usual illegal liquor, gambling, and prostitution, it featured nightly fistfights, and occasional shootings, stabbings, and police raids.Lewis A. Erenberg, Steppin' Out: New York Nightlife and the Transformation of American Culture, 1890-1930 (1981). Webster Hall is credited as the first modern nightclub, being built in 1886 and starting off as a \\"social hall\\", originally functioning as a home for dance and political activism events. === Jukebox and Prohibition === The jukebox (a coin-operated record-player) was invented in 1889 by Louis Glass and his partner William S. Arnold, who were both managers of the Pacific Phonograph Co. The first jukebox was installed in the Palais Royale Saloon, San Francisco on 23 November 1889, becoming an overnight sensation. The advent of the jukebox fueled the Prohibition-era boom in underground illegal speakeasy bars, which needed music but could not afford a live band and needed precious space for paying customers. Webster Hall stayed open, with rumors circulating of Al Capone's involvement and police bribery. From about 1900 to 1920, working class Americans would gather at honky tonks or juke joints to dance to music played on a piano or a jukebox. With the repeal of Prohibition in February 1933, nightclubs were revived, such as New York's 21 Club, Copacabana, El Morocco, and the Stork Club. These nightclubs featured big bands. === Pre-WWII === The \\"Kakadu\\" (1919‚Äì1937), one of Berlin's best-known dance- and nightclubs since the early 1920s, offered a bar, a dance floor, live music played by jazz band, and cabaret. Pre-World War II Soho in London offered caf√© society, cabaret, burlesque jazz, and bohemian clubs similar to those in New York, Paris, and Berlin. Nightclubs were tied very much to the idea of \\"high society\\", via famous organisations such as the Kit Kat Club (which took its name from the political Kit-Cat Club in Pall Mall, London) and the Caf√© de Paris. In this era, nightclubbing was generally the preserve of those with money. In Germany during the Golden Twenties, there was a need to dance away the memories of the First World War. In Berlin, where a \\"tango fever\\" had already swept dancing establishments in the early 1910s, 899 venues with a dancing licence were registered by 1930, including the Moka Efti, Casanova, Scala, DELPHI-Palast, Kakadu, Femina-Palast, Palais am Zoo, Gourmenia-Palast, Uhlandeck, and the Haus Vaterland. In the 1920s, the nightlife of the city was dominated by party drugs such as cocaine. Hundreds of venues in the city, which at the time had a sinful reputation, offered in addition to bars, stages, and dance floors an erotic nightlife, such as small booths where lovers could withdraw to for intimate moments. These venues were aimed at rich and poor people, gays, lesbians, nudists, and gangsters alike. In 1930s Shanghai, the big clubs were The Paramount Club (opened in 1933) and Ciro's (opened in 1936). Other clubs of the era were the Metropole and the Canidrome. Jazz bands, big bands, and singers performed for a bowtied clientele. The Paramount and Ciro's in particular were fiercely rivalrous and attracted many customers from the underworld. Shanghai's clubs fells into decline after the Japanese invasion of 1937 and eventually closed. The Paramount reopened after the communist victory in 1949 as The Red Capitol Cinema, dedicated to Maoist propaganda films, before fading into obscurity. It reopened as The Paramount in 2008. === World War II === In Occupied France, jazz and bebop music, and the jitterbug dance were banned by the Nazis as \\"decadent American influences\\", so as an act of resistance, people met at hidden basements called discoth√®ques where they danced to jazz and swing music, which was played on a single turntable when a jukebox was not available. These discoth√®ques were also patronized by anti-Vichy youth called zazous. There were also underground discoth√®ques in Nazi Germany patronized by anti-Nazi youth called the \\"Swing Kids\\". ===Post-WWII: Emergence of the disc jockey and discoth√®que=== The end of World War II saw the beginning of a transformation in the nightclub: no longer the preserve of a moneyed elite, over several decades, the nightclub steadily became a mass phenomenon. In Germany, the first discoth√®que on record that involved a disc jockey was Scotch-Club, which opened in 1959. Its, and therefore the world's, first DJ was 19-year-old local cub reporter Klaus Quirini who had been sent to write a story about the strange new phenomenon of public record-playing; fueled by whisky, he jumped on stage and started announcing records as he played them and took the stage-name DJ Heinrich. In Harlem, Connie's Inn and the Cotton Club were popular venues for white audiences. Before 1953 and some years thereafter, most bars and nightclubs used a jukebox or mostly live bands. In Paris, at a club named Le Whisky √† Gogo, founded in 1947 on the rue de Seine by Paul Pacine, R√©gine Zylberberg in 1953 laid down a dance floor, suspended coloured lights, and replaced the jukebox with two turntables that she operated herself so there would be no breaks between the music. This was the world's first-ever \\"discoth√®que\\". The Whisky √† Gogo set into place the standard elements of the modern post-World War II discoth√®que-style nightclub. By the end of the 1950s, several of the coffee bars in London's Soho introduced afternoon dancing. These prototype discoth√®ques were nothing like modern-day nightclubs, as they were unlicensed, daytime venues where coffee was the drink of choice and that catered to a very young public ‚Äî mostly made up of French and Italians working illegally, mostly in catering, to learn English, as well as au pair girls from most of western Europe. The most famous was Les Enfants Terribles at 93 Dean St. Initially opening as a coffee-shop, it was run by Betty Passes who claimed to be the inventor of disco after she pioneered the idea of dancing to records at her premises' basement in 1957. It stayed popular into the 1960s. It later became a 1940s-themed club called the Black Gardenia but has since closed. The Flamingo Club on D'Arblay Street ran between 1952 and 1967 and was famous for its role in the growth of rhythm and blues and jazz in the UK. It earned a controversial reputation with gangsters and prostitutes said to have been frequent visitors in the 1960s, along with famous musicians including The Beatles. ===1960s=== Discoth√®ques began to appear in New York City in 1964: the Village Vanguard offered dancing between jazz sets; Shepheard's, locates in the basement of the Drake Hotel, was small but popular; L'Interdit and Il Mio (at Delmonico's) were private; the El Morocco had an on-premises disco called Garrison; and the Stork Club had one in its Shermaine suite. Larger discos opened in 1966: Cheetah, with room for 2000 dancers, the Electric Circus, and Dom.Mark Caldwell, New York Night: The Mystique and Its History, 2005, , p. 314 While the discoth√®que swept Europe throughout the 1960s, it did not become widely popular in the United States until the 1970s, where the first rock and roll generation preferred rough and tumble bars and taverns to nightclubs until the disco era. In the early 1960s, Mark Birley opened a members-only discoth√®que nightclub, Annabel's, in Berkeley Square, London. In 1962, the Peppermint Lounge in New York City became popular and is the place where go-go dancing originated. Sybil Burton opened the \\"Arthur\\" discoth√®que in 1965 on East 54th Street in Manhattan on the site of the old El Morocco nightclub and it became the first, foremost, and hottest disco in New York City through 1969.Time magazine. (14 May 1965). Brewster, B.; Broughton, F. Last Night a Disc Jockey Saved My Life, Grove Press, 2000, pp. 62‚Äì64. In Germany in the 1960s, when Berlin was divided by the Wall, Munich became Germany's epicenter of nightlife for the next two decades with numerous nightclubs and discoth√®ques such as Big Apple, PN hit- house, Tiffany, Domicile, Hot Club, Piper Club, Why Not, Crash, Sugar Shack, the underwater discoth√®que Yellow Submarine, and Mrs. Henderson, where stars such as Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Freddie Mercury, and David Bowie went in and out and which led to artists such as Giorgio Moroder, Donna Summer, and Mercury settling in the city. In 1967, Germany's first large-scale discoth√®que opened in Munich as the club Blow Up, which because of its extravagance and excesses quickly gained international reputation. In parallel, the hippie movement spawned Britain's first club for psychedelic music, the UFO Club (at the Blarney Club, 31 Tottenham Court Road, London from 23 Dec 1966 to Oct 1967) which then became the Middle Earth club (at 43 King Street) and eventually the Roundhouse in 1968. Both the UFO Club and Middle Earth were short-lived but saw performances by artists such as house-band Pink Floyd, Soft Machine, Procol Harum, Fairport Convention, Arthur Brown, and Jimi Hendrix; DJ John Peel was a regular. These clubs germinated what would later become the underground gig scene of the 1970s and 1980s, at venues such as the 100 Club and The Clarendon in Hammersmith. During the 1960s, the Clarendon was a country & western club, having earlier been an upmarket jazz, dining, and dancing club in the pre-War era. In the north of England, the distinct northern soul movement spanned Manchester's Twisted Wheel Club, the Blackpool Mecca, Cleethorpes Pier, and the Wigan Casino, famous for the acrobatic dancing of its clubgoers; each of these clubs was famous for all-nighters. ===1970s: Disco=== Disco has its roots in the underground club scene. During the early 1970s in New York City, disco clubs were places where oppressed or marginalized groups such as gay people, African Americans, Latinos, Italian Americans, and Jews could party without following male to female dance protocol or exclusive club policies. Discoth√®ques had a law where for every three men, there was one woman. The women often sought these experiences to seek safety in a venue that embraced the independent woman ‚Äî with an eye to one or more of the same or opposite sex or none. Although the culture that surrounded disco was progressive in dance couples, cross-genre music, and a push to put the physical over the rational, the role of women looked to be placed in the role of safety net. It brought together people from different backgrounds.Lawrence, Tim. \\"Disco and the Queering of the Dance Floor\\". Cultural Studies 25.2 (2011): 230‚Äì43. These clubs acted as safe havens for homosexual partygoers to dance in peace and away from public scrutiny. By the late 1970s, many major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes centered on discoth√®ques, nightclubs, and private loft parties where DJs would play disco hits through powerful PA systems for the dancers. The DJs played \\"a smooth mix of long single records to keep people 'dancing all night long'\\". Some of the most prestigious clubs had elaborate lighting systems that throbbed to the beat of the music. The genre of disco has changed through the years. It is classified both as a musical genre and as a nightclub; and in the late seventies, disco began to act as a safe haven for social outcasts. This club culture that originated in downtown New York, was attended by a variety of different ethnicities and economic backgrounds. It was an inexpensive activity to indulge in, and discos united a multitude of different minorities in a way never seen before; including those in the gay and psychedelic communities. The music ultimately was what brought people together.Dyer, Richard. Only Entertainment. Routledge, 2002. Some cities had disco dance instructors or dance schools that taught people how to do popular disco dances such as \\"touch dancing\\", the \\"hustle\\", and the \\"cha-cha-cha\\". There were also disco fashions that discotheque-goers wore for nights out at their local disco, such as sheer, flowing Halston dresses for women and shiny polyester Qiana shirts for men. Disco clubs and \\"hedonistic loft parties\\" had a club culture with many Italian American, African American, gay, and Hispanic people. In addition to the dance and fashion aspects of the disco club scene, there was also a thriving drug subculture, particularly for recreational drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights, such as cocaineGootenberg, Paul. \\"Between Coca and Cocaine: A Century or More of U.S.-Peruvian Drug Paradoxes, 1860‚Äì1980\\". Hispanic American Historical Review, 83:1, February 2003, pp. 119‚Äì150. He says that \\"The relationship of cocaine to 1970s disco culture cannot be stressed enough; ...\\" (nicknamed \\"blow\\"), amyl nitrite \\"poppers\\", and the \\"other quintessential 1970s club drug Quaalude, which suspended motor coordination and turned one's arms and legs to Jell-O\\". The \\"massive quantities of drugs ingested in discotheques by newly liberated gay men produced the next cultural phenomenon of the disco era: rampant promiscuity and public sex. While the dance floor was the central arena of seduction, actual sex usually took place in the nether regions of the disco: bathroom stalls, exit stairwells, and so on. In other cases, the disco became a kind of \\"main course\\" in a hedonist's menu for a night out.\\" Famous 1970s discoth√®ques included celebrity hangouts such as Manhattan's Studio 54, which was operated by Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager. Studio 54 was notorious for the hedonism that went on within; the balconies were known for sexual encounters, and drug use was rampant. Its dance floor was decorated with an image of the \\"Man in the Moon\\" that included an animated cocaine spoon. Other famous 1970s discoth√®ques in New York City included Manhattan's Starship Discovery One at 350 West 42nd Street, Roseland Ballroom, Xenon, The Loft, the Paradise Garage, a recently renovated Copacabana, and Aux Puces, one of the first gay disco bars. The album cover of Saturday Night Band's Come On and Dance, Dance features two dancers in the Starship Discovery One. In San Francisco, there was the Trocadero Transfer, the I-Beam, and the End Up. In Spain during the 1970s, the first clubs and discos opened in Ibiza, an island which had been a popular destination for hippie travelers since the 1960s and now was experiencing a tourist boom. The first ever \\"Superclub\\" in Ibiza was the now-abandoned \\"Festival Club\\" at Sant Josep de sa Talaia, which was built between 1969 and 1972 and serviced tourists who were bused in until it closed in 1974. Responding to this influx of visitors, locals opened the first large clubs Pacha, Amnesia, and the Ku-club (renamed Privilege in 1995). By the early 1980s, the term \\"disco\\" had largely fallen out of favour in most of the English-speaking world. ===1970s: Glam and punk rock=== In parallel to the disco scene and quite separate from it, the glam rock (T. Rex, David Bowie, Roxy Music) and punk rock cultures in London produced their own set of nightclubs, starting with Billy's at 69 Dean Street (famous for its David Bowie nights), Louise's on Poland Street (the first true punk club and hangout of the Sex Pistols, Siouxsie Sioux plus the Bromley Contingent, and then Blitz (the home of the many famous Blitz Kids). Crackers was a key part of the jazz- funk scene and also the early punk scene via its Vortex nights. The underground warehouse party scene was kicked off by Toyah Willcox with her Mayhem Studios at Patcham Terrace in Battersea. The emergence of this highly experimental artistic scene in London can be credited almost entirely to Rusty Egan, Steve Strange, the Bromley Contingent's Philip Sallon, and Chris Sullivan. Dozens of clubs came and went, but one of the original batch, Gaz's Rockin' Blues, is still going as of 2020. The new wave music scene grew out of Blitz and the Cha Cha Club at 180 Hungerford Lane in Charing Cross. Whilst overall, the club scene was fairly small and hidden away in basements, cellars, and warehouses, London's complicated mix of punk, New Romantic, New Wave, and gay clubs in the late 1970s and early 1980s paved the way for acid house to flourish in the late 1980s, initially with Shoom and two acid house nights at Heaven: Spectrum and Rage. In the north of England, what later became the \\"alternative\\" scene was centred around the Roxy/Bowie room at Pips in Manchester, which opened in 1972; as small as this scene was, it predated Blitz in London by eight years and The Ha√ßienda in Manchester by 10. ===1980s: New wave, post-punk, goth, rave, and acid house=== A disc jockey (DJ) mixing vinyl records on turntables (Inland Empire, 2009) During the 1980s, during the New Romantic movement, London had a vibrant nightclub scene, which included clubs like The Blitz, the Batcave, the Camden Palace, and Club for Heroes. These clubs grew out of the earlier Mandrake and Billy's (later Gossip's) at 69 Dean Street, in the basement below the ground floor Gargoyle Club. Both music and fashion embraced the aesthetics of the movement. Bands included Depeche Mode, Yazoo, The Human League, Duran Duran, Eurythmics, and Ultravox. Reggae-influenced bands included Boy George and Culture Club, and electronic vibe bands included Visage. At London nightclubs, young men would often wear make-up and young women would wear men's suits. Leigh Bowery's Taboo (which opened in 1985) bridged the New Romantic and acid house scenes. With the birth of house music in the mid-1980s and then acid house, kickstarted by Chris Sullivan's The Wag Club (on the site of the earlier The Flamingo Club), a cultural revolution swept around the world; first in Chicago at the Warehouse and then London and New York City. London clubs such as Clink Street, Revolution in Progress (RiP), Philip Sallon's The Mudd Club, Danny Rampling's Shoom (starting in December 1987 in the basement of Southwark's Fitness Centre and here Andrew Weatherall played), Paul Oakenfold's Spectrum, and Nicky Holloway's The Trip fused the eclecticism and ethos of [Ibiza with the new electronic music from the USA. The largest UK cities like Birmingham, Leeds (The Orbit), Liverpool (Quadrant Park and 051), Manchester (The Ha√ßienda), Newcastle, and Swansea, and several key European places like Paris (Les Bains Douches), Ibiza (Pacha), and Rimini, also played a significant role in the evolution of clubbing, DJ culture, and nightlife. Significant New York nightclubs of the period were Area, Danceteria, and The Limelight. However, the seismic shift in nightlife was the emergence of rave culture in the UK. A mixture of free and commercial outdoor parties were held in fields, warehouses, and abandoned buildings, by various groups such as Biology, Sunrise, Confusion, Hedonism, Rage & Energy, and many others. This laid the ground for what was unfold in the 1990s, initially in the UK, Germany, and the US and then worldwide from the 2000s onwards. ===1990s, 2000s, and 2010s=== Club DJ using digital CDJ players for mixing music (Munich, 2010s) In Europe and North America, nightclubs play disco-influenced dance music such as house music, techno, and other dance music styles such as electronica, breakbeat, and trance. Most nightclubs in major cities in the U.S. that have an early adulthood clientele, play hip hop, dance-pop, house, and/or trance music. These clubs are generally the largest and most frequented of all of the different types of clubs. Techno clubs are popular around the world since the early 1990s. Famous examples of the 1990s include Tresor, E-Werk, and Bunker in Berlin; Omen and Dorian Gray in Frankfurt; Ultraschall, , and Natraj Temple in Munich; Stammheim in Kassel; and The Ha√ßienda in Manchester. The Castlemorton Common Festival in 1992 triggered the UK government's Criminal Justice Act, which largely ended the rave movement by criminalizing any gathering of 20 or more people where music (\\"sounds wholly or predominantly characterized by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats\\") was played. Commercial clubs immediately capitalized on the situation causing a boom in \\"Superclubs\\" in the UK, such as Ministry of Sound (London), Renaissance, and Cream (Liverpool). These developed the club-as-spectacle theme pioneered in the 1970s and 1980s by Pacha (Ibiza) and Juliana's Tokyo (Japan), creating a global phenomenon; however, many clubs such as The Cross in London, preserved the more underground feel of the former era. Since the late 2000s, two venues that received particularly high media attention were Berghain in Berlin and Fabric in London. In some languages, nightclubs are also referred to as \\"discos\\" or \\"discoth√®ques\\" ( or (outdated; nowadays: ); ; Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish: discoteca, antro (common in Mexico), and boliche (common in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay), discos is commonly used in all others in Latin America). In Japanese „Éá„Ç£„Çπ„Ç≥, disuko refers to an older, smaller, less fashionable venue; while „ÇØ„É©„Éñ, kurabu refers to a more recent, larger, more popular venue. The term night is used to refer to an evening focusing on a specific genre, such as \\"retro music night\\" or a \\"singles night.\\" In Hong Kong and China, nightclub is used as a euphemism for a hostess club, and the association of the term with the sex trade has driven out the regular usage of the term. Video art has been used in nightclubs since the 1960s, but especially with the rise of electronic dance music since the late 1980s. VJing gained more and more importance. VJs (\\"video jockeys\\") mix video content in a similar manner that DJs mix audio content, creating a visual experience that is intended to complement the music. === 2020s === The 2020s started with the global COVID-19 pandemic, which closed nightclubs worldwide - the first ever synchronized, global shutdown of nightlife. In response, online \\"virtual nightclubs\\" developed, hosted on video-conferencing platforms such as Zoom.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-14/virtual-nightlife- grows-past-dj-livestreams-to-paid-zoom-clubs ==Entry criteria== Many nightclubs use bouncers to choose who can enter the club, or specific lounges or VIP areas. Some nightclubs have one group of bouncers to screen clients for entry at the main door, and then other bouncers to screen for entry to other dance floors, lounges, or VIP areas. For legal reasons, in most jurisdictions, the bouncers have to check ID to ensure that prospective patrons are of legal drinking age and that they are not intoxicated already. In this respect, a nightclub's use of bouncers is no different from the use of bouncers by pubs and sports bars. However, in some nightclubs, bouncers may screen patrons using criteria other than just age and intoxication status, such as dress code, guest list inclusion, and physical appearance. This type of screening is used by clubs to make their club \\"exclusive\\", by denying entry to people who are not dressed in a stylish enough manner. While some clubs have written dress codes, such as no ripped jeans, no jeans, no gang clothing, and so on, other clubs may not post their policies. As such, the club's bouncers may deny entry to anybody at their discretion. The guest list is typically used for private parties and events held by celebrities. At private parties, the hosts may only want their friends to attend. At celebrity events, the hosts may wish the club to only be attended by A-list individuals. ===Cover charge=== Clubgoers dancing at an upmarket nightclub (Miami, 2008) In most cases, entering a nightclub requires a flat fee, called a cover charge. Some clubs waive or reduce the cover charge for early arrivers, special guests, or women (in the United Kingdom this latter option is illegal under the Equality Act 2010, but the law is rarely enforced, and open violations are frequent). Friends of the doorman or the club owner may gain free entrance. Sometimes, especially at larger clubs in Continental European countries, one gets only a pay card at the entrance, on which all money spent in the discoth√®que (often including the entrance fee) is marked. Sometimes, entrance fee and cloakroom costs are paid by cash, and only the drinks in the club are paid using a pay card. Some clubs, especially those located in Las Vegas, offer patrons the chance to sign up on their guest list. A club's guest list is a special promotion the venue offers separate from general admission. Each club has different benefits when you are signed up on their guest list. Some of the benefits of being on a club's guestlist are: free entry, discounted cover charge, the ability to skip the line, and free drinks. Many clubs hire a promotions team to find and sign up guest to the club's guest list. ===Dress code=== Light-up club wear for performances, glowing under black lights. (Barcelona, 2003) Many nightclubs enforce a dress code in order to ensure a certain type of clientele is in attendance at the venue. Some upscale nightclubs ban attendees from wearing trainers (sneakers) or jeans while other nightclubs will advertise a vague \\"dress to impress\\" dress code that allows the bouncers to discriminate at will against those vying for entry to the club. Many exceptions are made to nightclub dress codes, with denied entry usually reserved for the most glaring rule breakers or those thought to be unsuitable for the party. Certain nightclubs like fetish nightclubs may apply a dress code (BDSM) to a leather-only, rubber-only, or fantasy dress code. The dress code criterion is often an excuse for discriminatory practices, such as in the case of Carpenter v. Limelight Entertainment Ltd. ===Exclusive boutique clubs=== Large cosmopolitan cities that are home to large affluent populations (such as Atlanta, Chicago, Sydney, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Miami, New York City, and London) often have what are known as exclusive boutique nightclubs. This type of club typically has a capacity of less than 200 occupants and a very strict entrance policy, which usually requires an entrant to be on the club's guest list. While not explicitly members+only clubs, such as Soho House, exclusive nightclubs operate with a similar level of exclusivity. As they are off limits to most of the public and ensure the privacy of guests, many celebrities favor these types of clubs to other, less exclusive, clubs that do not cater as well to their needs. Another differentiating feature of exclusive nightclubs is, in addition to being known for a certain type of music, they are known for having a certain type of crowd, for instance, a fashion-forward, affluent crowd or a crowd with a high concentration of fashion models. Many exclusive boutique clubs market themselves as being a place to socialize with models and celebrities. Affluent patrons who find that marketing message appealing are often willing to purchase bottle service at a markup of several times the retail cost of the liquor. London's most exclusive boutique nightclubs include Amika, Cirque le Soir, Project, The Box, and The Rose Club. They are frequently visited by an array of A-list celebrities from the fashion, film, and music industries. All are located in London's prestigious Mayfair, except Cirque le Soir and The Box, which are both located in Soho. Los Angeles also contains exclusive clubs such as Warwick, owned by Eli Wehbe, which is frequented by celebrities such as G-Eazy and Halsey. ===Guest list=== Many nightclubs operate a \\"guest list\\" that allows certain attendees to enter the club for free or at a reduced rate. Some nightclubs have a range of unpublished guest list options ranging from free, to reduced, to full price with line by-pass privileges only. Nightclub goers on the guest list often have a separate queue and sometimes a separate entrance from those used by full price-paying attendees. It is common for the guestlist line-up to be no shorter or even longer than the full-paying or ticketed queues. Some nightclubs allow clubbers to register for the guest list through their websites. Web applications have been developed to manage nightclubs' guest list process. === Substance abuse === A distinctive feature of a nightclub is also the fact that it can serve as a hub for substances like alcohol, which could affect third parties, creating a negative externality of consumption. The culture of nightclubs create a sense of consuming alcohol in larger quantities than usual. A study in S√£o Paulo looking to identify causes of binge drinking found that environmental variables such as more number of dancefloors, higher level of noise, and ‚Äòall you can drink‚Äô services to be significantly linked to binge drinking. Furthermore, the culture created around nightclubs to indulge in ‚Äòpre-drinking‚Äô accentuates the amount of alcohol consumed, which leads to more problems in residential areas off nightclub premises (for example, a higher chance of participating in a fight). Moreover, young consumers of nightclubs who tend to binge drink are often found to be less safe during sexual encounters as a result of the alcohol, which could lead to the spread of STDs. A big issue that stems from alcohol and drug abuse in nightclubs is transportation. Private cars are the most prominent mode of transportation to and from nightclubs, and the use of drugs and alcohol in nightclubs are reported to increase the number of risky behaviors, such as driving under the influence or taking a lift from someone under the influence. A portion of driving customers, despite drinking less than non-driving customers, are still observed to have alcohol levels above the legal threshold after a night out at a nightclub. Number of patients with alcohol-related serious injury and trauma to the emergency department at different hours of the day, before and after a change in alcohol legislation that made partying stricter in the Sydney CBD Entertainment Precinct. These policies include: increased monitoring, increased strictness on entry of clubs, and sharing of information between venues to prevent intoxicated patrons to access different places. On average, there is significant decreases in any alcohol-related injury. ==Photography== At high end or exclusive nightclubs, professional photographers will take publicity photos of patrons, to use in advertising for the nightclub. Digital SLR cameras and speedlight flash units are typically used.Papasergis, George. ‚ÄúNightclub Photography Tips‚Äù, Digital Photography Bureau. Concert photography and event photography are used to provide clubgoers with a memorable keepsake in addition to promo material used by clubs. Since several years, some nightclubs and in particular techno clubs pursue a strict no photo policy in order to protect the clubbing experience, and smartphone camera lenses of visitors are taped up with stickers when one enters the venue. ==Security== Most nightclubs employ teams of bouncers, who have the power to restrict entry to the club and remove people. Some bouncers use handheld metal detectors to prevent weapons being brought into clubs. Bouncers often eject patrons for reasons such as possession of party drugs in the venue, physical altercations with other patrons, and behavior deemed to be inappropriate or troublesome. Bouncers only allow a certain number of people into a club at a time by counting heads in order to prevent stampedes and fire code violations. They also enforce a club's dress code upon entry. Many clubs have balcony areas specifically for the security team to watch over the clubbers. ==Serious incidents== * 20 September 1929: Study Club fire of 1929, early dance club fire that killed 22 in Detroit, Michigan, US * 23 April 1940: Rhythm Night Club fire, 209 killed at nightclub fire at Natchez, Mississippi, US * 28 November 1942: Cocoanut Grove fire, 492 killed in a nightclub fire at Boston, Massachusetts, US * 1 November 1970: Club Cinq-Sept fire in a nightclub just outside the small town of Saint-Laurent-du-Pont, Is√®re in south-eastern France; 146 people killed * 8 March 1973: Whiskey Au Go Go fire, 15 killed after firebombing at Fortitude Valley, Brisbane, Australia * 2 August 1973: Summerland disaster, 51 killed at fire at Summerland leisure centre at Douglas, Isle of Man * 28 May 1977: Beverly Hills Supper Club fire, 165 killed and 200 injured in nightclub fire at Southgate, Kentucky, US * 14 February 1981: Stardust fire disaster, 48 killed and 214 injured at nightclub fire at Dublin, Republic of Ireland * 17 December 1983: Alcal√° 20 nightclub fire, 82 people were killed and 27 injured in Madrid, Spain * 25 March 1990: Happy Land fire, 87 killed in a nightclub fire at Happy Land, The Bronx, New York City * 20 December 1993: Kheyvis Fire, 17 killed in a nightclub fire at Buenos Aires, Argentina * 27 November 1994: Yiyuan Disco fire, 233 killed in a nightclub fire at Fuxin, China * 18 March 1996: Ozone Disco Club fire, 162 dead and 95 injured at a nightclub in Quezon City, Philippines * 30 October 1998: Gothenburg discoth√®que fire, 63 people killed, 200 injured in a nightclub fire at Gothenburg, Sweden * 1 June 2001: Suicide bombing at the Dolphinarium discoth√®que in Tel Aviv, Israel * 12 October 2002: 2002 Bali bombings, 202 killed by large bombs * 7 December 2002: Cowgate fire, Edinburgh, Scotland * 17 February 2003: 2003 E2 nightclub stampede, Chicago, Illinois, 21 killed and over 50 injured * 20 February 2003: The Station nightclub fire, 100 killed at nightclub fire in West Warwick, Rhode Island * 30 December 2004: Rep√∫blica Croma√±√≥n nightclub fire, 194 killed and 714 injured in a nightclub fire at Buenos Aires, Argentina * 18 June 2007: Gatecrasher One Fire, Sheffield, England * 1 January 2009: Santika Club fire in Santika Club in Watthana, Bangkok, Thailand, 61 killed and at least 212 injured * 5 December 2009: Lame Horse fire, a fire at the Lame Horse nightclub killed at least 155 people and injures 79 others in Perm, Russia. * 27 January 2013: Kiss nightclub fire, 242 died in stampede in Brazil * 30 October 2015: Colectiv nightclub fire, 55 killed and 180 injured in Romania * 12 June 2016: 49 people killed in an attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida * 1 January 2017: At least 35 people killed in an attack on the Reina nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey ==See also== * Dance hall * Dance music * Dance party * Go-go dancing * Nightclub act * Rave * Outline of entertainment ==References* Category:Types of drinking establishment Category:DJing Category:Restaurants Category:Concert halls Category:Underground culture Category:Organized crime activity ","title":"Nightclub"},{"id":"19321339","text":"Amplitude amplification is a technique in quantum computing which generalizes the idea behind the Grover's search algorithm, and gives rise to a family of quantum algorithms. It was discovered by Gilles Brassard and Peter H√∏yer in 1997, and independently rediscovered by Lov Grover in 1998. In a quantum computer, amplitude amplification can be used to obtain a quadratic speedup over several classical algorithms. == Algorithm == The derivation presented here roughly follows the one given in. Assume we have an N-dimensional Hilbert space \\\\mathcal{H} representing the state space of our quantum system, spanned by the orthonormal computational basis states B := \\\\\\\\{ k\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\}_{k=0}^{N-1}. Furthermore assume we have a Hermitian projection operator P\\\\colon \\\\mathcal{H} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{H}. Alternatively, P may be given in terms of a Boolean oracle function \\\\chi\\\\colon\\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\to \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\} and an orthonormal operational basis B_{\\\\text{op}} := \\\\\\\\{\\\\omega_k\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\}_{k=0}^{N-1}, in which case :P := \\\\sum_{\\\\chi(k)=1} \\\\omega_k \\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\omega_k. P can be used to partition \\\\mathcal{H} into a direct sum of two mutually orthogonal subspaces, the good subspace \\\\mathcal{H}_1 and the bad subspace \\\\mathcal{H}_0: \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathcal{H}_1 &:= \\\\text{Image}\\\\; P &= \\\\operatorname{span}\\\\\\\\{\\\\omega_k\\\\rangle \\\\in B_{\\\\text{op}} \\\\;\\\\; \\\\chi(k) = 1\\\\\\\\},\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathcal{H}_0 &:= \\\\text{Ker} \\\\; P &= \\\\operatorname{span}\\\\\\\\{\\\\omega_k\\\\rangle \\\\in B_{\\\\text{op}} \\\\;\\\\; \\\\chi(k) = 0\\\\\\\\}. \\\\end{align} In other words, we are defining a \\"good subspace\\" \\\\mathcal H_1 via the projector P. The goal of the algorithm is then to evolve some initial state \\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H} into a state belonging to \\\\mathcal H_1. Given a normalized state vector \\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H} with nonzero overlap with both subspaces, we can uniquely decompose it as :\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\psi_1\\\\rangle +\\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\psi_0\\\\rangle, where \\\\theta = \\\\arcsin\\\\left( \\\\left P \\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\right \\\\right) \\\\in [0, \\\\pi/2], and \\\\psi_1\\\\rangle and \\\\psi_0\\\\rangle are the normalized projections of \\\\psi\\\\rangle into the subspaces \\\\mathcal{H}_1 and \\\\mathcal{H}_0, respectively. This decomposition defines a two-dimensional subspace \\\\mathcal{H}_\\\\psi, spanned by the vectors \\\\psi_0\\\\rangle and \\\\psi_1\\\\rangle. The probability of finding the system in a good state when measured is \\\\sin^2(\\\\theta). Define a unitary operator Q(\\\\psi, P) := -S_\\\\psi S_P \\\\,\\\\\\\\!, where : \\\\begin{align} S_\\\\psi &= I -2\\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\quad \\\\text{and}\\\\\\\\\\\\ S_P &= I -2 P. \\\\end{align} S_P flips the phase of the states in the good subspace, whereas S_\\\\psi flips the phase of the initial state \\\\psi\\\\rangle. The action of this operator on \\\\mathcal{H}_\\\\psi is given by :Q \\\\psi_0\\\\rangle = -S_\\\\psi \\\\psi_0\\\\rangle = (2\\\\cos^2(\\\\theta)-1)\\\\psi_0\\\\rangle +2 \\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\psi_1\\\\rangle and :Q \\\\psi_1\\\\rangle = S_\\\\psi \\\\psi_1\\\\rangle = -2 \\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\psi_0\\\\rangle +(1-2\\\\sin^2(\\\\theta))\\\\psi_1\\\\rangle. Thus in the \\\\mathcal{H}_\\\\psi subspace Q corresponds to a rotation by the angle 2\\\\theta\\\\,\\\\\\\\!: :Q = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos(2\\\\theta) & \\\\sin(2\\\\theta)\\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\sin(2\\\\theta) & \\\\cos(2\\\\theta) \\\\end{pmatrix}. Applying Q n times on the state \\\\psi\\\\rangle gives :Q^n \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\cos((2n+1) \\\\theta) \\\\psi_0\\\\rangle +\\\\sin((2n+1)\\\\theta) \\\\psi_1\\\\rangle, rotating the state between the good and bad subspaces. After n iterations the probability of finding the system in a good state is \\\\sin^2((2n+1)\\\\theta)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. The probability is maximized if we choose :n = \\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4\\\\theta}\\\\right\\\\rfloor. Up until this point each iteration increases the amplitude of the good states, hence the name of the technique. == Applications == Assume we have an unsorted database with N elements, and an oracle function \\\\chi which can recognize the good entries we are searching for, and B_{\\\\text{op}} = B for simplicity. If there are G good entries in the database in total, then we can find them by initializing a quantum register \\\\psi\\\\rangle with n qubits where 2^n=N into a uniform superposition of all the database elements N such that :\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{N}} \\\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} k\\\\rangle and running the above algorithm. In this case the overlap of the initial state with the good subspace is equal to the square root of the frequency of the good entries in the database, \\\\sin(\\\\theta) = P \\\\psi\\\\rangle= \\\\sqrt{G/N}. If \\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\ll 1, we can approximate the number of required iterations as :n = \\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4\\\\theta}\\\\right\\\\rfloor \\\\approx \\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4 \\\\sin(\\\\theta)}\\\\right\\\\rfloor = \\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{N}{G}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor = O(\\\\sqrt{N}). Measuring the state will now give one of the good entries with high probability. Since each application of S_P requires a single oracle query (assuming that the oracle is implemented as a quantum gate), we can find a good entry with just O(\\\\sqrt{N}) oracle queries, thus obtaining a quadratic speedup over the best possible classical algorithm. (The classical method for searching the database would be to perform the query for every e \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1,\\\\dots,N-1\\\\\\\\} until a solution is found, thus costing O(N) queries.) If we set the size of the set G to one, the above scenario essentially reduces to the original Grover search. == References == Category:Quantum algorithms Category:Search algorithms ","title":"Amplitude amplification"},{"id":"19321395","text":"The Jardin botanique d'Aubrac (300 m¬≤) is a small botanical garden located in Saint-Ch√©ly-d'Aubrac, Aveyron, Midi-Pyr√©n√©es, France.

It occurs every year on the Canadian May (Victoria Day) long weekend. ==Scheduling and Location== Although the show is now held on the Canadian Victoria Day weekend, the first show was held on the Canada Day weekend instead. Generally the show runs from Friday through Sunday night. The show has been held in a number of locations, including the Carleton University campus. Currently the Rideau Curling Club hosts the event. ==Features of the Show== CanGames features gaming (Board, Miniatures, RPG) in both English and French and offers trophies to winners. The convention was originally conceived, organized, and continues to be run by a committee of volunteers. And still is. ==The CanGames Dwarf== The CanGames Dwarf was designed by Denis Beauvais, a noted Fantasy artist whose work has appeared in Dragon Magazine, science fiction novel covers and in various video and boardgames. Currently the trophies are a sculpted dwarf based on Beauvais's artwork done by Sandra Garrity, a noted fantasy figure sculptor. ==Format of the Show== The format of the show has varied over the years, although the core activities of RPGs, miniature games and boardgames have featured each year. In the early years the show included seminars and featured guests from the gaming industry, including such as Frank Chadwick of GDW, Jim Dunnigan of SPI, Gary Gygax of TSR and John Hill of Avalon Hill. Canadian game designer Steve Newberg of SimulationsCanada was a frequent guest. Early shows also featured film showings and auctions. In later years the elements of the show have varied to reflect changing tastes in gaming, including the addition of CCGs to the featured games. Miniatures painting competitions have also been part of the show. Youth games have been added to encourage a new generation of gamers. ==CanGames Favorites== CanGames features several games that run every year. Chariots is a homegrown game that recreates the excitement of the Ben Hur chariot race. The Rubberboots saga is an \\"Indiana Jones\\"-style serial revolving around the recurring character of a Gumshoe detective featuring captivating scale-model sets. There is a thriving dealers area that is part of the main convention floor. There is also a consignment sale where attendees can drop off their sale items and the CanGames staff will sell them for a 15% commission. ==Coverage of the Show== CanGames was reported on by Dragon magazine in 1979 and 1980 and by local Ottawa newspaper Orleans Now in 2007Report in Orleans Now newspaper The CanGames web site also features a \\"Past Glory\\" archive section detailing lists of winners, photographs, and artwork from previous years.

The terrestrial juvenile phase is called an eft. Unlike other members of the family Salamandridae, newts are semiaquatic, alternating between aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Not all aquatic salamanders are considered newts, however. More than 100 known species of newts are found in North America, Europe, North Africa and Asia. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental life stages: aquatic larva, terrestrial juvenile (eft), and adult. Adult newts have lizard-like bodies and return to the water every year to breed, otherwise living in humid, cover-rich land habitats. Newts are threatened by habitat loss, fragmentation and pollution. Several species are endangered, and at least one species, the Yunnan lake newt, has gone extinct recently. ==Etymology== Pleurodeles, including the Iberian ribbed newt, is the type genus of subfamily Pleurodelinae. The Old English name of the animal was efte, efeta (of unknown origin), resulting in Middle English eft; this word was transformed irregularly into euft, evete, or ewt(e). The initial \\"n\\" was added from the indefinite article \\"an\\" by provection (juncture loss) (\\"an eft\\" ‚Üí \\"a n'eft\\" ‚Üí ...) by the early 15th century.Oxford English Dictionary; The form \\"newt\\" appears to have arisen as a dialectal variant of eft in Staffordshire, but entered Standard English by the Early Modern period (used by Shakespeare in Macbeth iv.1).The Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle, Volume 47 (1777), p. 321. The regular form eft, now only used for newly metamorphosed specimens, survived alongside newt, especially in composition, the larva being called \\"water-eft\\" and the mature form \\"land-eft\\" well into the 18th century, but the simplex \\"eft\\" as equivalent to \\"water-eft\\" has been in use since at least the 17th century.John Wilkins, An Essay Towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language (1668), p. 161. Gilbert White, The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne, in the County of Southampton (1789) p. 50: \\"the water-eft, or newt, is only the larva of the land-eft, as tadpoles are of frogs\\". Archibald Constable, Constable's miscellany of original and selected publications in the various departments of literature, science, & the arts, Volume 45 (1829), p. 63: \\"the salamandra aquatica of Hay, (the water-newt, or eft)\\". Dialectal English and Scots also has the word ask (also awsk, esk in Scots John Jamieson, An etmological dictionary of the Scottish language (1818).) used for both newts and wall lizards, from Old English ƒÅ√æexe, from Proto-Germanic *agi√æahsij«≠, literally \\"lizard-badger\\" or \\"distaff-like lizard\\" (compare German Eidechse and Echse, both \\"lizard;\\" *agi- is ultimately cognate with Greek \\"snake,\\" from Proto-Indo-European *h‚ÇÅog ∑ ∞isWolfgang Pfeifer (ed.), Etymologisches W√∂rterbuch des Deutschen.

Pfeifer gives the second element as germ. *√æahsj≈ç(n), relating it to Middle High German dehse \\"distaff\\", so that both animals (lizard and badger) were parallelized due to their common, spindle-shaped bodies.). Latin had the name stellio for a type of spotted newt, now used for species of the genus Stellagama. Ancient Greek had the name , presumably for the water newt (immature newt, eft).Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon. German has , from Middle High German mol, :wikt:olm, like the English term of unknown etymology. Newts are also known as Tritones (viz., named for the mythological Triton) in historical literature, and \\"triton\\" remains in use as common name in some Romance languages, in Greek, in Romanian, Russian, and Bulgarian. The systematic name Tritones was introduced alongside Pleurodelinae by Tschudi in 1838, based on the type genus named Triton by Laurenti in 1768. Laurenti's Triton was renamed to Triturus (\\"Triton-tail\\") by Rafinesque in 1815.Alain Dubois and Roger Bour, The nomenclatural status of the nomina of amphibians and reptiles created by Garsault (1764), with a parsimonious solution to an old nomenclatural problem regarding the genus Bufo (Amphibia, Anura), comments on the taxonomy of this genus, and comments on some nomina created by Laurenti (1768) , Zootaxa 2447 (2010), 1‚Äì52. Tschudi's Pleurodelinae is based on the type genus Pleurodeles (ribbed newt) named by Michahelles in 1830 (the name meaning \\"having prominent ribs,\\" formed from \\"ribs\\" and \\"conspicuous\\"). ==Distribution and habitats== Pyrenean brook newt lives in small streams in the Pyrenees mountains. Newts are found in North America, Europe, North Africa and Asia. The Pacific newts (Taricha) and the Eastern newts (Notophthalmus) with together seven species are the only representatives in North America, while most diversity is found in the Old World: In Europe and the Middle East, the group's likely origin, eight genera with roughly 30 species are found, with the ribbed newts (Pleurodeles) extending to northernmost Africa. Eastern Asia, from Eastern India over Indochina to Japan, is home to five genera with more than 40 species. Newts are semiaquatic, spending part of the year in the water for reproduction and the rest of the year on land. While most species prefer stagnant water bodies such as ponds, ditches or flooded meadows for reproduction, some species such as the Danube crested newt can also occur in slow-flowing rivers. The European brook newts (Calotriton) and European mountain newts (Euproctus) have even adapted to life in cold, oxygen-rich mountain streams. During their terrestrial phase, newts live in humid habitats with abundant cover such as logs, rocks, or earth holes. ==Characteristics== Newts share many of the characteristics of their salamander kin, Caudata, including semipermeable glandular skin, four equal-sized limbs, and a distinct tail. The newt's skin, however, is not as smooth as that of other salamanders. Aquatic larvae have true teeth on both upper and lower jaws, and external gills. They have the ability to regenerate limbs, eyes, spinal cords, hearts, intestines, and upper and lower jaws. The Japanese fire belly newt can regenerate its eye lens 18 times over a period of 16 years and retain its structural and functional properties. The cells at the site of the injury have the ability to undifferentiate, reproduce rapidly, and differentiate again to create a new limb or organ. One hypothesis is that the undifferentiated cells are related to tumor cells, since chemicals that produce tumors in other animals will produce additional limbs in newts. ==Development== The main breeding season for newts (in the Northern Hemisphere) is in June and July. After courtship rituals of varying complexity, which take place in ponds or slow-moving streams, the male newt transfers a spermatophore, which is taken up by the female. Fertilized eggs are laid singly and are usually attached to aquatic plants. This distinguishes them from the free-floating eggs of frogs or toads, which are laid in clumps or in strings. Plant leaves are usually folded over and attached to the eggs to protect them. The larvae, which resemble fish fry but are distinguished by their feathery external gills, hatch out in about three weeks. After hatching, they eat algae, small invertebrates, or other amphibian larvae. During the subsequent few months, the larvae undergo metamorphosis, during which they develop legs, and the gills are absorbed and replaced by air-breathing lungs. Some species, such as the North American newts, also become more brightly colored during this phase. Once fully metamorphosed, they leave the water and live a terrestrial life, when they are known as \\"efts.\\" Only when the eft reaches adulthood will the North American species return to live in water, rarely venturing back onto the land. Conversely, most European species live their adult lives on land and only visit water to breed. ==Toxicity== The Pacific newts (Taricha), including the California newt, are known for their toxicity. Many newts produce toxins in their skin secretions as a defence mechanism against predators. Taricha newts of western North America are particularly toxic. The rough-skinned newt Taricha granulosa of the Pacific Northwest produces more than enough tetrodotoxin to kill an adult human, and some Native Americans of the Pacific Northwest used the toxin to poison their enemies. However, the toxins are only dangerous if ingested, and the newts can easily and safely live in the same ponds or streams as frogs and other amphibians, or be safely kept as pets. The only predators of Taricha newts are garter snakes, some having developed a resistance to the toxin. Most newts can be safely handled, provided the toxins they produce are not ingested or allowed to come in contact with mucous membranes or breaks in the skin. ==Systematics== Newts form one of three subfamilies in the family Salamandridae, aside Salamandrinae and Salamandrininae. They comprise most extant species in the family, roughly 100, which are classified in sixteen genera: * Calotriton * Cynops (incl. Hypselotriton) * Echinotriton * Euproctus * Ichthyosaura * Laotriton * Lissotriton * Neurergus * Notophthalmus * Ommatotriton * Pachytriton * Paramesotriton * Pleurodeles * Taricha * Triturus * Tylototriton (incl. Liangshantriton) Hypselotriton and Liangshantriton are regarded as separate genera by some authors, but this is not unanimous. The term \\"newt\\" has traditionally been seen as an exclusively functional term for salamanders living in water, and not a clade. Phylogenetic analyses have however shown that species in the Salamandridae traditionally called newts do form a monophyletic group. Other, more distantly related salamander families also contain fully or in part aquatic species, such as the mole salamanders, the Proteidae, or the Sirenidae. Phylogenetic analyses estimated the origin of the newt subfamily in the Late Cretaceous to Eocene. Several fossil salamanders have also been referred to the Pleurodelinae, including: * Archaeotriton * Brachycormus * Carpathotriton * Chelotriton * Koalliella * Palaeopleurodeles ==Anatomy and physiologyCirculation=== The heart of newts, like that of most amphibians, consists of two atria and one ventricle.(Miyachi, Y. 2011. The Unusual Circulation of the Newt Heart after Ventricular Injury and Its Implications for Regeneration. Anatomy Research International:1-7). Blood flows from the anterior and posterior caval veins into the right atrium; blood that entered the heart from the left atrium is then expelled out of the ventricle. Newts do not have a coronary artery on the ventricle, due to circulation that is found in the conus arteriosus. Newts contain a special circulatory adaptation that allows them to survive ventricular penetration: when a newt‚Äôs ventricle is punctured, the heart will divert the blood directly into an ascending aorta via a duct located between the ventricle and the conus arteriosus. Newts begin to regenerate the ventricle by a thickening of the epicardial layer that protrudes to allow the new vessels to form, and conclude with a regeneration of the entire myocardial wall. In early stages of development in amphibians, ventilator gas transport and hemoglobin gas transport are independent mechanisms and not yet coupled as they are in adulthood.(Pelster, B. 1999. Environmental Influences on the Development of the Cardiac System in Fish and Amphibians. Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A 124:407-412) In juvenile amphibians, there is no cardiovascular response in conditions of hypoxia. When newts are induced into anemia, they are able to respire without the need of blood cells.(Casale. G.P, Khairallah. E. A., Grasso. J. A. 1980. An Analysis of Hemoglobin Synthesis in Erythropoietic Cells. Developmental Biology 80:107-119. ) In T. carnifex, around two weeks after anemia is induced, the newts produced a mass of cells that helps to revitalize the already circulating red blood cell mass. ===Respiration=== Adult crested newts (Triturus cristus) were found to breathe mainly via the skin but also through the lungs and the buccal cavity. Lung breathing is mainly used when there is a lack of oxygen in the water, or at high activity such as during courtship, breeding, or feeding.(Eddy, F. B., P. McDonald. 1978. Aquatic respiration of The Crested Newt Triturus Cristatus. Comparative Biochemical Physiology. 59: 85-88) A form of compensatory respiration is the ability to release stored erythrocytes when needed, for example under hypoxia.(Giuliano Frangioni, Mario Santoni, Stefano Bianchi, Marco Franchi, Giancarlo Fuzzi, Stefano Marcaccini, Carlo Varlani, Gianfranco Borgioli. 2006. Function of the Hepatic Melanogenesis in the Newt, Triturus Carnifex. Journal of Experimental Zoology. 303A:123-131.)(Frangioni, G., G. Borgioli. 1996. Variations in blood pressure of newts according to their respiratory conditions. Italian Journal of Zoology. 63:3, 201-206). Spleen size can increase as the temperature declines for adults ‚Äì in larvae, there is no dramatic change in spleen size.(Frangioni, G., G Borgioli. 1997. Blood and splenic respiratory compensation in larval newts. Italian Journal of Zoology. 64:3, 221-226) During hibernation, an increase in liver pigment cells allows for storage of oxygen, as well as other important ions and free radicals.(Barni et al 1999) ===Osmoregulation=== In experiments, dehydrated eastern newts were prone to a loss of motor control: After only 22% water weight loss, newts in the aquatic phase lost their ability to remain upright and mobile. However, after adaptation to a terrestrial phase, they could lose 30% before a loss of motor control was recorded. Newts in the terrestrial phase were found to dehydrate much quicker than newts in the aquatic phase, but conversely, during rehydration, dehydrated terrestrial animals will go through water gain 5x faster than dehydrated newts that are in the aquatic phase.P. Walters, L. Greenwald. 1977. Physiological adaptations of aquatic newts (Notophtalmus viridescens) to a terrestrial environment. Physiological Zoology. 50(2): 88-98. In the Italian crested newt, it was shown that during winter months, prolactin is released into the circulatory system, which drives the newts into the aquatic environment and reduces the active transport of sodium ions.Lodi, G., Biciotti, M., and Viotto, B. 1981. Cutaneous Osmoregualtion in Triturus cristatus carnifex (Laur.) (Urodela). General and Comparative Endocrinology 46: 452-457. In contrast to prolactin, which decreases osmotic permeability, vasotocin increases the permeability and is secreted during the summer months.Brown, M., Brown, S., Bisceglio, I., and Lemke, S. 1983. Breeding Condition, Temperature, and the Regulation of Salt and Water by Pituitary Hormones in the Red-Spotted Newt, Notophthalmus viridescens. General and Comparative Endocrinology 51, 292-302. Arginine vasotocin not only increases cutaneous water permeability, but promotes increased cutaneous blood flow.Minoru Uchiyama, Norifumi Konno, Hormonal regulation of ion and water transport in anuran amphibians, General and Comparative Endocrinology, Volume 147, Issue 1, 15 May 2006, Pages 54-61, ===Thermoregulation=== Thermoregulation, in combination with seasonal acclimation, describes the major mechanisms of how newts, as ectotherms cope with the changing temperatures existing in their environments. This regulation is most often achieved through behavioral thermoregulation.(M. Hadamova, L. Gvozdik. 2011. Seasonal acclimation of preferred body temperatures improves the opportunity for thermoregulation in newts. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology. 84(2):166-174. ) They are thermoconformers, which means they will acclimate to their surrounding environmental temperatures. When there is a large range of environmental temperatures, newts are insensitive to a thermal gradient profile.(V. Marek, L. Gvozdik. 2012. The insensitivity of thermal preferences to various thermal gradient profiles in newts. Journal of Ethology. 30(1): 35-41) To escape predators, newt larvae have been found to shift their microhabitat to a temperature range that exists outside the predator‚Äôs preferred temperature range.(R. Smolinsky, L. Gvozdik. 2009. The ontogenetic shift in thermoregulatory behavior of newt larvae: testing the ‚Äúenemy-free temperature‚Äù hypothesis. Journal of Zoology. 279(2): 180-186. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-7998.2009.00603.x) Larvae that are in the metamorphosizing stage tend to prefer warmer temperatures than those in the stage following metamorphosis. Therefore, the larvae in this stage will undergo a much more precise thermoregulation process than those in the intermediate stage. Reproductive females of the Italian crested newt were shown to regulate their body temperature more precisely and prefer higher temperatures than non- reproductive females and males.(L. Gvozdik. 1995. Does reproduction influence temperature preference in newts. Canadian Journal of Zoology. 83(8): 1038-1044. doi: 10.1139/z05-096) ===Susceptibility to pollution=== Larvae, with their great number of lamellae in their gills,(Brunelli, E., E. Sperone, M. Maisano, and S. Tripepi. 2009. Morphology and ultrastructure of the gills in two Urodela species: Salamandrina terdigitata and Triturus carnifex. Italian Journal of Zoology. 76(2): 158-164) are more susceptible to pollutants than adults. Cadmium, a heavy metal released into the environment from industrial and consumer waste, has been shown to be detrimental to the Italian crested newt even at a concentrations below Italian and European thresholds, by disrupting the activity of the adrenal gland.(Gay, F., V. Laforgia, I. Caputo, C. Esposito, M. Lepretti, and A. Capaldo, ‚ÄúChronic Exposure to Cadmium Disrupts the Adrenal Gland Activity of the Newt Triturus carnifex(Amphibia, Urodela),‚Äù BioMed Research International.) In experiments allowing Italian crested newts to be exposed to nonylphenol, an endocrine disruptor common in leakage from sewers, there was a decrease in corticosterone and aldosterone, hormones produced by the adrenal gland and important for stress response.(A. Capaldo, F. Gay, S. Valiante, M. DeFalco, R. Sciarrillo, M. Maddaloni, V. Laforgia. 2012. Endocrine-disrupting effects of nonylphenol in the newt, Triturus carnifex (Amphibia, Urodela). Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology. 155(2): 352-358. doi: 10.1016/j.cbpc.2011.10.004) ==Conservation status== The Yunnan lake newt is considered extinct. Although some species, such as the rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) in North America or the smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris) in Europe, are still relatively common, populations of newts throughout their distribution range suffer from habitat loss, fragmentation, and pollution. This affects especially the aquatic breeding sites they depend on, but also their land habitats. Several species, such as the Edough ribbed newt (Pleurodeles poireti), Kaiser's spotted newt (Neurergus kaiseri), or the Montseny brook newt (Calotriton arnoldi) are considered threatened by the IUCN, and the Yunnan lake newt is an example of a newt species that has gone extinct recently. Some newt populations in Europe have decreased because of pollution or destruction of their breeding sites and terrestrial habitats, and countries such as the UK have taken steps to halt their declines.UK Biodiversity Action Plan In the UK, they are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Habitat Regulations Act 1994. It is illegal to catch, possess, or handle great crested newts without a licence, or to cause them harm or death, or to disturb their habitat in any way. The IUCN Red List categorises the species as ‚Äòlower risk‚Äô Although the other UK species, the smooth newt and palmate newt are not listed, the sale of either species is prohibited under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981. In Europe, nine newts are listed as \\"strictly protected fauna species\\" under appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats: *Calotriton asper *Euproctus montanus *Euproctus platycephalus *Lissotriton italicus *Lissotriton montandoni *Triturus carnifex *Triturus cristatus *Triturus dobrogicus *Triturus karelinii The remaining European species are listed as \\"protected fauna species\\" under appendix III. ==As bioindicators== Newts, as with salamanders in general and other amphibians, serve as bioindicators because of their thin, sensitive skin and evidence of their presence (or absence) can serve as an indicator of the health of the environment. Most species are highly sensitive to subtle changes in the pH level of the streams and lakes where they live. Because their skin is permeable to water, they absorb oxygen and other substances they need through their skin. Scientists study the stability of the amphibian population when studying the water quality of a particular body of water. ==As pets== Chinese warty newts, Chinese fire belly newts, eastern newts, paddletail newts, Japanese fire belly newts, Chuxiong fire-bellied newts, Triturus species, emperor newts, Spanish ribbed newts (leucistic genes exist), and red- tailed knobby newts are some commonly seen newts in the pet trade. Some newts rarely seen in the pet trade are rough-skinned newts, Kaiser's spotted newts, banded newts and yellow-spotted newts. ==ReferencesCategory:Extant Late Cretaceous first appearances es:Salamandra it:Tritone (anfibi) lt:Tritonai nl:Pleurodelinae ja:„Ç§„É¢„É™ ","title":"Newt"},{"id":"19321522","text":"Potentilla recta, the sulphur cinquefoil or rough-fruited cinquefoil, is a species of cinquefoil.

The lower leaves have long stalks and the stem leaves are arranged alternately and have short stalks. All the leaves are palmate, divided into usually six or seven leaflets, sometimes up to nine, with the uppermost ones just having three leaflets. The green to yellow-green leaves may be up to long, with the central leaflet reaching in length. The leaflets are linear-lanceolate, hairy in texture and toothed along the edges. The inflorescence is a cyme of several flowers which are generally light to pale yellow in color, with white to gold-flowered individuals occurring at times. Each flower has five calyx lobes, five broad, shallowly-notched petals, thirty stamens, many pistils and a separate gynoecium. The fruit is a receptacle containing several glossy, pale brown achenes. The plant may reproduce by seed or vegetatively by sprouting new shoots from its caudex. Sulphur cinquefoil flowers from June to August. ==Distribution and habitat== Sulphur cinquefoil is native to much of Europe, Asia, and parts of North America, and it can be found in other parts of the world as an introduced species. Its natural habitat is arable fields, gardens, banks, hedgerows, wasteland, logging clearings, loading areas and occasionally shores.

It also owned AM 1490 WNDU, 92.9 WNDU-FM (now WNDV-FM) and Channel 16 WNDU-TV. But they were commercial operations, staffed by broadcasting professionals. (The three commercial stations were sold in 1998.) The university wanted to put a student-run radio station on the air to help train students in broadcasting. On September 17, 1962, WSND-FM signed on the air as a 10 watt educational station licensed to the University of Notre Dame. It was operated by students during the university's Fall and Spring semesters and signed off during the summer and other school breaks. In 1971, WSND-FM expanded its schedule and improved its signal coverage. A new 3,430 watt transmitter was installed, which covered the South Bend area and surrounding communities including parts of lower Michigan. WSND-FM added to its staff to include area volunteers who helped keep the station operating during summer breaks and other times when classes were not being held. Today, WSND-FM continues to be operated with a complementary mix of students and volunteers. In 2012, chief operator Edwin Jaroszewski celebrated his 40th year with the station. In the mid-1980s, under the stewardship of Eliot Coe, who was Jazz Director from 1984‚Äì1986, the station pioneered an eclectic mix of jazz music.

Museum of American Financial History (June‚ÄìDecember 2000). Retrieved on September 14, 2008. It was the first national business weekly in the United States. The Commercial & Financial Chronicle continued the legacy begun by Hunt's Merchant's Magazine and Commercial Review, a monthly business magazine, which was founded in 1839 by Freeman Hunt but disappeared during the American Civil War. They are together in many library collections.\\"On the Hundredth Anniversary of the Commercial & Financial Chronicle\\" Bulletin of the Business Historical Society, Vol 13, No. 5 (Nov., 1939) pp 67‚Äì72. Dana continued as editor of the Chronicle until his death in 1910. The Commercial & Financial Chronicle never had the large subscriber base or influence of The Wall Street Journal or Barron's. In 1872 its circulation was around 4,000 and reached 26,000 by 1922. Data from the publication is, however, used by many economic historians, as it is one of the few sources available. Douglas Steeples, Dana's biographer, wrote that \\"one can scarcely reconstruct the business history of the United States between the Civil War and 1910 without immersing oneself in his paper. Even the most important series of business statistics published by the U.S. government, Historical Statistics of the United States [...], depends heavily on his work and that of the correspondents worldwide who contributed to the Chronicle.\\" In 1895, the William B. Dana Company sued rival Boston-based financial publisher Frank P. Bennett & Co., charging that the new financial supplement printed by Bennett's United States Investor consisted largely of The Chronicle's copyrighted content. \\"The Chronicle's injunction was granted [by the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Massachusetts], protecting the copyright. The case is considered an important one because it has been deemed almost impossible heretofore to protect publications like those of The Chronicle,\\" wrote the Library of Congress' Copyright Office in 1980.

Its enrollment during the 2010‚Äì11 academic year was 1,334, with 53% male students and 47% female. Its current principal is Michael Thornton, who was hired in 2008. ==History== Conestoga Valley High School originated in 1907 when East Lampeter Township dedicated a two-room building next to present-day Smoketown Elementary School as its first high school, named East Lampeter High School. The building itself was constructed in 1868. The first class, the class of 1909, graduated with two years of high school education, but in the same year, the school was developed into a three-year school. In 1910, the building was renovated to a four-room, two-story building, but the high school only remained there until 1927. In 1927, East Lampeter High School was moved west along Old Philadelphia Pike and remained there until 1958 when East Lampeter Township, Upper Leacock Township, and West Earl Township decided to merge their school systems into present-day Conestoga Valley School District. The high school was moved to present-day Smoketown Elementary School and was dedicated as the new high school, becoming a four-year high school in the process. Its old location became Witmer Heights Elementary School and then subsequently became a Mennonite church. The new location of the high school was built in 1937 when the one-room schoolhouses of East Lampeter Township were merged there. In 1958, Conestoga Valley High School was moved to Horseshoe Road where the present-day high school now stands. ===Principals=== Before Conestoga Valley High School was so named, a multitude of principals preceded Michael Thornton. At the time that East Lampeter High School was located along Old Philadelphia Pike, from 1928 to 1958, the principals were Charles Ressel, Aaron Breidenstine, Galen Kilhefner, Harry K. Gerlach, Henry Walker, and J. Elias Fritz. When East Lampeter High School was moved to Horseshoe Road in 1958 and renamed Conestoga Valley High School, Fritz left the principal position to become the first supervising principal of the district, therefore becoming the first superintendent of Conestoga Valley School District. An elementary school in the district is named after him. The most recent former principal was Brian Ginter, who served as the high school's assistant principal before moving on to become principal in 2003. He remained in that position for five years before accepting a principal position at Warwick High School. Michael Thornton previously served as the principal of Tunkhannock Area High School in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania, and Blue Ridge High School in New Milford, Pennsylvania, before coming to Conestoga Valley High School. In 2008, he became this school's principal and is currently serving here. ===Recent developments=== In 2002, Conestoga Valley School District and the East Lampeter Township Police Department agreed to implement the School Resource Officer Program by placing a police officer in the high school. Officer Preston Gentzler became the school's first SRO and worked for three years until Officer Randy Shrom took over in 2005. From there, he served until 2010 when Officer Matthew Hess took over. Officer John Werner is the school's current SRO. The high school building was renovated in 2006 and 2012. In 2006, specialized classrooms were created for art, business, and computer technology as well as the addition of two technology-enhanced Large Group Instruction rooms. In 2012, renovations were made to the school's roof at a cost of $370,000, and to the main entrance to make it more energy-efficient, at a cost of $17,000. The school expanded its wireless network to cover all of the building. In 2012, a new electronic sign was installed to replace the old standard sign which had been in use since the building was erected. The sign cost $15,000 and was funded by a number of disbanding clubs which agreed to donate money as well as donations by the classes of 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2011. The school also launched a campaign in 2012 to renovate its stadium complex. Termed \\"Sound Mind, Sound Body, Sound Future\\", this capital campaign focuses on promoting physical activity through sports, a $3.4 million upgrade of its sports complex, and establish ingdurable athletic facilities that will last well into the future. The field will be replaced with artificial turf, the grandstand and concession stands will be expanded, the bleachers will be replaced with new ones that conform to the current safety codes, and the press box will be replaced. As of November 2012, more than $75,000 had been raised for the capital campaign, including a contribution of $10,000 donation by the Kysilka Family in memory of Karin Kincaid, class of 1991. The stadium campaign was completed and dedicated before the Homecoming football game in 2014. For the 2012-2013 school year, the PSSAs were eliminated in favor of the Keystone Exams, a new set of exams that replaced the PSSAs. Instead of being tested in math, reading, science, and writing, students are tested in Algebra I, Biology, and Literature. The one to one computing initiative began in the 2013-2014 school year. Each student received a Lenovo netbook to use throughout the school year. This initiative has continued, and has been expanded to Conestoga Valley Middle School. Students receive the laptops free of cost, paying only a $40 per year insurance fee to cover accidental damage or loss of technological equipment. The school hopes that this move towards technology will lower the overall cost throughout the school by eliminating printed textbooks and worksheets. This change has accompanied e-book readers for use in the library and iPads that are distributed throughout the building on a variety of carts available for both teacher and student usage. ==Clubs and organizations== * Anime Club * Boardgame Club * Breakdance Club * Bucks Connect Program * Civil Discourse Club (CVCDC) * Color Guard * Concert Choir * Drama Club * Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA) * Fellowship of Christian Students (FCS) * Floor Hockey Club * Future Business Leaders of America * Future Nurses Club * Game Design Club * Gaming Club * Gay-Straight Alliance * German Club * Interact * Jazz band * Leo Club * Literary Magazine * Marching Band * Metal Club * Mock Trial * Model United Nations (CVMUN) * Movie Club * National Art Honor Society * National Honor Society * Newspaper Club (The Valley Voice) * Orchestra Chamber Ensembles * Ping Pong Club * Prom Committee * Quiz Bowl * Republican Club * School Store * Science Olympiad * Skateboarding Club * Ski Club * Snavely Club * Sports Movie Club * Student Athletic Training Club * Student Council * Students Against Destructive Decisions (SADD) * Tri-M Music Honor Society * Truth Club (Bible study club) * TSA Club (within PA-TSA) * Ukulele Club * Video Game Club * Weight training * Women's Chorus * Yearbook Club ==Athletics== * Baseball * Basketball * Bowling * Cheerleading * Cross country * Field hockey * Football * Golf * Lacrosse * Rifle * Soccer * Swimming * Tennis * Track * Volleyball * Wrestling ==Notable alumni== * Kim Glass - indoor volleyball player; joined the U.S. national team in the Olympics; won a silver medal in the 2008 Beijing Olympics * Jonathan Groff - actor and singer; was in the original casts of the Broadway musicals Spring Awakening and Hamilton; voiced Kristoff in the Disney movie Frozen; starred in the television series Glee, the Netflix series Mindhunter and Looking * Floyd Landis - professional cyclist; won several events including the Tour of California in 2006, and the Tour de France in 2006; convicted of doping * Ryan G.

It is the gateway to Myanmar Railways' 3,126-mile (5,031 km) rail network whose reach covers Upper Myanmar (Naypyidaw, Mandalay, Shwebo), upcountry (Myitkyina), Shan hills (Taunggyi, Kalaw) and the Taninthayi coast (Mawlamyine, Ye). The station was first built in 1877 by the British but destroyed by the retreating British in 1943 from advancing Japanese forces. The current station designed in traditional Burmese architectural style, making prominent use of indigenous tiered roofs called pyatthat, was completed in 1954, designed by U Tin. Yangon Central railway station has been designated a landmark building since 1996. In December 2007, the Yangon city government announced a master plan that will relocate Yangon Central to a satellite town, East Dagon, from downtown at an unspecified date. ==Lines== The following lines pass through or terminate at Yangon Central: *Yangon Circular Railway *Yangon‚ÄìMandalay railway *Yangon‚ÄìMawlamyaing railway *Yangon‚ÄìBagan railway *Yangon‚ÄìAunglan‚ÄìBagan railway *Yangon‚ÄìPyay railway ==History== Old Rangoon Central railway station in 1890s Yangon Central railway station was first built in 1877 by the British to support Burma's first railway line, from Yangon to Pyay. The station was located on the southern side of the railway compound on the upper block of Phayre Street (now Pansodan Street) in the downtown area. The building was designed in the British Victorian style and the access roads were bordered by grassy lawns. The beauty of the property prompted locals to praise the new structure as the Fairy Station. Yangon central railway station terminal The station became a favorite target for Japanese bombers during World War II. In 1943 it was destroyed by British forces retreating to India. The station was rebuilt following the war according to a design drawn by engineer Hla Thwin and based on Burmese traditional architectural styles. The new structure was 5110 square meters (55,000 sq ft) in size. To the north were grass lawns, gardens and wide access lanes. The new design was approved by the Railway Authority on 7 May 1946. Construction was started in January 1947 by engineer Sithu U Tin and completed in May 1954 at a total cost of K4.75 million. The opening ceremony of the new Yangon Central railway station was held on 5 June 1954. The structure is listed on the Yangon City Heritage List. ==References *Official website Category:Railway stations in Yangon Category:Railway stations opened in 1877 Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 1954 ","title":"Yangon Central railway station"},{"id":"19321930","text":"Acta Biotheoretica: Mathematical and philosophical foundations of biological and biomedical science is a quarterly peer-reviewed scientific journal published by Springer Science+Business Media.

The effect of compressing water vapor can be done by two methods. The first method utilizes an ejector system motivated by steam at manometric pressure from an external source in order to recycle vapor from the desalination process. The form is designated ejectocompression or thermocompression. Using the second method, water vapor is compressed by means of a mechanical device, electrically driven in most cases. This form is designated mechanical vapor compression (MVC). The MVC process comprises two different versions: vapor compression (VC) and vacuum vapor compression (VVC). VC designates those systems in which the evaporation effect takes place at manometric pressure, and VVC the systems in which evaporation takes place at sub-atmospheric pressures (under vacuum). The compression is mechanically powered by something such as a compression turbine. As vapor is generated, it is passed over to a heat exchanging condenser which returns the vapor to water. The resulting fresh water is moved to storage while the heat removed during condensation is transmitted to the remaining feedstock. The VVC process is the more efficient distillation process available in the market today in terms of energy consumption and water recovery ratio. As the system is electrically driven, it is considered a \\"clean\\" process, it is highly reliable and simple to operate and maintain. == See also == *Vapor-compression evaporation *Marine vapor- compression distillers == References == *AN ADVANCED VAPOR-COMPRESSION DESALINATION SYSTEM *Vacuum vapour compression water makers for the oil and gas industry :*Vacuum vapour compression water makers *AN ADVANCED MECHANICAL VAPOR COMPRESSION DESALINATION with VVC SYSTEM in desalination and purfying water industry Category:Evaporators Category:Water desalination ","title":"Vapor-compression desalination"},{"id":"19321950","text":"WFWC may refer to: * WFWC-CD, a television station (channel 45, virtual channel 45) licensed to serve Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States * WFWC-LP, a defunct low-power radio station (99.3 FM) formerly licensed to serve Fremont, North Carolina, United States * WSPQ, a radio station (1330 AM) licensed to serve Springville, New York, United States, which held the call sign WFWC in 1986 ","title":"WFWC"},{"id":"19321972","text":"William Trench may refer to: *William Trench, 1st Earl of Clancarty (1741-1805), Anglo-Irish aristocrat and politician *William Trench, 3rd Earl of Clancarty (1803-1872), Irish nobleman *William Trench III (1831-1896), reeve of Richmond Hill, Ontario *William Le Poer Trench (1837-1920), Anglo- Irish politician and British army officer ","title":"William Trench"},{"id":"19321981","text":"Jason Goulet (born February 25, 1983) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman. ==Playing career == Goulet played junior hockey in the Western Hockey League for the Saskatoon Blades and the Prince George Cougars.

He was born in Dessau, the only surviving child of Leopold III, Prince and later Duke of Anhalt-Dessau, by his wife Louise, daughter of Frederick Henry, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt. His only sibling, a sister born on 11 February 1768, was either stillborn or died shortly after her birth.Genealogical data of the rulers of Anhalt ==Life== Memorial to Hereditary Prince Frederick in K√ºhnauer Park. In 1786 he joined to the Prussian army, where he later obtained the rank of Generalfeldmarschall. In 1805 he contracted to build K√ºhnauer Park. Frederick died in Dessau, three years before his father, thus never inherited Anhalt-Dessau. His place as Leopold III's heir was taken by his older son Leopold Frederick, who succeeded his grandfather in 1817 with the name Leopold IV. ==Marriage and issue== In Bad Homburg vor der H√∂he on 12 June 1792 Frederick married Landgravine Amalie of Hesse-Homburg (b. Homburg, 29 June 1774 - d. Dessau, 3 February 1846), daughter of Frederick V, Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg. They had seven children: #Amalie Auguste (b. Dessau, 18 August 1793 - d. Rudolstadt, 12 June 1854), married on 15 April 1816 to Frederick G√ºnther, Prince of Schwarzburg- Rudolstadt. #Leopold IV Frederick, Duke of Anhalt-Dessau and since 1863 Duke of all Anhalt (b. Dessau, 1 October 1794 - d. Dessau, 22 May 1871). #George Bernhard (b. Dessau, 21 February 1796 - d. Dresden, 16 October 1865). #Paul Christian (b. Dessau, 22 March 1797 - d. Dessau, 4 May 1797). #Louise Fredericka (b. Dessau, 1 March 1798 - d. Homburg, 11 June 1858), a deaf-mute from birth; married on 12 February 1818 to her uncle Gustav, Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg (brother of her mother). #Frederick Augustus (b. Dessau, 23 September 1799 - d. Dessau, 4 December 1864). #William Waldemar (b. Dessau, 29 May 1807 - d. Vienna, 8 October 1864), married morganatically on 9 July 1840 to Emilie Klausnitzer (b. Dessau, 30 January 1812 - d. Vienna, 28 March 1888), created Freifrau von Stolzenberg in 1842. ==Connection with Mozart== The text of the German song \\"Des kleinen Friedrichs Geburtstag\\", K. 529, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, was originally written in 1778 by the poet Johann Eberhard Friedrich Schall to commemorate the ninth birthday of the Hereditary Prince Frederick. It is unknown how Mozart came across this text or why he chose to set it in Prague in 1787. All that is known is that it was entered into his own catalog of musical compositions as a completed work on 6 November 1787. ==References== Category:1769 births Category:1814 deaths Category:People from Dessau-Ro√ülau Category:Princes of Anhalt-Dessau Category:House of Ascania Category:Heirs apparent who never acceded ","title":"Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Anhalt-Dessau"},{"id":"19322064","text":"The McVickar House is located at 131 Main Street in Irvington, New York, United States. It is a wooden frame house built in the middle of the 19th century in the Greek Revival architectural style with some Picturesque decorative touches added later. In 2004 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was built by John McVickar, an Episcopalian minister who moved to the area to be close to his friend Washington Irving and establish a school, which later became the nearby Church of St. Barnabas. His son, the church's first pastor, lived in the house. It is the second oldest house on the village's Main Street. Eventually it became the property of Consolidated Edison, the regional electric utility, which still runs a small facility in the backyard. It was rented out until the 1990s. Today, after extensive restoration, it is home to the Irvington Historical Society. It operates the house both as its offices and a museum whose exhibits include a section of the first transatlantic telegraph cable. ==Building== The house is located on the north side of Main Street between North Broadway (U.S. Route 9) and Dearman Street. Surrounding buildings are generally commercial buildings of a similar scale from the 20th century. To the north is the Church of St. Barnabas, also listed on the Register. Further down Main Street, which slopes west toward the Hudson River, are two other properties listed on the Register. The trailway over the Old Croton Aqueduct, a National Historic Landmark, intersects Main two blocks to the west. On the next block, at the corner of Main and North Ferris Street, is Irvington Town Hall, still the village's municipal building. Main and portions of its adjoining streets have been proposed for a future historic district. The lot on which the house stands is in size. At its rear is an electrical substation that is not included in the Register listing. A small garden, set off from the sidewalk by a metal railing, is located at the street, next to the front steps on the west side. The house itself is a two-and-a-half-story three-by-two-bay wood frame structure on a raised fieldstone foundation, allowing for an English basement at the front. It is sided in the original clapboard and topped with a side- gabled metal roof. A single brick chimney pierces it at the east end. Wooden steps with decorative wooden railings of solid wood panels pierced by saw-cut quatrefoils climb to the hip-roofed porch which runs the length of the first story on the south (front) facade. Immediately east of them another set of steps leads down to the English basement, currently occupied by a small clothing store. The porch roof is supported by square pillars with knee braces at the top and a molded cornice. At the deck, a baluster similar to those on the steps up to the porch connects the pillars. All windows are six-over-six double-hung sash. Those on the front are flanked by louvered shutters. On the northwest corner is an enclosed smaller porch supported by square columns with simple pedestals and capitals. The overhanging eaves of the rooflines are decorated with saw-cut vergeboards. A paneled wooden door inside an entry with architrave, transom and sidelights in the westernmost bay leads to an entrance hall. The interior has been remodeled but retains some original features, most notably the staircase in that entrance hall. It has a turned mahogany newel post, round railing, and turned balusters. In the front parlor the fireplace has its original wooden mantelpiece and chimney breast. The rear has been reconfigured, with some doors and walls removed. Upstairs is another original newel post, and some of the original lath and plaster on the walls. The basement has also been modified, but may have contained the original kitchen and dining room. ==History== After a lengthy career in the Episcopal Church as a military chaplain and two-time acting president of Columbia University, where he taught the first course on political economy (the discipline now known as economics) in the U.S., The Rev. John McVickar retired to what was then known as Dearman in 1852 and built the house. His goal was to establish a chapel school he had long envisioned, with help from his friends Washington Irving, who lived at the nearby Sunnyside estate, and John Jay. It was established on a parcel just north of where the house is now. McVickar persuaded his son William to come to Dearman to preside over the school. It did not last long, eventually moving north up the Hudson Valley and becoming the root of what is today Bard College. McVickar stayed as the rector of what was now the Church of St. Barnabas. He lived in the Greek Revival house his father had built until the current rectory at St. Barnabas was built. At some point around William McVickar's death in 1868 the Picturesque detail was added to the original design. This was in keeping with trends of the time, particularly in the Hudson Valley, where the influence of Andrew Jackson Downing remained strong even after his death around the time John McVickar had taken up residence. As a result of the combination of Greek Revival form and plan with the Picturesque decoration, the house has a unique and distinct Victorian quality to it. William McVickar's daughters inherited the house from him. They sold it to their brother John a few months later, and he in turn sold it to a local grocer in 1870. It passed through a few other owners until 1957, when Consolidated Edison, the electric utility that serves Westchester County as well as New York City, bought the house in order to build the substation in the rear. They subdivided the house's interior and rented it out to various tenants through 1992. After that time the house grew neglected. It had had asbestos composite shingles placed over its clapboard siding and asphalt shingles on its roof. In the early 2000s its historic potential was recognized and it was restored in order to serve as home to the Irvington Historical Society. Con Ed sold the house to the village. The work cost a half million dollars, and included a new roof, siding, windows, heating and plumbing. The Society moved in in 2005 when the work was done. The basement became a children's center and the first story the main exhibit hall. Upstairs the rooms are used for office space, storage and work. Among the items in the permanent collection are a section of the first transatlantic telegraph cable, donated by the family of its builder, Cyrus West Field, who died in Irvington. Past exhibits have been devoted to household chores and collectibles. The museum is open two afternoons a week. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in southern Westchester County, New York ==References *McVickar House, at Irvington Historical Society Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:National Register of Historic Places in Westchester County, New York Category:Houses completed in 1853 Category:Houses in Westchester County, New York Category:Irvington, New York Category:Consolidated Edison ","title":"McVickar House"},{"id":"19322120","text":"Erax aestuans is a species of insect in the family Asilidae, the robber flies.

It is a stone Gothic Revival structure whose oldest sections date to the mid-19th century, with several expansions undertaken since then. The reputedly haunted church complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. At first the church was a small chapel modeled on St Martin's Church in Canterbury, the oldest church in continuous use in England. It was part of a school, but after six years that was abandoned and it became a parish church. An expansion into the present structure a decade later was designed by the firm of architect James Renwick, Jr.. Among its members have been Washington Irving, Philip Schuyler and Jay Gould, all of whom lived in the area. Since its construction it has been expanded several times. Most additions have been either sympathetic to the original architecture or unobtrusive. Its congregation plays a major role in the Irvington community, sponsoring several local programs including the village's only day care center. ==Buildings and grounds== The church occupies a lot on the west side of North Broadway (U.S. Route 9) just north of the intersection with Irvington's Main Street. To its north is a 19th-century Presbyterian church. On the south are properties along the north side of Main Street, a mix of commercial and residential buildings, including the McVickar House, also listed on the Register and currently home to the Irvington Historical Society. Across the street is a modern residential development; on the west the church property is bounded by the trailway along the route of the Old Croton Aqueduct, a linear National Historic Landmark. A driveway leads into the property from North Broadway, opening into a large annular parking area just northeast of the main church building, where it meets a walkway from a lych gate along Broadway. The parish house extends from its north side, to the west of the parking area. A modern garage is attached to its west. South of the church is the rectory. All buildings on the property except the garage, and the lychgate, are considered contributing resources to the church's historic character. To the west of the garage is a small playground, amidst a broader lawn. Tall mature trees shade the buildings and line the edges of the property. The terrain slopes gently west, towards the Hudson River. ===Church=== The main church building incorporates the original chapel built on the site. It is an asymmetrical one-story building on a partial basement with granite walls topped by a gabled slate roof. The lancet arched windows have limestone molding and tracery, while the tower and buttresses are trimmed with bluestone coping. At the center is a 55-foot-tall () square crenelated tower with a louvered vent on all four sides between two bluestone courses and flat roof. On its southeast corner is a smaller, round tower with a conical roof. The church's two entrances are located on a side aisle on the north; there is a small chapel at the west end. Inside the sanctuary, the floor is mosaic. Plaster walls and ceilings are complemented by dark wood tongue and groove wainscoting and exposed trusses. It is illuminated by 15 stained glass windows. alt=An elaborate stone and wood gate with a slate roof and dormer Like the church, the parish hall wing is a one-and-a-half granite structure with Gothic detail and a gabled roof. However, it is sheathed in asphalt shingles rather than slate. Inside it has a large meeting room with original woodwork. The modern office wing that connects the parish hall to the church has vertical wood siding, large casement windows and a flat roof. The modern classroom extension to the west of the parish hall has a similar treatment. Both of these elements are sited so as to be unobtrusive from the street. ===Rectory and lych gate=== South of the church, the rectory is a granite structure with a slate roof. Later additions include a front piazza and a rear wing sided in clapboard and roofed in asphalt. Its interior retains some of its original woodwork and layout, although it has been remodeled several times. A modern garage, the only non-contributing resource on the property, is adjacent. The smallest historic resource on the property is the lych gate. Framing the view of the church from Broadway, it is also a granite and limestone structure with a slate roof and wooden Gothic detail. Atop is a gabled clock and copper finials. ==History== St. Barnabas began as a school. The Rev. John McVickar, a friend of early American author Washington Irving, bought the where the church is presently located in order to be closer to Irving's estate, Sunnyside, a National Historic Landmark (NHL). The two frequently spent evenings on Irving's veranda watching the sun set across the Hudson, and during their conversations came up with the idea to establish a school and chapel on the property. Irving contributed some of the money while the rest came from descendants of the state's Revolutionary-era notables such as John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, and Trinity Church in Manhattan. McVickar took responsibility for the design. He had studied church architecture since the early years of the 19th century, which had led him to believe that the key aspect of a beautiful church was its proportions rather than its materials. He is said to have based the building on St Martin's Church in Canterbury, a 6th- century structure that is the oldest church in continuous use in England and today a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is likely that he designed the rectory as well, since a drawing of it from the time shows its basic rectangular form and Gothic detail. It was dedicated on June 2, 1853, St. Barnabas Day. In 1858 it was decided to abandon the school and establish the chapel as a parish within the Episcopal Church, the first in the village, whose residents of that denomination had previously worshipped at Christ Episcopal Church in Tarrytown to the north. McVickar's son William, who had been a missionary to the village and rector of Zion Church in Dobbs Ferry, was appointed the first pastor. His father built a house for him near the church on what is today Irvington's Main Street. The original chapel sufficed for the congregation initially. But by 1863 it had gotten too small. Renwick & Sands, the firm of James Renwick Jr., who had already designed New York City's Grace Church and St. Patrick's Cathedral, as well as the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the Main Building at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie further up the Hudson Valley, all today NHLs, received the commission. At the time the firm was busy completing St. Patrick's. Two of its other commissions of the time, Riverdale Presbyterian Church and the William E. Dodge House, both located in the Bronx and also listed on the Register, share similar stonework, steep roofs and arched windows, but little else, with St. Barnabas. The expansion added the tower, transept and chancel to the original building, which today survives as the nave. In the basement some of its framing, including whole logs, is still visible. The expansion of the property under the church's control continued when the McVickar family donated the rectory and its land to the church in 1876. Its piazza was reportedly added in 1889. Jay Gould, whose Lyndhurst estate, another NHL, is located north of Sunnyside, donated the remaining land the following year. alt=A stone building with a gabled roof, dormer windows and a castle-like front entrance Over time the stained glass windows were added from different makers, including the first of two Tiffany windows, in 1896. Three years later the lych gate was built, and the parish hall added in 1902. The latter was designed by local architect Albert J. Manning, who also built Irvington's nearby village hall, in the more current Collegiate Gothic style. All were meant to be architecturally consistent with the church. Another, smaller expansion in 1906 added electric lighting. That year the church hosted a major event, the funeral of Irvington resident, Gen. Phillip Schuyler. The grandson of the Revolutionary War general of the same name, Schuyler had attained the rank of brigadier general during the Civil War with the Army of the Potomac. While on a hunting trip late in 1906, he was killed in the same train accident that took the life of Samuel Spencer, president of the Southern Railway. He had lived in nearby Ardsley-on-Hudson after retiring from a long business career, and worshipped at St. Barnabas. Due to the Schuyler family's prominence within the state, the funeral drew many notable attendees. A special train from the city carried 200 friends, representing many of its esteemed organizations and institutions. J. P. Morgan came on his own train with private car and special locomotive. Joseph Choate and Ogden Mills were also in attendance. The crowd was larger than the church could hold. Changes to the church continued. In 1924 the parish hall's basement was equipped with a bowling alley and rifle range, leading to heavy use by the local Boy Scouts and Irvington's police department. The next addition was the Luke Memorial Chapel on the north side of the church, designed by Delano & Aldrich and built in 1945. The office and Sunday school wings, the latter connecting the parish hall to the church, completed the current complex in the 1960s. ==Reputed ghosts== There have been claims that the ghosts of some previous occupants haunt the building. One occupant matched a photo of one former member of a 19th-century pastor's family to a woman she frequently saw sitting in a rocking chair, knitting. In 2000, several workers installing a new organ left the church in rush after seeing an apparition in the sanctuary. It was believed by some members of the church to be the ghost of William McVickar. ==Beliefs and programs== St. Barnabas is part of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. It describes itself as \\"a Christian community that seeks to serve Christ in all persons, loving our neighbors as ourselves\\". Baptism is the only requirement for full membership. The current rector, The Rev. Gareth C. Evans, is the 14th to hold the position. Ordained in the Church of England in 1996, he became canonically resident in the Episcopal Church in 2004 and a U.S. citizen in 2016. The church holds two services every Sunday. The 8AM service is Rite I Holy Eucharist according to the Book Common Prayer. The later service at 10AM is Rite II Holy Eucharist with choir and pipe organ. The summer schedule begins the Sunday after the Patronal Festival of St. Barnabas with one Rite II service of Holy Eucharist at 9AM. Among its programs are children and youth ministries; The youth group meets monthly; its members go on field trips and play roles in the church's Christmas pageant and on St. Barnabas Day. The church sponsors, and takes part in, a wide range of community outreach activities. It runs an annual clothing and thrift sale to benefit various local non-profit organizations. The Irvington Children's Center, the village's only day care center, is resident in the Sunday school wing and independently operated. Local chapters of Alcoholics Anonymous, Al- anon and Families Anonymous meet in the church. Member collect non-perishable food and disposable diapers for two local food pantries. ==See also== *List of reportedly haunted locations in the United States *National Register of Historic Places listings in southern Westchester County, New York ==References *Church of St. Barnabas, at Irvington Historical Society *Church of St. Barnabas website *Images of stained glass windows *Church blog * Category:Episcopal church buildings in New York (state) Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:National Register of Historic Places in Westchester County, New York Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in New York (state) Category:U.S. Route 9 Category:Religious organizations established in 1858 Category:19th-century Episcopal church buildings Category:Reportedly haunted locations in New York (state) Category:Churches in Westchester County, New York Category:Irvington, New York Category:Churches completed in 1853 Category:1858 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Church of St. Barnabas (Irvington, New York)"},{"id":"19322221","text":"Cyrinda Foxe (born Kathleen Victoria Hetzekian; February 22, 1952 ‚Äì September 7, 2002) was an American actress, model and publicist, best known for her role in Andy Warhol's Bad (1977). She was married to both David Johansen of the proto-punk band New York Dolls and Steven Tyler of the hard rock band Aerosmith. She was the mother of Mia Tyler. ==Early life== Foxe was born Kathleen Victoria Hetzekian in Santa Monica, California, to an Armenian family. She grew up as an army brat in an abusive household. After graduating high school, she lived in Texas briefly before settling in New York City, where she got a job working as an assistant to Greta Garbo. She later changed her name and began frequenting Max's Kansas City, the famous nightclub, and became an actress. ==Career== Foxe had affairs with David Bowie and James Williamson of The Stooges while working under Tony Defries as a publicist for MainMan, Bowie's management company. She also appeared in the music video for Bowie's 1973 single, \\"The Jean Genie.\\" Bowie wanted the video to depict \\"Ziggy as a kind of Hollywood street-rat\\" with a \\"consort of the Marilyn brand\\". This led to Foxe's casting, and she flew from New York to San Francisco especially for the shoot.David Bowie & Mick Rock (2005).

In his memoir, Arthur Kane characterized Foxe as being \\"bright [and] very magnetic\\" and having \\"an effervescence about her\\" as \\"[she was] very much a character of her own creation.\\" Having grown up idolizing the Rolling Stones, Foxe became closely associated with the New York Dolls, a band often compared to the Stones. In 1977, after years of dating, she married David Johansen, the band's lead singer. It was while Foxe was married to Johansen that she met Aerosmith's lead singer, Steven Tyler. After less than a year of marriage to Johansen, Foxe left him for Steven Tyler. Foxe and Tyler married and had a daughter, Mia, but the marriage was troubled by drug addiction, extramarital affairs, and physical and emotional abuse. Foxe and Tyler divorced shortly before Aerosmith made a comeback in the late 1980s. She raised Mia in Sunapee, New Hampshire and New York City. ==Personal life== In 1997, Foxe's memoir, Dream On: Livin' on the Edge with Steven Tyler and Aerosmith, co-written with Danny Fields, was published. Not long after the book was released, Foxe announced that the paperback edition of Dream On would include nude photos of Steven Tyler, but Tyler won a lawsuit in 1999, preventing Foxe from publishing the photos. In 2000, she launched a web site in which she was selling nude pictures of Tyler, but the site closed by the end of the year. ==Death== In 2001, Foxe had a mild stroke. She received Medicaid and food stamps, but she had no apartment or place to live. Myra Freidman organized a benefit at CBGB to raise money for Foxe. Steven Tyler, who also paid her hospital bills, donated a signed Aerosmith guitar to the benefit, which sold for $5000. David Bowie also donated an acoustic guitar. Tyler agreed to pay for a room for Foxe at the Gramercy Park Hotel where, on August 28, 2002, she married musician Keith Waa. Foxe died at age 50 from an inoperable brain tumor on September 7, 2002. ==ReferencesMary Anne Christiano. Interview Punk magazine.

He promoted ideas of Afrocentrism, atheism, and Jesus Christ in comparative mythology. ==Early life and education== Jackson was born in Aiken, South Carolina, on April 1, 1907, and raised Methodist. At the age of 15 he moved to Harlem, New York, where he enrolled in Stuyvesant High School. During this time, he became interested in African-American history and culture and began writing essays on the subject. His work was noticed and in 1925, while still a high school student, Jackson was invited to write for Marcus Garvey's newspaper, Negro World.AfricaWithin, short biography. ==Career== From 1930 onwards, Jackson became associated with a number of Pan-African historians, activists and writers, including Hubert Harrison, Arturo Alfonso Schomburg, John Henrik Clarke, Willis Nathaniel Huggins, Joel Augustus Rogers, and Marcus Garvey. He also authored a number of books on African history, promoting a Pan-African and Afrocentrist view, such as Man, God, and Civilization (1972) and Introduction to African Civilizations (1974). He also became interested in the idea of Christianity's origins in the Egyptian religion. An unapologetic atheist, he authored a number of books on the idea, including The African Origin of Christianity (1981) and Christianity before Christ (1985), as well as writing the foreword to Gerald Massey's Lectures (1974). He also wrote the controversial text, Was Jesus Christ a Negro? (1984), which argued that Jesus may have been a black man.Africa Within, bibliography. In 1987, Jackson wrote a biographical article about Hubert Harrison for American Atheists entitled \\"Hubert Henry Harrison: The Black Socrates\\". In it, he praised not only Harrison's agnostic atheism, but also his educational and civil rights achievements. It was later published as a seven-page pamphlet. Jackson had previously lauded Harrison, and other Black atheists of Harlem, in a 1984 speech at the American Atheists national convention entitled 'The Black Atheists of the Harlem Renaissance'. During the five decades that he lived in New York, Jackson lectured at the Robert G. Ingersoll forum of the American Association for the Advancement of Atheism.

A centenarian, he was the oldest Dutch Roman Catholic bishop. ==Life== Ernst had his seminary years in the Diocese of Breda and was ordained a priest on 7 June 1941. Later he taught moral theology at the diocesan seminary although he never went to a university or any school for further theological training. Ernst, at the time vicar- general of the Diocese of Breda, was appointed bishop of the same Diocese on 3 November 1967 after the sudden death of his predecessor, Gerardus Henricus De Vet; he was consecrated by Cardinal Bernard Alfrink on 17 December the same year. He remained bishop of the Diocese of Breda until retirement on 6 May 1992. He stayed on running the Diocese, however, as an Apostolic Administrator for another two and a half years. Ernst himself consecrated his successor, Martinus Petrus Maria Muskens in 1994, and was in 2007 also Co-Consecrator when the latter resigned and consecrated the current dignitary Hans van den Hende. He turned 100 in April 2017 and died a month later.https://www.rkkerk.nl/bisschoppen-feliciteren-100-jarige-bisschop- hubertus-ernst/ ==Pax Christi== In 1976 the Dutch Catholic Peace Movement, Pax Christi, asked Ernst to be the next President of its organisation, becoming Alfrink's successor. Ernst, former Professor of Moral Theology at the Diocesan Seminary, had always cherished strong views on for instance nuclear pacifism. Even after his retirement as a Bishop and after the end of his Presidency at Pax Christi he spoke out vehemently against President George W. Bush's War on Terror. In his opinion such views contradicted the moral teaching of the Catholic Church as has been said in ¬ß 112 of the encyclical Pacem in terris of Pope John XXIII. ==See also== *Diocese of Breda ==References *Catholic-Hierarchy *Diocese Site Category:1917 births Category:2017 deaths Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:People from Breda Category:Roman Catholic bishops in the Netherlands Category:Dutch centenarians ","title":"Hubertus Ernst"},{"id":"19322465","text":"The Rod of Seven Parts is an accessory for the 2nd edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, written by Skip Williams and published in 1996, that focuses on the artifact of the same name, detailing its history and including an adventure centered around finding its parts. ==Plot summary== At the Dawn of Time the forces of Law warred with the forces of Chaos for control of the Cosmos. The Battle of Pesh was the climax of this campaign where the armies of Chaos were led by Miska the Wolf-Spider, while the forces of Law were championed by the Vaati, or Wind Dukes. Desperately outnumbered, the Wind Dukes fashioned the Rod of Seven Parts, a weapon powerful enough to kill Miska in a single strike. Yet the Battle of Pesh was a draw, as neither Law nor Chaos won the day. The Wind Dukes were decimated, but in the final moments their leader struck Miska with the Rod, but rather than being slain the Wolf-Spider was mortally wounded and imprisoned for eternity within the Abyss. The resulting balance created the multiverse as it now exists, with a tense stand-off between order and anarchy. The fate of the multiverse is in the hands of the wielder of the Rod of Seven Parts, for it can still both slay Miska and free him. Because the Rod is so potent, it cannot be conventionally protected. Therefore, to keep it safe the Wind Dukes designed the separate sections of the Rod to scatter around the globe whenever its full powers were employed by striking Miska. Each piece of the Rod both leads and urges its bearer in the direction of the next sequential section. Once the first section of the Rod has fallen into the hands of the player characters they are committed to a quest which will take them the length and breadth of their homeworld, and eventually into the heart of the Abyss. The third segment is held by a Cloud Giant Clan who is currently at war with a local family of dragons. The party can side with the giants against the dragons and hope to earn the segment as a reward, or else side with the dragons against the giants and infiltrate the giant's lair under cover of polymorph. ==Rod of Seven Parts== The Rod of Seven Parts is a 5-foot-long pole when whole. The command words for each piece are \\"Ruat,\\" \\"Caelum,\\" \\"Fiat,\\" \\"Justitia,\\" \\"Ecce,\\" \\"Lex,\\" and \\"Rex,\\" which collectively make up a Latin phrase that translates into \\"Though chaos reign, let justice be done. Behold! Law is king.\\" The artifact is described as singular, with creator Gary Gygax emphasizing that only one exists. The Eldritch Wizardry guidelines described each piece as having its own unique powers. In a gaming scenario, the more parts of the rod a user possessed, the more powerful each one of the seven parts became. The Rod was one of the first artifacts detailed for the Dungeons & Dragons game. The artifact was updated for AD&D; 2ndCook, David. Dungeon Master's Guide (TSR, 1989) and 3rd editionsCagle, Eric, Jesse Decker, Jeff Quick, Rich Redman, and James Wyatt. Arms and Equipment Guide (Wizards of the Coast, 2003) The Rod of Seven Parts artifact first appeared in the 1976 TSR (Gygax & Blume) publication Eldritch Wizardry. It was the centerpiece of a story concerning a long-ago \\"great war\\" between characters known as Wind Dukes of Aaqa and the Queen of Chaos. At the time the artifact was in one piece, and was known as The Rod of Law. In the story, the Rod of Law was used in the Battle of Pesh to imprison the Queen's greatest general, a character known as Miska the Wolf-Spider, Prince of Demons. The rod was broken into seven fragments during this conflict, and the seven individual pieces were scattered across the world. Game designer Ken Rolston has called the Rod \\"the greatest story\\". Fellow game designer Hal Barwood said the concept of a rod of many parts forms the basis for a process of \\"corporealizing and then atomizing\\" a game's story, where a single item is broken into pieces and the players are tasked with finding and assembling the parts. The Rod of Seven Parts is one of the few artifacts to be given a detailed history and guide for any campaign world. An earlier adventure featuring the Rod appeared in an RPGA tournament adventure called \\"The 'Dwarven' Quest for the Rod of Seven Parts\\" by Frank Mentzer in 1982.http://www.greyhawkonline.com/grodog/gh_tourneys_r7-10.html The Rod of Seven Parts was also a featured item in a fantasy novel by Douglas Niles, titled The Rod of Seven Parts. The story deals with the return of the Rod and the forces of Chaos trying to keep it apart. This makes the Rod the only major Dungeons & Dragons magical artifact to be featured in its own stand alone product and a novel. ==Reception== Trenton Webb reviewed The Rod of Seven Parts for Arcane magazine, rating it a 9 out of 10 overall. He commented that \\"The power and success of The Rod of Seven Parts campaign stems directly from the artefact itself\\" and states that the quest is \\"a big, character- killing task that's probably a bit too long for its own good, but one that's so fascinating it's well worth sticking with\\". Webb comments: \\"The success of The Rod of Seven Parts lies in its flexibility. With three starting points and three possible conclusions there's real scope for players to make their own decisions rather than scrabbling to satisfy a designer's conditions. Throughout each set-piece useful trouble-shooting guides crop up and alternative solutions are suggested to the ref. In essence, The Rod of Seven Parts guides the course of events rather than forcing the pace.\\" He continues: \\"And so this relaxed approach encourages players through the adventures, but these are not the only carrots that this stick has to offer. There are glorious visual cue cards which will help the players to picture the locations and characters they meet perfectly. These are indicative of the extremely high standard of artwork throughout all three manuals and the vast number of maps, which underline the superior quality of the set.\\" Webb adds: \\"The weaknesses of The Rod are few and far between. There are a few annoying typographical errors [...] which trip up an otherwise highly readable manual. The only real problem, though, is the size - in all honesty, the campaign may just be too big for one party to play through.\\" He continues: \\"However, The Rod of Seven Parts is a very persuasive adventure because it addresses the fraught issue of heroic power. Potent artefacts have a way of finding themselves powerful guardians, so parties are going to have to tackle some major league nasties if they are to ensure its safe assembly. Yet these aren't just monsters that have been dropped in to crank up the combat, but well-rounded NPCs with an agenda of their own. If players keep their ears open and their brains in gear it should become obvious how to reclaim the next section without the need for a fight, or, if it comes to blows, the best way to tip the balance in their favour. It's this ability to turn no-win scenarios into victories that separates heroes from hardmen, and it's what drives the Rod campaign. Regarding the choice between siding with either the dragons or the giants, Webb said \\"The chances of even a tough party beating either group in a battle are pretty slim, and their chances of victory over both together are nonexistent. So players are forced to muster up their courage and attempt to survive this vicious intrigue long enough to spot and steal the segment. [...] And stepping into a Cloud Giant Castle which you know could well come under serious Dragon attack at any second is a great gulp moment, regardless of how hard you reckon you are!\\" ==Further reading== *\\"A History of the Rod of Seven Parts\\", Dragon #224 *\\"The Rod of Seven Parts, World by World\\", Dragon #233 *Henson, Dale, and Doug Stewart, eds.

The car is directly based on the standard F430 and uses the same 4.3L V8 engine. It was introduced at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show to succeed the Ferrari 360 Challenge in the Ferrari Challenge and the Rolex Sports Car racing series. ==Overview== Ferrari F430 Challenge at New Jersey Motorsports Park F430 Challenge interior The F430 Challenge is a non-road legal variant of the road-going Ferrari F430, it has been extensively modified by Ferrari to boost its on circuit performance with extensive weight reduction and suspension changes. Just like in previous Ferrari Challenge cars the engine has largely remained the same as on the production road cars except for some enhanced breathing by means of a racing exhaust system and some engine management tweaks and fine blueprinting. Furthermore, the body styling has received very few styling changes with the Formula One inspired single central nut (slick shod) BBS wheels hiding enormous carbon brakes. The transmission is derived from Ferrari's Formula One program and offers the same 150 ms shift times as in the standard Ferrari F430 with no option of a manual H-gate gearshift. Fifth and sixth gears have been tweaked, as well as the final drive ratio, specifically for the Challenge car. Weight saving efforts have affected all areas of the car, the most noticeable of which is the cockpit. Inside, the F430 Challenge has no carpets or sound deadening, no stereo, and the standard leather seats have been replaced with ultra-light FIA approved carbon racing seats. A lifeline snaps off boss allows the Alcantara steering wheel to be removed from the car to aid entry and exit to the cockpit. The race wheel replacing the standard cars airbag-equipped road car wheel. It also has buttons for pit radio, and for interfacing with the digital instrument display. A full roll cage and 6 point racing harnesses are also present in the cockpit along with super-light carbon door panels and Lexan front, side, and rear windows replacing all-road car glass. The characteristics of the car have been retained from the standard gearbox's \\"Race\\" mode. Traction control is permanently disengaged, along with the stability system. The car does retain ABS and ASR though. The racing modifications are present in almost all of the components, with the E-Differential being replaced by a mechanical one, and the suspension settings modified for racing. Production was limited to just 142 cars over the 2007 to 2010 production period. It is estimated that more than half of these race cars have been written off during the various Ferrari Challenge series around the world. This means that approximately 50 (or less) would be in existence today. ==Performance== The engine is the same 90¬∞ 4.3-litre V8 as in the standard F430. The output remains the same at , as well as the torque at . The engine is equipped with Double Overhead Camshafts and contains 4 valves per cylinder. The engine is, and always has been, naturally- aspirated. The engine is mounted behind the cockpit and faces longitudinally (along the length of the car). The transmission is the 6-speed, paddle operated, automated manual, as found in the standard F430. The transmission uses Formula 1 technology and can shift gears in 150 ms. The brakes use carbon-ceramic material, which is very resistant to brake fade. Both front and rear suspension used double wishbones and anti-roll bars. The exhaust system is updated for the Challenge car, placing the outlet ports higher in the back of the car. The back also includes a new grille to help with drawing heat out of the engine.

He was sometimes credited as Yoshinori Nishizaki. He was born in 1934 and graduated from the Nihon University Art Department. ==Life and work== Nishizaki graduated in 1957 from Nippon University. His first love was music; he owned a jazz club and was also a jazz radio personality. He formed Office Academy in 1963 as a music production company. Nishizaki's entry into the anime world came in 1970 when he joined Osamu Tezuka's animation studio, Mushi Production, as a sales manager; his first job was to sell the studio's anime Marvelous Melmo to a TV broadcaster in Osaka. Nishizaki produced his first anime, Triton of the Sea, in 1972, and followed it up with the ambitious musical comedy Wansa-kun in 1973; both were based on Tezuka manga, but due to an apparent copyright mixup on Nishizaki's part, Tezuka lost the rights to the anime versions of both series, and Mushi Production made both shows without Tezuka's involvement. Both shows were also ratings disappointments. Nishizaki produced the classic Space Battleship Yamato franchise in 1974 with its initial television run. At first its ratings were as disappointing as those of Nishizaki's previous ventures; however, the franchise exploded in popularity in 1977 with the release of a hugely successful movie-length edit of the TV series, and \\"Yamato Fever\\" continued unabated in Japan for the next six years. Edited versions of the three Yamato TV series were also a cult success in the United States under the title Star Blazers. Nishizaki's other works produced during and after Yamato's peak of popularity did not come close to matching the explosive popularity of Yamato, and during the 1990s, he began to fall into rough straits financially. His company, New Japan Visual Network, founded in 1984, declared bankruptcy in 1991, and Nishizaki himself declared bankruptcy in 1997 amidst his wrangling with Yamato co-creator Leiji Matsumoto over the copyrights to Yamato. In 1994, Nishizaki designed a short-lived follow-up series called Yamato 2520, and was later sued by Matsumoto for breach of copyright. The case over Yamato led to halting the production of the video series after only three episodes. The dispute was finally settled in 2003, with Nishizaki winning the use of the name Yamato and the original plot and characters but losing the use of the original conceptual art, ship and character designs to Matsumoto. Nishizaki's new Space Battleship Yamato anime film was released December 12, 2009. There is also a live action film adaptation of the first TV series produced by Nishizaki which premiered in Japan during December 2010. ==Legal troubles== On December 2, 1997, police stopped his car on the T≈çmei Expressway in Shizuoka after he was driving suspiciously. He was arrested when police found inside his attache case 50g of stimulants, 7g of morphine, 9g of marijuana. While on bail he went to the Philippines on his English-registered cruiser the Ocean Nine; he returned to smuggle in an M16 with M203 grenade launcher, a Glock 17, and a large amount of ammunition.„ÄåÂÆáÂÆôÊà¶Ëâ¶„É§„Éû„Éà„Éó„É≠„Éá„É•„Éº„Çµ„Éº Ë¶ö„Åõ„ÅÑÂâ§ÊâÄÊåÅÂÆπÁñë„ÅßÈÄÆÊçï„Äç„ÄéÊúùÊó•Êñ∞ËÅû„Äè1998Âπ¥1Êúà17Êó• On January 21, 1999, Nishizaki was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison for the narcotics possession charge. Later on February 1, 1999, he was arrested after a handgun, 131 bullets and 20 grams of stimulant drugs were seized from his house in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo. Nishizaki, voluntarily submitted two automatic rifles, 1,800 bullets, and 30 howitzer shells kept in a station wagon in his garage, police said. Police said that Nishizaki had hidden an Austrian handgun loaded with three bullets under a zaisu chair in a study. Nishizaki told police that he had bought the handgun in Hong Kong 10 years earlier.„ÄåÂÆáÂÆôÊà¶Ëâ¶„É§„Éû„Éà Ë£Ω‰ΩúËÄÖ„ÅåÈäÉÊâÄÊåÅ Ë¶ö„Åõ„ÅÑÂâ§„ÇÇ„Äç„ÄéÊó•Êú¨ÁµåÊ∏àÊñ∞ËÅû„Äè1999Âπ¥2Êúà2Êó• On February 20, 2003, he was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison for the possessing firearms charge.

Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe for their 1951 Broadway musical, Paint Your Wagon, which is set in the California Gold Rush. Rufus Smith originally sang the song on Broadway, and Joseph Leader was the original singer in London's West End. It quickly became a runaway hit, and during the Korean War, the song was among the \\"popular music listened to by the troops\\". Vaughn Monroe and his Orchestra recorded the song in 1951, and it was among the \\"popular hit singles at the record stores\\" that year. It has since become a standard, performed by many notable singers across several genres of popular music. A striking feature of the song in the original orchestration (also used in many cover versions), is a driving, staccato rhythm, played on the string instruments, that evokes a sense of restless motion. ==Critical reception== It has been called Paint Your Wagon's \\"best known song\\" and \\"rousing but plaintive.\\" Musicologist Stephen Citron wrote, \\"Perhaps the most unusual song in the score is a beautiful ballad of lonely prospectors hungering for their women, \\"They Call the Wind Maria\\" ‚Äì not chauvinistic in this case, for each man is yearning for his own girl.\\" Composer and conductor Lehman Engel wrote that the song \\"has a cowboy flavor\\", and commented that \\"In the lyric, its folk quality is accentuated.\\" Engel concluded that \\"Lerner has invented an interesting kind of narration\\". Princeton University historian Robert V. Wells wrote that it is \\"a sad and wistful song about being far from home\\". Theater historian Don B. Wilmeth called the song \\"haunting\\", and said that it evokes \\"emptiness\\". Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. ==Folk music revival== The song gained renewed popularity during the American folk music revival. In 1959, it was included on the Kingston Trio's first live album, ...From the Hungry i, which reached #2 on the Billboard Pop chart and won a RIAA gold record in 1960.Liner notes: The Kingston Trio and ...from the Hungry i Capitol Records reissue. Liner notes by Ben Blake, 1992. It was also included on the Smothers Brothers first album, The Songs and Comedy of the Smothers Brothers! Recorded at the Purple Onion, San Francisco, released in 1961. Other folk singers who performed the song include Josh White and Burl Ives. Musical historian John Bush Jones wrote that the song \\"so evokes the American West that during the folksinging craze of the later 1950s countless Americans thought 'They Call the Wind Maria' was a folksong, not a show tune!\\" ==1969 film version== The song was featured in the 1969 Hollywood film Paint Your Wagon, starring Lee Marvin, Clint Eastwood and Jean Seberg. In the film, the song was performed by Harve Presnell. The New York Times said that Presnell's role in the film \\"delivered the golden opportunity to sing the unforgettable ballad.\\"Grimes, William.\\"Harve Presnell, Singing Actor, Dies at 75,\\"The New York Times, July 2, 2009 Theater writer Thomas Hischak said that \\"in one of the film's few pleasing moments, Harve Presnell gave full voice to 'They Call the Wind Maria' and it was lovely to hear\\". Referring to Eastwood and Marvin, film reviewer Brian W. Fairbanks wrote that \\"Harve Presnell steals both stars' thunder with a knockout version of the best song.\\" In a promotional tie-in with release of the film, recorded versions of the song were issued by seven singers and groups, including Presnell, Ed Ames, Burl Ives, Jim Nabors and the Baja Marimba Band. Several record labels participated. This version appeared in 50 First Dates where it was played at the conclusion of the first half of the end credits during the dedication message to Stanley Sandler who was the real-life father of the film's star Adam Sandler. ==Background and pronunciation of \\"Maria\\"== In George Rippey Stewart's 1941 novel Storm, he names the storm that is the protagonist of his story Maria. In 1947, Stewart wrote a new introduction for a reprint of the book, and discussed the pronunciation of \\"Maria\\": \\"The soft Spanish pronunciation is fine for some heroines, but our Maria here is too big for any man to embrace and much too boisterous.\\" He went on to say, \\"So put the accent on the second syllable, and pronounce it 'rye'\\". The success of Stewart's novel was one factor that motivated U.S. military meteorologists to start the informal practice of giving women's names to storms in the Pacific during World War II. The practice became official in 1945. In 1953, a similar system of using women's names was adopted for North Atlantic storms. This continued until 1979, when men's names were incorporated into the system. Although Stewart's novel is set in 1935, the novel and its effect on meteorology later inspired Lerner and Lowe to write a song for their play about the California gold rush, and like Stewart, they too gave a wind storm the name Maria, which is pronounced . The lines throughout the song end in feminine rhymes mostly using the long 'i' sound /a…™/, echoing the stress pattern and vowel sound of the name Maria. ==Cultural influence== The American singer, songwriter and producer Mariah Carey was named after this song. Maria Creek, a glacial meltwater stream in Antarctica, was given its name on account of the strong winds in the area. An episode of the TV series M*A*S*H is called ‚ÄúThey Call the Wind Korea‚Äù (S7,E8 - originally aired 10/30/78). ==Other versions== Broadway and recording star Robert Goulet considered it \\"a personal favorite\\", and a version by Jack Barlow charted at number 58 on Hot Country Songs. Other notable acts who have performed the song include: *101 Strings *Ed Ames *Baja Marimba Band *Leon Bibb *Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers *The Browns *Arthur Conley *Sam Cooke *The Country Gentlemen *Vic Damone *Eddie Fisher *Gila Bend *Richard Kiley *Frankie Laine *Vaughan Monroe and his Orchestra *Jim Nabors *P.J.

When he was two years old, the family moved to Port Arthur on the Texas Gulf Coast, where he was reared. He graduated in 1952 from Thomas Jefferson High School, now known as Memorial High School, and then, for one academic year, attended Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas, known at the time as Lamar Technical Institute. Himself a Baptist, Robbins graduated in 1956 from East Texas Baptist University in Marshall in east Texas with credentials in business administration and sociology. From 1957 to 1959, Robbins served in the United States Army and was on the Fourth Army track team. He set a record for the javelin throw, the same event in which he had lettered at ETBU. In the Army, he met the son of a film producer who told him about job opportunities in Hollywood as a stuntman. ==Moving to Bandera, Texas== After military service, Robbins moved to Bandera, a small community west of San Antonio which calls itself \\"The Cowboy Capital of the World\\". He worked there for a time as a wrangler at the Dixie Dude Ranch until he was offered a speaking but unnamed role as one of the Tennessee Volunteers in John Wayne's epic The Alamo, which was filmed not in San Antonio but near Brackettville in Kinney County in south central Texas. In The Alamo, Robbins was involved in a short dialogue repeated several times during the film: a fellow-Tennessean would review a developing situation and ask Robbins, \\"Do this mean what I think it do?\\" Robbins would reply, \\"It do.\\" Thereafter, John Wayne called Robbins by the nickname \\"It Do\\"; one of Robbins' treasured possessions is a souvenir Alamo mug addressed to \\"It Do\\" from \\"Duke\\", Wayne's nickname.\\"Rudy Robbins\\", Texas Hill Country Magazine, Winter 2007:http://www.hillcountrymagazine.com/issues/20074/128.php After The Alamo, Robbins went to Hollywood but returned semi-permanently to Bandera in 1971 though he was on tour for many of the following years. ==Acting and stunts== Wayne introduced Robbins to legendary director John Ford, who hired him as an actor in Two Rode Together with James Stewart and Richard Widmark (also filmed near Brackettville) and later for stunts in Cheyenne Autumn, also with Widmark, and in three other Wayne films, McLintock! with Maureen O'Hara), The Green Berets and Rio Lobo (1970). Robbins' other parts were for uncredited stunts in The Rounders (1965) and Sugarland Express (1974). He also appeared as a mechanic in Sugarland Express. He did stunts for CBS's Gunsmoke in 1964, acting as a double for series star James Arness. In 1966, Robbins played Josh Cutler in NBC's Daniel Boone with Fess Parker.Internet Movie Database:https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0730454/ Robbins holds Parker, later a large Los Angeles developer, in high esteem because Parker paid him in advance: \\"He knew I was hard up. When I showed up on Monday morning, he handed me an envelope with my first episode‚Äôs pay in advance,\\" recalls Robbins. Along with Wayne, Clint Eastwood, and Charlton Heston, Robbins was awarded honorary membership in the Stuntmen's Association of Motion Pictures. Robbins also trained horses for other stuntmen and became a production manager for various shows. ==Later activities== In 1967, he was selected by the United States Department of Commerce to go to Europe as a \\"Cowboy Goodwill Ambassador\\" to introduce and promote the sale of denim jeans. Later, he joined Montie Montana, Jr., to re-create Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. With a cast of 125 cowboys, cowgirls, and Indians and 135 bison, longhorns, and horses, the show toured worldwide from London to Brazil to Singapore. The group was particularly well received in Japan, where it performed four to five shows daily for four months. The last wild west show performance was near Glacier National Park in northern Montana. Back in Texas, Robbins produced the Rudy Robbins Western Show and the All American Cowboy Get-Together, a two-day event of music, poetry, cooking, arts, crafts and demonstrations. He was also active in the \\"Keep Bandera Western\\" campaign. Robbins formed The Spirit of Texas, a western harmony group, which in 1991 was named by the Texas State Senate as the \\"Official Cowboy Band for Texas\\". Modeled on the old Sons of the Pioneers, the band performed for such celebrities as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Rogers, Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, and Tom Selleck, as well as General H. Norman Schwarzkopf and Texas Governors Ann W. Richards and George W. Bush. Robbins and the Canadian yodeler Shirley Field co-authored How to Yodel the Cowboy Way.Robbins and Shirley Field, How to Yodel the Cowboy Way: https://www.amazon.com/How-Yodel-Cowboy-Rudy-Robbins/dp/1574240358 After the death of two members, the Spirit of Texas disbanded. Robbins also wrote short stories for Cowboy Magazine. He is featured in the Museum of the Gulf Coast, which is administered by the Port Arthur Historical Society. He lived in Bandera in the Texas Hill Country. Among his awards, Robbins was made honorary town marshal of Tombstone, Arizona, honorary deputy sheriff of Pima County (Tucson), Arizona, and \\"Outstanding Cowboy of the 20th Century\\" for Bandera County, Texas. He was commissioned an admiral in the Texas Navy by former Governor Bill Clements. He was awarded a plaque for excellence by the Texas Stuntmen's Association. Robbins died of cancer at the age of 77. His graver marker reads, \\"A Western Showman Who Loved The Lord\\". He was survived by a son, Jody, who was born in 1956. Much of Robbin's memorabilia is now in the Frontier Times Museum in Bandera and the Bandera Library. ==FilmographyActor=== {  - ! Year ! Title ! Role !

E. Bentley, The Jacobean and Caroline Stage, 7 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1941-68; Vol. 2, pp. 446-7. He started out as a boy player filling female roles; during the period of the English Civil War and the Interregnum (1642-1660) when the theatres were closed and actors out of work, Gough became involved in the publication of plays. Alexander Gough was born in 1614, the son of Robert Gough, an actor with the King's Men. Like some other sons of actors (Theophilus Bird; Robert Pallant), Gough started acting as a boy -- in his case, with his father's company. Alexander Gough played: * Caenis in Massinger's The Roman Actor, 1626 * Acanthe in Massinger's The Picture, 1629 * Eurinia in Wilson's The Swisser, 1631 * Lillia-Bianca in Fletcher's The Wild Goose Chase, the 1632 revival. Gough also had roles in Ford's The Lover's Melancholy (1628) and Clavell's The Soddered Citizen (1630). Gough remained with the company at least until 1636, and perhaps longer, probably playing minor adult roles. in 1642, at the start of the Civil War, the Puritan regime forced the closure of the London theatres. Theatrical activity did not cease entirely; rather, actors staged clandestine performances, often at the private houses of sympathetic citizens. In so doing, the actors faced a major and obvious problem: how to find audiences for \\"secret\\" performances (ideally, audiences that did not contain informers who would betray them to the authorities). During this period, Alexander Gough reportedly functioned as what was then called a \\"jackal\\" -- he helped to gather audiences for these clandestine performances.Edwin Nunzeger, A Dictionary of Actors and of Others Associated with the Representation of Plays in England Before 1642, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1929; pp. 156-7. Later in the Commonwealth era, Gough was active in publication, specifically of plays. He was not the only actor who shifted to publishing; Andrew Pennycuicke and William Cartwright did the same. Most notably, Gough wrote an introduction to Humphrey Moseley's 1652 first edition of The Widow; his preface \\"To the Reader\\" re-iterated the title-page attribution of that play to John Fletcher, Ben Jonson, and Thomas Middleton. Modern scholars and critics have strongly rejected the attribution to Fletcher and Jonson, and recognize The Widow as a solo work by Middleton.David J. Lake, The Canon of Thomas Middleton's Plays, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1975; pp. 38-43. Gough was also involved with the first editions of The Queen (1653), a play assigned to John Ford, and Lodowick Carlell's The Passionate Lovers (1655). ==References== Category:English male stage actors Category:17th-century English male actors Category:1614 births Category:Year of death unknown ","title":"Alexander Gough"},{"id":"19323013","text":"The Biljanini Izvori Sports Hall (, transliterated Sportska sala Biljanini Izvori) is a multi-functional indoor sports arena.

His mother, Charity, had told him that she would have preferred to have a daughter as her second child; his father, Leonard, also had a violent temper and held little affection for his two sons. Leonard died in 1947 when James and his brother Leonard Jr. were aged 12 and 14, respectively. Leonard Jr. became the father figure of the family and constantly picked on James during their upbringing, often taunting him for being a weakling.Killers: The Ruthless Exponents of Murder; the Most Evil Crime of All p. 255 At 16, James was so dissatisfied with his home life that he ran away and attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself with a sheet. He was unsuccessful and returned home. == Adulthood == As an adult, Ruppert stood 5'5\\" and weighed 135 pounds. He was described as a modest, bookish, and helpful man who was unremarkable and quiet. In addition, he had no police record. By 1975, Ruppert was envious of his older brother's successful job and family.The Encyclopedia of Mass Murder pp.244-245 Ruppert himself had dropped out of college after two years, then trained as a draftsman, although by 1975, he was unemployed, had never married, and was still living at home with his mother. In contrast, his older brother, Leonard Jr., had earned a degree in electrical engineering, had married James' ex-girlfriend, owned his own home in the city of Fairfield, and had eight children.Killers: The Ruthless Exponents of Murder; the Most Evil Crime of All p. 254 Charity was frustrated with James' inability to hold a steady job and his constant drinking; she had threatened to evict him from her home on more than one occasion. James also owed his mother and brother money, having lost much of what little cash he had in the stock market crash of 1973-4. == The final month == A month before the massacre, James inquired about silencers for his weapons while purchasing ammunition. His behavior in general became more unusual as he neared the breaking point, battling a deep depression. On March 29, 1975, his 41st birthday, witnesses had seen him engaging in target practice shooting tin cans with his .357 Magnum along the banks of the Great Miami River in Hamilton. The night before the murders, James went out as he did nearly every night. At the 19th Hole Cocktail Lounge he talked with employee Wanda Bishop, a 28-year-old mother of 5. She would later state that James told her he was frustrated with his mother's demands on him and his impending eviction and that he needed to solve the problem. According to Bishop, Ruppert stated that his mother had complained that if he could afford to buy beer seven nights a week, he could afford to pay rent. Ruppert left the bar at 11:00 p.m. that night and later returned. When Bishop asked him if he had solved the problem, he replied, \\"No, not yet.\\" James stayed at the bar until it closed at 2:30 a.m. == The murders == On Easter Sunday, March 30, 1975, Ruppert's brother Leonard and his wife, Alma, brought their eight children (ranging in age from 4 to 17) to see their grandmother at the house on Minor Avenue. Ruppert stayed upstairs, sleeping off a night of drinking, while the other family members performed an Easter egg hunt on the front lawn. At around 4:00 p.m, James woke up, loaded a .357 Magnum, two .22 caliber handguns, and a rifle, then went downstairs. Charity was preparing lunch in the kitchen, in the company of Leonard Jr. and Alma. Most of the children were playing in the living room. Entering the kitchen, he first shot and killed his brother Leonard, then his sister-in-law and his mother. Next, he took the life of his nephew David and his nieces Teresa and Carol, all in the confines of the kitchen. Ruppert then proceeded to the living room, where he killed his niece Ann and his four remaining nephews: Leonard III, Michael, Thomas, and John. One child had been shot once in the chest; the remaining 10 victims had been shot three times, to ensure they had died. The only sign of a struggle at the crime scene was one overturned wastepaper bin. The Butler County coroner theorized that Ruppert had likely shot some victims more than once to prevent anyone escaping. The massacre was over within five minutes. After spending three hours in the house, James finally called police to report the shooting. He waited just inside the front door for authorities to arrive. === Victims === {  style=\\"background-color: transparent; width: 100%\\"  width=\\"33%\\" align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"  *Charity Ruppert, 65, mother *Leonard Ruppert Jr., 42, brother *Alma Ruppert, 38, sister-in-law  width=\\"33%\\" align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"  *Leonard Ruppert III, 17, nephew *Michael Ruppert, 16, nephew *Thomas Ruppert, 15, nephew *Carol Ruppert, 13, niece  align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"  *Ann Ruppert, 12, niece *David Ruppert, 11, nephew *Teresa Ruppert, 9, niece *John Ruppert, 4, nephew } == Aftermath == The murders shocked the town of Hamilton and the entire country. Those who knew James Ruppert did not think he was capable of violence, especially at the magnitude of this particular massacre. By all accounts, neighbors considered the Rupperts a nice family. James was arrested and charged that day with 11 counts of aggravated homicide. He refused to answer questions asked by the police and was very uncooperative. He made it clear he would plead insanity. County prosecutor John Holcomb viewed the crime scene and stated that there was so much blood on the first floor, it was dripping through the floorboards into the basement, which to this day can still be seen on the wood. Ruppert had fired a total of 35 rounds, and all four weapons were recovered at the scene. All 11 victims were buried in Arlington Memorial Gardens in Cincinnati, Ohio. A year later, the house was opened to the public and all of its contents were auctioned off. It was then cleaned, recarpeted, and rented to a family new to the area, whose members were unaware of the murders that had taken place there. The new family later left the house, claiming they were hearing voices and other unexplained noises. Other families have moved in and out, and the house is still occupied. == Prosecution == The original trial was held in Hamilton, Ohio. The three-judge panel found Ruppert guilty on 11 counts of murder and sentenced him to life in prison. A mistrial was declared and it was decided that the retrial would be held in Findlay, Ohio, 125 miles north, because it was believed he could not receive a fair trial in the city of Hamilton. The second trial began in June 1975 and prosecutors revealed evidence involving the witnesses who had seen Ruppert engaging in target practice, asking about silencers for his gun collection and admitting that his mother's expectations were a problem that he needed to solve. In July 1975 Ruppert received 11 consecutive life sentences.Killer of 11 Is Given 11 Life Sentences, The New York Times (July 15, 1975) Retrieved March 25, 2015 On appeal, a new trial was granted in 1982. Defense attorney Hugh D. Holbrock, convinced his client was insane, personally funded the hiring of expert psychiatrists and psychologists from all over the country. On July 23, 1982, another three-judge panel found Ruppert guilty on two counts first degree murder (his mother and brother), but found him not guilty on the other nine counts of murder, by reason of insanity. He received one life sentence for each count, to be served consecutively. Because capital punishment had been suspended in the United States from 1972 to 1976 as a result of the Supreme Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia, and because the massacre on Minor Avenue had occurred in 1975, Ruppert could not receive the death penalty for his crimes. == Current status == , Ruppert remains incarcerated in the Franklin Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio,https://appgateway.drc.ohio.gov/OffenderSearch/Search/Details/A169321 a unit of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction.https://drc.ohio.gov/fmc In June 1995, at the age of 61, he was granted a hearing before the state Parole Board, but his release was denied.http://www.whio.com/news/news/parole-hearing-held-for-mass- murderer/nkk9G/?ecmp=whiotv_social_facebook_2014_sfp He received another hearing in April 2015, at which release was again denied.

He has also played for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. A defensive end, Walls played collegiate football for the University of Arkansas. Following college, he attended training camp with the Minnesota Vikings, but was cut before the regular season. In 2004, he was drafted in the fifth round of the NFL Europe draft by the Scottish Claymores.https://web.archive.org/web/20090630161836/http://www.bluebombers.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=117&Itemid;=129 In February 2005, Walls signed with the Blue Bombers and ended up having one of the most successful rookie seasons in team history. He led the team in quarterback sacks with 12, second best that season in the CFL, and was named CFL Rookie of the Year following the 2005 season. He was recognized as CFL Lineman of the Week four times during the season and was selected as a CFL West Division All-Star and a CFLPA All-Star for the season. During the season, he scored two touchdowns, unusual for a defensive lineman. Walls's second season saw a similar level of performance, registering eleven quarterback sacks and earning honours as a CFL East Division All-Star in 2006. In 2007, Walls played a substantial role in leading the Blue Bombers to the 95th Grey Cup, which they lost to the Saskatchewan Roughriders, 23-19. Walls was signed to a new contract by the Blue and Gold heading into the 2009 season. He is regarded as the best in the league at the strong-side defensive end position, and his new contract reflects that.

He worked as an assistant to the producer Mark Goodson and as a showcase and question writer for The Price Is Right, Concentration, The Better Sex, Match Game and Family Feud. He was once introduced by his father on an episode of Family Feud to promote his band The Midnight Eyes and had an appearance with Ronnie Mars on Dinah!. He served as a creative consultant of the latter show's second run, with his father as host from 1994 to 1995. Dawson was also an associate producer at Rastar Productions and at NBC for You Bet Your Life, a remake based on a Groucho Marx TV program from the 1950s that his father's production company produced in the 1980s. In 2001, he was hired by Paul Schrader as a technical advisor for the movie Auto Focus. In March 1979, Dawson married Cathy Hughart, an assistant producer on his father's Family Feud show. \\"I could not have chosen a classier spouse for my son or a more wonderful person than Cathy,\\" Richard Dawson said. The two later divorced.Cathy Hughart Dawson at the Internet Movie Database Dawson manages the all-female tribute band The Iron Maidens, the cover band Crabby Patty and the all-female heavy metal band Phantom Blue. Drummer Linda McDonald is a member of all three bands. In 2008, with Brad and Tom Zutaut, he developed a tribute bands television show for New Wave Entertainment. ===His mother‚Äôs alleged 'missing millions'=== Diana Dors allegedly claimed to have hidden away more than ¬£2 million in banks across Europe. In 1982, allegedly she gave Dawson a sheet of paper on which, she told him, was a code that would reveal the whereabouts of the money. His stepfather Alan Lake supposedly knew the key that would crack the code, but as he had committed suicide soon after her death, Dawson was left with an apparently unsolvable puzzle. He sought out computer forensic specialists Inforenz, who recognised the encryption as the Vigen√®re cipher. Inforenz then used their own cryptanalysis software to suggest a ten-letter decryption key, DMARYFLUCK (short for Diana Mary Fluck, Dors's real name). With the aid of a bank statement found among Alan Lake's papers, Inforenz was then able to decode the existing material to reveal a list of surnames and towns only ‚Äì suggesting that there must be a second page that would reveal first names and bank details, to complete the message. As this has never come to light, no money has ever been traced. In 2003, Channel 4 made a television programme about the mystery. ==Selected filmographyProduction=== *Concentration ‚Äì production assistant, editorial staff, rebus writer, assistant contestant coordinator (1976‚Äì1977) *Match Game ‚Äì editorial staff (1976) *Tattletales ‚Äì editorial staff (1976) *The Better Sex ‚Äì music coordinator (1977) *Family Feud ‚Äì editorial staff (1977‚Äì1985); creative consultant (1994‚Äì1995) *The Price Is Right ‚Äì showcase writer (1977) *Card Sharks ‚Äì music coordinator, production assistant (1978) *Nudity Required ‚Äì associate producer (1988) *You Bet Your Life ‚Äì associate producer (1988) *Auto Focus ‚Äì technical advisor (2002) *The Iron Maidens Live at Galaxy Theater ‚Äì director (2007) ===Acting/appearances=== *Family Feud ‚Äì Himself (select episodes) *Who Got Diana Dors' Millions ‚Äì Himself ==DiscographyThe Midnight Eyes=== *At the Roxy ‚Äì (1980) ===Phantom Blue=== *Caught...Live! ‚Äì producer (1997) *Full Blown ‚Äì producer (1998) ===The Iron Maidens=== *World's Only Female Tribute to Iron Maiden ‚Äì co-producer (2005) *Route 666 ‚Äì co- Producer (DVD) (2007) *The Root of All Evil ‚Äì co-Producer (2008) *Metal Gathering Tour 2010 ‚Äì Japan ‚Äì co-Producer (2010) ==References *DRZ Entertainment Group * *Mark Dawson Biography Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:British talent agents Category:Businesspeople from London Category:20th-century British businesspeople Category:21st-century British businesspeople ","title":"Mark Dawson"},{"id":"19323261","text":"Daniel Hansen Ludlow (March 17, 1924 ‚Äì February 14, 2009) was a professor of religion at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah.

Growing up, he was a Boy Scout and an Eagle Scout. In 1980, Hass graduated from the University of Oregon with a Bachelor of Science in journalism. In 1981, he earned his Master of Arts in communication from the American University School of Communication. Prior to serving in the legislature, Hass spent 20 years as a journalist, most recently at KATU television from 1984 to 2000. He won an Emmy Award in 1998 for writing.Official biography , from Senate web site == Oregon legislature == Hass was selected in fall 2007 by the County Commissions of Washington and Multnomah counties to serve the remainder of Senator Ryan Deckert's term, following Deckert's resignation. He was elected for a full term in 2008. Hass has subsequently been reelected twice, in 2012 and 2016. Hass is the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance and Revenue.Finance and Revenue Committee He is also a member of the Senate Education Committee Senate Education and Workforce Development Committee Senate Labor and Business Committee, and the Joint Interim Committee on Public Education Appropriation. He also serves as Senate Democratic Whip. Throughout his time in the Oregon Legislature, Hass has made reforming education in Oregon his chief priority. In 2011, Hass sponsored a bill (SB248) for full-day kindergarten, which replaced half-day kindergarten in Oregon public schools in the 2015-16 school year. Hass was also instrumental in restructuring the state's higher education system. In 2011, as a member of the Higher Education Workgroup, Hass led the legislative efforts to pass SB 242, which provided greater autonomy for Oregon's seven public universities. It also created the Higher Education Coordinating Commission. During that same 2011 session, Hass led the passagehttps://sos.oregon.gov/archives/Pages/records/legislative_minutes.aspx of SB 253, which put the 40-40-20 goals into state law. Those goals seek a workforce by 2025 that is made up of 40 percent people who hold a bachelor's degree or higher, 40 percent who hold a two-year degree and the remaining 20 percent people who hold the equivalent of a high school diploma. During the 2013 Legislative session, Hass sponsored Senate Bill 270 after chairing the Oregon Legislative Task Force on University Governance. Senate Bill 270 created institutional governing boards for the schools in the Oregon University System. That same year, Hass was the chief sponsor of a bill that established the Accelerated Learning Committee, an institution promoting access to dual credit programs in Oregon high schools.

Perhaps Hass' most significant reforms happened in the recently completed 2019 Legislative session. Long a critic of Oregon's inadequate K-12 education system, Hass spearheaded the passage of the Student Success Act. The bill makes new investments in Oregon's education system by prioritizing early childhood development, mental healthcare in schools, and increasing graduation rates. == Personal life == Outside of the legislature, Hass works as an account manager for Cappelli Miles, an advertising and brand identity firm with offices in Portland and Eugene.

Jan Stendal, January 14, 1913, Prague ‚Äì d. November 18, 1992, North Hollywood, California). Photographer. Ian Stendal was born to middle-class parents on the eve of World War I, in what was then the state of Bohemia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father, Konrad Stendal, was an executive at the Chemicke Zavody Sokolov chemical company, and his mother was Sara Marculis, whose family owned several successful dime stores in Prague and Pilsen. Stendal took an early interest in photography while working in his uncle‚Äôs camera shop in Prague. In the early 1930s, Stendal was a student at the University of Frankfurt in Germany, where he took classes with Paul Tillich and Theodor Adorno. Although he had planned to study art, Stendal left Frankfurt when the Nazis came to power. In 1934 took a sales position with the Swiss camera company Paillard Bolex. In 1939, Stendal was sent to the United States as a Paillard-Bolex representative at the New York World‚Äôs Fair. During his stay in the United States, the Germans invaded and occupied Czechoslovakia, and Stendal was cut off from his family and home. Through the intervention of Ezra Brockway, the U.S. importer of Paillard-Bolex, Stendal was able to remain in the United States. However, in 1940, Stendal went to Canada in order to enlist in the Canadian armed forces. He was accepted into the 1st Canadian Infantry and was sent to England in late 1940. In 1942, Stendal was wounded in the catastrophic Dieppe Raid. He was taken prisoner, but after two failed attempts he escaped from a prisoner of war camp. During the same period, his mother and her family were deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp and none survived the war. His father, who was not Jewish, died in 1944. It is believed that Konrad Stendal committed suicide by ingesting photographic processing chemicals at hand in his brother‚Äôs store. After the war, Ian Stendal became a naturalized Canadian. He returned to work for Paillard-Bolex and moved to Los Angeles, California. While acting as the Paillard-Bolex agent for the major film studios, Stendal also opened a small photographic studio on Fairfax Boulevard in Los Angeles. He left Paillard- Bolex in 1950 to become a technical advisor to the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios. In the late 1940s, Stendal renewed a friendship with Adorno, who was then living in L.A. and Stendal became involved in the √©migr√© intellectual community coalescing around Hollywood. Around this time, Stendal became fascinated by Los Angeles street life and turned his lens toward capturing the vast diversity of life he found in the city. Seldom ironic, Stendal sought very literal and personal renderings of his subjects, giving the audience a more emotional and direct experience of what they might otherwise consider prosaic. Much of his street photography is marked by a brightness and vitality unusual in that art form and he was one of the few street photographers to embrace Kodachrome film, eschewing the black and white standard to celebrate the vigor and energy of California life. Unlike his fellow √©migr√©s, many of whom returned to Europe after the war, Stendal remained in California until he died. In 1952, he married Olivia Newmark (b. Olga Navarova), an actress he had met while working on the set of Nancy Goes to Rio. In 1958, Stendal began teaching photography at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. In 1962, the International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House mounted Stendal's first solo museum show. Stendal was included in the 1967 \\"New Documents\\" exhibition, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City along with Lee Friedlander, Garry Winogrand and Diane Arbus. In 1989, the Museum of Modern Art displayed a major retrospective of Stendal‚Äôs works. His work was displayed again by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art as a retrospective in 1992, just before his death. Having grown up in the verdant city of Prague, Stendal was fascinated by the bizarre and thrilling images of people almost cavalierly adapting to a harsh life in the desert. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, he made yearly summer trips to Palm Springs, Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Tucson. A selection of photographs from these trips was published as Urban / Desert and was displayed at the Whatley Gallery in Los Angeles in 1998. A large collection of his work, unseen by the public, is currently in the hands of a private collector who has plans of releasing some of the photographs for publication.

Concepts of these relationships, including what defines an age disparity, have developed over time and vary among societies. Differences in age preferences for mates can stem from evolutionary mating strategies and age preferences in sexual partners may vary cross-culturally. There are also social theories for age differences in relationships as well as suggested reasons for 'alternative' age-hypogamous relationships. Age- disparity relationships have been documented for most of recorded history and have been regarded with a wide range of attitudes dependent on sociocultural norms and legal systems. ==Statistics== Data in Australia and United Kingdom show an almost identical pattern. Relationships with age disparity of all kinds have been observed with both men and women as the older or younger partner. In various cultures, older men and younger women often seek one another for sexual or marital relationships. Older women sometimes date younger men as well, and in both cases wealth and physical attractiveness are often relevant. Because most men are interested in women in their 20s, adolescent boys are generally sexually interested in women somewhat older than themselves. Older men also display an interest in women of their own age. Most men marry women younger than they are; with the difference being between two and three years in Spain, the UK reporting the difference to be on average about three years, and the US, two and a half. The pattern was also confirmed for the rest of the world, with the gap being largest in Africa. A study released in 2003 by the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics concluded that the proportion of women in England and Wales marrying younger men rose from 15% to 26% between 1963 and 1998. Another study also showed a higher divorce rate as the age difference rose for when either the woman was older or the man was older. A 2008 study, however, concluded that the difference is not significant.Ben Wilson and Steve Smallwood, \\"Age differences at marriage and divorce\\", Population Trends 132, Summer 2008, Office for National Statistics In August 2010, Michael Dunn of the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff completed and released the results of a study on age disparity in dating. Dunn concluded that \\"Not once across all ages and countries ... did females show a preference for males significantly younger than male preferences for females\\" and that there was a \\"consistent cross- cultural preference by women for at least same-age or significantly older men\\". A 2003 AARP study reported that 34% of women over 39 years old were dating younger men. A 2011 study suggested that age disparity in marriage is positively correlated with decreased longevity, particularly for women, though married individuals still have longer lifespans than singles. ==Reasons for age disparity== Explanations for age disparity usually focus on either the rational choice model or the analysis of demographic trends in a society. The rational choice model suggests that people look for partners who can provide for them in their life (bread-winners); as men traditionally earn more as they get older, women will therefore prefer older men. This factor is diminishing as more women enter the labor force. The demographic trends are concerned with the sex ratio in the society, the marriage squeeze, and migration patterns. Another explanation concerns cultural values: the higher the value placed in having children, the higher the age gap will be. As people have chosen to marry later, the age differences between couples have increased as well. In a Brown University study, it has been noted that the social structure of a country determines the age difference between spouses more than any other factor. One of the concerns of relationships with age disparities in some cultures is a perceived difference between people of different age ranges. These differences may be sexual, financial or social in nature. Gender roles may complicate this even further. Socially, a society with a difference in wealth distribution between older and younger people may affect the dynamics of the relationship. Although the \\"cougar\\" theme, in which older women date much younger men, is often portrayed in the media as a widespread and established facet of modern Western culture, at least one academic study has found the concept to be a \\"myth\\". A British psychological study published in Evolution and Human Behavior in 2010 concluded that men and women, in general, continued to follow traditional gender roles when searching for mates. The study found that, as supported by other academic studies, most men preferred younger, physically attractive women, while most women, of any age, preferred successful, established men their age or older. The study found very few instances of older women pursuing much younger men and vice versa.Alleyne, Richard, \\"The 'Cougar' concept: older women preying on younger men is a myth, claim scientists \\", The Telegraph, 19 August 2010 The study has been criticized, however, for limiting their results to online dating profiles, which are traditionally not used by those seeking older or younger partners, and for excluding the United States from the study. == Evolutionary perspective  Evolutionary approach === The evolutionary approach, based on the theories of Charles Darwin, attempts to explain age disparity in sexual relationships in terms of natural selection and sexual selection.Darwin, C. (1859). On the Origin of Species by Natural Selection Within sexual selection Darwin identified a further two mechanisms which are important factors in the evolution of sex differences (sexual dimorphism): intrasexual selection (involve competition with those of the same sex over access to mates) and intersexual choice (discriminative choice of mating partners). Life History theoryYampolsky, Lev Y(Jul 2003) Life History Theory. In: eLS. John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chichester. http://www.els.net (that includes Parental Investment Theory)Robert, T. (1972). Parental investment and sexual selection. Sexual Selection & the Descent of Man, Aldine de Gruyter, New York, 136‚Äì179. provides an explanation for the above mechanisms and strategies adopted by individuals, leading to age disparity in relationships. Life History theory posits that individuals have to divide energy and resources between activities (as energy and resources devoted to one task cannot be used for another task) and this is shaped by natural selection. Parental Investment Theory refers to the value that is placed on a potential mate based on reproductive potential and reproductive investment. The theory predicts that preferred mate choices have evolved to focus on reproductive potential and reproductive investment of members of the opposite sex. This theory predicts both intrasexual selection and intersexual choice due to differences in parental investment; typically there is competition among members of the lower investing sex (generally males) over the parental investment of the higher investing sex (generally females) who will be more selective in their mate choice. However, human males tend to have more parental investment compared to mammal males (although females still tend to have more parental investment). Thus, both sexes will have to compete and be selective in mate choices. These two theories explain why natural and sexual selection acts slightly differently on the two sexes so that they display different preferences. For example, different age preferences may be a result of sex differences in mate values assigned to the opposite sex at those ages. A study conducted by David Buss investigated sex differences in mate preferences in 37 cultures with 10,047 participants. In all 37 cultures it was found that males preferred females younger than themselves and females preferred males older than themselves. These age preferences were confirmed in marriage records with males marrying females younger than them and vice versa. A more recent study has supported these findings, conducted by Schwarz and Hassebrauck. This study used 21,245 participants between 18 and 65 years of age who were not involved in a close relationship. As well as asking participants a number of questions on mate selection criteria, they also had to provide the oldest and youngest partner they would accept. It was found that for all ages males were willing to accept females that are slightly older than they are (on average 4.5 years older), but they accept females considerably younger than their own age (on average 10 years younger). Females demonstrate a complementary pattern, being willing to accept considerably older males (on average 8 years older) and were also willing to accept males slightly younger than themselves (on average 5 years younger). This is somewhat different to our close evolutionary relatives: chimpanzees. Male chimpanzees tend to prefer older females than younger and it is suggested that specific cues of female mate value are very different to humans. === Male preference for younger females === Buss attributed the male preference for younger females to certain youthful cues. In females, relative youth and physical attractiveness (which males valued more compared to females) demonstrated cues for fertility and high reproductive capacity. Buss stated the specific age preference of around 25 years implied that fertility was a stronger ultimate cause of mate preference than reproductive value as data suggested that fertility peaks in females around mid-20s. From a life history theory perspective, females that display these cues are judged to be more capable of reproductive investment. This notion of age preference due to peak fertility is supported by Kenrick, Keefe, Gabrielidis, and Cornelius's study, which found that although teenage males would accept a mate slightly younger than themselves, there was a wider range of preference for ages above their own. Teenage males also report that their ideal mates would be several years older than themselves. Buss and Schmitt stress that although long-term mating relationships are common for humans, there are both short-term and long-term mating relationships. Buss and Schmitt provided a Sexual Strategies Theory that describes the two sexes as having evolved distinct psychological mechanisms that underlie the strategies for short- and long-term mating. This theory is directly relevant and compatible with those two already mentioned, Life History and Parental Investment. Males tend to appear oriented towards short-term mating (greater desire for short-term mates than women, prefer larger number of sexual partners, and take less time to consent to sexual intercourse) and this appears to solve a number of adaptive problems including using fewer resources to access a mate. Although there are a number of reproductive advantages to short-term mating, males still pursue long-term mates, and this is due to the possibility of monopolizing a female's lifetime reproductive resources. Consistent with findings, for both short-term and long-term mates, males prefer younger females (reproductively valuable). === Female preference for older males === { class=\\" sortable floatright\\" +Table 1. Regional singulate mean age of marriage (SMAM) difference between males and females - ! Region !! SMAM difference -  Eastern Africa  4.3 -  Middle Africa  6.0 -  Northern Africa  4.5 -  Western Africa  6.6 -  Eastern Asia  2.4 -  South-Central Asia  3.7 -  South-Eastern Asia  2.4 -  Western Asia  3.5 -  Eastern Europe  3.1 -  Northern Europe  2.3 -  Southern Europe  3.3 -  Western Europe  2.7 -  Caribbean  2.9 -  Central America  2.5 -  South America  2.9 -  Northern America  2.3 -  Australia/New Zealand  2.2 } As they are the higher-investing sex, females tend to be slightly more demanding when picking a mate (as predicted by parental investment theory). They also tend to have a more difficult task of evaluating a male's reproductive value accurately based on physical appearance, as age tends to have fewer constraints on a male's reproductive resources. Buss attributed the older age preference to older males displaying characteristics of high providing-capacity such as status and resources. In terms of short-term and long-term mating, females tend to be oriented towards long-term mating due to the costs incurred from short-term mating. Although some of these costs will be the same for males and females (risk of STIs and impairing long term mate value), the costs for women will be more severe due to paternity uncertainty (cues of multiple mates will be disfavoured by males). In contrast to above, in short-term mating, females will tend to favour males that demonstrate physical attractiveness, as this displays cues of 'good genes'. Cues of good genes tend to be typically associated with older males such as facial masculinity and cheek-bone prominence. Buss and Schmitt found similar female preferences for long-term mating which supports the notion that, for long-term relationships, females prefer cues of high resource capacity, one of which is age. == Cross-cultural differences == Cross-culturally, research has consistently supported the trend in which males prefer to mate with younger females, and females with older males. In a cross-cultural study that covered 37 countries, preferences for age differences were measured and research supported the theory that people prefer to marry close to the age when female fertility is at its highest (24‚Äì25 years). Analysing the results further, cross culturally, the average age females prefer to marry is 25.4 years old, and they prefer a mate 3.4 years older than themselves, therefore their preferred mate would be aged 28.8 years of age. Males however prefer to marry when they are 27.5 years old, and a female to be 2.7 years younger than themselves, yielding their preferred mate to be 24.8 years old. The results from the study therefore show that the mean preferred marriage age difference (3.04 years averaging male and female preferred age) corresponds very closely with the actual mean marriage age difference (2.99). The preferred age of females is 24.8 years and the actual average age females marry is 25.3 years old (and 28.2 for males) which actually falls directly on the age where females are most fertile, so the sexes have evolutionarily adapted mating preferences that maximise reproductivity. The United Nations Marriage Statistics Department measures the SMAM difference (Singulate Mean Age Marriage difference: the difference in average age at first marriage between men and women) across the main regions in the world (refer to Table. 1). === Larger than average age-gaps === { class=\\" sortable floatright\\" style=\\"width: 20%; height: 40px;\\" +Table 2. Countries with Largest Marital Age differences - ! Country ! SMAM difference ! Legal Status of Polygamy - Cameroon a 6.5 Polygamous - Chad 6.1 Polygamous - Rep. of Congo 8.6 Polygamous - Dem.

A theory that can explain this finding from an evolutionary perspective is the parasite-stress theory which explains that an increase of infectious disease can cause humans to evolve selectively according to these pressures. Evidence also shows that as disease risk gets higher, it puts a level of stress on mating selection and increases the use of polygamy. Table 2 shows that 17 of the 20 countries with the largest age-gaps between spouses practice polygyny, and that males range from 6.1 to 9.2 years older than their partners. In regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa the use of polygyny is commonly practiced as a consequence of high sex-ratios (more males born per 100 females) and passing on heterozygous (diverse) genetics from different females to offspring. When disease is prevalent, if a male is producing offspring with a more diverse range of alleles, offspring will be more likely to withstand mortality from disease and continue the family line. Another reason that polygynous communities have larger age-gaps between spouses is that intrasexual competition for females increases as fewer females remain on the marriage market (with males having more than one wife each), therefore the competitive advantage values younger females due to their higher reproductive value. As the competition for younger women becomes more common, the age in females' first marriage lower as older men seek younger and younger females. === Smaller than average age-gaps === Comparatively in Western societies such as the US and Europe, there is a trend of smaller age-gaps between spouses, reaching its peak average in Southern Europe of 3.3 years. Using the same pathogen-stress model, there is a lower prevalence of disease in these economically developed areas, and therefore a reduced stress on reproduction for survival. Additionally, it is common to see monogamous relationships widely in more modern societies as there are more women in the marriage market and polygamy is illegal throughout most of Europe and the United States. As access to education increases worldwide, the age of marriage increases with it, with more of the youth staying in education for longer. The mean age of marriage in Europe is well above 25, and averaging at 30 in Nordic countries, however this may also be due to the increase of cohabitation in European countries. In some countries in Europe such as France, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Norway, Estonia, Finland and Denmark, 20‚Äì30% of women aged 20‚Äì34 are cohabiting as opposed to legally marrying. In addition to this with the gender pay gap decreasing, more women work equal hours (average of 40 hours in Europe and the US) to males and looking less for males with financial resources. In regions such as the Caribbean and Latin America there is a lower SMAM difference than expected; however, there are also a large proportion of partners living in consensual unions; 24% in Brazil, 20% in Nicaragua and 18% in Dominican Republic. A 2011 study suggested that age disparity in marriage is positively correlated with decreased longevity, particularly for women, though married individuals still have longer lifespans than singles. == Social perspectives  Social structural origin theory === Social structural origin theory argues that the underlying cause of sex-differentiated behaviour is the concentration of men and women in differing roles in society. It has been argued that a reason gender roles are so prevalent in society is that the expectations of gender roles can become internalised in a person's self- concept and personality. In a Brown University study, it has been noted that the social structure of a country determines the age difference between spouses more than any other factor. In regards to mate selection, social structural theory supports the idea that individuals aim to maximise what they can provide in the relationship in an environment that is limiting their utilities through expected gender roles in society and marriage. It is thought that a trade-off or equilibrium is reached in regards to what each gender brings to the mating partnership and that this equilibrium is most likely to be reached with a trade-off of ages when selecting a mate. Women are said to trade youth and physical attractiveness for economic security in their male partner. This economic approach to choosing a partner ultimately depends on the marital or family system that is adopted by society. Women and men tend to seek a partner that will fit in with their society's sexual division of labour. For example, a marital system based on males being the provider and females the domestic worker, favours an age gap in the relationship. An older male is more likely to have more resources to provide to the family. === The rational choice model === The rational choice model also suggests that people look for partners who can provide for them in their life (bread-winners); as men traditionally earn more as they get older, women will therefore prefer older men. This factor is diminishing as more women enter the labour force and the gender pay gap decreases. == Age-hypogamy in relationships == Age-hypogamy defines a relationship where the woman is the older partner, the opposite of this being age-hypergamy. Marriage between partners of roughly similar age is known as \\"age homogamy\\". Older female‚Äìyounger male relationships are, relative to age-hypergamous relationships (older male‚Äìyounger female), less researched in scientific literature. Slang terms such as 'Cougar' have been used in films, TV shows and the media to depict older females with younger male mates. The picture often displays a stereotypical pairing of a divorced, middle-aged, white, affluent female dating a younger male with the relationship taking the form of a non-commitment arrangement between the partners. Although age- hypogamous relationships have historically been very infrequent, recent US census data has shown an increase in age-hypogamous relationships from 6.4% in 2000 to 7.7% in 2012. There may be many reasons why age-hypogamous relationships are not very frequent. Sexual double standards in society, in particular, may account for their rarity. Ageing in women is associated with decreased sex appeal and dating potential. There is debate in the literature as to what determines age-hypogamy in sexual relationships. A number of variables have been argued to influence the likelihood of women entering into an age-hypogamous relationship, such as racial or ethnic background, level of education, income, marital status, conservatism, age, and number of sexual partners. For example, US Census data show an exaggerated sex ratio in African American communities, whereby there were 100 African American woman for every 89 African American males. Support for this evidence was then found in regard to marriage, whereby it was shown that African American women were more likely to be in age-hypogamous or age-hypergamous marriages in comparison with White American women. However, more recent evidence has found that women belonging to racial categories besides African American or White were more likely to sleep with younger men, showing that it is still unclear which, if any, ethnic groups are more likely to have age-hypogamous relationships. French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte. The couple married in 2007; at the time he was 30 years old and she 54, demonstrating a 24-year age-hypogamous gap between the pair. alt= Another example illustrating the varying literature surrounding age-hypogamous relationships is research indicating that a woman's marital status can influence her likelihood of engaging in age-hypogamous relationships. It has been found that married women are less likely to be partnered with a younger male compared to non-married women in comparison to more recent findings, which provides evidence to suggest that previously married women are more likely to engage in an age-hypogamous sexual relationship compared to women who are married or who have never been married. Despite social views depicting age-hypogamous relationships as short lived and fickle, recent research published by Psychology of Women Quarterly has found that women in age-hypogamous relationships are more satisfied and the most committed in their relationships compared to younger women or similarly aged partners. It has also been suggested that male partners to an older female partner may engage in age-hypogamous relationships due to findings that men choose beauty over age. A recent study found that when shown pictures of women of ages ranging from 20‚Äì45 with different levels of attractiveness, regardless of age, males chose the more attractive individuals as long term partners. ==\\"Half-your-age-plus-seven\\" rule== Graph of the half-age-plus-seven rule That a person should never date someone under half their age plus seven is a rule of thumb sometimes used to determine whether an age difference is socially acceptable. Although the origin of the rule is unclear, it is sometimes considered to have French origin. In earlier sources, the rule had a different interpretation than in contemporary culture, as it was understood as a formula to calculate ideal age for the bride, instead of a lower limit for the woman's age in dating. Frederick Locker-Lampson's Patchwork from 1879 states the opinion \\"A wife should be half the age of her husband with seven years added.\\" Max O'Rell's Her Royal Highness Woman from 1901 gives the rule in the format \\"A man should marry a woman half his age, plus seven.\\" Similar interpretation is also present in the 1951 play The Moon Is Blue by F. Hugh Herbert.Moon Is blue.: [A play]: Herbert, Frederick Hugh at Internet Archive The half-your-age-plus seven rule also appears in John Fox, Jr.'s The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come in 1903, in American newspapers in 1931, attributed to Maurice Chevalier,\\"Maurice Chevalier says....plus seven years\\". Detroit News item reprinted in Oakland (CA) News, 27 August 1931. and in The Autobiography of Malcolm X attributed to Elijah Muhammad. A study in 2000 found that the rule was fairly accurate at predicting the minimum age of woman that a man would marry or date. The rule was not found to be predictive of the minimum age a woman would marry or date, nor of the maximum age either sex would marry or date. == Slang terms == The age disparity between two partners is typically met with some disdain in industrialized nations, and various derogatory terms for participants have arisen in the vernacular. In English- speaking countries, where financial disparity, and an implicit money-for- companionship exchange, is perceived as central to the relationship, the elder of the two partners (perceived as the richer) is often called a \\"sugar daddy\\" or \\"sugar mama\\" depending on gender. The younger of the two is similarly called the sugar baby. In extreme cases, a person who marries into an extremely wealthy family can be labelled a gold digger, especially in cases where the wealthy partner is of extreme age or poor health; this term often describes women but can be applied to any gender. An attractive younger woman pursued by a wealthy man who is perceived as wanting her only for her appearance may be called a trophy wife. The opposite term \\"trophy husband\\" does not have an agreed upon use, but is becoming more common in usage: some will use the term to refer to the attractive stay-at-home husband of a much more famous woman; whereas some will use it to refer to the husband of a trophy wife, as he is her trophy due to the wealth and prestige he brings her. In the latter case, the term trophy is broadened to include any substantial difference in power originating from physical appearance, wealth, or status. The trophy label is often perceived as objectifying the partner, with or without the partner's implicit consent. Where the primary perceived reason for a relationship with a significant age difference is sexual, many gender- specific terms have become popular in English-speaking cultures. A woman of middle to elderly age who pursues younger men is a cougar or puma, and a man in a relationship with an older woman is often called a boytoy, toyboy, himbo, or cub. In reverse, the terms rhino, trout and manther (a play on the panther term for women) are generally used to label an older man pursuing younger women, and the younger woman in such a relationship may be called a kitten or panther. If the woman is extremely young, the man may be labelled a cradle- snatcher (UK) or cradle robber (US) In gay slang, the term chickenhawk may be used. If the much-younger target of affections is not of the legal age of consent, the term jailbait may be applied to them, with connotations cautioning against involvement. An older term for any licentious or lascivious man is a lecher, and that term and its shortening of lech have become common to describe an elderly man who makes passes at much younger women. == See also == * Ephebophilia * Gerontophilia * Homogamy (sociology) * Hypergamy * Life history theory * List of oldest fathers * Mate choice * Parental investment * Polygamy * Age and pregnancy * Sexual selection in humans == References  Further reading == * * Buss, D.

Although small when compared to urban secondary schools, Lord Dorchester is larger than many rural-area schools. The student population hovers in the range of 500 students. Lord Dorchester is a strong academic school (based on provincial test scores), but also offers a range of non-academic courses such as shop classes to go along with core subjects in mathematics, sciences, and the arts. Lord Dorchester lacks sports teams which can draw students away from the school. The mascot of Lord Dorchester is the Canadian beaver. == The school == Lord Dorchester Secondary School was constructed in 1961 and is named for Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester.‚Äì About Us ‚Äì Thames Valley District School Board The current school grounds include a two-story school building with an attached cafeteria and a gymnasium, two auxiliary storage buildings, and a very large open field that accommodates school sports as well as community recreation. Throughout the years, the school has undergone a series of renovations and upgrades. In the early 1990s, a state-of-the-art music room was built as an addition to the school. Over the summer of 2007 asbestos was removed and windows and exterior doors were upgraded. In the Spring of 2015 the library/learning commons was upgraded for a more student- friendly research environment. Most classrooms in the school have newer desks, computers (laptops, tablets and Chromebooks) data projectors and Smart Boards. Only one wing of the school is air conditioned. The school is surrounded by residential areas centrally located in the town of Dorchester, where a large percentage of the staff and students reside. Other students are bused in from surrounding communities such as Putnam, and Thorndale. == Academics == LDSS is regarded as a strong community based school that repeatedly scores above average in London area, provincial and national tests in math and literacy. Despite declining enrollment, the school offers a full academic program at par with most larger schools. There are a full range of academic and applied courses at all grade levels. The school has locally developed courses and extensive access to on-line/e-learning. LDSS also has a High Skills Majors program in Physical Education. Lord Dorchester also offers extensive and diverse co-op programs for students. Some students do medical research in labs at local London hospitals, while others work at local businesses developing skills for successful employment. Each year, a few students take Advanced Placement Exams, which offer them a chance to earn university credits in high school. Other students take advantage of attending community college (e.g. Fanshawe College and Lambton College) one day per week, in a program where they can earn college credits. Students keen on taking open programs, particularly in the arts, can transfer to other schools such as H.B. Beal Secondary School. == Manufacturing and computer technology == The back of the school is home to an expansive technology wing with several large classrooms dedicated manufacturing and computer technology. On the main floor of the technology wing there are classrooms for automotive and engine repair, tool and die manufacturing, electronics, robotics and woodworking and cabinetry. On the upper floor there are computer labs which offer classes in accounting and business, programming and design, and keyboarding. == Sports and athletics == Lord Dorchester has a large number of extracurricular sports and athletic programs.

He participated at the 2010 IIHF World Championship as a member of the Belarusian national team. == Playing career == Denisov with the Belarusian national team in 2017 Denisov played in the Russian Hockey Super League for HC Lada Togliatti in the 2006-07 season. With ambitions to play in the NHL, Vladimir signed with affiliate of the Colorado Avalanche, the Lake Erie Monsters, in the AHL for the 2007‚Äì08 season. While using the season with the Monsters to adjust to the North American game, Denisov impressed with his physicality and signed his first NHL contract with the New York Rangers for the 2008‚Äì09 season on 10 July 2008. Denisov was assigned to AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack, to start the season. Vladimir eclipsed previous highs for goals and assists, however frustrated from lack of opportunity with the Rangers he requested a trade in January but played the season out. On 5 September 2009, Vladimir was invited to the Washington Capitals training camp for the 2009‚Äì10 season. Failing to earn a contract with the Capitals, and rejecting the option to try out with the Capitals affiliate, the Hershey Bears, Denisov returned to Belarus where he signed for HC Dinamo Minsk of the KHL on 29 September 2009. Denisov appeared on the Blueline in 42 games with Minsk and posted 14 points but as the team was unable to advance to the playoffs, he was not tendered a new contract. On 29 September 2010, Denisov moved to the Swiss National League A, signing to a one-year contract with HC Ambr√¨-Piotta. Denisov returned to Dinamo Minsk as a main-stay on the blueline for the following two seasons before signing a contract with KHL rival Salavat Yulaev Ufa for two-years on 22 May 2013. Before the season commenced, Denisov was traded by Ufa without having played a game to Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod on 9 September 2013. ==Career statisticsRegular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:55em\\" - e0e0e0;\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" fff;\\" ! rowspan=\\"99\\" fff;\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" fff;\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - e0e0e0;\\" !

Previously Al Otaiba served as non- resident ambassador to Mexico. His father is Petroleum magnate Mana Al Otaiba, who served as the president of OPEC a record six times. == Early life == Otaiba was born on January 19, 1974 in Abu Dhabi into a wealthy merchant family. His father was the UAE's first Minister of Petroleum, Mana Saeed Al Otaiba, one of the country's key non-royal founding members as well as a close confidant to the late UAE founder and President Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (1918‚Äì2004). His father had at least 12 children with 4 wives, including Otaiba's Egyptian mother. Otaiba was raised in Cairo by his mother, from whom he is the only child. He went to Cairo American College, a pre-K‚Äì12 international American school, and, while there, introduced himself to Frank G. Wisner, then the US ambassador to Egypt.THE UAE'S YOUNG NEW AMBASSADOR -- MBZ'S RIGHT HAND MAN GETS READY TO TAKE ON WASHINGTON 2008 March 2, Wikileaks After completing high school in 1991, Yousef studied international relations at Georgetown University. It was Wisner, one of Otaiba's mentors, who encouraged the young Al Otaiba to go to Washington, D.C. The UAE embassy claims that Otaiba obtained a degree in international relations from Georgetown University. However, in 2017, The Intercept reported Georgetown University's office of the registrar claims he never graduated.Ryan Grim: Diplomatic Underground: The Sordid Double Life of Washington's Most Powerful Ambassador, The Intercept, 30 August 2017 Otaiba subsequently spent the next three years working for the automotive division of his family's firm, the Al Otaiba Group. His father's firm lost the prestigious General Motors/Cadillac agency in Abu Dhabi after a bitter 11-year dispute over non-performance. Otaiba was then selected to attend the International Fellow at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF) at the National Defense University in Washington, in preparation for an assignment to join the immediate staff of then UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a position he assumed upon graduating from ICAF in 2000. The former CENTCOM Commander, General Anthony Zinni was another of Otaiba's mentors. Otaiba and his wife, Abeer, founder of a luxury fashion company, have one son, Omar, and one daughter, Samia. == Government career == Otaiba in 2013 At age 26, Otaiba became senior adviser to Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and, until his new posting, as director of international affairs for the court of the crown prince, he also served as the country's principal security, anti-terrorism and defence liaison with other governments. Bin Zayed was deputy supreme commander of the UAE Armed Forces, so in effect Otaiba worked for the UAE's defense minister for eight years. In 2006 and 2007 Otaiba's role was described by Kristofer Harrison, a Defense and State Department advisor during the George W. Bush administration who worked closely with Otaiba, as \\"crucial helping to talk other countries in the region into backing President George W. Bush's troop surge in the Iraq War\\". A role that was confirmed by Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr. Otaiba's most significant contribution was \\"persuading other Gulfies to support the political components of the surge (e.g. the Anbar Awakening), and helping 'translate' the general strategy into something they would support\\".Ryan Grim, Akbar Shahid Ahmed: His Town, 2015 June 22, 2008 Otaiba was elevated to UAE ambassador to the United States. He succeeded Saqr Ghobash, who had served as ambassador since March 2006. Upon his arriving in the capital, Otaiba hired Amy Little-Thomas, a former State Department staffer in the Bush administration, who became the UAE embassy's chief of protocol and he created the nonprofit ‚Ä≥Oasis Foundation‚Ä≥, his private foundation in connection with his work as ambassador \\"to advance positive relations between the UAE, a significant American ally (particularly in the Middle East), and the United States.‚Äù Court documents later disclosed deposits of millions of dollars to Oasis accounts, which were by turns frozen or shut down for suspicious activity. Otaiba worked closely with Howard Berman, then the Democratic chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on an agreement that would allow the UAE to obtain nuclear materials from the US for a civilian program. In July 2010, remarks made by Otaiba, were interpreted as supporting a United States military strike on nuclear reactors in Iran. Otaiba's remarks are reported to be the standard position of many Arab states. From 2015 onwards Otaiba was a leading voice in Washington for the War in Yemen, where the UAE operated torture warehouses and funded death squads. The conflict has left more than 10,000 dead, millions starving (Famine in Yemen) and a cholera epidemic of historic proportions. The UAE was the first nation to obtain the US military's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system - the first batch of UAE officers and airmen graduated from training on the system in December 2015. In the run-up to President Trump's Riyadh Summit with Islamic leaders on 20‚Äì21 May 2017 strong bonds reportedly formed between Otaiba and President Trump's advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and minister of defense Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia. Otaiba and Kushner first met June 2017 at the behest of Thomas Barrack, a billionaire investor and Trump backer. Otaiba is generally seen as being a successful ambassador for the UAE, as the country asserts itself more aggressively in the sphere of foreign policy. In November 2017 it was announced that he had been promoted to the rank of Minister, while remaining the ambassador to the United States. In August 2020, Otaiba issued a statement extolling the Israel‚ÄìUnited Arab Emirates peace agreement as \\"a win for diplomacy and for the region\\", adding how it \\"lowers tensions and creates new energy for positive change\\". == Philanthropy == Ambassador Al Otaiba is closely associated with philanthropic causes in the United States and around the world, including Children's National Hospital in Washington D.C, Tornado Relief in Joplin Missouri, the Hurricane Sandy New Jersey Relief Fund, The Community Soccer Program, and global polio eradication efforts. Former President Bill Clinton recognized the Ambassador for his philanthropic involvement at the 2017 Interaction Forum. In 2014, Al Otaiba and his wife, Abeer, co-chaired the Children's Ball, which raised a record $10.9 million for Children's National, making it the most successful nonprofit fundraiser in Washington's history. Both the ambassador and his wife have served as partners and advocates for children in the Washington area and around the world. In 2015, the Ambassador and Mrs. Al Otaiba were the recipients of the second annual Joseph E. Robert, Jr. Prize in Philanthropy created to honor families who have given back to the hospital, after having a personal experience with the institution. The prize is named for philanthropist and business leader Joseph E. Robert, Jr. ==Hacked emails== In early June 2017, a hacker group calling itself ‚ÄúGlobalLeaks‚Äù began distributing hacked emails taken from the inbox of Al Otaiba. According to The Intercept, the leaked emails revealed how Al Otaiba prior to being an ambassador lived a double life as a party-goer with his friends in Washington D.C., New York, Los Angeles, and Abu Dhabi. According to The Intercept, one of Al Otaibas friends, Roman Paschal, expressed that he allegedly observed the exploitation of trafficked girls in Abu Dhabi. The hackers reached out to The Daily Beast in email to offer a sample of the messages which The Daily Beast described that the content \\"fall short of the explosive revelations hinted at in the cover letter\\". Among other websites, the hackers provided Huffington Post with another batch of leaked emails from Otaiba, ranging between 2014 and 2017, showing that the UAE supported moving the US Al Udeid Air Base out of Qatar. The New York Times further reported how the US had allegedly supported Abu Dhabi in hosting a Taliban embassy, which can be referenced to separate leaked email dated January 28, 2012. The hacked email allegedly contains a message written by Otaiba to another American official about an angry call from his foreign minister Abdullah bin Zayed who was unhappy they were not able to host the Taliban embassy. Al Otaiba stated that the UAE was encouraged by the US to host a Taliban embassy and the UAE offer to the Taliban was only if the Taliban denounced al-Qaeda and its founder, Osama Bin Laden, recognized the Afghan Constitution, and renounced violence and lay down their weapons. The Taliban refused these conditions and the UAE rescinded their offer to host the Taliban Embassy in Abu Dhabi. According to The New York Times, the hacked emails appeared to benefit Qatar while trying to embarrass the United Arab Emirates and are believed to be the work of hackers working for Qatar. Part of the emails leaked included ex-Al Jazeera journalist and Otaiba's high school friend Mohamed Fahmy asking Al Otaiba for a loan with a sum of $250,000 to allegedly cover his legal fees in his $100 million lawsuit against the Qatari news organization and in a later email confirming that the money was received. Fahmy has acknowledged that he received a loan from Al Otaiba that he has sent to a \\"third party\\", denying taking the money himself stating, ‚ÄúI have not received a penny from Yousef‚Äù. The hacked Emails revealed how Otaiba bought UAE influence in Washington. In 2015, the UAE paid the US lobbying firms $13.5 million, with $6,5 million going to the Camstoll Group, that was operated by former US Treasury officials who had been responsible for relations with Gulf state and Israel as well as countering funding of terrorism, and $4.5 million to Harbor Group.Ambassador from United Arab Emirates to the U.S.: Who Is Yousef Al Otaiba? Jul 18, 2017 Leaked documents to The Wall Street Journal implicate Otaiba in the multibillion-dollar corruption scandal surrounding the Malaysian state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB1) (1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal). The WSJ reported that Otaiba's leaked emails included descriptions of meetings between Shaher M. Awartani, Otaiba's an Abu Dhabi-based business partner, and \\"Jho Low, the Malaysian financier the [US] justice department says was the central conspirator in the alleged $4.5 billion 1MDB fraud.\\" Companies connected to Otaiba received $66 million (¬£50.6m, ‚Ç¨57.7m) from offshore accounts that contained money allegedly embezzled from 1MDB. They include ‚Ä≥Densmore Investments Ltd.‚Ä≥ in the tax haven British Virgin Islands and ‚Ä≥Silver Coast Construction & Boring‚Ä≥ in the UAE. One of the documents obtained by The Intercept was an invoice from the Center for a New American Security, an influential national security think tank founded in 2007 by alumni from the Clinton administration. The invoice, dated July 12, 2016, billed the UAE embassy $250,000 for a paper on the legal regime governing the export of military-grade drones. In the leaked emails, Al Otaiba responded to a 2008 email about Saudi religious police's 2008 decision to ban red roses on Valentine's Day and called it \\"f***in' coo coo!\\". In other emails, he described how the Emiratis have had a more bad history with Saudi's than anyone else and has warred against them for 200 years over Wahhabism. In the emails, he praises Mohammed bin Salman as a reformer, describing him as \\"on a mission to make the Saudi government more efficient\\". In November 2017, leaked emails showed that Otaiba allegedly hired Banque Havilland to draw up a plan on how to start a financial war against Qatar. Since 5 June 2017, several countries abruptly cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar for their alleged support for terrorism. == See also == * Embassy of the United Arab Emirates, Washington, D.C. * United Arab Emirates‚ÄìUnited States relations ==References *Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba official biography *Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba official picture *U.A.E.

A favourite soloist of Sir Malcolm Sargent's, she also participated in a number of recordings of Gilbert and Sullivan operas. ==Biography== Thomas was born in Sunderland, England. Her father was a Welsh tenor, and her mother, an amateur pianist, was Scottish. When Thomas was two years old, her family moved to Oldham, Lancashire. She was educated at the Hulme Grammar School for Girls, then the Manchester High School for Girls from 1934 to 1939\\"School Reports, 1874‚Äì1952\\", Manchester High School for Girls, 1939 and became a member of the choir at St Paul's Church in Oldham.Leeming, Robert. \\"Renowned singer Marjorie dies, 85\\", Oldham Evening Chronicle Online, 9 September 2008 She studied piano with her mother beginning at age 5, and later with William Walton's brother Noel.\\"Marjorie Thomas: mezzo-soprano\\", The Times, 3 October 2008 In 1940, at the age of 17, Thomas won a scholarship to the Royal Manchester College of Music to study piano.\\"Marjorie Thomas\\", The Daily Telegraph obituary, 26 September 2008 There, in her second term, she began to study singing with Elsie Thurston, which became her principal study, graduating in 1944.

The same year, she sang the role of Konchakovna in Thomas Beecham's radio production of Alexander Borodin's Prince Igor. Beecham asked her for \\"more emotion\\" when he heard her audition but then added: \\"But how could you have experienced emotion ‚Äì 22 and living in Manchester?\\" Nevertheless, he invited her back to perform at his 1946 Delius festival and for his second recording of George Frideric Handel's Messiah in 1947. Thereafter, she was often heard in Messiah. While rehearsing for Prince Igor, she met Edwin \\"Teddy\\" Gower, the sound engineer for the broadcast. The couple married in 1947. Thomas took a year off from her career after the birth of her daughter, Eileen, in 1948. Her career then accelerated, both in opera and on the concert stage. In 1950, Thomas first sang the role of the Dryade in Ariadne auf Naxos at Glyndebourne and the Edinburgh Festival. She also sang Nancy in Albert Herring with Benjamin Britten's English Opera Group at the Cheltenham Festival in 1951. In 1953, she sang the roles of the Rhinemaiden Flosshilde in Das Rheingold and G√∂tterd√§mmerung and the Valkyrie Rossweisse in Die Walk√ºre in Rudolf Kempe's Covent Garden production of Wagner's ring cycle (also recording these roles) and Magdalena in Rafael Kubel√≠k's Covent Garden production of Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg. With Kubel√≠k, she also recorded Gustav Mahler's Third Symphony. In 1960, she created the role of Hermia in Benjamin Britten's opera, A Midsummer Night's Dream, which she performed at its premiere at Aldeburgh, then at the Holland festival and Covent Garden. William Walton wrote his Gloria for her in 1961. She also recorded a well-received complete Johannes Brahms Liebeslieder Waltzes, Op. 52 & 65, with Elsie Morison, Richard Lewis and Donald Bell, accompanied by Vitya Vronsky and Victor Babin. She also was known for performances and recordings of Johann Sebastian Bach's Christmas Oratorio, Mass in B Minor and Cantata No 6. Thomas performed with Malcolm Sargent for the first time in 1951, with his Royal Choral Society and the Huddersfield Choral Society. She became one of his favourite soloists, often singing his orchestration of Brahms's Four Serious Songs. She continued to sing with both of these choirs in all of the oratorios conducted by Sargent until his death in 1967. She was, perhaps, most admired for her performances as Angel in Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius, which she recorded in 1954 with Sargent, the Huddersfield Choral Society and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. The Daily Telegraph wrote of this recording: \\"The luminous beauty of her tone, her perfect diction and the warmth and dignity with which she invested the music are a lesson for young singers.\\"Quinn, John. \\"Sir Edward ELGAR (1857‚Äì1934), The Dream of Gerontius, Op. 38\\" MusicWeb (2007) With Sargent, she also recorded Felix Mendelssohn's Elijah Messiah, Vaughan Williams's Serenade to Music, Walton's Gloria and a series of Gilbert and Sullivan mezzo-soprano roles: Pitti-Sing in The Mikado (1957); Tessa in The Gondoliers (1957); Phoebe in The Yeomen of the Guard (1958); Cousin Hebe in H.M.S.

She retired from concert singing in 1973. ===Teaching and later years=== Thomas became a professor of singing at the Royal Manchester College of Music in 1960 and in 1964 accepted a post at London's Royal Academy of Music. She became the head of vocal studies there in 1984, where she taught until 1990. Her students included Susan Bullock. After her retirement from the Academy of Music, she adjudicated at festivals and singing competitions. Thomas died at the age of 85 after a long illness. ==NotesReferences== *Oron, Aryeh.

The play has been considered a defining work in the subgenre of heroic drama, in which \\"rhymed heroic tragedy comes into full being.\\"George Henry Nettleton, English Drama of the Restoration and the Eighteenth Century, 1642‚Äì1780, New York, Macmillan, 1914; p. 55 As its subtitle indicates, the play deals with the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire under Hern√°n Cort√©s. ==Performance== The premiere production was staged by the King's Company at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; it featured Michael Mohun as the Emperor, Charles Hart as Cortez, Edward Kynaston as Guyomar, Nicholas Burt as Vasquez, William Wintershall as Odmar, William Cartwright as the Priest, and Anne Marshall as Almeria. The original production employed a \\"gorgeously feathered cloak\\" that Aphra Behn had brought back from Surinam,John Gillies, Shakespeare and the Geography of Distance, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1994; p. 28. along with \\"glorious wreaths for...heads, necks, arms, legs.\\"Aphra Behn, The Plays, Histories, and Novels of Mrs. Aphra Behn, 6 Volumes, Eighth Edition, London, 1735; Vol. 5, p. 77. Dryden spiced his play with crowd-pleasing features, including incantations and conjured spirits, and an elaborate grotto scene with \\"a Fountain spouting.\\" On opening night, Dryden had a program distributed to the audience, on the connection between this play and his earlier The Indian Queen (a collaboration with his brother-in-law Sir Robert Howard). When the Duke of Buckingham and his collaborators satirised Dryden in The Rehearsal (1671), they had their Dryden-substitute Bayes say \\"that he had printed many reams to instill into the audience some conception of his plot.\\"George Saintsbury and Sir Walter Scott, eds., The Works of John Dryden, Vol. 2, Edinburgh, William Paterson, 1882; p. 321. The play was a major popular success, and was revived in 1667, with Nell Gwyn as Cydaria and Mary Knep in the role of Alibech. Samuel Pepys saw a performance; though he was an admirer of Gwyn, he condemned her performance in the role of the Emperour's daughter, calling it \\"a great and serious part, which she do most basely.\\"Pepys' Diary entry for 22 August 1667. The play was also given an amateur performance at Court in 1668, which included James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth and his Duchess in the cast. Pepys criticised the elite cast as mostly \\"fools and stocks\\"Pepys' Diary entry for 14 January 1668.‚Äîthough he did not actually see the production in question. ==Publication== The play was first published in 1667 by Henry Herringman. Dryden dedicated the play to Ann Scott, Duchess of Monmouth and Buccleuch, whom he called his \\"first and best patroness.\\"Harry Graham, A Group of Scottish Women, London, Methuen & Co., 1908; pp. 120‚Äì1. Subsequent editions followed in 1668, 1670, 1681, 1686, 1692, 1694, and 1696, all from Herringman; the 1692 edition coincided with another stage revival. ==Sources== Dryden's sources for his play, both historical and literary, have been disputed and debated. Two sources of major significance were Sir William Davenant's The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru (1658), and the Spanish accounts of the conquest in Purchas his Pilgrimes (1625 edition).Dougald MacMillan, \\"The Sources of Dryden's The Indian Emperour,\\" Huntington Library Quarterly, Vol. 13 No. 4 (August 1950), pp. 355‚Äì70. Dryden also took plot elements from a play by Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca, El pr√≠ncipe constante (c. 1628‚Äì29), which Dryden read in the original Spanish.N. D. Shergold and Peter Ure, \\"Dryden and Calder√≥n: A New Spanish Source for The Indian Emperour,\\" Modern Language Review, Vol. 62 No. 3 (July 1966), pp. 369‚Äì83. One aspect of Dryden's plot, Guyomar and Odmar's competition for Alibech, comes from Georges de Scud√©ry's poem Alaric (1654).Derek Hughes, \\"Dryden's The Indian Emperour and Georges de Scud√©ry's Alaric,\\" Review of English Studies, Vol. 33 No. 129 (February 1982), pp. 47‚Äì51. In turn, Voltaire borrowed from Dryden's play for his drama Alzire.Merle L. Perkins, \\"Dryden's The Indian Emperour and Voltaire's Alzire,\\" Comparative Literature, Vol. 9 No. 3 (Summer 1957), pp. 229‚Äì37. ==Plot== In his play, Dryden presents the type of conflict between love and honour that is typical of his serious drama. Montezuma refuses a chance to save his kingdom from conquest, for personal reasons: > But of my crown thou too much care dost take; > That which I value more, my love's at stake. Cortez takes the opposite course, turning his back on his love for Cydaria to obey the orders of his king, even though he acknowledges that those orders are flawed. Montezuma gets the worst of their conflict; tortured by the Spaniards, he ends the play with his suicide. Dryden wanted to portray Cortez as high- minded and magnanimous; but he also wanted to show the Spaniards as cruel and oppressive. He managed this by the wildly ahistorical recourse of bringing Francisco Pizarro into the play as a subordinate of Cortez, and making Pizarro the villain. Modern critics have studied the play from feminist and anti- colonialist viewpoints.Heidi Hutner, Colonial Women: Race and Culture in Stuart Drama, New York, Oxford University Press, 2001; pp. 65‚Äì88.Ayanna Thompson, Performing Race and Torture on the Early Modern Stage, London, Routledge, 2008. ==Dramatis personae and relationship status== :MONTEZUMA, Emperor of Mexico and consort of Almeria :ODMAR, Montezuma‚Äôs eldest son in contention for the love of Alibech :GUYOMAR, Montezuma‚Äôs younger son in contention for the love of Alibech :ORBELLAN, son of the late Indian Queen by Traxalla, betrothed to Cydaria :TRAXALLA, High Priest of the Sun. :CYDARIA, Montezuma‚Äôs daughter, Courted by Cortez, betrothed to Orbellan :ALMERIA, sister to Alibech, daughter of the late Indian Queen, consort of Montezuma :ALIBECH, sister to Almeria, daughter of the late Indian Queen, :CORTEZ, the Spanish General, In love with Cydaria :VASQUEZ, Commander under Cortez, unknowingly in love with Alibech :PIZARRO, Commander under Cortez, In love with gold Act 1, Scene 1. A pleasant Indian country The arrival of the Spaniards reveals their intentions with the new land. They discuss the dwindling resources of Spain and the richness of the land they intend to conquer and exploit. The Taxallan Indians, a rival of the Aztecs under Spanish command, have informed the officers of Montezuma's presence. Cortez commands his guide to bring him to Mexico to first offer peace and, that notwithstanding, to make war. Act 1, Scene 2. A Temple Starting with the High Priest finishing a blood ritual honouring Montezuma's birthday, the royal party arrives to the Temple. The High Priest asks Montezuma, in accordance with the ritual, to pick out his future queen. Montezuma surrenders his love to Almeria, who as the daughter of his late rival scorns Mont.‚Äôs love but seeks to control him and his power through the relationship. Odmar tries to sway Mont. from his choice but is unsuccessful as Almeria pledges her love to Mont. who is enamored with her. Guyomar enters and describes the Spaniards arrival in terms he understands interpreted by the HP as in accordance with a prophecy about ‚Äúfloating castles‚Äù. Mont. sends the HP to see what their arrival portends as he finishes up the ritual by having his sons pick brides. They both pledge their love to Alibech who in turn refuses both. The two sons argue over her before Mont. silences them and asks Orbellan to also pick a bride. He chooses Cydaria, who despite her hatred for Orbellan recognises her duty to her father to marry him and join the Indian nations. Her acceptance is interrupted by the arrival of the Spanish officers. Mont. thinks them gods at first but soon realises they are emissaries of ‚Äúsome petty prince‚Äù King Charles V. The Commanders issue the terms of Mont's surrender (gold, submission, and conversion) while Cydaria catches Cortez's eye. Mont refuses the Terms of Peace and leaves with the royal party but not before Cortez ask that Cydaria be able to stay a moment that they may talk. Cortez falls for her and she begins to fall for him when Orbellan reenters and fetches Cydaria back to Mexico, which now prepares for war. Act 2, Scene 1. The Magician's Cave Montezuma and the high priest call upon spirits to guide them in their choices. The spirits inform him of the destiny of his people and their ruin, him to give up his scepter but he refuses their prophecy (‚ÄúDoom as thy please my Empire not to stand, I‚Äôll grasp my scepter with my dying hand‚Äù) He insists a better prophecy must exist and asks the high priest to summon again. A spirit dressed in all white appears and sings of Montezuma's success. As they finish with the spirits, the spirit of the Indian Queen appears to curse her former husband. Montezuma resolves to fight the Spaniards. Act 2, Scene 2. Between two Armies Cydaria and Alibech standing waiting for Cortez to arrive. Once he does, Cydaria implores Cortez to peace. She criticises the choices he's given as showing the outcome to be a foregone conclusion. (‚ÄúYou threaten Peace, and yet invite a War‚Äù) She calls him a blind follower and declares his love of country was stronger than his love to her. As a particularly honour bound character, Cortez pledges to hold off his attack until the next day but is informed by Pizarro that the war has already started. The officers withdraw to war as Odmar and Guyomar enter to make Alibech decide her love for either before the battle begins. Alibech tells them that she loves one but not the other, not revealing which is which, but will marry whoever wins the war for their country. They all leave as the scene changes to the countryside battlefield where Mont. charges the field. Cortez condemns his Indian allies for cowardice. Cortez and his officers lead a cavalry charge of their own against the rear of Montezuma's forces. Odmar and Guyomar enter and are bragging of their kills when Montezuma enters with Alibecch declaring that the day is lost due to the Spanish soldiers guns, ‚ÄúOur foes with Lightning and Thunder fight.‚Äù The Commanders enter triumphant and make to seize Montezuma and Alibech but Guyomar defends Montezuma as Odmar flees with Alibech to safety. Guyomar covers Montezuma's retreat but is eventually overcome and captured by the Spaniards. Guards lead Guyomar off. Cortez and Cydaria enter. Cydaria has convinced Cortez to re-offer terms of peace to Montezuma. They talk of their love and Cortez reveals that he had a former love, now dead, that Cydaria resembles. They spar about whether his love for his dead wife will overshadow her. Cydaria is doubtful, so Cortez releases Guyomar as a token of his love. Guyomar is grateful and pledges brotherhood to Cortez. Guyomar leaves to convince Montezuma to hold three days of peace. Act 3 Scene 1. A Chamber Royal Odmar and Alibech are safe in the city with Odmar trying to claim Alibech's hand when Guyomar enters. Each defend their earlier decision. Alibech declares the contest is not yet won. Montezuma, Almeria and Orbellan enter discussing Montezuma's options for peace. Almeria and Orbellan convince him to return to war, despite the protestations of Guyomar. Montezuma, Odmar, Guyomar and Alibech leave to prepare for more war. Almeria and Orbellan stay behind. Guyomar returns and overhears their conversation as Almeria convinces Orbellan to try to assassinate Cortez. Almeria and Orbellan leave as Guyomar monologues his intent to warn Cortez, then exits. Act 3 Scene 2. A Camp at Night Cortez, unable to sleep for love, wanders alone and hears commotion in camp. Orbellan enters running, trying to disguise himself from pursuers. He tells Cortez that he is Taxallan and needs protection from harassment. Cortez promises his safety and hides Orbellan in his tent. Commanders enter and inform Cortez that Guyomar has been there to warn of Orbellan's assassination attempt. The commanders leave and Cortez brings out Orbellan and reveals his identity. On his honour he escorts Orbellan out of camp, but once they are out Cortez gives Orbellan a sword and challenges him to a duel. Orbellan is wounded in his sword hand. Cortez's honour compels him to free Orbellan but warns that he will attack the city on the next day, which is the day Orbellan is to marry Cydaria. Act 3 Scene 3. Mexico Montezuma, Odmar, Guyomar, and Almeria are awaiting Orbellan as the marriage approaches. They are discussing the starvation in the city due to the siege. Orbellan enters and pulls Almeria aside to tell his failure. Alibech and Cydaria enter to implore Montezuma to stay the wedding because Cydaria loves Cortez. A messenger enters to say that the war is back on at the city walls. More messengers arrive as the battle gets closer to the royal party. Cortez finally enters and slays Orbellan, but is outnumbered. Guyomar forces Cortez to surrender his sword. Almeria calls for his head but Guyomar defends Cortez and returns Cortez's sword. Montezuma threatens Guyomar but Odmar steps between them. Odmar mediates Cortez's surrender. Cortez is given as prisoner to Guyomar in the castle on the lake. Almeria is pissed and vows revenge. Act 4 Scene 1. A Prison Almeria enters Cortez's cell to kill him. Cortez awakes and shows no fear of death, which makes Almeria fall in love with him. She can‚Äôt kill him and instead tries to find out if he would love her instead of Cydaria. Cortez politely refuses, but she pretends it was a joke and leaves him alive anyway. Cortez contemplates his condition. Act 4 Scene 2. A Chamber Royal Montezuma, Odmar, Guyomar and Alibech discuss the growing threat of starvation and contemplate surrender. They decide to fight still, because Cortez though in chains has increased his terms of peace: ‚Äúhe in Chains demanded more/ Than he impos‚Äôd in Victory before‚Äù. Montezuma refuses to surrender: ‚ÄúIf either Death or Bondage I must choose,/ I‚Äôll keep my Freedom, though my Life I lose.‚Äù Guyomar grudgingly accepts command and Montezuma and Odmar leave to prepare for war. Alibech implores Guyomar to release Cortez and let the opposing army into the city to end their starvation. Guyomar laments his choice between Alibech and the empire and decides through much consideration to put his country first. A messenger arrives and tells Guyomar that the Spanish commanders are resting at a defenceless grotto. Guyomar leaves to go kill them and claim victory. Odmar enters and Alibech asks him what she asked of Guyomar. Odmar agrees and leaves and Alibech monologues, revealing that she loves Guyomar even though he refused her, and she hates Odmar though he obeyed her. She laments that this would force her to marry Odmar in honour of her agreement. Act 4 Scene 3 A Pleasant Grotto Guyomar surprises the Spanish commanders and captures them. The Spaniards are led out as Montezuma, Alibech and a discontented Odmar enter. Montezuma commends Guyomar on his victory. Alibech pledges herself to him and Montezuma declares it their wedding day. Montezuma tells Odmar to guard the commanders. Montezuma, Alibech and Guyomar leave. Odmar realises that he was the one Alibech hated and is swayed to revenge on his rival. He orders Vasquez and Pizarro brought out and allies with them, promising them an easy victory. Vasquez requests the hand of a beauty whose name he does not know as his price. Pizarro wants gold. Act 4 Scene 4. A Prison Cortez and Almeria are again discussing Almeria's love for Cortez. Cortez doesn‚Äôt believe her; she threatens to kill him if he doesn‚Äôt return her love. Cortez is adamant that his heart belongs to Cydaria, but pledges to Almeria platonic love and devotion. As he kisses her hand, Cydaria enters. Cydaria misinterprets and accuses Cortez of infidelity. Almeria realises the mistake but persists, declaring the same thing in an attempt to break Cydaria's love for him. As Cortez is trying to prove his love, the Spanish led by Vasquez can be heard arriving. Almeria, fearing death by Spaniard, tries to kill Cydaria to keep her from Cortez. Cydaria runs behind Cortez, who is hurt instead. Almeria tries to kill herself but Cortez stops her. Pizarro and Vasquez arrive. Cortez promises Cydaria's protection and orders her into a tower in the prison to keep her safe, but refuses Almeria. Cortez promises not to kill Montezuma or Cydaria's brothers. They leave to put Cydaria away. Almeria, despondent, leaves to let herself be killed in the battle. The Spanish return. Cortez makes Pizarro guard the tower and leaves to fight. Pizarro leaves his post to plunder instead. Act 5 Scene 1. A Chamber Royal Odmar enters with Guyomar and Alibech bound. Odmar unbinds Alibech and declares Alibech his queen; she refuses. He threatens her life if she won‚Äôt accept. Guyomar resigns his right to her rather than let her die, but she chides him saying that it's still her choice. Odmar threatens to kill Guyomar if she won‚Äôt marry him. Alibech tries to barter, but is forced to agree to the match. She asks only to kiss Guyomar once. As they kiss they decide to die together. Vasquez enters and declares that Alibech is the one he wanted as his price. Odmar and Vasquez fight as Alibech frees Guyomar. Vasquez kills Odmar as Guyomar runs to his brother's sword. Guyomar fights and kills Vasquez. Act 5 Scene 2. A Prison Montezuma and an Aztec High Priest are tortured on the rack by a Christian priest and Pizarro in an effort to both locate more gold AND convert them to Christianity. ‚ÄúHow wickedly he has refus‚Äôd his Wealth,/ and hid his gold from Christian hands by stealth‚Äù. Montezuma refuses to submit, claiming that his gods are stronger. They get into a religious debate during the torture. The High Priest almost breaks, and asks Montezuma for permission to reveal the gold's location. Montezuma commands that he die instead. And so he does. Cortez enters and frees Montezuma. He threatens Pizarro with Martial Law for letting the battle turn into a massacre and refuses to let anyone take gold, claiming it is cursed. (Money is the root of all evil!) Pizarro and the priest leave. Cortez and Montezuma make up. A Spanish messenger arrives to report that Guyomar is winning; Cortez leaves to rally his troops but promises to save Guyomar from death. Almeria enters a changed woman, not yet dead, and asks Montezuma's love. She helps him to the base of Cydaria's tower and Montezuma yells for her to let them in. As Cydaria lets in Montezuma, Almeria tries to get in as well even though Cydaria doesn‚Äôt trust her. They get in just as the Spanish arrive. Cortez tries to retrieve Cydaria, but Montezuma and Almeria refuse to let her go. Rather than be a slave to Cortez's charity, Montezuma, a proud man, commits suicide instead. The Spanish start to break into the tower. Almeria prepares to kill Cydaria one more time. Cortez tries to barter for her life. As they argue, Almeria stabs Cydaria and then herself. The Spanish break in and bring them to Cortez. Almeria declares her love for Cortez once more, asks Cydaria's forgiveness, and dies. Cydaria is not mortally wounded. Guyomar and Alibech enter captured, and Cortez releases them and offers to share power with them. They refuse and head far north instead. Cortez ends the play promising a grand funeral for Montezuma. ==References== Category:Plays by John Dryden Category:English Restoration plays Category:1665 plays Category:Aztecs in fiction Category:Tragedy plays ","title":"The Indian Emperour"},{"id":"19323663","text":"Round Lake Historic District can refer to: * Round Lake Historic District (St. Petersburg, Florida) * Round Lake Historic District (Round Lake, New York) ","title":"Round Lake Historic District"},{"id":"19323665","text":"Marcin Budzi≈Ñski (born 6 July 1990 in Gi≈ºycko) is a Polish footballer who last played as a midfielder. == Career == He made his first appearance in the Ekstraklasa in September 2008. == International career == Marcin Budzi≈Ñski formerly played for the Poland U-21. team.U-21: ≈Åotwa - Polska 2:2 Previously, he played for Poland U-19. == Club career == Between 2008 and 2017, Budzi≈Ñski featured in the Ekstraklasa, the top flight of the Polish football system, where he played 200 matches for club sides Arka Gdynia and Cracovia.

The National Pantheon of Heroes and oratory of the Virgin Our Lady Saint Mary of the Asuncion which is located between Palma and Chile streets in the downtown of the capital of Paraguay, is a must for all tourists and foreign delegations arriving visit to Paraguay and Asuncion. It is, at the same time, an architectural jewel of great artistic, cultural and heritage. In October 1863, the then president Francisco Solano L√≥pez ordered the construction of the chapel of the Virgin of the Asuncion, which was designed by Italian architect Alejandro Ravizza, in collaboration with the builder Giacomo Colombino. But as a result of the War of the Triple Alliance, the building remained unfinished and scaffolding for over 70 years. Only after the Chaco War in 1936 was able to finish and was inaugurated on October 12 of that year, to become by presidential decree in National Pantheon of Heroes. The National Pantheon is the mausoleum of the country, where lie the remains of the great heroes of Paraguayan history such as Don Carlos Antonio L√≥pez (1st president Constitutional), Mariscal Francisco Solano L√≥pez, Mariscal Jos√© F√©lix Estigarribia (hero and winner of the Chaco War against Bolivia) and his wife. In addition, the Children Martyrs Acosta √ëu, two Unknown Soldiers, among others. Within the enclosure of the pantheon have set countless illustrious honorary plaques sent by foreign rulers, kings and princes. Congratulations and verses of appreciation to the Paraguayan Navy, Air Force among others. Many wonder what the significance of the inscription in Latin, which is in the front of the pantheon, \\"Fides et Patria\\" means, \\"My faith and my country.\\" It is customary in Asuncion that when something historic happens (such as the victory of President Lugo in the 2008 elections) people flock with their flags to the street in front of it and celebrate the event. The ceremonial changing of the guard is held several times a day. ==Gallery== Image:Panteon Asuncion Paraguay.jpgThe National Pantheon by day Image:Panteon heroes paraguay.jpgThe Pantheon by night Image:Pante√≥n nacional de los H√©roes - Paraguay.jpgFront of the National Heroes Pantheon by Day Category:Buildings and structures in Asunci√≥n Category:Mausoleums Category:Monuments and memorials in Paraguay Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1936 ","title":"National Pantheon of the Heroes"},{"id":"19323798","text":"Classic Hits/Pop (Local Version) (formerly known as Oldies Plus) was a 24-hour music format produced by Dial Global, formerly distributed by Waitt Radio Networks and then under the now-defunct Dial Global Local brand.

He is best known for his 2008 single \\"Let It Rock\\". ==Early life== Kevin Winston Rudolf was born on February 17, 1983, in New York City, New York, to Ellyn, an American singer, and Stephen, a disc jockey originally from the United Kingdom and of English heritage. He grew up an only child on the Upper East Side, his parents divorcing while he was still very young. His middle name, Winston, is an homage to Beatle John Lennon: \\"My dad... was a DJ at the time in Baltimore. He's British, and emceed some shows for the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. In fact, that's why my middle name is Winston, he named me after John Lennon's middle name. And, of course, mom being a singer, she'd let me come to her gigs and soundchecks. They both really influenced me a lot to be a musician.\\" Rudolf has said that his first musical memory is of listening to the Van Halen song \\"Jump\\", while jumping around the apartment in which he grew up. His first guitar was a gift from his grandfather, who realized that his grandson already \\"had a passion for [music].\\" His skills on the instrument improved rapidly. \\"My mother actually said something really smart to me. She said, 'Whatever you put in, you'll get out,' so I thought, that makes sense...I started practicing a lot.\\" Rudolf played with several local bands, including an alternative rock group known as 'Paint', but soon found himself frustrated with the tensions and internal squabbles associated with a band situation. Taking matters into his own hands, Rudolf began creating his own beats and musical tracks, as well as writing the material. ==Musical career2000‚Äì2006: Career beginnings=== In 2000, Rudolf began work on the group of songs that, nine months later, would form the basis for his major label debut. Written, produced and engineered by Rudolf, and mixed by Mark Saunders, the album took nine months to complete.Bonacich, Drago (2003). Allrovi.com. Retrieved May 26, 2013 Rudolf was signed to Madonna's record label, Maverick, which released the album under the pseudonym, Binocular. A song from the album, \\"You\\", was used in the TV show Smallville (2001), and a song not appearing on the album, \\"Maybe You're Gone\\" (written by Danny Scherr), was later used over the end credits of the movie \\"The Girl Next Door\\" (2004). imdb.com. Retrieved June 3, 2013. Despite receiving positive reviews, the album went largely unnoticed in the United States.Allmusic (2009). However, it was successful in the Philippines. allmusic.com. Retrieved May 26, 2013 Rudolf's solo career took a detour in 2003, when famed recording engineer Jimmy Douglass introduced him to superstar producer Timbaland. Rudolf was invited to watch a recording session, but, at Timbaland's urging, soon found himself participating, by playing guitar on Lil' Kim's 2003 hit \\"The Jump Off.\\" Rudolf remembers, \\"At first I just went into the studio to absorb what I could. I brought my guitar as sort of peace offering so I wasn't feeling completely useless. Soon I was playing parts on songs.\\" Rudolf has stated that his time spent with Timbaland influenced his own attitude in making records. \\"Working with Timbaland, I was amazed by his work ethic and just how much he would work on something until he got the results he wanted.\\" He would go on to collaborate with Timbaland on many songs, including those by The Black Eyed Peas, Justin Timberlake, Nelly Furtado, and David Banner. ===2007‚Äì2009: Major label success=== Rudolf continued to work on his solo material throughout 2007, while still working with Timbaland. During one memorable session, he met Bryan \\"Birdman\\" Williams and Ronald \\"Slim\\" Williams, brothers and co-CEO's of Cash Money Records. \\"I played them a couple of records I produced and wrote and they liked them for one of their artists. Then I played them my solo stuff and they flipped out over this song called 'Coffee and Donuts'. We built from there, and a few months later Lil Wayne got on 'Let It Rock' and they signed me, and the rest is history.\\" When Rudolf was signed to a record deal by Cash Money, he became the first white artist, as well as the first rock artist, signed to a label previously known for releasing records by African-American rap artists, including, most famously, Lil Wayne. CEO Slim Williams explained, \\"we love one-of-a-kind artists, and Kevin rolls that way in everything he does...we are always looking at the next step, the next level we can take our audience. I knew his work with other artists, but when he played me his solo stuff, we just knew we had to partner up.\\" \\"Let It Rock\\", the initial single from Rudolf's then-upcoming album, In the City, was released on June 16, 2008. Written and produced by Rudolf, and featuring Lil Wayne, the song met with immediate success, debuting at number 5 on Billboard magazine's influential Hot 100 chart. Noted music critic David Jeffries predicted that fans would find the song \\"a near-perfect highlight,\\" while critic Rick Florino called Rudolf's voice \\"sexy and bombastic\\" and noted his \\"diverse set of pipes.\\" The song became a staple of sporting events, listed by BMI as the second most- played song in NFL, MLB and NHL arenas and stadiums. With \\"Let It Rock\\" already a massive hit, fans and media still noted a sense of \\"mystery\\" surrounding Rudolf. \\"There really was no mystery,\\" he said. \\"The song just blew up faster than we could catch up with it. But it was great that the music was given a chance to speak for itself. People truly felt it--it wasn't anything fake. And with me, music always comes first. Unlike some artists, I don't want the attention to be put on myself as much as my music.\\" Rudolf's first studio album, titled In the City, was released on November 24, 2008, and was produced and co-written by Rudolf, with the exception of one song, \\"She Can Get It\\", which was co-produced by the Neptunes. Rudolf explained that the album was about \\"growing up in New York City when the city was wild... it felt like there were no rules and you could be anyone you wanted. That is the landscape of this album.\\" The album was noted for Rudolf's distinctive merging of musical styles, namely, rock and hip-hop. \\"It's about taking rock attitude vocally, hip hop drums, synths, and guitars and sharpening the edges of everything in a sense. You bring it together. That's how I do it.\\" Rudolf's penchant for \\"genre-bending\\" was noted in many reviews of the album. \\"'In the City' cribs tricks from both rap and rock 'n' roll, not in the pursuit of a bastardised Limp Bizkit-type hybrid, but with the intention to produce a crossover rock record with modern hip-hop tools...it's hard to deny Rudolf is a man with some big ideas.\\" With lead single \\"Let It Rock\\" still garnering the most attention, other songs from the album also began to have impact. \\"Welcome to the World\\", the album's second single, went gold and was featured prominently in advertisements for WrestleMania XXVI.[ Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]Australian-charts.com - Welcome to the World - Kevin Rudolf featuring Kid Cudi - Chart positions \\"NYC\\" was featured on an episode of CSI: NY. Throughout most of 2009, Rudolf performed songs from In the City live, including appearances on The Jimmy Kimmel Show, Dancing with the Stars, the Miss USA Pageant and the 2009 NBA All-Star Game. ===2010‚Äì2014: To the Sky=== On June 15, 2010, Rudolf's second studio album, To the Sky, was released. The album consists of 11 tracks with a total running time of 37 minutes. The first single from the album, \\"I Made It (Cash Money Heroes)\\", was released on February 2, 2010, in advance of the album, becoming Rudolf's second platinum single. It was followed, on September 14, by the single \\"You Make the Rain Fall.\\" Critical reviews were mixed, with one saying, \\"this is 'In the City' evolved...to a higher level, while others noted the \\"good songwriting,\\" but lamented that \\"without a worthy 'Let it Rock' successor, this is hard to recommend over his debut.\\" Responding to a question about his song, \\"I Made It\\", Rudolf elaborated on his own feelings regarding success. \\"I think that 'making it' is something that you do in stages. There's a certain feeling of 'I made it' when you have a hit on the radio for the first time and people are feeling it and buying it and reacting to it at shows. But I've also set new goals since then.\\" On July 2, 2013, Perez Hilton premiered Rudolf's video for his upcoming single, \\"Here's to Us.\\" Hilton stated, \\"'Here's To Us' will be the lead single off his upcoming third album. We seriously got goosebumps watching this video! It has such a positive message. We just LOVE Kevin's outlook on life!\\" On July 26, Rudolf announced via his official Twitter page that the single, \\"Here's to Us\\" would be available on iTunes as of Tuesday, July 30. The song was also featured on the soundtrack of the video game 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil. ===2015‚Äìpresent: Space Rock=== On January 13, 2015, Kevin Rudolf announced that he had completed his contract with Cash Money Records and now he was an independent artist. After being relaxed out of his record deal with Cash Money Records in January 2015, Rudolf could no longer release music under his own name for a period of three years, therefore Rudolf created a new project under the alias Space Rock. After signing with Primary Wave Music in July 2015, Kevin dropped the name Space Rock and went back to Kevin Rudolf using Space Rock as the album title instead. On May 21, 2015, Kevin released the first single from Space Rock, titled \\"That Other Ship\\". The single was re-released on June 22 under Kevin Rudolf as the artist. On June 22, 2015, Kevin released a song called 'Blaze Of Glory', featured on the WWE Tough Enough soundtrack. On July 7, 2017, Rudolf released the single 'Nobody Gets Out Alive'. ===Production work=== In September 2009, having finished two solo albums, Rudolf moved from Miami to Los Angeles to concentrate on co- writing and producing records for several LA-based artists, including Cobra Starship, Leona Lewis, Lifehouse, Natasha Bedingfield, Selena Gomez and Weezer. \\"I spent a lot of time in L.A. after a couple of my records blew up, and I got into producing and writing for a lot of other artists out there. I got into that whole game. Then when I got back to New York‚ÄîI grew up in New York‚ÄîI felt completely inspired all over again. I felt like I had done enough of writing songs for other people, that I wanted to really say something. I think what music's lacking right now is there's really no message. No one's saying anything...I just felt like I really wanted to put something back in the world that inspires people, says something, and means something.\\" In 2013, Rudolf took a break from recording his own album to co-write a song with country artist Keith Urban and country songwriters Brad and Brett Warren called \\"Little Bit of Everything\\", which Urban debuted on May 16, 2013, on the Season 12 finale of American Idol. ==Personal life== Kevin Rudolf, Miami 2013 Having grown up in New York City, the only child of divorced parents, Rudolf has stated that he has found greater inspiration and a stronger sense of belonging in his adopted city of Miami. Rudolf first lived temporarily in Miami while doing session work with producer Timbaland. After relocating to Los Angeles in 2010 while writing and producing for several artists, Rudolf returned to New York for a brief time in 2012 to begin work on his upcoming album. He missed living in Miami and later that year made it his permanent residence. In the documentary Ferraris and Helicopters, Rudolf explained his attraction to the city. \\"When I moved down to Miami it was like moving to another planet because I was so used to New York, the energy and the craziness and everything. I came down here, I really didn't know too many people. I would go to this place called the Greek Place for breakfast, and I sort of found myself sitting up at the bar talking to the old retirees, South American people, Orthodox Jews-and the local Floridians, and it became part of my daily life. I don't know how it happened. I just started hanging out and having conversations. I still talk to all those people, a lot of them when I go back there. It's cool because it gave me the feeling of a hometown rooting for you.

He was a first round selection, 23rd overall by Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg in the 2009 KHL Junior Draft. ==Playing career== Roman made his professional debut in the 2005‚Äì06 season, in his native Czech Extraliga with his junior club, HC V√≠tkovice. The following season harbouring NHL ambitions he moved to North America to play major junior hockey in the Western Hockey League with the Spokane Chiefs. After his rookie season, Roman was selected 136th overall in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft by the Dallas Stars. Roman returned to the Czech Republic for a second stint with his original club, HC V√≠tkovice. During his second season with the Steelers in 2009‚Äì10, on 29 January 2010, Roman was signed by the Dallas Stars to a three- year entry-level contract. Roman reported the next year to the Stars' American Hockey League affiliate, the Texas Stars. In his first professional North American season, Roman appeared in 72 games with Texas, contributing with a career high 22 points. During the 2011‚Äì12 season, unable to gain traction on his debut AHL season, Roman was traded by the Stars to the Florida Panthers in exchange for Angelo Esposito on 13 January 2012.

Neogaerrhinum filipes) is an annual species of North American snapdragon, usually known by the common name yellow twining snapdragon. This herbaceous plant is native to deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it is common. ==Description== The species is a hairless herbaceous annual, growing long, thin, vine-like stems which climb on objects, including other plants, for support. The inflorescence is composed of a tendril-like pedicel which may be up to 10 centimeters long and coils tightly to help the plant climb. At its tip is a single flower which is bright yellow to gold in color, dotted with dark maroon, and just over a centimeter long. The stem is similar to that of a vine, winding up anywhere from 9 to 100 centimeters long on other plants, and it does not have a gland. It winds around the branchlets of other plants for protection. The base of the stem is woolly. The petiole, the stalk that attaches the leaf blade to the stem, is 0‚Äì5 millimeters long with the leaf blade being 6 to 50 millimeters. Leaves are lanceolate, as in shaped like the tip of a lance, as well as being linear to ovate. Both the plant's steam and leaves are bright green. Flowers are self-pollinating via the process of cleistogamy, meaning they are fertilized as buds that never need to open. The flower's corolla, as in all of the petals collectively together, is 10 to 13 millimeters long. Pedicels (stems that attach a single flower to the inflorescence) are thread-like, measuring 3 to 10 centimeters long, and are able to intertwine around the stems of other plants. They are even thinner and longer than those of similar snapdragon species of the Mohave Desert. Its coloring is yellow and gold with speckles of maroon. The fragile fruit are ovoid to spherical, 3 to 5 millimeters long. Seeds are black, wing-shaped, with 4 to 6 thick ridges, and 1 millimeter long. ==Habitat== A. filipes is native to the sandy deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its flowering period is from March to May. The plants, due to being hidden by low bushes, are hard to spot because its stem is usually covered by the leaves and twigs of other plant species. Locations where the species has been documented include slopes in the Grand Canyon, within the Mohave Desert and within the Sonoran Desert. It can be found at an elevation of up to 1650 meters. ==In literature== A research study was completed in 2009 by the Journal of Arid Environments which compared the flowering phenology of both shrubs and ephemerals in both urban and non-urban areas.

It has a population of approximately 5000 people. ==Geography== Irkay is situated in the Al-Janub (Southern) governorate, southeast from the capital, Beirut, and borders two small towns, ‚ÄòIzzah in the east and Khzaz in the west. It is only 36 miles (78 km) from Beirut and only 9 miles (15 km) from Sidon, one of the main ports in Lebanon. The town is situated on the Jabal ‚ÄòAamel mountain range which begins from Sidon and stretches throughout the South, making the town‚Äôs average altitude 1243 feet (378m) above sea-level. The low population of 4850 people and the vast area of the town resulted in a small population density and hence many houses are scattered at different altitudes within the town region. ==Agriculture== Irkay is well known for producing olive oil due to the white, fertile soil which also helps to grow flavorful figs. The major river in the South, Al Zahrani, flows next to Irkay and further helps to promote the crop growth and also provides a source of leisure for the residents. ==Climate== Irkay is known to have a moderate Mediterranean climate with four distinct seasons. Temperatures range from 8 ¬∞C (46 ¬∞F) in the winter to 35 ¬∞C (95 ¬∞F) in the summer. The humidity is usually high in the summer and low in the winter. Snow occurs very rarely, nearly once every couple of years. This excellent weather makes Irkay an attractive place for visitors. People come and enjoy most of their summer vacation here if they don‚Äôt want to travel outside the country. ==History== In the North of the town, at the cliff of the mountain, lie many mysterious caves which have been deserted for hundreds of years. It is believed that deep within the caves are ancient artifacts, like pottery and old ruins dating back to the Romans and the Phoenicians. No-one has ever explored these caves because of their remote location; however the ruins are believed to exist, because over 7000 years ago ancient civilizations inhabited the Levant area (including Lebanon) so that discovery wouldn‚Äôt be a surprise. About ten years ago, people from the town were doing excavation work to build a house, when they found a cave, with two old jars inside. When Irkay was first emerging over 50 years ago, there were severe tensions between the three major families Nasser, Makki and Chakroun. Occasional brawls leading to injuries would take place. At some point of time the Lebanese army interfered to cool down the tensions. The reasons for clashes among Irkey residents to occur were land problems, multi-political beliefs and possibly due to jealousy caused between families. The people in Irkay survived a major starving episode during the first world war. Food was limited, where nearly 20% of the population died from hunger. People started planting their own food in order to survive. The episode was caused by a locust infestation which flooded the entire country. Food became contaminated therefore many caught diseases during that period of time. It was the worst Irkay has ever experienced. Irkay has also survived through many wars and battles such as the Civil War in 1975 and the Israeli invasion in 1978 and 1982. Both wars lasted until the end of the 20th century. During that time Irkay was occupied by Israeli soldiers, when Israel was in control of the South, and also Irkay was home to many Lebanese militias during the Civil War. In recent history, in July 2006, when the July War began, Irkay was nearly hit by 4 bombs dropped down by Israeli fighter jets and 2 of which landed on ‚ÄòIzzah, nearly 1.5 miles (2 km) away from Irkay. The explosion was definitely felt by the residents in Irkay but no harm was done. Recently the mayor proposed raising taxes in order to pay for the maintenance of the roads and the creation of more social activities. In the end the government decided to fund all of this as gratitude for the people. ==Religion== Irkay residents are Muslims. Athan is raised 5 times a day in the mosque (Al-Masjed) as a calling for all residents to pray. Every Tuesday (El-Tawasull) and Thursday (Kumaill) duaa' is played aloud for residents across the village to participate in such holy prayer. Friday, is remarkable as it combines both the elderly and youngsters together in such a holy prayer called Salat Al-Jumaa'. ==Culture== The people in Irkay are known for their continuous cultural activities. Some of these activities include, going down to the river every 3rd week in August and have a picnic where all the residents sing and dance the traditional Lebanese dabke, after enjoying a feast finishing off the traditional Lebanese folklore. Irkay has its own mayor, elected by the public every four years. His job is to oversee the government projects such as, maintenance, schools, and clinics, he also communicates with the government, on behalf of the people, to tell them about their concerns and needs. Furthermore, there is a reward given by Irkay to the students, in each grade, who achieve the highest marks at the end of each year. Traditionally all the houses are built from red bricks and white stone. They also each have a garden where many residents grow their own vegetables and fruits. ==Sports== The people of Irkay enjoy many sports, such as soccer, basketball and volleyball. Every August a soccer tournament is arranged where teams from different villages are invited to participate. Sometimes even players from the Lebanese National team are invited to attend this tournament. The winning team is awarded a trophy and a cash prize. This tournament is a major source of entertainment to the residents of the South. == Sources == *Chakroun, Nadim, Direct Interview, 6 July 2012. *Chakroun, Rami, Direct Interview, 24 June 2013. *Egger, Per. \\"Irkay, Lebanon Page.\\" Directory of Cities and Towns in Mohafazat Liban-Sud, Lebanon. 1996-2004.

He earned renown for his brilliant performances at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, performing some of the most demanding roles written for the dramatic tenor voice. ==Career== Yershov was born illegitimate into a poor family in Novocherkassk. He entered the Aleksandrovsk railroad school in 1884 and trained to become a mechanic/engine driver. In his spare time, he sang in choirs. The outstanding potential of his voice was noticed and he received singing lessons in Moscow. In 1888, Anton Rubinstein awarded him a scholarship to the Saint Petersburg Conservatory where he was assigned to the class of the distinguished teacher Stanislav Ivanovich Gabel (1849‚Äì1924). He studied, too, with Joseph Palacek at the conservatory. According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera at least, Yershov made his operatic debut in Saint Petersburg in 1893 as Gounod's Faust. The young tenor travelled to Italy the following year to complete his studies in Milan with Ernesto Rossi. While in Italy, he performed at Turin and at Reggio Emilia, appearing as Don Jose in Carmen and Canio in Pagliacci. He returned to Russia in 1894 and took up an engagement with the Kharkov Opera. Here he sang a variety of roles as diverse as Romeo in Rom√©o et Juliette, Arturo in I puritani, Samson in Samson and Delilah, Vladimir in Prince Igor and Ernani in Ernani. Yershov met with considerable success at Kharkov, although his voice still exhibited some shortcomings. Such was his promise, however, he was offered a contract by Russia's foremost opera house, the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg. His debut as a Mariinsky artist came in the title role of Faust in January 1895. Yershov's singing continued to grow in size and technical assurance following his arrival at the Mariinsky. Before long, he was being hailed by audiences and music critics alike as Russia's finest dramatic tenor. He would appear regularly at the Mariinsky in a wide spectrum of operatic works, including Peter Tchaikovsky's masterpiece Eugene Onegin, in which he sang the part of Lenski. He also sang the title roles in Tannh√§user and Lohengrin and appeared as Faust in Mefistofele. The part of Roland in Esclarmonde was added in 1897 to his repertoire. In 1900, he appeared as Tristan in Tristan und Isolde and Raoul in Les Huguenots. He sang the title role in Otello the next year, and that of Siegfried in Siegfried in 1902. He appeared, too, as Radames in Aida and Paolo in Francesca da Rimini in 1904. Other roles which he undertook included John of Leyden, Florestan, Grishka Kuterma, Sobinin, Tsar Berendey, Sadko, Finn, Mikhailo Tucha, Orest, Gvidan and Golitsyn. He also gave concerts featuring vocal music by Tchaikovsky, Modest Mussorgsky, J.S. Bach, G.F. Handel, Robert Schumann, Hector Berlioz and other prominent composers. In private life Yershov was a reserved, serious-minded individual who shunned the limelight and was genuinely humble about his achievements. He also disliked travel and when Cosima Wagner asked him in 1901 to sing at the Bayreuth Festival, he declined the invitation on the grounds that he did not wish to restudy his Wagnerian roles in German. (He also feared that his musical interpretations would be stifled by the prevailing Bayreuth style of singing, which preferred Sprechgesang to bel canto.) Yershov believed strongly that opera was an important art form and not mere entertainment for the wealthy. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, he concentrated most of his energies on producing operatic works and teaching vocal students at the Leningrad (Saint Petersburg) Conservatory, although, in February 1919, he agreed to perform the leading role in a revival of Rimsky-Korsakov's Kashchey the Deathless. He also sang Truffaldino in Prokofiev's The Love for Three Oranges, which received its premiere Russian performance in February 1926 at the Mariinsky (or the \\"Leningrad State Academic Theatre for Opera and Ballet\\" as it had been renamed by the Soviet authorities). Yershov retired from the stage in 1929, having performed in approximately 55 different operas during the course of his career. In 1938, he was made a People's Artist of the Soviet Union and awarded a doctorate of musicology three years later. He was evacuated to Tashkent in Uzbekistan during the German army's invasion of Russia in World War II. Yershov died in Tashkent in 1943 at the age of 76. His remains were brought back to Russia for reinterment in 1956. Plot: he died during the evacuation and in 1956 was re-buried in Necropolis of Arts Alexander Nevsky Monastery (Saint Petersburg)https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/56960407 * Wife: Sofia Vladimirovna Akimova (1887‚Äì1972 ) opera singer soprano. Sophia Akimova was born in Tiflis, and received her vocal training under Maria Slavina. She became the wife of fellow opera singer and actor Ivan Vasilievich Ershov (1867‚Äì1943). Sofia performed as a soloist with the Marinskii Theatre in Petrograd, and was later appointed a professor of music at the Leningrad Conservatory. * Son: Igor Ivanovich Ershov (1916‚Äì1985). Painter and graphic designer. He was born into an artistic family; his father Ivan Ershov was an opera singer with the Imperial Marinskii Theatre and his mother was both a singer and a professor at the St Petersburg Conservatoire. In 1932, Ershov began his studies at the academy of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. Amongst his professors were I.Brodsky and I.Bilibin, the masters of the ¬´silver age¬ª of Russian paintings. His studies were interrupted by the Second World War when he was evacuated to Tashkent. Ershov graduated from the Academy in 1947, presenting lithographs for A. Pushkin's Bronze Horseman. In 1949, a jubilee edition of Pushkin's works was published with illustrations by the artist. From the 1950s onwards, he worked mainly as an illustratorof children's books. At least two generations of Russian children grew up reading Khorovod with Ershov's illustrations. His illustrations for the Russian folk tales by Charles Perrault and Aleksandr Pushkin were very popular; The tale of the Golden Cockerel (1957-1960), A tale of the Fisherman and his wife (1956‚Äì57), Russian fairy-tales (1957‚Äì1960). Ershov also illustrated the books of contemporary poets such as M.Dudin, E.Rein, and G.Sapgir. The total publication of Ershov's children's books exceeds 1.2 million copies. Ershov's works can be found in the collections of a number of Russian museums including the State Russian Museum and Museum of A.S. Pushkin and in museums and private collections in both France and England. * Xenia Krivocheine (bio provided by the granddaughter ) Paris \\"Une atmosph√®re de conte de f√©es\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20120407123403/http://www.egliserusse.eu/blogdiscussion/Une- atmosphere-de-conte-de-fees_a680.html ==Recordings and assessment== Although his career was almost completely confined to Russia, Yershov is considered to have been one of the very best operatic tenors of the past 125 years, on a par with the likes of Jean de Reszke, Francesco Tamagno, Enrico Caruso, Lauritz Melchior, Beniamino Gigli and Jussi Bj√∂rling. His enormous reputation is supported by a handful of acoustic discs which he made in Saint Petersburg for Columbia Records and the Gramophone and Typewriter Company in 1903, most of which are now available on CD reissues. These recordings consist of some Russian songs and a few operatic arias by Giacomo Meyerbeer, Richard Wagner and Giuseppe Verdi. Despite their sonic limitations, caused by the technological limitations of the day, they show that he possessed a powerful, steady, pure-toned voice of wide compass with clarion high notes and a formidable technique. Yershov was praised, too, for his theatrical make-up skills and vivid stage presence. His acting was said to be on the same level as that of his celebrated contemporary, the bass Feodor Chaliapin. * Mariia Platonova‚Äôs 1902 letter to Ershov illustrates how opera contributed to self- realization and gave embodiment to exalted, authenticating confession. Platonova exhilaratingly wrote: ‚ÄúO Siegfried! Siegfried! Child of the world! Siegfried‚Äîjoy, hope of the earth! Giver of life, radiant hero!‚Äù How much light, truth, and beauty there is in you, pure and youthful! You showed us young people what youth and life means. . . . You expressed it . . . through your person . . . gave a living, concrete picture, fulfilled a vague desire . . . I feel myself and my words to be small and pathetic before Siegfried . . . I want to pray before your creation and your talent. . . . I believe that there is a God, that he is great, having given us . . . aspiration to goodness and beauty, having given us your talent. . . .

The video begins with a closeup of Dani Filth's face hidden in the shadows. The camera cuts to a young maid in a restroom who notices a digital camcorder, sits down in a toilet stall and looks at the camera for any footage present. The video on the camcorder shows the Cradle of Filth band members in something like an empty dance hall, sharply dressed, systematically abusing and humiliating half a dozen young men and women, while Dani directs proceedings with a megaphone. Near the video's end, Dani is seen looking at himself in an antique mirror, which he then spins around and points at the camera operator, revealing that the maid herself was recording the band's activities. In the restroom, the maid looks horrified. We then cut back to the torture room, now vacant and poorly lit, to find the maid alone with the libertine tormentors, and forced into a chair as Dani takes the camera and another band member takes a director's clapperboard labelled \\"Pandora's Box.\\" The young lady weeps as she is taunted, yelled at, and ridiculed. Back in the bathroom, the footage on the digital camcorder cuts off and the maid looks up with terror etched on her face.

The company published during the years 1994 to 1999, at which point it was contracted to form the Marvel Knights imprint for Marvel Comics. == History== Penciller Quesada and inker Palmiotti, after working well together on various projects such as Valiant Comics' X-O Manowar, and following the creation of their first joint project in Kid Death & Fluffy for a Creators Universe card series, decided to create their own studio with their own original characters. They spent two weeks in the Florida Keys developing Ash, their flagship character. Event published several series starring Ash, as well as stand-alone crossovers with another Event title, 22 Brides. The initial series, simply titled Ash, ran for a total of seven issues, with issue #6 leading directly into issue #0. The second series, Ash: The Fire Within ran for three issues. The final series to focus on the title character was Ash: Cinder & Smoke, which ran for a total of six issues. Ash also co-starred in the intercompany crossover Azrael/Ash, co- published with DC Comics in 1997. Another popular Event character was Painkiller Jane, who made her first appearance in 22 Brides #1 (1995). Originally a five-issue mini-series, Painkiller Jane went on to star in numerous crossover books with the likes of Punisher, The Darkness, Darkchylde, Vampirella, and Hellboy. In 1997, Event launched Crimson Plague, the first creator-owned comic by popular veteran cartoonist George P√©rez. Originally intended as a six-issue mini-series about an alien with ultra-toxic blood, P√©rez produced only one issue. (He later temporarily revived the title with Image Comics in 2000.) Other Event Comics titles included Thrax (1996), the Kid Death & Fluffy Spring Break Special (1996), the Kid Death & Fluffy Halloween Special (1997), Legends of Kid Death & Fluffy (1997), and Here Come the Big People (1997). === Marvel Knights === In 1998, the Event Comics team was contracted by Marvel Comics to breathe new life into some of their second- tier characters. Under the designation of \\"Marvel Knights,\\" Palmiotti and Quesada were given creative control of Black Panther, Daredevil, The Punisher and The Inhumans. Event hired the creative teams for the line while Marvel published them, and in September 1998 the Marvel Knights imprint was born. As Marvel Knights editor, Quesada encouraged experimentation and used his contacts in the indie comics world to bring in new creators such as David W. Mack, Michael Avon Oeming, Brian Michael Bendis, Garth Ennis, and Steve Dillon. The Event Comics creative teams eventually produced popular, well- regarded Knights runs like Kevin Smith & Quesada's Daredevil and Christopher Priest's Black Panther. Once Marvel Knights was implemented back into Marvel proper, Quesada and Palmiotti returned to the Marvel fold, and Event Comics was shut down, the last comics published being Ash: Fire and Crossfire in January and March 1999, respectively. In 2000, Quesada ascended to the role of Marvel's editor-in-chief. As of June 2010, he is also Chief Creative Officer (CCO) of Marvel Entertainment; this double commitment led to Quesada stepping down as editor-in-chief in January 2011, saying: == Titles == * 22 Brides (1996) * Ash (1994) * Ash #¬Ω (co-published with Wizard magazine, 1997) * Ash/22 Brides(1996) * Ash: The Fire Within (1996) * Ash: Cinder & Smoke (1997) * Ash: Fire And Crossfire (1999) * Ash Files (1997) * Crimson Plague (1997) * Here Come the Big People (1997) * Kid Death & Fluffy Halloween Special (1997) * Kid Death & Fluffy Spring Break Special (1996) * Legends of Kid Death & Fluffy (1997) * Painkiller Jane (1997) * Thrax (1996) === Crossover === * Azrael/Ash (co-published with DC Comics, 1997) * Painkiller Jane vs. The Darkness (co-published with Top Cow Productions, 1997) * Painkiller Jane/Darkchylde (co-published with Image Comics, 1998) * Painkiller Jane/Hellboy (co-published with Dark Horse Comics, 1998) * Vampirella/Painkiller Jane (co-published with Harris Comics, 1998) == Creators associated with Event Comics == * Joe Quesada ‚Äì co-founder * Jimmy Palmiotti ‚Äì co-founder * Brian Augustyn * Trace Beaulieu * John Cebollero * Amanda Conner * Garth Ennis * Scott Lee * Rick Parker * George P√©rez * Humberto Ramos * James Robinson * Dave Ross * Mark Waid ==ReferencesEvent Comics at Who's Who in American Comic Books Category:Comic book publishing companies of the United States Category:Defunct comics and manga publishing companies Category:Publishing companies established in 1994 Category:1994 establishments in Illinois Category:Companies based in Chicago ","title":"Event Comics"},{"id":"19324082","text":"Antirrhinum nuttallianum (syn.

He spent the majority of his soccer career in North America, primarily playing for clubs in Canada. Thomas' greatest achievements were spent with the Toronto Lynx, and the Toronto Olympians, where he won a league title and two Open Canada Cups with the Olympians; he was also awarded the Canadian Professional Soccer League MVP Award. Internationally, Thomas has represented Canada at the senior level, by being capped a total of three times. He is first CPSL player to be called up for the national team, while playing in the league. ==Club career== Thomas began playing soccer during his tenure at the University of Hartford. During his four-year tenure at Hartford Thomas' accomplishments were being named All-New England and First Team All-Conference in 1993 and 1994, and serving captain in both those seasons. Also helped the Hawks earn a spot on the All-Conference Championship postseason team in 1991, 1992, and 1994. He was the Championship MVP in 1992. Upon graduating from Hartford Thomas was drafted by the Connecticut Wolves of the USISL Select League in 1996. The following season the USISL Select League merged with the A-League, which resulted in Thomas returning to his hometown to sign with the newly expansion franchise Toronto Lynx. The signing of Thomas was announced in a press conference where the Lynx unveiled their roster for their debut season. Thomas made his debut on April 12, 1997 in a match against Jacksonville Cyclones, where he made history by scoring the franchise's first goal; unfortunately the match ended in 3-1 defeat. On May 3 Thomas in a match against the Worcester Wildfire Thomas contributed by scoring the second goal in a 3-1 victory, which marked the first victory for the Toronto side. Thomas would continue his fine form by recording another goal in a 3-0 victory over the Richmond Kickers on May 11. He helped the Lynx to set a franchise and A-league record of ten straight wins; their streak came to an end with a 1-0 defeat to Long Island Rough Riders on June 22. He finished his rookie season with six goals that helped the Lynx clinch a playoff spot. During the club's playoff run Thomas started in the first leg of the semi-final match against the Montreal Impact where the Lynx were defeated 2-1. Unfortunately for the Lynx they were defeated 4-0 in the second leg of the semi-final match, which resulted in a 6-1 victory on aggregate for Montreal. In 1998 Thomas recorded his first goal of the season in a 2-1 defeat to his former club Connecticut. On August 26 the Toronto Lynx traded Thomas to rivals Montreal Impact for future considerations and an undisclosed amount of cash. In Montreal Thomas appeared in only three matches and led the Impact to the Conference Semi-finals. In the post season, Thomas recorded two goals for the Impact in the Eastern Conference semifinals against Rochester Rhinos. Thomas left Montreal in September 1999, when new ownership opted against fielding an outdoor squad in order to properly prepare for the 1999-2000 indoor season. Resulting in Thomas to sign with the Toronto Olympians of the Canadian Professional Soccer League. He made his debut on June 6, 1999 against York Region Shooters where he even managed to score two goals in a 7-1 victory. During the 1999 season, he was instrumental in leading his club to the Treble, and setting a league record by becoming the first CPSL franchise to finish the season undefeated. The season was a productive one for Thomas, as he scored 25 goals in all competitions. In doing so he led the Olympians to their first Rogers Cup triumph, where he scored the opening goal in a 2-0 victory over Toronto Croatia on October 2 in the CPSL playoff finals match. Thomas was further instrumental during Toronto's quest to claim their second consecutive Open Canada Cup. In the tournament Thomas contributed by registering five goals that led the Scarborough side to the finals, where their opponents were Toronto Croatia. During the finals the Olympians were leading the match with a one-goal lead, until Thomas struck two stunning goals to allow the match to culminate to a 3-0 victory. Once the season came to a conclusion Thomas was named the CPSL MVP Award. Due to a sensational debut season he received his first cap for the national side and was part of the winning team in the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup. During the 2000 season, Thomas was again instrumental in Toronto's exceptionally successful campaign; together with the likes of Gus Kouzmanis, Eddy Berdusco, and Darren Tilley, Thomas led the Olympians to a 10-game undefeated streak, as well as claiming the Open Canada Cup in the process. The victory in claiming the Open Cup marked the first time in league history a club winning the trophy three consecutive years in a row. Thomas was responsible for scoring the lone goal that would clinch the title for the Scarborough-based club, in a 1-0 victory over St. Catharines Roma Wolves. Thomas finished the season with nine goals placing him third in most goals scored for the Olympians. Though he did manage to lead his team to the playoff finals, they were defeated by Toronto Croatia by a score of 2-1. Shortly after the season Thomas announced a leave of absence in order to pursue a career in teaching. He made his return to soccer a year later when he returned to the A-League to sign with his former club Toronto Lynx. Thomas was signed on April 20, 2002 in a press conference held by the Lynx. He scored his first goal of the season on April 27, 2002 in a 2-1 victory over Hampton Roads Mariners. He nearly helped the Lynx make the playoffs, where the Lynx required a victory in the final game of season against Atlanta Silverbacks, but unfortunately the match resulted in a tie for the Lynx, which allowed Charlotte Eagles to clinch the final playoff berth. On March 18, 2003 the Toronto Lynx re-signed Thomas to a one-year contract. Thomas concluded the season with two goals, but unfortunately the Lynx failed to reach the post season for the third year straight. As his contract expired at the end of season, Thomas played the remainder of the season in the CPSL with Vaughan Sun Devils. He made his debut on September 12, 2003 against Hamilton Thunder. He helped secure a postseason berth by finishing third in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs he contributed a goal in a 4-3 victory over Toronto Supra. Vaughan reached the CPSL Championship final against Brampton Hitmen, but Thomas didn't feature in the match. After the 2003 season he retired from professional soccer in order to continue on teaching. In 2006 it was announced that Thomas was inducted into the University of Hartford Hall of Fame. Thomas had a stint in the National Professional Soccer League with the short lived expansion franchise the Toronto ThunderHawks during the 2000-2001 winter indoor season. He helped the ThunderHawks reach the postseason by finishing second in the National Conference, and reached the Conference finals where they were defeated by the Milwaukee Wave. ==International career== He made his debut for Canada in an October 1999 CONCACAF Gold Cup qualification match against Haiti and went on to earn a total of 3 caps, scoring no goals. He was in Canada's title-winning squad at the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup, but did not play himself. His final international was a January 2000 friendly match against Bermuda. ==Coaching career== He now works for Neil McNeil Catholic Secondary School as a Cooperative Education teacher.He also works as a soccer coach for Pickering FC.Soccer Maroons prepare to test playoff mettle - The MirrorElvis Thomas Soccer Coach, Neil McNeil High School - Fan590 ==HonorsCanada=== *CONCACAF Gold Cup (1): 2000 ===Toronto Olympians=== *CPSL Championship (1): 1999 *Open Canada Cup (2): 1999, 2000 *Canadian Professional Soccer League Regular Season Champions (2): 1999, 2000 ===Individual=== *Canadian Professional Soccer League MVP: 1999 ==References *Player profile - CanadaSoccer * Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Scarborough, Toronto Category:Soccer people from Ontario Category:Association football midfielders Category:Black Canadian sportspeople Category:Canadian soccer players Category:Canada men's international soccer players Category:Canadian Professional Soccer League (1998‚Äì2005) players Category:CONCACAF Gold Cup-winning players Category:Connecticut Wolves players Category:Hartford Hawks men's soccer players Category:Toronto (Mississauga) Olympians players Category:Toronto Lynx players Category:Montreal Impact (1992‚Äì2011) players Category:USL A-League players Category:Toronto ThunderHawks players Category:York Region Shooters players Category:National Professional Soccer League (1984‚Äì2001) players ","title":"Elvis Thomas"},{"id":"19324100","text":"The Northwest Aeronautical Institute () is an aviation school located in Tijuana, Mexico.

As the founder and supporter of the Ratcliffe Aerodrome, Sir Lindsay was a pioneer aviator, knighted for his crucial efforts in World War II with the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA). He controlled Everards Brewery for nearly 25 years and was a member of parliament. ==Pioneer Aviator== Wartime aviation has changed the course of history and Sir Lindsay Everard is an important contributor to its development. In 1930, Sir Lindsay opened Ratcliffe Aerodrome on near his estate and Ratcliffe College. He had become President of the Leicester Aeroclub in 1928, purchasing the club a de Havilland Gipsy Moth in 1929. Named \\"The Quorn\\", the club used Carts Field at Desford. A large air show brought 30,000 spectators to the site. Sir Lindsay purchased a de Havilland Puss Moth that he named \\"The Leicestershire\\", and sold in July 1932. He also favoured the Percival Gull Four P.1.B Mk. IIa.The Percival \\"Gull\\" G-ACGR of the Air & Space museum of Brussels Ratcliffe Aerodrome opened with a 'Grand Air Pageant' on 6 September 1930. Famed aviator Amy Johnson made an unexpected trip from London to participate with Sir Sefton Brancker, Director of Civil Aviation. Some 5000 spectators were treated to a show with 100 planes and staged bombings of Chinese pirates. There was one crash, but no one was killed. Ratcliffe Aerodrome was one of the finest in civil aviation with a comfortable clubhouse and an outdoor pool. The hangars were first-class and the many air shows and displays had the atmosphere of a garden party. Sir Lindsay was not a pilot himself, but hired personal pilots to travel throughout the world and participate in air racing events. He owned a de Havilland Dragon, an 8-seat aircraft, with which they won the Oasis Trophy in Cairo. With pilot Lt. Com. Phillips he won the Grosvenor Cup air race. Among his personal pilots were Winifred Spooner, a celebrated woman aviator, and Albert Codling, Sir Lindsay's Chief Inspector responsible for the maintenance of all his aircraft.http://austerhg.org/books. Sir Lindsay was supportive of every aspect of aviation, including gliders. He was the first president of the Model Aero Club. His airmail postage stamp collection was sold by H.R. Harmer of London on 19 and 20 October 1953 in 530 lots. The County Flying Club was formed at Ratcliffe and in 1938 moved to a field at Rearsby on land owned by Sir Lindsay. Another member of the County Flying Club, Alexander Lance Wykes, was the managing director of Crowthers Limited, a Thurmaston company, that manufactured textile machinery. In 1938, Wykes negotiated a licence agreement with American manufacturer Taylorcraft to build a light aeroplane in England. It was designated the Taylorcraft \\"Plus C\\" model and the first one built was brought by road to Sir Lindsay's Aerodrome where it made its maiden flight on 3 May 1939. This aircraft became an important part of the war effort in World War II and a production order of 100 aircraft designated the Taylorcraft- Auster Mk 1 was placed in 1942. The Auster continued to be an important and popular plane long after the war.Auster Club With the onset of World War II, civil flying was suspended on 31 August 1939. Ratcliffe Aerodrome had a central location that made it an important field for the ATA, a network of civilian pilots that ferried new aircraft from the factories and those that needed repair. Ratcliffe Aerodrome was ferry pool no. 6 of the original 14 started in 1942.Air Transport Auxiliary The Aerodrome grew larger during the war, adding new facilities. Some 50,000 ferry flights passed through this ideal staging ground. When the ATA was disbanded, the event was commemorated by an air show on 6 October 1945 that included Geoffrey de Havilland. Sir Lindsay was knighted during the war for services to aviation and commerce. The Leicester Aeroclub reformed in 1947 and drew a crowd of 10,000 for an event in 1949. Sir Lindsay died that year and his estate was sold to non-flyers. Ratcliffe Aerodrome closed on 25 March 1950. It fell into disrepair with some of the buildings being used as barns for the surrounding farms. ==Career and Philanthropy== Sir Lindsay took over the business of Everards Brewery in 1925 and remained in that position until his death in 1949. Everards was founded in 1849 by William Everard, was managed by his son Thomas, and then Sir Lindsay. The brewery specialises in ales and has more than 150 pubs around Leicestershire. The brewery was in Burton upon Trent when Sir Lindsay was in control. His son Tony Everard ran the business from 1949 to 1988 and saw the business move back to Leicester. Sir Lindsay was elected High Sheriff of Leicestershire in 1924.Leicestershire Government That same year (and in 1929, 1931, and 1935) Sir Lindsay was elected the Member of Parliament for Melton as a Conservative. In 1924 he also played a first-class cricket match for Leicestershire.CricketArchive: William Everard Sir Everard offered wide support to the community of Leicestershire. His contributions of land and resources to the nascent civil flying clubs in the area are detailed above. In 1927, Sir Lindsay acquired Ulverscroft Priory, a mid-13th century Augustinian house, preserving the decaying ruins from total destruction. In 1930, Sir Lindsay built Bradgate Hall to replace the wooden restaurant used for village events.Leicestershire Villages ==Personal== Sir William Lindsay Everard was born on 13 March 1891 in Knighton, Leicester and attended Harrow School and Trinity College Cambridge. He resided in Ratcliffe Hall in Ratcliffe on the Wreake and was the owner of two Bentley motor cars including reference SB2754 which was delivered new to Sir Lindsay in 1929. Sir Lindsay married Cornelia Ione Kathleen Beresford-Armstrong, Lady Everard, daughter of Captain Marcus Beresford-Armstrong. Their children included Patrick Anthony William Beresford Everard and Bettyne Ione and granddaughters Lady Denyne Butler. Sir Lindsay died on 11 March 1949 in Torquay, Devon, aged 57. ==Sources== *Ratcliffe Aerodrome History at Ratcliffe College. *Leicestershire Aero Club *Everards Brewery *The Story of the Air Transport Auxiliary.

Players assume the role of a robot operator destined to earn the highest operator rank. To do so, the robot ‚Äì known in the game as a Heavy DOLL ‚Äì must complete a combat training camp which prompts the 2D Platformer stages. The player then must combat other Heavy DOLLs as the end-level bosses which prompts the 2D fighting elements. A sequel, Black Hole Assault, was released in 1992. ==Story== Sometime in Earth's future, it came to mankind's realization that the Earth's natural resources were starting to decline, but despite every nation's attempts, the Earth's environment and resources continued thin. Suddenly, an alien race appeared in the Solar System. Hailing from the planet Akirov, the aliens had been observing Earth for centuries and arrived in order to save it. With their technological help, Earth's environment was replenished and Human's were able to travel deeper into space. By the year 2102, mankind was finally at peace thanks to the Akirovians. Ten years later, a plot to enslave mankind was discovered to be a part of the Akirovian's plans and a war waged between the two. Eight years later, the Akirovians lost and left the Solar System. The primary machines for Earth's victory came from original Akirovian designed machines: giant remote controlled robots first used to design and repair Earth's satellite and colony structures. The robots were favored as Earth's primary line of defense and were dubbed the Heavy D.O.L.L's (Defensive Offensive Lethal Liberator). Now taking place in 2120, the prospect of earning the highest combat ranking for a Heavy D.O.L.L, the rank of Heavy Nova, has become a long desired military rank. The player assumes the role of such a person attempting to earn that rank who must go through training and combat situations to prove their abilities. ==Gameplay== Heavy Nova's Single Player game play is separated into two sections: a Platformer section and a Fighting Game section. The player has to destroy every possible enemy robot in the Platformer sections and make it to the end in order to fight the boss awaiting them. The player has various attacks at their disposal with the Idar, most of which they were able to use during combat with the bosses in the Fighting Game stages. During the Fighting Game Stages/Boss Fights, the player had to defeat the boss using various Fighting Game attacks such as a button command that allowed missiles to launch from the Idar's hand. However, both Heavy D.O.L.L robots, player and enemy, has an energy bar under their health meter; the energy bar measures how much strength the player or enemy has in order to move their robot. Taking too much damage results in energy depletion. When the player's energy was depleted to two bars, the player robot cannot move, leaving the player completely vulnerable to enemy attacks. Alternatively, the 2 Player mode pitches two players against each other using all of the enemy robot models encountered in the game. ==Reception== Heavy Nova received very poor reviews. Mega said that \\"badly animated robots, appalling music and terribly unresponsive controls as much fun as colouring in each square on a piece of graph paper with a different pen... with a headache... listening to Max Bygraves.\\" Classic Game Room's Mark Bussler praised its intro cutscene, but called it \\"possibly the worst video game I've ever played\\", criticizing the clumsy controls, uninspired level design, and flawed collision detection that turns the boss fights into a matter of \\"simply mashing buttons and hoping for the best\\".Classic Game Room review, May 13, 2008 Entertainment Weekly gave the game a D+ and wrote that \\"Heavy Nova's high-stepping, stainless-steel robot hero may have a certain wacky appeal ‚Äî if Michael Jackson were the Terminator, this is what his skeleton would look like ‚Äî but it also has the most ponderous, difficult-to-master moves this side of a t'ai chi tournament.

The town is named after two cannons of historical importance and is close to the Diaz cross, erected five centuries ago by Bartholomeu Diaz, the first Portuguese ocean explorer to sail along the eastern coast of South Africa.Footprints On Our Land website Cannon Rocks is a major marker for weather forecasts for the coastal belt. It divides two coastal sections: Plettenberg Bay to Cannon Rocks; and Cannon Rocks to Kei Mouth.South African Weather bureau ==Geology== There are outcrops in the sea close to Cannon Rocks of a coastal marine formation, the Salnova Formation. This formation occurs about 20 metres above sea level and comprises calcrete with quartzitic sandstone boulders and shell material.SA National Parks website. ==Activities== Cannon Rocks is a great kitesurfing location. The town used host the yearly Cannon Rocks Kiteboarding Classic competition. Since dune movement on the car parking area it has been suspended. The major attraction is the unspoilt and uncrowded nature of the beaches, coupled to a stable and predictable south westerly and easterly wind which are both cross shore. These conditions are also enjoyed by Windsurfers. The town is a premier rock and surf angling destination with the site of lone anglers making their way down the unspoilt beaches a beautiful sight. There is a charter company (Big Blue) in town that takes visitors on deep sea angling, snorkeling or scuba diving excursions. There is a two-hour drive that takes visitors through the Golden Mile dairy farms on the spectacular cliffs overlooking Bird Island and the world's biggest coastal dune field. The road turns into the state forest where century old trees form a dense canopy over the road. The road ends in Alexandria, where it branches back over the mountain to Cannon Rocks. Two hiking trails begin in Cannon Rocks. The first (7 km) starts right at the western end of town at the Cannons and winds through the bush to a look-out over the coastal dunefield. It then goes back on the beach. It is advisable to wear a sun-hat and take water. The second trail is a two-day trail that can be booked through the Addo Elephant Park offices. ==Economy== Cannon Rocks is close to an area called \\"The Golden Mile\\" of dairy farming. It is a strip of land between the sea and the Woody Cape forest that is very well suited to dairy farming. This historically drove the development of the area. Recent price collusion between major milk-buying companies Clover, Parmalat and Woodlands have left the once prosperous farmers facing bleak futures, with herds reduced and many farmers opting for beef cattle.http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click;_id=13&art;_id=vn20080131062707253C825062 The economy of Cannon Rocks is primarily retirement housing, holiday houses and weekend visitors. The beaches are immaculately clean and safe due to the very low number of visitors and the fact that there is approximately 100 km of untouched bush and beaches to the west. Cannon Rocks does not have a retail outlet and residents and visitors buy basic commodities in Boknesstrand or Kenton-on-Sea. Basically the only commercial activity is the Post Office Agency.

The area is known for its distinctive agricultural landscape, a close-knit community life, and deep Roman Catholicism brought by Germans who began settling the region in the 1840s. The area has been studied as an example of chain migration. It has been called \\"The Holyland\\" since at least 1898. ==Location== The Holyland area is located in the region east of the southern end of Lake Winnebago and it crosses political boundaries. It is primarily in Fond du Lac and Calumet counties, with a small area in the northwest corner of Sheboygan County. Towns include Taycheedah, Calumet, and all of Marshfield in Fond du Lac County and Brothertown in Calumet County. Communities include Calvary, Charlesburg, Jericho, Johnsburg, Marytown,The History of Marytown, Wisconsin Mount Calvary, St. Anna, St. Cloud, St. Joe, and St. Peter. Eden, Wisconsin tries to consider themselves part of this region even though they are not.In Wisconsin's Holyland, they're keeping it holy ==HistoryOrigin=== Reverend Casper Rehrl was a missionary who founded Roman Catholic churches in the area. Between 1841 and 1870, ten German Catholic parishes were established in the Holyland. The church sites, which were mostly named after saints, eventually grew into communities. German- speaking Roman Catholics immigrated to the Holyland from the Vulkaneifel region of Rhenish Prussia in the late 19th century. Many of the immigrants came from the municipalities of Daun and Adenau. Smaller communities and hamlets in that area include Kaperich, Nitz, Kirsbach, and M√ºrlenbach. Because the area had limited land available, experienced periodic crop failures, and was undergoing changes to its industry, immigrants left to find better economic conditions. (archived) According to M. Beth Schlemper's translation of Joseph Mergen's work Die Amerika Auswanderung aus dem Landkreise Daun (The Emigration to America from the Daun Counties), \\"[In 1838], the yield of potatoes was only average in quantity. The wine harvest hardly reached a fourth of a usual, average year and was at the same time of poorer quality. The fruit completely failed\\". Land had been divided among heirs for so many generations that farms were too small to be viable. In another region of Prussia, Schleswig-Holstein, Denmark to the north was battling Prussia to the south in the 1840s. Emigrants from that area also found their way to the Holyland, especially in the area around New Holstein. Settlement in Wisconsin Former military road at Calumetville Immigrants began settling in Wisconsin in the 1830s. To get to Wisconsin, they typically traveled across the Atlantic Ocean to New York City, then up the Hudson River to the Erie Canal, and followed the Erie Canal across New York state to Buffalo. From Buffalo they traversed the Great Lakes to Wisconsin. Those who settled the Holyland traveled across forested land to a settlement in Calumetville. Calumetville's hotel had been established by George White in 1835. It was on the only road through the region, a north-south military road. White became friends with immigrant Ferdinand Ostenfeld, who described the poor conditions in his original homeland. White asked Ostenfeld to return to his original homeland with him in late 1847 to convince others to come to America. White later sold land to some of these immigrants. A ship left Prussia on April 2, 1848 carrying 198 passengers, with almost every passenger an immigrant from Prussia or Schleswig-Holstein. The group arrived in New York on May 12. Their Great Lakes vessel arrived in Sheboygan on May 22 and they arrived at Calumetville on May 25. A second settlement formed at Johnsburg, and within two years the group had founded a church called St. Johannes Gemeinde (German for St. John's Congregation, now St. John the Baptist). Johnsburg church historian Benjamin Blied said, \\"Most of [the immigrants], more or less antagonistic to being governed by Protestant Prussia ever since the defeat of Napoleon, left their homes along the Mosel River between Trier and Koblenz hoping primarily to better their economic condition in the new world.\\" Over the next few years, Johnsburg became the core for the growing area. A second wave of immigrants arrived in the 1860s and 1870s, some with families and friends from the first wave. The Capuchin religious order selected the Holyland for its first permanent American settlement. They founded a seminary (now St. Lawrence Seminary High School) in 1856 to train young men to become priests. Between 1841 and 1870, eleven parishes were founded in the Holyland. They were built as territorial churches to serve the people in the vicinity, not as national churches to serve immigrants of a particular ethnicity. The introduction of the Sheboygan-Fond du Lac Railroad helped develop the communities, but the railroad declined after trucking became more cost effective. ===Chain migration=== Chain migration is a process whereby early immigrants to an area send back information encouraging their relatives and friends to immigrate. An example is this letter from Michael Rodenkirch from December 26, 1846, Another influential item was Carl de Haas's 1848 report Nordamerika, Wisconsin, Calumet: Winke f√ºr Auswanderer (Calumet, Wisconsin, North America: A Prospect for Emigrants) which was published in Elberfeld, Germany. After living in Calumet (now Calumetville) for six months, he prefaced the report, \\"Upon my departure from Germany I faithfully promised friends and acquaintances that I would send them within the year, a complete report of my observations during the journey from Elberfeld, Germany to Calumet, Wisconsin, and particularly of my experiences here.\\" His account included detailed information for those considering immigrating, including provisions to bring along, conditions in Wisconsin, travel advice, and description of the land and wildlife. He described which ships to take from Germany and how to purchase and use farmland after arrival in Wisconsin. ===Museum=== The history of the Holyland region is preserved in the Malone Area Heritage Museum. The museum is located in two buildings in Malone. One of these buildings was the train depot for the community; it is the only remaining depot left from the railroad that is not being used as a commercial structure. Malone, originally named St. John, was renamed after railroad official H. T. Malone. ==References== Category:Geography of Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin Category:Geography of Calumet County, Wisconsin Category:Geography of Sheboygan County, Wisconsin Category:German communities in the United States Category:German-American culture in Wisconsin Category:Regions of Wisconsin Category:Populated places established in 1841 ","title":"The Holyland (Wisconsin)"},{"id":"19324278","text":"Route 145 is a circuitous south-north urban state highway in Massachusetts.

The raid lasted from about the end of September 1863 to the end of November 1863. The primary area of operation during this expeditionary raid, was the central Indian Ocean, across the Tropic of Capricorn, steaming east toward the Dutch East Indies. == Raid overview == CSS Alabama worked its way east from the Cape of Good Hope through rough weather, passing the islands of St. Peter Island and St. Paul Island in the Indian Ocean, which are about halfway to the Strait of Sunda. Alabama crossed the Tropic of Capricorn and conferred with the captain of an English bark, learning that USS Wyoming, a Union steamer, was patrolling in the Strait of Sunda with a tender, and anchored nightly at Krakatoa Island. Many of the ships intercepted during this period were English or Dutch ships. However, on November 6, Alabamas captain, Semmes, learned from an English ship out of Foochow that Winged Racer, escorted by USS Wyoming was coming out of the strait. Alabama pursued and overhauled two English ships before coming upon Amanda, out of Boston, laden with sugar and hemp. Semmes and crew set Amanda alight by 10:00 pm. Getting underway for the Strait of Sunda, Alabama sailed past Keyser Island, Beezee island and Sowbooks Island, and then passed through the strait, on to Thwart-the-Way Island and Stroom Rock, not finding USS Wyoming. However, on November 8, amidst a rain squall, Alabama sighted sail and chased down the unescorted Winged Racer. The crew and master were put in boats to row ashore to nearby land at North Island, and Winged Racer was burnt. CSS Alabama then proceeded toward the China Sea, passing Sumatra and Java, and arrived in Gasper Strait. Around daylight, new sail was sighted, and a Yankee clipper headed toward Alabama only to find the Confederate flag unfurled when Captain Semmes hoisted a change of colors. The clipper added topsails, and opened chase. The clipper Contest encountered a slack in the wind during the midday qualms, which allowed Alabama to bring the ship within gun range. To the regret of Captain Semmes, he could not capture the new prize and outfit her for service in the Confederate Navy, and so he reluctantly burnt her. From this raiding area in the Dutch East Indies, CSS Alabama returned, via Singapore, to the Strait of Malacca. ==Raid bounty== {  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" + CSS Alabamas Indian Ocean Expeditionary Raid !

The kangaroo industry is based on the harvesting of the large species of kangaroos, which are abundant and are sustainably harvested in Australia under strict government control.Conserving the Kangaroo Many professional ecologists support this industry on the basis that it delivers significant environmental benefits.The Kangaroo Industry - Environmental Impact Many argue kangaroos, which are native to Australia, are a more environmentally friendly livestock option than introduced sheep and cattle.FATE Program ==Products== Kangaroo meat is consumed in Australia and available in some Australian supermarkets. It is also exported to over 55 countries. Kangaroo leather is recognised as the strongest lightweight leather throughout the world and extensively used in first class sporting shoes and gloves.Enhancing the Unique Properties of Kangaroo Leather ==Kangaroo populations== Of the 48 species of macropods (kangaroos) in Australia, only six can be commercially harvested. Over 99% of the commercial kangaroo harvest occurs in the arid grazing rangelands. The populations of kangaroos in these areas are estimated every year in each State by well-developed aerial survey techniques. These are sparsely timbered, savannah-type ecosystems; hence, it is possible to fly over them and count the large animals, such as kangaroos, seen. Using either low-flying fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters, flying at heights of two to 300 meters, the National Parks authorities count the numbers of kangaroos seen over fixed transects. Thirty years of such monitoring have allowed them to develop sophisticated and accurate techniques of extrapolating out to total population numbers.Commercial kangaroo harvesting fact sheet Kangaroos are one of only a very few species (including humans) which have an annual census of their populations. Current populations stand around 45 million. Within the rangelands, kangaroos are now more common than prior to European settlement. This situation has arisen due to the increased food and water supply generated by the activities of the sheep and cattle industry. Prior to European settlement, these areas had very few places of surface water from which kangaroos could drink. The pastoral industry has tapped into below- ground water supplies to the point where now very few points in the rangelands are further than 3 km from a permanent water source and no point is further than 10 km.Landsburg, J (1999). The effects of artificial sources of water on rangeland biodiversity. CSIRO Div. Wildlife and Ecology, Biodiversity Technical Paper no 3 ==The harvest quota setting process== For any kangaroo species to be harvested, the State's National Parks authority must have a detailed management plan approved by the federal conservation department. These plans must detail the population monitoring and quota-setting controls and the controls over the take, and they must be renewed every five years. Each year after the population estimate is obtained, each management plan will set a maximum allowable take (quota) of between 10 and 20% of total population. The State's authority will then issue individually and sequentially numbered plastic lockable tags. These tags are designed to ensure, once properly applied, any tampering with them will be perfectly obvious. Populations fluctuate seasonally. Some evidence suggests a correlation between droughts and population decline.http://www.southwestnrm.org.au/ihub/effect-drought-kangaroo- populations Each kangaroo taken by licensed harvesters must have such a tag fixed to it and the harvester and processor must report back to the authorities on a monthly basis the details of the exact number of the tags they have used, where the tags were used, and what species, sex and weight of animal to which they were attached. The authority monitors the release and use of tags to ensure the harvest in any one area does not exceed the quota. The complexity and detail of the controls in the management plans can be indicated by a brief examination of the NSW plan. It divides the State into 15 different zones, 14 in which commercial kangaroo harvesting is allowed and one comprising over one-third of the State in which no harvesting can take place. The population is estimated in each individual zone and a harvest quota allocated to it. An appropriate number of tags are then issued to the conservation authority managers in each zone, and these can only be obtained by kangaroo harvesters on two days of each month. The harvester must use and submit reports for all tags issued before more can be obtained, and the issue of tags by zone is closely monitored. As soon as the harvest in any one zone approaches the quota, it is closed to commercial activity for the rest of the year.Kangaroo Management Program ==Licensing controls over kangaroo harvesters== To purchase the tags issued by the authorities, kangaroo harvesters must be licensed as such. To do so, they must undergo training delivered by government-accredited agencies and approved by the Australian Tertiary and Further Education agency in the appropriate State. This training covers the regulatory controls and compliance requirements, the animal welfare controls, and the hygiene controls to which each harvester must adhere. They must then pass assessment in their knowledge and practices relating to these controls by two separate government departments. This will include assessment of their competency with their firearms. Only then will they be able to obtain the required licenses from the two authorities concerned. The kangaroo harvesters' licenses are conditional on adherence to the guidelines laid out in the federal ‚ÄòCode of Practice for the Humane Shooting of Kangaroos‚Äô. This specifies the minimum high-caliber firearms which can be used, and requires all animals to be head-shot, and documents procedures for the humane dispatch of any pouch young.National codes of practice (commercial and non-commercial) for the humane shooting of kangaroos and wallabies Any kangaroo or kangaroo product accepted by processors, be it for meat or skins, must have an approved tag applied to it and be supplied by a licensed harvester. Each processor must report on a monthly basis to the State authority the numbers of kangaroos purchased, from whom, and the relevant tags numbers. ==Environmental effects of using kangaroos== The kangaroo management plans have been operating under strict and intensive supervision for almost 30 years. Over this period, the average harvest per year has been in excess of 2 million animals. ===Population sustainability=== Despite long-term harvests in excess of 2 million animals per year, the kangaroo population has consistently increased. Even following the worst drought on record (2005‚Äì07), numbers in 2008 are still at what could be considered historically typical levels. Their current population of 25 million is only marginally lower than the 25-year average of 26.7 million (which is skewed by the very high levels reached during a run of highly favorable years in the late 1990s). A project conducted by NSW Department of Agriculture, which employed extensive field study and highly sophisticated computer modeling techniques, has cast light on why kangaroo populations are so resilient to harvesting. The project examined harvester activity and modeled it in response to terrain and prices paid for kangaroos harvested. It demonstrated, in the areas investigated and at current prices, 20-40% of any one property will rarely be visited by a kangaroo harvester because the terrain is too rough or other limitations make it not economic to do so. These areas then become ‚Äòrefugia‚Äô areas, in which the resident kangaroo population is never harvested and from which the population expands to repopulate areas which are harvested.Kangaroo Management Options in the Murray-Darling Basin. 2004. Ron Hacker, Steve McLeod, John Druhan, Brigitte Tenhumberg & Udai Pradhan. Murray-Darling Basin Commission and NSW Agriculture. MDBC Publication number: 02/04 The authors conclude: ‚ÄúModels presented here suggest that kangaroo populations may be more resilient to harvesting than we had previously thought‚Äù. ===Effects on the species=== The argument is often mounted that kangaroo harvesting selects the largest animals and will therefore affect the genetic fitness of the species. The scientific data strongly refute this argument. Four reports have recently provided evidence to contest these claims. *An examination of a question submitted to the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service in 2001 concluded: :‚ÄúCurrently, there is no evidence of real or potential genetic ‚Äòdeterioration‚Äô due to harvesting, nor any reason to suspect it. Indeed, indications are that kangaroo numbers would have to be reduced to extremely low levels for genetic impacts to become important and by then other impacts, such as demographic disruption, would be overridingly important‚Äù.Situation Analysis Report: Current State of Scientific Knowledge on Kangaroos in the Environment, Including Ecological and Environmental Impact and Effect of Culling. *A report into factors affecting genetic makeup in kangaroos by the University of Queensland concluded: :‚ÄúThe effects of the commercial harvest are therefore unlikely to produce genetic changes in the population. First, the heritability of the characters in question is low. Second, the selection differential is low because differences in fitness between younger and older adult males is small, older males do not appear to monopolise matings, only a small proportion of older males are selected against (so most animals are in the selected group), and only a small proportion of the population is harvested.‚ÄùKangaroo Genetics, Impacts of Harvesting *A study of Queensland kangaroo populations harvested at rates of 0 to 30% has shown no differences in the genetic diversity of the various populations. That is, intensively harvested populations show no reductions in genetic diversity compared to unharvested ones.Pople 1996 This study also cites information showing virtual uniformity of genetic codes across widely dispersed kangaroo populations, suggesting the extensive harvesting to date has had no effect on the species. *A study conducted by the NSW Department of Agriculture has applied extremely sophisticated computer modeling techniques to kangaroo population‚Äôs dynamics. It has demonstrated, even after several hundred years of intensive harvesting, there would be no impact on the genetic makeup of the population, a large cause of this being there are always areas of rugged terrain in which kangaroos are never harvested (refugia) and migration of animals and their genetic material out of these areas offsets any selection which may occur through harvesting. ==Environmental impacts of not using kangaroos== Several trials have indicated uncontrolled kangaroo numbers present a risk to plant biodiversity. Kangaroos can not be commercially harvested in National Parks; as a result, their numbers often rise to excessive levels which sometimes require culling programs to be used. In biodiversity monitoring done following a cull at Hattah-Kulkyne National Park in Victoria, increased abundance of 20 rare or threatened plant species was recorded in areas where kangaroo were culled compared with control areas (Sluiter et al. 1997).Sluiter, I., Allen, G., Morgan, D. and Walker, I. (1997) Vegetation responses to stratified kangaroo grazing at Hattah-Kulkyne National Park, 1992-96. Dept. Natural Resource, Melb ==Animal welfare== All kangaroos taken for commercial use are harvested by professional shooters. State and federal government controls ensure that no kangaroo can enter the commercial industry unless it has been taken by a licensed kangaroo harvester who has passed an accredited training course, which includes training in the animal welfare aspects of kangaroo harvesting. In addition, anyone wishing to harvest kangaroos for human consumption must undergo assessment of their accuracy with their firearms. The accreditation and competency assessment are controlled by state government regulations in each State. In 2017, an environmental documentary titled, Kangaroo: A Love Hate Story, was released in Australia. The film details the bizarre relationship between the marsupial and the Australian public, how even though they are used as the symbol for the country, they are seen as nothing but an over populated pest. In particular, it stands with the kangaroos, and sheds light on the unethical and often violent treatment of the animals within the kangaroo industry. ==Kangaroo use and a new ecological model== To date, agricultural development in Australia has largely been based on modified European systems, using European animals. In recent decades, this Eurocentric view has come under academic question. Some believe that Australians should develop management systems adapted to the specific environmental conditions, not impose systems adapted to Europe. Under this philosophy, use of free- ranging populations of native animals adapted to the environment makes environmental sense. To this end, the University of New South Wales has implemented a new project aimed at encouraging the development of farm enterprises based on using native plants and animals (specifically kangaroos). The project intends to monitor the environment benefits that accrue from doing so. ==Kangaroos and global warming== Kangaroos emit small amounts of methane compared to domestic livestock. Cattle and sheep do so in large volumes, and methane is 21 times worse than carbon dioxide as a global warming gas. The beef industry alone is estimated to account for 11% of Australia‚Äôs carbon emissions.Native Wildlife on Rangelands to Minimize Methane and Produce Lower- emission Meat: Kangaroos Versus Livestock ==References== Category:Agriculture in Australia Category:Hunting in Australia Category:Industry in Australia Category:Macropods ","title":"Kangaroo industry"},{"id":"19324513","text":"Comendite at Lookout 589 in the Glass House Mountains Comendite is a hard, peralkaline igneous rock, a type of light blue grey rhyolite.

The primary area of operation during this expeditionary raid, was the southern Pacific Ocean, steaming east and then turning back west toward the Strait of Malacca. ==Raid overview== CSS Alabama passed the Karimata Strait and reached Pulo Condore, anchoring in the western harbor north of White Rock on December 2, 1863. After a few weeks of steaming, she headed back toward Singapore, anchoring at Pulo Aor on December 19. Arriving in the Strait of Malacca on December 24, Captain Semmes overtook the English vessel Martaban before spotting Texan Star, which Alabama captured and burned.

The estate is southeast of Aberystwyth, and has been in the possession of the Vaughan family since 1200.Trawsgoed Estate The Vaughans are descended from Collwyn ap Tangno, founder of the fifth noble tribe of North Wales, Lord of Eifionydd, Ardudwy, and part of Ll≈∑n, who had his residence on the site of Harlech Castle.The History of the Princes, the Lords Marcher, and the Ancient Nobility of Powys Fadog, and the Ancient Lords of Arwystli, Cedewen, and Meirionydd The land falls within the ancient parish of Llanafan,Vision of Britain in the upper division of the hundred of Ilar. In Wales, an ancient parish was a village or group of villages or hamlets and the adjacent lands. Originally they held ecclesiastical functions, but from the sixteenth century they also acquired civil roles. The parish may have been established as an ecclesiastical parish. Originally a medieval administrative unit, after 1597 ecclesiastical units were separated from civil parishes to serve the ecclesiastical needs of the local community.Ancient Parishes of Britain The Trawsgoed estate extended over 22 Cardiganshire parishes, including Llanafan.Morgan, Gerald. A Welsh House and its Family: the Vaughans of Trawsgoed (Crosswood) 1999 The community of Trawsgoed has a population of 989 (2011) and includes the villages of Llanafan and Llanfihangel-y-Creuddyn. ==History of ownership== The estate and mansion of Trawsgoed came into the Vaughan family by the marriage of Adda Fychan with Tudo, daughter and heiress of Ifan Goch of Trawsgoed, ‚ÄòEvan the Red'. The founder of the modern estate was the parliamentarian and lawyer, Sir John Vaughan, who was made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas by Charles II. It was Sir John Vaughan who acquired from the Earl of Essex much of the former monastic lands of the Cistercian abbey Strata Florida. At the same time further land was added to the estate through his marriage to Jane Stedman, daughter of John Stedman of Ystrad Fflur and Cilcennin. The estate has been passed down in the landed family from father to son in a direct line since it was acquired by marriage in 1200. The Vaughans are one of the few aristocratic families who have retained possession of a house since first taking it on in the Middle Ages. Trawsgoed became an estate in the English sense of the word in the 16th century. Strata Florida Abbey, in the centre of Wales, was given to the 1st Earl of Essex to broker during the English Reformation and dissolution of the monasteries, and he sold much of it to the Stedman family. Sir John Vaughan married the Stedman heiressAnnals and Antiquities of the Counties and County Families of Wales: Stedmans of Strata Florida and his brother, Henry, her sister. So almost all the abbey estate was taken over by the Vaughans. In 1695, John Vaughan of Trawsgoed, the grandson of Sir John Vaughan, was created Viscount Lisburne in the peerage of Ireland. during the Civil War he married Malet, daughter of the poet and courtier, the Earl of Rochester, and granddaughter of the Cavalier, Sir Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester, the victor of the Battle of Roundway Down. The Vaughan family was granted the title Earl of Lisburne in 1776 and remained at Trawsgoed mansion over successive generations. The family at one time owned estates in Northumberland and at Mamhead in Devon. In 1947 the mansion house became the headquarters of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Wales, and the home farm is still occupied by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and managed by the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research (IGER). ==Grounds== In 1873, the Vaughan's estate acreage at Trawsgoed was the largest in Cardiganshire at as listed in the government return of landowners. Sir Pryse Pryse of Gogerddan held 28,684, W.T.R. Powell of Nanteos held 21,933, John Waddingham of Hafod held .Ceredigion, A Wealth of History, p. 198 The Vaughan family has for many years worshiped at St Afan's Church, Llanafan, that lies within the estate. It was chosen as a special stage in the British Rally from 2006 to 2008. ==Trawsgoed Mansion== River Ystwyth near Trawsgoed Trawsgoed Mansion is a 17th-century country house, also known as Crosswood Park, formerly the seat of the Earl of Lisburne. It is a Grade II* listed building. It was Ernest George Henry, the 6th Earl of Lisburne, who added the 50-room Victorian wing to the old Georgian mansion and built the summerhouse, squash and tennis courts, and the ornamental fountain. He also had the library ceiling painted in the style of those at Windsor Castle. The house eventually included seventy rooms, gardens with rare Chilean and Himalayan tree species that thrive in the mild moist climate of coastal Wales, a stable block, lodge house, and an unencumbered view of the Cambrian Mountains. There are the remains of a small Roman fort adjoining the grounds. The mansion was sold in 2007 to the Edwards family, who spent five years restoring the house. Their work on Trawsgoed was featured on the television show The Restoration Man in 2010. The house was put up for sale in 2012. The Vaughan family owns over of the original estate that includes upland pastures, Common Land and farmland on and adjoining Cors Caron. The estate lets shooting rights over and adjoining Forestry Commission woodlands and fishing rights on the River Ystwyth and Teifi. The house is set in listed parkland and gardens and is southeast of Aberystwyth. The last remaining Vaughan member to be in residence at the house was the Honourable John Edward Malet Vaughan, born 3 Oct 1952. He is the youngest child of John David Malet Vaughan, 8th Earl of Lisburne and Shelagh Macauley. Formerly a Director of Savills, John Vaughan is the Managing Director of Trawsgoed Estates, Ltd.Trawsgoed Estates, Ltd. ==Lisburne Mines== The Trawsgoed estate was home to the Lisburne (Lead) Mines, one of the most profitable in all of Wales. In the 1880s, Trawsgoed had the second largest lead mine in Britain.Second Largest Lead Mines in Britain The mineral rights extend over an extensive area and are still owned by the estate. ==Notable neighbours== The estate shares a border along the River Ystwyth with that of the Hafod estate and Nanteos. ==Climate== The Met Office operates a Weather Station at Trawsgoed, providing climate data for the surrounding area. Trawsgoed experiences an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfb) similar to almost all of Wales and the United Kingdom. This translates to a narrow range of temperatures, rainfall in all seasons and low sunshine levels. Recent temperature extremes vary from during July 2006, down to during January 2010. Typically, just over 48 nights of the year will record an air frost, and at least 1mm of rain will be reported on 169 days. Trawsgoed holds the record for the UK's hottest November day, 22.4 ¬∞C on 1 November 2015. It also holds the record for the UK‚Äôs warmest February day, 20.6 ¬∞C on 25 February 2019. ==NotesReferences== * Crosswood Deeds, estate and family records 1527‚Äì1939 of Vaughan of Trawsgoed, later Earls of Lisburne.

In Norse mythology, Sumarr (Old Norse \\"Summer\\"Orchard (1997:154).) and Vetr (Old Norse \\"Winter\\"Orchard (1997:174).) are personified seasons. Sumarr and Vetr, personified, are attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both, the two are given genealogies, while in the Prose Edda the two figure into a number of kennings used by various skalds. ==Attestations== Winter in Blefjell, Norway. ===Poetic Edda=== In the stanza 26 of the Poetic Edda poem Vaf√ær√∫√∞nism√°l, the god Odin (disguised as \\"Gagnr√°√∞r\\") asks the j√∂tunn Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir from where warm Sumarr and Vetr come from, stating that they arrived \\"first among the Wise powers\\".Larrington (1996:44). In stanza 27, Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir responds: > :Wind-cool [Vindsvalr] he is called, Winter's [Vetr's] father, :and Mild-One > [Sv√°su√∞r], the father of Summer [Sumarr]. The second half of this stanza is missing from early manuscripts, but some later manuscripts feature the addition of: > :And both of these shall ever be :Till the gods to destruction go.Bellows > (1936:75). ===Prose Edda=== In chapter 19 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, Gangleri (king Gylfi in disguise) asks why there's an evident difference between summer and winter. The enthroned figure of High responds, and (after scolding him for asking a question everyone knows the answer to) states that the father of Sumarr is Sv√°su√∞r, who is quite pleasant, while the father of Vetr is referred to as Vindsvalr or, alternately, Vindlj√≥ni, and that Vetr derives his countenance from his ancestors, as they are \\"cruel and cold-hearted kinsmen\\".Byock (2005:30). Sumarr and Vetr are additionally personified in the Prose Edda book Sk√°ldskaparm√°l, where they are referred to in kennings. Kennings for Sumarr are given in chapter 30, including \\"son of Sv√°su√∞r\\", \\"comfort of the snakes\\", \\"growth of men\\", exemplified in an excerpt given from a work by the skald Egill Skallagr√≠msson where \\"Valley-fish's mercy\\" points to \\"Snake's mercy\\", which signifies \\"Summer\\".Faulkes (1995:94). Kennings are given for Vetr in chapter 26; \\"Son of Vindsvalr\\", \\"snake's death\\", and \\"storm season\\". Excerpts of works by the skalds Ormr Stein√æ√≥rsson (who uses the kenning \\"Vindsvalr's son\\") and √Åsgr√≠mr (who employs the kenning \\"snake woe\\") are then given as examples.Faulkes (1995:93). Both Sumarr and Vetr are given as terms for \\"times\\" in chapter 63.Faulkes (1995:144). ==NotesReferences== * Bellows, Henry Adams (Trans.) (1936). The Poetic Edda.

Racing, Ormonde went undefeated, an English Triple Crown winner, but as an imported sire he was almost infertile. As for his son, Ormandale (born in Menlo Park, California), he was not the runner his father was, but as a sire, he was much the better horse. Sent to Kentucky in 1912 at the death of his California breeder, he entered the second half of his stud career as an immediate success. The dam of Purchase was Cherryola whose racing career was more than respectable, winning 26 races between the years 1909 to 1913. (On April 15, 1923, along with forty other horses, she died in a barn fire at Harry F. Sinclair's Rancocas Stable, New Jersey.) Eventually standing 16 hands 1 inch, Purchase was a long-legged golden chestnut, sold as a yearling to the Brighton Stable which was shortly thereafter dispersed. The trainer Sam Hildreth bought Purchase for $12,500. By the end of his racing career, Hildreth said that Purchase was one of the greatest racehorses he ever trained‚Ä¶\\"and I say that without any strings to it.\\" ==Racing career== Racing at two, he went winless in at least seven races, including the Futurity Stakes (coming in third) basically due to what Hildreth described as a \\"bad break.\\" But Sam Hildreth thought all that would change with maturity, especially as the colt had injured his leg just before another two-year-old race. And Hildreth was right. Racing at the age of three, Purchase was barely beaten out of winning the three-year-old colt division by Sir Barton even though Purchase had won nine races of 11 that year, including the inaugural running of the Jockey Club Gold Cup. Hildreth would have entered Purchase in the 1919 Kentucky Derby as well as the Preakness Stakes, but just before the Derby, Purchase reared up in his stall and caught a front hoof in a hay rack. This delayed his third year campaign until he beat the first Triple Crown winner Sir Barton by three lengths in the Dwyer Stakes on July 10, 1919. In the Saratoga Handicap, Purchase bested Eternal who was co-favorite for Sir Barton's Kentucky Derby and had been American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt as well as America's top earner in 1918. Purchase came in second to Eternal in the Brooklyn Handicap and second to Exterminator in the Saratoga Cup. (Exterminator won the Saratoga Cup four years in row: 1919 through 1922 as well as the 1918 Kentucky Derby.) Purchase took the Saranac Stakes carrying 133 pounds and the Huron Stakes carrying 134. In the two races he lost, he came in a good second, and in the race against Exterminator, it was his jockey, claimed Hildreth, who rode Purchase badly, as well as losing his whip. Otherwise, Sam Hildreth was sure he would have won. Sometime during this streak, Hildreth was offered $100,000 for the colt (or, depending on the source, $300,000), but turned it down. At the end of his three-year-old season, Hildreth, feeling he had nothing else to beat (and the connections of Man o' War only racing their horse against three-year-olds; by then Purchase was four), still kept Purchase in training. Breezing at Laurel Park, the horse struck a rock on the track, tearing the ligaments loose in his off front leg. He did not race again until he was five years old. In this last season he ran under the colors of Harry Sinclair. Beginning in July 1921, he appeared at the Empire City track in a sprint race, causing a sensation among racing fans. He won that race and the one after, but on his way to Saratoga, New York to continue that year's campaign, once again ill luck struck. On the train he wrenched one of his hind legs, ending his racing career ==Stud record== Produce was retired to stud at Rancocas Stable and stood in the largest box stall next to Zev, Grey Lag and Lucullite. When Rancocas Stable was itself dispersed in 1930, Purchase was 14 years old. He sold for only $2,000. At stud he had been a disappointment, but like other horses trained by Hildreth it was probably due to Fowler's solution, a concoction Hildreth gave all his horses which contained arsenic and strychnine. Even so, he did get a few winners. His daughter Fire of Orissa won the Fashion Stakes and the Clover Stakes. Sabine, Semba, Miss Purray, and a number of others won lesser races.

Coleson Cove opened in 1976 and was designed to burn #6 fuel oil, also known colloquially as \\"bunker C\\". Fuel is delivered via the underground Lorneville Pipeline, which runs from Irving Oil's Canaport bulk oil tanker unloading station off Red Head, 4 km southeast of the city's central core, crossing to the city's west side via the Reversing Falls Railway Bridge. The #6 fuel oil is stored in two 1.5 million barrel tanks at Canaport and four 300,000 barrel tanks at Coleson Cove. The plant features three boiler units powering three 350 MW generators for a total output of 1,050 GW, which is approximately 33% of the utility's generating capacity. To achieve this, Coleson Cove burns 5 million barrels of oil annually and discharges its exhaust through twin smoke stacks. In 1994, Coleson Cove was responsible for discharging 40,500 tonnes of sulphur dioxide (), increasing to 61,000 tonnes of in 1999; the plant also discharged 17,100 tonnes of nitrogen oxides () that year. ==Refurbishment== In late 2001, NB Power announced its intention to refurbish Coleson Cove and convert its fuel source to orimulsion, which was sole-sourced from Petr√≥leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) in a $2 billion 20-year supply agreement. The $2.2 billion refurbishment project involved reconfiguring the boilers, as well as on-land storage tanks, Lorneville Pipeline, and some equipment at Irving Oil's Canaport unloading facility. The project was envisioned to be complete in November 2004 with a cost of $818 million. Part of this refurbishment saw Coleson Cove fitted with LO-NOx burners and the addition of six flue gas desulphurization (FGD) scrubbers which were designed to also remove hydrochloric acid. ==Orimulsion issue== Political instability in Venezuela in 2003 is believed to have contributed to PDVSA balking at formally signing a contract to implement an orimulsion deal with NB Power for Coleson Cove.PDVSA had supplied orimulsion for NB Power's Dalhousie Generating Station since that plant was refurbished in 1994. By winter 2004 it was apparent that the fuel supply agreement with PDVSA had fallen through and NB Power launched a $2.2 billion lawsuit that was filed simultaneously with the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan and the Court of Queen's Bench of New Brunswick in Fredericton during the last week of February, naming both PDVSA and its United States subsidiary Bitumenes Orinoco S.A. (Bitor) as defendants and citing the companies' inability to negotiate and sign a contract to deliver orimulsion to Coleson Cove. On March 16, 2004 PDVSA announced that it was phasing out all orimulsion production; since NB Power's Dalhousie Generating Station's fuel supply agreement ends in 2010, it is assumed that both plants will be forced to switch to an alternative. The failure to secure a fuel supply agreement with PDVSA for the Coleson Cove Generating Station overshadowed the final term of Premier Bernard Lord and is believed to have played a role in his government's subsequent 2006 electoral defeat, since the publicly owned utility's write-down of the loss added substantially to the provincial long-term debt. On 3 August 2007, the NB Power Group settled the lawsuit with PDVSA over the failed contract for a total book value of $333m, split between a cash payment of $115m and a (then) future supply of fuel valued at $218m.gnb.ca: \\"NBPower Annual Report 2010/11\\", p.50 On 23 August 2007, the Energy and Utilities Board (EUB) approved a regulatory deferral for the purpose of returning the benefit of the lawsuit settlement with PDVSA to customers in a levelised manner. The deferral will be allocated over a period of 17 years in order to best match the benefit from the settlement to the customers that the customers will pay for the Coleson Cove Generating Station Refurbishment.gnb.ca: \\"NBPower Annual Report 2012/13\\", p.32 ==Pollution== Forced to continue its reliance upon heavy fuel oil, NB Power realized several environmental benefits and plant efficiencies resulting from the refurbishment as the generating station moved ahead 2 generations from its original polluting 1970s technology: emissions were reduced by 77%, emissions were reduced by 70% and particulate release was reduced by 75%. In addition, the changes in the burners and addition of scrubbers saw the production of a gypsum byproduct which was commercially resold for wallboard through a subsidiary of J.D. Irving Limited. Despite the improvements reducing emissions, the Coleson Cove Generating Station remains the largest thermal generating station in Atlantic Canada and has been cited by the New Brunswick Environmental Network and the Clean Energy Coalition of New Brunswick as the largest single point source of air pollution and greenhouse gases in the region. Emissions from the station in the form of particulates have been, and remain, a frequent source of pollution complaints in the region. ==Possible natural gas conversion== In May 2011 NB Power announced that it was considering converting Coleson Cove to burn natural gas. The high price of fuel oil in recent years, coupled with the plant's still-high emissions, has meant that it has sat idle for much of the last decade as it has been cheaper for NB Power to purchase imported electricity to replace the generating capacity. The decline in natural gas prices in recent years, increased cost of the mid-life refurbishment of the nearby Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station, and the rising cost of replacement imported electricity has provided an economic case for converting Coleson Cove, however, the project must be approved by the Government of New Brunswick and undergo environmental study. Additionally, a natural gas pipeline to supply the plant must be constructed from either the Saint John Lateral of the Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline or the Brunswick Pipeline.cbc.ca: \\"NB Power may convert Coleson Cove to natural gas\\", 18 May 2011 ==See Also== * List of largest power stations in Canada ==References== Category:NB Power Category:Oil-fired power stations in New Brunswick Category:Buildings and structures in Saint John, New Brunswick ","title":"Coleson Cove Generating Station"},{"id":"19324804","text":"Carlos Turrubiates P√©rez (born 24 January 1968 in Reynosa, Tamaulipas) is a retired Mexican professional footballer who played for Club Le√≥n, Chivas de Guadalajara and Atlante F.C..

On the website, users added video games to their profile, as well as track game play time and achievements, share reviews, game related information, and game activity. Raptr let users publish their gaming accomplishments to sites like Twitter, Plurk, FriendFeed, and Facebook. One of the main features was Raptr rewards, a program where users earn a currency, called Raptr points, while playing or gaining achievements, those points could be exchanged for various rewards such as in-game items, avatars, new games, etc. In February 2014, AMD invested in Raptr, which improved the reward system, allowing users to earn points for optimizing their games with the app and added discounts and giveaways for real hardware. Raptr launched in a closed beta on February 2, 2008, and launched an open beta to the public on September 3, 2008. Raptr has partnerships with video game publishers Activision & Ijji, and the Raptr client was bundled with the PC release of Red Faction: Guerrilla. In December 2009, Raptr partnered with GameSpot to provide both communities with extra features. In 2014, Raptr rebooted its business plan to focus on PC gamers. Dennis Fong stated \\"the biggest pain point for PC gamers is the weakness of the platform as a whole. Everybody has a different kind of PC.

Howard, one of his original short stories about Kull of Atlantis, first published in Weird Tales magazine c. 1929. It is one of only three Kull stories to be published in Howard's lifetime.Patrice Louinet. Atlantean Genesis, page 287, Kull: Exile of Atlantis; 2006, Del Rey. Set in the fictional Prehistoric Thurian Age, it deals with a disillusioned King Kull questioning the meaning of existence, leading him to seek the assistance of a two-faced wizard. ==Plot== Kull, King of Valusia, suffers from a severe depression which not even his friend and ally, Brule the Spear-slayer, can rouse him from. A mysterious woman later whispers to Kull that he should visit Tuzun Thune, a wizard of the Elder Race, who supposedly knows the secrets of life. Kull is intrigued, and set off at once. Kull arrives at the wizard's lair, known as the House of a Thousand Mirrors, and the two begin their discussion. To Kull's questions regarding the legitimacy of his powers, Tuzun Thune simply offers him an evasive answer. Disappointed, Kull states how he views Thune as just an ordinary man. However, Thune points out that all men, from kings to wizards, are just ordinary men. Tuzun Thune guides Kull deeper into his laboratory and shows him a hall of mirrors. One, the wizard claims, is crafted from the \\"Deepest Magic\\". However, when Kull looks into the mirror, all he sees is his own reflection. He then begins to wonder if he himself is only a mirror image, and the man in the mirror is the true Kull, and he longs to visit this \\"truer\\" world. Kull leaves, but returns day after day to stare into this mirror. Affairs of his state are being neglected, and the subjects are beginning to worry about their king. Still, Kull doesn't care. Soon, Kull begins to feel himself slipping into this mirror realm. Suddenly, Kull hears someone call his name and the mirror shatters. Brule has arrived and killed Tuzun Thune. Brule explains how Thune was involved in a plot to kill the king, as was the woman who first suggested Kull visit the wizard. Kull asks why a wizard with power over dimensions would be involved in a play for political power. Brule points out that all men, from kings to wizards, are just ordinary men. However, Brule says that when he arrived, he could see Kull actually dissolving into the mirror. Kull wonders if Thune actually did place a powerful spell over him, or if he managed to break the bonds of reality all on his own. The two leave Thune's corpse where it lies, and go. But for the rest of his life, Kull is haunted by questions about what really happened to him in Thune's mirror, and they leave him even less certain about the nature of reality. ==Adaptations== This story was rewritten as a Conan story by Marvel Comics in Conan the Barbarian #25 (\\"The Mirrors of Kharam-Akkad\\", Apr 1973). ==References External links == * *Robert E.

The Chippewa is in turn a tributary of the upper Mississippi River. The Flambeau drains an area of USGS gauging station at Bruce, WI near the mouth, http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?05360500 and descends from an elevation of approximately to above sea level. The Flambeau is an important recreational destination in the region. It is notable among canoeists in the Midwest for outstanding canoe camping, including excellent scenery, fishing and whitewater.Whitewater; Quietwater. Palzer, Evergreen Paddleways, 1980 The river and its forks have a variety of possible trip lengths from short day outings, to overnight camping, to voyages of a week or more. ==Origin of name== The name flambeau means \\"torch\\" in French. Many place names in Wisconsin have French origins due to the early French explorers, trappers and traders in the region in the colonial era. A common interpretation is that early explorers saw the local Ojibwe (Chippewa) people fishing at night by torchlight.Native American Placenames of the United States, William Bright, University of Oklahoma Press ==Hydrology== The Flambeau River rises in two major forks‚Äîthe North Fork and the South Fork. Both originate in north-central Wisconsin and flow generally southwest to their confluence, then continue as the main Flambeau, also southwesterly, to the mouth at the Chippewa River near Bruce, Wisconsin. The North Fork is formed by the confluence of the Manitowish and Bear rivers just above Turtle-Flambeau Flowage (reservoir). The South Fork's source is Round Lake in northeastern Price County, Wisconsin. Major tributaries of the Flambeau include the Turtle River, flowing into the North Fork in the Turtle-Flambeau Flowage, and the Elk River, which flows into the South Fork. Swamp Creek is the largest of 23 streams flowing into the Flambeau River. While the South Fork is free-flowing below a small dam at the outlet of Round Lake, the North Fork and the main river have several dams that impound small reservoirs, known locally as flowages. Below the dam impounding the Turtle-Flambeau Flowage, the North Fork has three dams between Park Falls and Oxbo. On the main Flambeau below the Forks, there are four more dams: Big Falls Dam, Rural Electric Agency Dam (Dairyland Reservoir), Ladysmith (Papermill Dam), (the Port Arthur Dam until it was removed), and the Thornapple Dam. ==Human settlements along the river== The communities of Park Falls and Oxbo are located along the North Fork. Fifield and Lugerville border the South Fork. Ladysmith is the only city on the main Flambeau. Generally the river flows through remote areas dominated by second-growth forest, with few road crossings or approaches. ==Navigation== The Flambeau River is best known as a classic canoeing stream. Both forks are canoeable from their sources, but most trips start at or downstream of access points near Oxbo on the North Fork or Lugerville on the South Fork, and end upstream of the Big Falls Flowage on the main stem. For much of the length of these sections of river, the Flambeau and its forks flow through the Flambeau River State Forest. The North Fork in this section is rated class I to II on the international scale of river difficulty at normal water conditions. Major named rapids are Wannigan and Flambeau Falls. The South Fork is a more difficult whitewater river, with runnable rapids up to class III and a portage at Little Falls. Major named rapids include Stonewall, Big Bull, Slough Gundy, and Scratch. Below the confluence (the Forks), the main Flambeau is class II down to the Big Falls Flowage.http://www.paddleflambeau.com The notable rapids on the main Flambeau are Cedar and Beaver Dam.Whitewater; Quietwater, Palzer, Evergreen Paddleways, 1980 Aldo Leopold in Sand County Almanac discusses Flambeau, the changes to it for canoeing, and the controversy around damming it in the 1940s. ==Ecology== The Flambeau system is considered an important fish habitat and fishing resource, primarily for smallmouth bass and muskellunge (muskie). ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Seeburger, William \\"First up the Dore Flambeau\\", reprinted in Malcolm Rosholt's Lumbermen on the Chippewa beginning at page 342.

The hospital's primary service area includes 16 counties in East Tennessee, and its secondary service area includes counties in southwest Virginia, southeast Kentucky and western North Carolina. It is certified by the state as a Comprehensive Regional Pediatric Center (CRPC), Tennessee's highest level of certification for pediatric hospital care. The hospital is accredited by the Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and is a member of Child Health Corporation of America, Hospital Alliance of Tennessee, Children's Hospital Alliance of Tennessee, Tennessee Hospital Association and National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions (NACHRI). The hospital and its affiliates, including numerous pediatric physician practices, employ about 1,800 individuals in full-time, part-time and as-needed positions. ==History== Opening in 1937, the 28-bed facility at 1912 Laurel Avenue was known as the Knox County Crippled Children's Hospital, and its primary purpose was to care for children with polio. In the 1940s, because of admissions from outside Knox County, officials changed the name of the hospital to East Tennessee Crippled Children's Hospital, open to children birth through 21 years with any type of illness. Because of the advent of antibiotics and the polio vaccine, the need for specialized orthopedic services diminished. Because of this, the hospital was officially renamed East Tennessee Children's Hospital in 1955 and began to focus on all pediatric illnesses and injuries. In 1970, a new facility with 74 beds opened at the hospital's current location, 2018 Clinch Avenue, a few blocks from the original location. In 1975, the number of beds increased from 74 to 96 with the completion of a 22-bed fourth floor. Later in 1975, the addition of an Intensive Care Nursery increased total beds at East Tennessee Children's Hospital to 122. A emergency department was completed in 1981, and a five- story medical office building was added in 1986. Additional facility expansions‚Äîwithout a change in total patient beds‚Äîtook place in 1988, 1993, 1994 and 2001. The hospital constructed two parking garages, the first in 1993 (now used for patient and physician parking) and the second in 2001 (for employee parking). In 1999, a new three-story hospital office building, Children's Plaza, opened. It was renamed in 2001 to honor longtime hospital president Bob Koppel on the 25th anniversary of his presidency. This building was expanded in 2003, more than doubling in size. In 2001 Children's Hospital received state approval to begin development of Children's West, an outpatient campus in West Knoxville. The campus now is home to the Children's West Surgery Center (a day surgery center that opened in 2003) and Children's Hospital Rehabilitation Center, which relocated from its former site in 2004. Also in 2001 Children's Hospital announced plans for a major expansion and renovation project on the main campus. The project included a new seven-story patient tower, a third-floor addition over the existing Emergency Department and renovation of much of the existing facility, including renovation of all semi-private patient rooms into private rooms with full baths. Children's Hospital's $31.8 million expansion project was completed in 2005. When the project began, Children's Hospital was a 169,700-square-foot, 122-bed facility; the hospital now has of space and 152 licensed beds. In January 2004, Children's Hospital provided care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for Tennessee's first surviving quintuplets, the van Tols: Willem Scott, Sean Conner, Isabella Marie, Ashley Faith and Meghan Ann. In 2006, the hospital provided surgical care to two Iraqi girls brought to the United States for treatment of serious medical conditions. ==Services== East Tennessee Children's Hospital offers 29 subspecialties (with more than 90 pediatric subspecialists). Children made more than 155,000 visits to Children's Hospital in the 2007-08 fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2008. Children's Hospital provides the following services: * Treatment for acute illnesses and injuries in the 24-hour Emergency Department. * Care for critically ill and injured patients in the Goody's Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), . * Board- certified neonatologists in the 44-bed Haslam Family Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), which specializes in the care of critically ill or premature newborns. * A pediatric transport service for critically ill and injured newborns and pediatric patients.

The church (50.6 m long and 19 m wide, with naves 25 m long), though not quite finished, was dedicated in 1387, when it was first mentioned as St. Stephen's. The bell tower was added in 1446 on the church's southwest side; it was begun during John Hunyadi's reign in honour of his 1442 victory over the Ottomans near the Ialomi≈£a River and completed in 1468 under his son Matthias Corvinus.\\"Turnul Sf. »òtefan\\" In the mid-16th century the tower and church were partly destroyed by powerful lightning. The tower was rebuilt in 1559-61; the church passed from Roman Catholic to Reformed control in 1588.Glodici In 1619 both structures underwent a thorough restoration: the tower received a new roof, high and sharp-pointed, in the shape of a square-based pyramid. In 1628 four mechanical clocks with moons (one on each face), manufactured by a Pre≈°ov clockmaker, replaced the tower's bell.The two weights, one of them of 80 kg, are kept at the county museum.

The tower was rebuilt the following year, when the gallery was raised a level and the roof redone in Baroque onion-dome style. The church was in ruins and repairs estimated to be very costly, so the authorities decided to demolish its remaining walls in 1847 using gunpowder; the former church site became a park in 1856, with Ferenc Schulz's 1870 plan for rebuilding it remaining unimplemented, and only the bell tower remained standing. This was destroyed by fire in 1869 and rebuilt in 1898-99 in neo-Gothic style, a form it preserves to this day.

Munro Hamilton, International Airport Upper James Street, is an Upper City (mountain) arterial road in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. It starts at the Claremont Access, a mountain-access road in the north, and extends southward towards the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport where it then changes its name to the Hamilton Port Dover Plank Road, (Highway 6). It is a two-way street throughout. As with most of the \\"Upper\\" streets, their addresses start at roughly the point where their lower counterpart finishes just below the Escarpment and were originally labelled without the \\"Upper\\" prefix. (Note: Highway 6 now uses a new alignment from Highway 403 to south of the Hamilton Airport, connecting with the southerly leg to Caledonia, the Grand River and Port Dover.) ==History== It was named Upper James Street because it was in alignment with James Street in the Lower City Hamilton and was named after one of Nathaniel Hughson's sons. Hughson was one of the City founders along with George Hamilton and James Durand. Originally it was called the Caledonia Road because it was the road that led to Caledonia, Ontario. It has also been known as Plank Road. As early as 1842 an inn was situated at the top of the escarpment near Claremont access, where present day Southam Park is situated. By 1850 a four-storey stone structure was erected at the site and it was called the Mountain View Hotel. It met the needs of those travelling the Caledonia Road, (Upper James Street). Farmers travelling in from townships south of Hamilton rested their horses here on the way to and from the Hamilton Farmer's Market. It offered patrons an unobstructed view of the city below and Lake Ontario beyond. The hotel served as a lookout point for Thirteenth Battalion during the Fenian threat in 1866. The building was destroyed by fire in 1878 and replaced by a new five-storey structure that included an elaborate observation tower on its eastern end in 1881. In 1890 a pavilion suitable for roller skating and dancing was added attracting various family and organized events. Access was improved with an Incline railway immediately to the north. When the establishments liquor license was revoked in 1916 the property was sold. It then served as the home for the Hamilton Hunt Club. The building was razed in 1937 and the grounds were donated to the City of Hamilton for use as a park in 1943. ===Westend incline railway=== Claremont Access, original site of West-end Incline Railway Claremont Access, mountain-access road James Street, at the base of the Niagara Escarpment was the site of the city's first Incline railway (1892‚Äì1932). Back then, the incline railway on James Street was known as the Hamilton & Barton Incline Railway. It connected to present day Upper James Street. The city's second Incline railway on Wentworth Street South, (1895‚Äì1936), was known as the Eastend Incline Railway but was often called, The Mount Hamilton Incline Railway. The Eastend Incline on Wentworth Street was electrically operated and the Westend Incline on James Street depended on steam for its power. In 1924, following the city's booming development in the east, there was some serious discussion regarding the addition of a third incline railway. The two locations considered at the time were Sherman Avenue or Ottawa Street South. The population of Hamilton Mountain at the time was 6,000. In 1929, the city's brochures were using the motto, \\"The City Beautiful and Hub of Canadian Highways\\" as well as \\"The City of Opportunity\\". In regards to the incline railways, the brochures go on to boast, \\"There is no finer view anywhere on the North American continent than the panorama to be seen from the Hamilton mountain.

The double tracks were 700 feet in length on a grade of 31% to overcome the 195-foot rise of the escarpment. Over half the line was supported on trestles which, at their maximum, held the 36-foot-long cars 50 feet above the ground. Stationary engines drew the cars to the top using steel cables. Opened June 11, 1892, it was heavily used by residents and tourists alike. The 75-second ride provided a convenient link between the city and Barton Township for both pedestrian and horse-drawn traffic. Improved mountain access roads and the rise in popularity of motorized traffic caused a steadily declining numbers of customers. The line ceased operation on December 26, 1931. The abandoned rails and equipment were removed during World War II and the right of way came under the jurisdiction of the Hamilton Parks Board. === Today === John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport or Hamilton International, is an international airport and is named for John C. Munro, a Hamilton Member of Parliament and cabinet minister. John Munro, elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1962 election, and served continuously as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Hamilton, Ontario. Munro was appointed to Cabinet by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and served variously as Minister of Amateur Sport, Minister of Health and Welfare and Minister of Labour from 1968 to 1978 when he was forced to resign from over the \\"Skyshops\\" scandal. The airport was originally built in 1940 as the Mount Hope Airport, a Royal Canadian Air Force base. After the war, the airport gradually shifted towards civil use, The military ceased using it as a base in 1964. In 1994 Transport Canada announces it will divest itself of local and regional airports. The region of Hamilton issues a request for proposals from private firms to run the airport. In 1996 Hamilton International Airport Limited (HIAL) is the fully owned subsidiary of TradePort International Corporation. HIAL begins to manage the Hamilton/John C. Munro International Airport. TradePort, winner of the bid to take over the airport, assumes responsibility to manage, finance and operate it under a 40-year lease. The Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum is a major Canadian aviation museum. It is located at the John C. Munro International Airport. The museum is a non-profit organization whose mandate is to acquire, document, preserve and maintain a complete collection of aircraft that were flown by Canadians and the Canadian military services from the beginning of the Second World War to the present. ==Landmarks== Airport Inn Mountain Plaza Mall Upper James Square Note: Listing of Landmarks from North to South. * James Street Stairway (second upper level), 300-metres East of the lower section stairs. * Bruce Trail * Claremont Access (mountain-access road) * Niagara Escarpment (mountain) * Southam Park ** Old site of the Hamilton & Barton Incline Railway (West-end Incline Railway) ** Old site of the Mountain View Hotel * Unity Church on the Mountain (church) * St. Peter & Paul Church (off Brucedale Avenue) * Upper James Court (Two 3-storey apartment complexes) * Delmonico (15-storey apartment building) * Mountain Plaza Mall * Mohawk Plaza (shopping/ commercial) * Butty Tower (10-storey apartment building) * Ridgemount Junior Public School (off Hester Street) * Dave Andreychuk Mountain Arena & Skating Centre (off Hester Street) * Mohawk Ford dealership * Upper James Toyota dealership * Cresmount Funeral Home/ Upper James Chapel * Lincoln M.

Pushed by regional British Commander-in-Chief Sir John Nixon, General Fenton Aylmer launched an attack against Ottoman defensive positions on the banks of the Wadi River. The Wadi was a steep valley of a stream that ran from the north into the River Tigris, some upstream towards Kut-al-Amara from Sheikh Sa'ad. The attack is generally considered as a failure, as although Aylmer managed to capture the Wadi, it cost him 1,600 men. The British failure led to Townshend's surrender, along with 10,000 of his men, in the largest single surrender of British troops up to that time. However, the British recaptured Kut in February 1917, on their way to the capture of Baghdad sixteen days later on 11 March 1917. ==Background== On 5 December 1915, Ottoman forces under the command of Halil Kut and the German commander Baron von der Goltz, surrounded an Anglo-Indian force of 25,000 men and began the Siege of Kut-Al Amara, a city south of Baghdad. Replying to pleas for help from Major Charles Townshend, Mesopotamian Theatre commander Sir John Nixon dispatched the British Tigris Corps of 19,000 men under Lieutenant General Sir Fenton Aylmer to relieve the besieged garrison. The first attempt to relieve Kut (the Battle of Sheikh Sa'ad) came on 6 January 1916. Aylmer's advance force, under Major-General George Younghusband, moved forward from Ali Al-Gharbi towards Sheikh Sa'ad along both banks of the Tigris. Younghusband's column made contact with the Ottomans on the morning of 6 January, east of Sheikh Sa'ad. British efforts to defeat the Ottomans were unsuccessful. British casualties were heavy amounting to 4,202, including 133 officers. Following this, the Ottoman forces voluntarily abandoned their position on 9 January for an unknown reason, and retired upstream to the Wadi. ==Preparations for the battle== Aylmer‚Äôs troops were exhausted and demoralized as they continued to make their way up the Tigris toward Kut. Their progress was hampered by the region‚Äôs typical shortage of available roads and supply routes. Aylmer planned to outflank the Wadi position, capture the Hanna Defile and surround the Ottoman force. The 28th Indian Brigade of the 7th (Meerut) Division under Brigadier General George Kemball would attack the Wadi trenches frontally, while the rest of the Tigris Corps moved around the flank. However, the British troops were hampered by having no accurate maps of the area, so much of the planning was left to chance. Meanwhile, the Ottoman army, under new regional commander Halil Pasha, set up new and firmer defensive positions‚Äîwith some 20,000 troops‚Äîalong the banks of the smaller Wadi River, through which the British would have to pass to reach Kut. ==Battle of Wadi== The attack, which began in the early afternoon of 13 January‚Äîpostponed from the morning because of a persistent mist and a slow advance by artillery across the river‚Äîquickly lost the intended element of surprise, as the outnumbered British forces on both sides of enemy lines struggled to assert themselves against a robust Ottoman defense. Kemball made a frontal advance, while Younghusband, with the bulk of the British force, attempted a wide turning movement. The delay seriously affected the chances of success, as small-arms and artillery fire from the alerted Ottoman forces began to halt the British infantry movements. Lacking proper maps, the leading British column became lost. Seizing the opportunity, the Ottoman units began to wheel around from a north-south orientation to an east-west, to face the British flanking manoeuvre. The resulting frontal attack by the 28th Brigade was repulsed with heavy casualties. By dusk, it became clear that the attempt had failed. British troops, attempting to manoeuvre around the Ottoman flanks, failed to reach the river, and the mouth of the Hanna Defile was still strongly held by the entrenched Ottoman troops. Aylmer called off the attack by the end of the day and ferried most of his remaining troops to the right bank of the Tigris. By this time, Aylmer's troops had gained control of the Wadi, but it was a small advance that was unworthy of the 1,600 men killed or wounded (including 40 British officers) in the attack and did little to bring relief closer to Townshend‚Äôs beleaguered forces at Kut. The provision of adequate medical capacity and supplies had not improved significantly since the appalling debacle at Sheikh Sa'ad, so again many casualties suffered without treatment or evacuation for several days. ==Aftermath== Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz -- the victorious German commander leading the Ottoman troops The British continued to attempt to break through the Ottoman lines over the coming months in order to rescue their brethren in Kut, all of which were unsuccessful. In April 1916, after nearly five months under siege, Townshend finally submitted, along with 10,000 of his men, in the largest single surrender of British troops up to that time. Through mistreatment and neglect leading to starvation, nearly 5,000 British prisoners died before the end of the war. The Siege of Kut was an important Ottoman victory, greatly raising the morale of Ottoman soldiers and prestige for the Ottoman Army in the Middle East. The British government on the other hand was forced to pour more resources into Mesopotamia. The British captured Kut in February 1917 on their way to the capture of Baghdad sixteen days later on 11 March 1917. The humiliation the British faced due to the loss of Kut had been partially rectified. The Ottoman government was forced to end its military operations in Persia and try to build up a new army to prevent the British from moving on to capture of Mosul. Sepoy Chatta Singh of the 9th Bhopal Infantry was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions at the battle. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * Wadi (1916) Wadi (1916) Wadi (1916) Wadi (1916) Wadi (1916) Wadi (1916) Category:Conflicts in 1916 Category:Military history of Iraq Category:20th century in Iraq Category:1916 in Asia ","title":"Battle of Wadi (1916)"},{"id":"19325363","text":"The Arizona myotis (Myotis occultus) is a vesper bat species inhabiting much of the southwestern United States and central Mexico as far south as the Distrito Federal. ==Taxonomy and etymology== It was described as a new species in 1909 by American zoologist Ned Hollister.

He is best known as the program director of KHJ radio in Los Angeles during its ground-breaking \\"Boss Radio\\" period (1965‚Äì1969), and as co- creator of the countdown show American Top 40, and the seminal radio program The History of Rock and Roll (1969). ==Early career in Hawaii== Jacobs was born in Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii, on September 3, 1937. His parents, Ray (a merchant) and Shirley (a homemaker) moved to the Islands from New York and New Jersey in April 1937. Jacobs was born in The Queens Hospital in Honolulu. Jacobs first attended Punahou school and dropped out of Roosevelt High School and began his radio career in 1953, upon receiving his FCC license. His first job was as the all-night DJ at Honolulu's KHON. He then went to KGU Radio, the NBC affiliate in Hawaii, as the Honolulu correspondent for the network's new program, Monitor. In 1957, Jacobs teamed with fellow KGU DJ Tom Moffatt to jump-start Henry J. Kaiser‚Äôs new KHVH Radio. The young deejays brought the best young talent to perform concert dates in Honolulu; and developed relationships with the era‚Äôs best rock talent ‚Äì including industry legends Elvis Presley and his manager, Colonel Tom Parker (they served as honorary pallbearers at Parker‚Äôs 1997 funeral). In 1958, Jacobs was the program director at KPOA Radio in Honolulu. Then, in 1959, Jacobs launched and programmed K-POI Radio ‚Äì Hawaii‚Äôs first Top 40 outlet. During this time, Jacobs wrote and produced the first Pidgin English rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll records, among them: \\"Da Kine,\\" about Hawaii's delayed entrance into the US, and local Hawaii rock hits by \\"Lance Curtis\\" (real name, Dick Jensen). ==Move to California== At 23, Jacobs moved to the U.S. mainland. In 1962, he was promoted to vice president of programming for the Colgreene Corporation. From there he programmed San Bernardino's KMEN Radio, and then, Fresno's KMAK. In Fresno, Jacobs found himself competing head on with radio consultant Bill Drake. They soon combined their talents to program RKO General's KHJ Radio in Los Angeles. Within six months, the Drake-Jacobs‚Äô \\"Boss Radio\\" format was Number One in America's second largest radio market, garnering national recognition for creating pop radio's most influential sound of the 1960s. Jacobs produced the 48-hour-long History of Rock and Roll. Radio's first \\"rockumentary,\\" which aired on KHJ and subsequently other stations in the RKO chain, and was accepted into the Library of Congress as the \\"first aural history of rock and roll music.\\" While programming the RKO radio chain from KHJ, Jacobs teamed again with Moffatt and Tom Rounds to form Charlatan Productions to produce films featuring recording artists in strange but eye- catching settings. ==Watermark, Inc.== After four years atop the L.A. radio ratings, Jacobs left KHJ to co-found and become vice president of Watermark Inc. In 1970, with Tom Rounds and veteran LA deejay Casey Kasem, Jacobs co- created the syndicated radio program American Top 40. At Watermark, Jacobs also produced the award-winning Elvis Presley Story, written by rock author Jerry Hopkins and narrated by broadcast personality, Wink Martindale. Next, Jacobs produced a 15-album record series of legendary top-40 DJs re-creating their station's sound with the original music, commercials and jingles. The albums covered 1955 through 1969 and were titled \\"CRUISIN': A History of Rock 'n' Roll Radio.\\" Jacobs produced several other notable records at Watermark including \\"A Child's Garden of Grass\\", for Elektra Records; Key: An Album of Invisible Theater, the debut album of performance artist Meredith Monk; and, Music from Another Present Era, the first recording by the jazz ensemble, Oregon. ==To San Diego== Jacobs then went to San Diego to program KGB AM/FM Radio. It was there that Jacobs conceived and produced the original Home Grown album. The KGB Chicken, later known to the nation as \\"The San Diego Chicken\\" was also hatched from Jacobs' imagination. In 1972, Ron Jacobs was honored by Billboard as Program Director of the Year. Jacobs‚Äô documentary about Max Yasgur, on whose farm the Woodstock festival was staged, won Program of the Year honors and two years later, Billboard named KGB Station of the Year. During this time, Ron Jacobs continued concert promotions with Tom Moffatt, Tom Rounds and Mel Lawrence. In 1964, the four men formed Arena Associates, staging the first rock show in the Honolulu International Center (now, the Neal S. Blaisdell Arena). In 1968, Arena Associates produced the Miami Pop Festival. Jacobs produced concerts at the Hollywood Bowl, Hollywood Palladium, Los Angeles Sports Arena, Orange County Fairgrounds (first US appearance of the Rolling Stones), San Diego Stadium, in conjunction with KMEN, KHJ and KGB radio stations, which he served as program director ==Return to Hawaii== In July 1976, Jacobs returned to an on-air position doing morning drive on KKUA Radio, in Honolulu, as \\"Whodaguy Ron Jacobs.\\" It was at KKUA that Jacobs introduced Home Grown, a radio station promotion in which contest winners had the opportunity to record their winning songs for release on a compilation album with the proceeds being donated to Habilitat, a drug/alcohol rehabilitation facility in Honolulu. Jacobs did three albums, Home Grown (1976), Home Grown II and Home Grown III, that featured a track named \\" Kona Winds \\" that introduced singer Marvin Franklin, while he was at KKUA.Home Grown, aka KKUA Home Grown Album, KKUA Records/Ron Jacobs, liner notes by Wayne Harada. 1976 Jacobs‚Äô TV career began when he hosted the Coca-Cola Record Hop on KHVH-TV, owned by Henry J. Kaiser. In 1977, Jacobs expanded his television work, producing Home Grown TV specials; a one-hour documentary on contemporary Hawaiian music entitled \\"Slack Key and Other Notes\\" (co-produced with the Hawaii Observer and Videololo II), and a quarterly magazine-format series, Pictures of Paradise, for CBS affiliate, KGMB-TV. During this period Jacobs was the TV spokesman for the local Ford dealer, \\"doing crazy stunts,\\" which helped make him one of the most well known personalities. In 1980, after leaving KKUA, Jacobs launched KDEO Radio as Hawaii's only full-time country music station, \\"the Western-most country station in the nation.\\" In 1985, in conjunction with Hawaii's visitor industry, Jacobs conceived, wrote and produced a nationwide radio promotion, The Hawaiian Chief, that ran in 48 markets in the continental United States under the sponsorship of American Airlines and Sheraton Hotels. In 1992, Jacobs was hired to produce and co- write the return of the radio show, Hawaii Calls. It was once again broadcast live from Waikiki, but from a different location, and lasted for less than one year. ==Final years on the airwaves== In 1994, Jacobs returned to Los Angeles where he joined Radio Express as executive producer of The World Chart Show. In April 1997, Jacobs returned to Honolulu where he produced Home Grown '97, a compilation album of contest winners' songs, for KRTR-FM and an inter-island network of stations, again donating the profits from the CD of previous Island Home Grown to Habilitat, which had relocated to Kaneohe, on the island of Oahu. On February 9, 1998, Jacobs joined KCCN/1420 as host of the morning- drive show. A year later, the station changed to an all-sports format. Jacobs left the airwaves. On July 7, 2007, Jacobs debuted the WHODAGUY website, which streamed live, 24 hours a day, traditional and contemporary Hawaiian music. Local musicians visited the Jungle Studio, playing and being interviewed. A fire in October 2009 caused the operation to shut down. With a broadcasting career spanning six decades, the Hawaii State Legislature recognized Jacobs for his cultural contributions in the area of Hawaiian music and the Mayor of the City and County of Honolulu honored him with a \\"Ron Jacobs Day.\\" In 1997, the Hawai'i Academy of Recording Arts (HARA) awarded Jacobs a Na Hoku Hanohano Award (The Hawaii recording industry's regional equivalent of the Grammy Awards). On May 3, 2015, Jacobs received the Hawai'i Academy of Recording Arts Lifetime Achievement Award for his career achievements as a radio station disc jockey and program director, record producer and promotion of Hawaiian music and Hawaii resident musicians, singers and songwriters. ==Writing career== Ron Jacobs was also a published author. His first book, Backdoor Waikiki, was published in 1986. For seven years he was a contributing editor to both Honolulu and Hawaii magazines. More than 150 Jacobs‚Äô articles have appeared in both local and national publications. In February 2002, Zapoleon Publishing, Stafford, Texas, released KHJ: Inside Boss Radio, a 407-page narrative by Ron Jacobs that included a series of oral-history interviews, memos and graphics covering Jacobs‚Äô tenure at Boss Radio. Ron Jacobs' book titled, OBAMALAND: Who Is Barack Obama?, published by Trade Publishing, Honolulu, November 2008, is one of the alltime nonfiction bestsellers in Hawaii. The volume, including new photos, commissioned artwork and never-before published facts about Obama's youth in Honolulu, begins in 1959, when Barack Obama, Sr., landed in Hawaii and ends with Barack Obama graduating from Punahou School and heading to California for college in 1979. ==Most recent activities== Jacobs resided in Pearl City, Oahu, Hawaii, where he wrote and maintained several social media sites. In 2015, Jacobs claimed to never have missed a Los Angeles Rams football game in person or on TV. At the time of his death, Jacobs was completing Locker Room Confessions, written with Todd Hewitt, longtime Rams equipment manager. == Sources == *440:Satisfaction, The DJs, news people and unsung radio heroes from out of our past!

The group is predominantly composed of Visayans (mostly Ilonggo), embracing a form of Folk Catholicism that utilizes amulets and violence. The group complemented the Philippine Constabulary as a militia force during the 1970s in southern Mindanao while fighting against Moro guerrillas during the Moro insurgency in the Philippines. From 1970 to 1971 Ilaga launched a series of 21 massacres that left 518 people dead, 184 injured, and 243 houses burned down. The group committed one of its bloodiest acts with the Manili massacre on June 19, 1971, when the group killed 70‚Äì79 Moro civilians (women, children and elders) inside a mosque. ==Background== The Mindanao region is rich in natural resources, including large quantities of mineral reserves. The American colonial government and subsequently the Philippine government pursued a policy of migration by resettling significant numbers of Christian Filipino settlers from the Visayas and Luzon onto tracts of land in Mindanao, beginning in the 1920s. This policy allowed Christian Filipinos to outnumber both the Moro and Lumad populations by the 1970s, which was a contributing factor in aggravating grievances between the Moro and Filipino Christian settlers as disputes over land increased. Another grievance by the Moro people is the extraction of Mindanao's natural resources by the central government whilst many Moros continued to live in poverty.The Bangsamoro Struggle for Self-Determintation: A Case Study The Philippine government under Ferdinand Marcos encouraged Ilonggo settlers who had emigrated to Mindanao to form a militia, which was eventually called the Ilaga. There is anecdotal evidence that the Ilaga often committed human rights abuses by targeting the Moro and Lumad peoples, as well as attempting to seize additional territory. The end result of Ilaga extremism is the lingering animosity between Moro and Christian communities. Mistrust and a cycle of violence are still felt today due to the creation of the Ilaga. ==History== From March 1970 to January 1972, the Ilaga committed 22 massacres resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Muslim civilians (mostly women, children and elders). The group is guilty of \\"mutilat[ing] bodies of victims\\" and \\"marking bodies with a cross.\\" The group also burned down and looted many houses and properties. ===Manili massacre=== Violence attributed to the Ilaga reached its climax on June 19, 1971 with the Manili massacre of 70-79 Moro Muslims Civilians (women, children and elders) in a mosque in Manili, Carmen, North Cotabato. The Muslim residents of the town had gathered in their mosque to participate in a supposed peace talk with Christian groups when a group of armed men dressed in uniforms similar to those worn by members of the Philippine Constabulary opened fire on them. ===1971 Battle of Lanao del Norte=== Following the massacre at Manili, many Maranao Muslims civilians fled to take shelter in the Lanao del Norte. Some Muslims formed small militant groups to counter the Ilaga. One such group was called the \\"Barracudas\\" and in September 1971, the Barracudas clashed with the Ilagas resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people on both sides of the conflict. The Ilagas also clashed with the Philippine Constabulary. The skirmishes continued until October, and over 60 Muslim houses were torched by the Ilaga.Robert, B.

The album was a concept album and, at the time of its release, the most widely reviewed and lauded of the group's catalog. In support of the album, PUTS released two singles, as well as the group's first music video for \\"The Wiz\\". For the release of the album, the group again chose an independent label, Gold Dust Media. ==Recording== The name of the album is partly a homage to the group Run‚ÄìD.M.C., but also an expression of what the group felt that they provided to their listeners: a relaxing party album, with bits of introspection mixed in. For the first time, the group decided to create a concept album involving the daily life of a typical Central or South Central Los Angeles resident. They even brought recording equipment to a summer house party and barbecue, and used the ambient noise from the party to supplement the opening, \\"daytime\\" songs on the new album. The first half of the album includes songs about record collecting (\\"The Ultimate 144\\"), video gaming (\\"Gamin On Ya\\") and partying (\\"Anotha' BBQ\\", \\"Enjoy\\"). As the day moves on into evening and nighttime, the subject matter of the album gets more reflective and serious, even touching upon Thes One's fears of becoming a parent (\\"A Baby\\") and the loss of loved ones (\\"D\\"). Much like \\"43 Labels I Like\\" covered vinyl record labels on Question in the Form of an Answer, \\"The Ultimate 144\\" is a clear reference to the Ultimate Breaks and Beats series of compilation albums geared toward DJs looking for drum breaks, and the lyrics are mostly song titles from the series. For a period of time leading up to the release of Fun DMC, Thes One became an avid collector of standalone arcade games. While toying with the arcade cabinets, he found a way to plug the audio lines for the games' soundtracks into recording equipment. This discovery allowed Thes One to use several old video game soundtracks and effects to create the backing track for \\"Gamin' On Ya\\". ==Promotion== Having toured extensively throughout Australia several times since 2004, Thes One and Double K wrote the song \\"The Wiz\\" about their travels down under. In Spring 2008, the group worked with director Matt Bird to film the video for \\"The Wiz\\" on location in Bondi Beach. The filming of the video involved underwater cameras, cranes, and an elaborate helicopter shot. It was the group's first official music video. To support the release of the album, Thes One prepared a free digital mixtape, with the similarly Run-D.M.C.-inspired name, Funner Than Leather. The mixtape included several early disco and old school hip hop tracks from the 1970s and 1980s with added instrumentation and vocals from the group and several guest contributors, including Crown City Rockers, Time Machine, Aesthetics Crew and DJ Day. With the assistance of San Jose producer Controller 7, the group also created a joke video on YouTube called Rick James the B-Boy from Buffalo. Unrelated to the album, the video features Double K imitating Rick James while he raps to classic hip hop tracks. ==Release and touring== Fun DMC debuted on the Billboard Heatseekers List at #6. The album also received universally positive reviews. Allmusic called the album \\"infinitely fresher and more original\\" than other current artists, and PopMatters dubbed it \\"the height of their career thus far.\\" The album was also lauded for its concept and tone. The Pitchfork Media review explained that Double K and Thes One \\"confront deeper matters, and sleekly weave them into their classic good-vibe atmosphere, offering listeners a new level of profundity, energy, and intricacy without surrendering the sheer pleasure they expect from a People Under the Stairs record.\\" Following a nationwide tour of the US in support of the album, PUTS celebrated their 10-year anniversary with a sold out show on December 19, 2008 at the historic El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles, performing multiple songs from every album. The performance was released on DVD the following year. ==Alternate version== In spring of 2011, the group released a dub version of the album that Thes One had made while mixing the album in 2008, available exclusively on their recently launched website. ==Track listing== All songs written by Christopher \\"Thes One\\" Portugal and Michael \\"Double K\\" Turner, except where noted. The double-LP version of the album omits tracks 7, 8, 10, 11, 17 and 19, and it places \\"Party Enemy No. 1\\" between \\"Critical Condition\\" and \\"The Wiz\\". Consequently, it is nearly 20 minutes shorter, and Side B is mixed slightly differently than its corresponding CD material. ==References *Official People Under The Stairs Website *Fun DMC Dub Version *Official Fun DMC lyrics page on The Point of the Rhyme Category:People Under the Stairs albums Category:2008 albums ","title":"Fun DMC"},{"id":"19325523","text":"H47 may refer to : * H-47 Chinook, an American twin-engine, tandem rotor helicopter produced since 1961 * HMS Blanche (H47), a World War II British Royal Navy B-class destroyer * HMS H47, a 1919 British Royal Navy H class submarine and also : * Hyampom Airport FAA LID * Other disorders of optic (2nd) nerve and visual pathways ICD-10 code ","title":"H47"},{"id":"19325528","text":"Times-News may refer to: * Times-News (Idaho), a newspaper published in Twin Falls, Idaho * Times-News (Burlington, North Carolina), a newspaper published in Burlington, North Carolina * Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina), a newspaper published in Hendersonville, North Carolina * Times News (Pennsylvania), a newspaper published in Lehighton, Pennsylvania * The Times- News (Utah), a newspaper published in Nephi, Utah * Cumberland Times-News, a newspaper published in Cumberland, Maryland * Erie Times-News, a newspaper published in Erie, Pennsylvania * Kingsport Times-News, a newspaper published in Kingsport, Tennessee ","title":"Times-News"},{"id":"19325553","text":"H48 may refer to : * HMCS Fraser (H48), a 1931 Royal Canadian Navy River-class destroyer * HMS H48, a 1919 British Royal Navy H class submarine and also : * Disorders of optic (2nd) nerve and visual pathways ICD-10 code ","title":"H48"},{"id":"19325594","text":"So Wa Wai (; born October 6, 1981) is a retired athlete from Hong Kong who has competed in the Paralympic Games on four occasions, winning 11 medals. == Early life == So was born with jaundice which affected both his hearing and the balance of his limbs, and hence competes in the T36 classification for athletes with cerebral palsy. At the age of 10, his enthusiasm for running was noticed by athletics coach Poon Kin-lui, who then began to formally train So. == Paralympic career == His first Paralympic appearance came at the 1996 games in Atlanta, where he won a gold medal as part of the men's 4√ó100 m relay team in the T34-37 classification. Over the course of the next two summer Paralympic Games, 2000 in Sydney and 2004 in Athens, So won four gold and two silver medals in a range of individual events, up to a distance of 400 m, as well as two bronze medals in relay events. In 2008 So was chosen to be part of the torch relay as the Olympic flame passed through Hong Kong on its way to Beijing. However, his participation in the games themselves was put into doubt when an injury to his father rendered him unable to work. So was forced to give up his training and take up a full-time job to support his family. Help with his situation came from Andy Lau, a Hong Kong entertainer and the singer of the Beijing Paralympic Games official theme song \\"Flying with the Dream\\", who gave him a full-time job with the flexibility to allow him to train for the Games. At the 2008 Summer Paralympics games, So led the Hong Kong team into the Bird's Nest Stadium during the opening ceremony as the flagbearer.Official list on the website of the International Paralympic Committee During competition he first won a bronze medal in the 100 m, a performance with which he was disappointed, and followed this with a sixth place in the 400 m. In the 200 m T36 final he broke his own world record with a time of 24.64 seconds on the way to winning the gold medal, making him the Paralympic champion in that event for the third successive occasion. After the race he said he had been ill before the competition and that \\"During the first part of today's competition I did not run at my normal speed\\", he attributed his win to both \\"good luck\\" and \\"practice\\". So announced the news of his retirement from athletics in January 2016.

The pilot and instructor sat in tandem under a long canopy. ==Design and development== Jack Laister designed the aircraft in response to the formation of the United States Army Air Corps' American Glider Program in 1941, basing it on his Yankee Doodle design of 1938 for Lawrence Tech. Aside from the addition of a second seat, the Yankee Doodle 2 differed from its predecessor by having wings of constant dihedral instead of gull wings. The USAAC expressed interest, but only if Laister could arrange for the manufacture of the type. When Laister found a sponsor in businessman John Kauffmann, they established the Laister-Kauffmann Corporation in St Louis, Missouri and the USAAC ordered three prototypes as the XTG-4. When evaluation of the type proved positive, the Army placed an order for 75 aircraft, followed by an order for another 75. These were operated as the TG-4A. All had been withdrawn from service prior to the end of the war when it was discovered that the flight characteristics of the aircraft were so different to those of a cargo glider, that the experience gained on the TG-4 was not particularly relevant. After the war many were sold as surplus and helped build civilian gliding in the USA. ==Variants== * XTG-4 - prototypes (three built) * TG-4A - production model (150 built) * TG-4B - civilian aircraft impressed into service (one impressed) ==Operators== LK-10 Serial #48 registered as N53619 owned and flown by Doug Fronius of Poway, California, USA as of 2018.

In an attempt to cure Radford, his doctor shows him the movie. When another doctor, Dr Wayne, arrives at the ward the following morning, he discovers evidence of a mass slaughter, however no bodies are to be found. Five years later, a local theater is showing The Dark Beneath for the first time since the murders. The theater's staff, Bridget, Rachael, and Kenny welcome a small group of customers, including a biker couple, Harley and Babe, Dr. Wayne and Detective Barrons, who both believe Radford will appear, and Bridget's boyfriend Josh, who is with his friend Mario, Mario's girlfriend Samantha and their friend Sully. Bridget's younger brother Timmy also arrives, but is sent home due to his age. As the movie is about to begin, Josh convinces Bridget to allow Kenny to be in charge so she can watch the movie with him. However, after a while Bridget becomes unsettled by the movie and enters the lobby, where it is revealed she was abused by her father as a child. Meanwhile, Kenny enters the basement to retrieve stock, but is murdered by the same killer from the film. His death is shown to the watchers in the theater, however they believe it is part of the film. Then Josh convinces Bridget to re-enter the theater, while Sully goes to use the restroom. However, while returning he is attacked and murdered. Bridget, Josh, Mario and Samantha think of it as an elaborate prank by Sully, but Rachael too is stabbed to death for all to see, prompting everyone to investigate. The detective reveals himself to the rest of the group, who realize the deaths are real. The group try to get help, but find their phones do not have a signal and the theater's phone is dead. They also discover Timmy, who had snuck back in to watch the movie. Suddenly, Radford appears and slashes Dr. Wayne's throat. The detective shoots Radford, but there is little effect as Dr. Wayne is soon seen being dragged into a basement on the screen. Timmy tells the group he entered through the upstairs window, and so the group decide to try and escape. However, while doing so the window slams shut on Samantha's fingers, trapping her and forcing the others to flee. The Detective attempts to save Samantha, however Radford stabs both to death. Regrouping downstairs, the survivors find a police officer outside the entrance, however Radford makes the group invisible, and the police officer soon leaves. Desperate, the group resort to trying to break the projector, and thus stop the film. Harley breaks the projector just in time to save Josh who is attacked by Radford. The projector quickly repairs itself, and Radford chases the group. Harley, Babe and Timmy hide in a closet but the killer breaks through the door and stabs Harley while the others get away. Bridget, Josh and Mario make their way back to the theater where they witness Babe being murdered on the screen. Mario ditches his friends, but is eventually killed by Radford. Josh also falls victim to Radford, while Bridget finds Timmy. Bridget realizes that in order to defeat the killer they have to get rid of their fear. Together, the pair concentrate on not being afraid and Radford is unable to kill them. Suddenly, Bridget finds herself in the movie, in a creepy basement. She finds everyone Radford has killed tied up in cells, bleeding but alive. She finds Josh but Radford finds her, torturing her until once again she is able to ignore her fear and escape and free Timmy. They are ambushed by the killer's movie mother, but Timmy stabs her and they continue their escape, with Radford in pursuit. Bridget realises the film is ending and so sacrifices herself to remain trapped in the movie world, throwing Timmy through the screen back into the real world. The police arrive at the theater to find Timmy the only survivor. ==Cast== * Rebekah Brandes as Bridget * Daniel Bonjour as Josh * Greg Cirulnick as Mario * Mandell Maughan as Samantha * Stan Ellsworth as Harley * Melissa Steach as Babe * Jon Briddell as Detective Doug Barrons * Michael Swan as Doctor Dave Wayne * Michael Schwartz as Sully * Justin Baric as Timmy * Brea Grant as Rachael * Shawn Ausmus as Kenny * Arthur Roberts as Ted Radford ==ReleaseHome media=== The film was released on DVD by Peace Arch Trinity on January 6, 2009.

It was established in 1988 with the proceeds from the film Salaam Bombay! directed by Mira Nair, which was about the lives and vulnerabilities of street children. The name Salaam Baalak Trust translates literally as \\"salute the child\\". Programs at SBT include repatriation, providing education (formal education, informal education and open learning), basic literacy and schooling, full care facilities for the young (up to 18 years), drop-in shelters for older children, physical and mental health care, life-skills education, vocational training, sports, job placement and counselling in HIV/AIDS. SBT runs 7 24-hour full care residential homes for children, of which two are devoted to girls (Arushi and Udaan - Rose Home). 10 contact points/day care centers mostly near railway stations and a 24-hour toll-free helpline service (1098), cater to children in distress all over India. Therefore, looking after nearly 10,000 children every year. Salaam Baalak Trust children, who have been trained in theatre, dance and puppetry, are giving performances all over the world. Since 2007, SBT Delhi has been running the City Walk Program, a guided tour through Paharganj and New Delhi Railway Station area. The guides are former street children from the Trust. The walk aims to sensitise the guests about street life, street children and children in distress. During the Walk, the guides share their personal story of survival and walk them through the contact points/day care and residential homes. The walk, thus, also provides an opportunity for the young adults to improve their communication and marketing skills. All proceeds go directly towards the Trust to enable more opportunities. From April 2019 to March 2020, the City Walk Program did 902 walks and 8353 visitors were sensitised from across the world. In addition to the City Walk tour, SBT also offers a Heritage Walk through Old Delhi, showcasing six hidden places, including markets, havelis, and five different religions that have existed in the region since 1638. This walk acquaints tourists with all that has survived in Old Delhi since Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal Emperor who made Delhi the capital of his empire. The walk takes tourists on a rickshaw ride through the city and lands panoramic views of Old Delhi from a spice market rooftop. It ends in an SBT shelter home for boys to offer a glimpse into what street children have survived through. ==History== SBT contact point for street children on a platform from New Delhi Railway Station Originally established in 1988 to rehabilitate the children who appeared in the film, Salaam Bombay! (1988) in Mumbai, Salaam Baalak Trust started working in 1989, and by 2005 it had 17 centres for street child throughout India.Salaam Baalak Trust Mercy in Her Eyes: The Films of Mira Nair, by John Kenneth Muir. Published by Hal Leonard, 2006. , . page 61. This struck a chord with the trustees, who identified the potential in India's street children. A trust was created where young street boys and girls could feel secure and could breathe hope. In New Delhi, SBT started its operations with a staff of 3 and 25 children in the open-air balcony of the Police Station at the New Delhi Railway Station. It has now grown to employ a staff of 142, providing support services in Delhi & NCR region. SBT currently functions through 13 Contact Points/Day Care Centers and 5 Shelter Homes, which provide a holistic child development. In its 25 years of operation, it has brought about a positive change in the lives of more than 50,000 children from India and abroad. SBT also manages an emergency Child Helpline (1098), which is a toll free number to reach out to children in distress at any point of time. Starting 1999, Family Health International (FHI), with funding from USAID, started working with the SBT, on HIV/AIDS education and prevention, while supplying, street children aged between 4 and 13 with food, medical aid, education, and essential supplies.Street Children and Youth Get a Chance in India \\"Family Health International \\".U.S. Official Visits Salaam Baalak Trust's Shelter for Children newdelhi.usembassy.gov. 28 April 2006.U.S. Assistant Secretary Richard Boucher Visits Salaam Baalak's Shelter for Children USAID, 5 August 2006.

Its latest home, DMRC Children Home, built exclusively for boys, was opened in New Delhi (near Tis Hazari Metro Station) in August 2010 and provides shelter to over 100 boys. The Arushi centre at Gurgaon was opened in 2008 and provided support to around 86 girls, aged between 5 and 18.

There are two main classes of encapsidation signals in avian hepatitis B viruses - Duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and Heron hepatitis B virus (HHBV) like. DHBV is used as a model to understand human Hepatitis B virus. Although studies have shown that the HHBV epsilon has less pairing in the upper stem than DHBV, this pairing is not absolutely required for DHBV infection in ducks.

HHBV epsilon also consists of a stem structure, a bulge and an apical loop (Fig. 2). The RNA structure has been determined by chemical probing and by mutagenesis.

Smith, eds., The Later Jacobean and Caroline Dramatists: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1978; p. 204. written and produced by Sir William Davenant. The music was composed by Matthew Locke.Janet Clare, Drama of the English Republic, 1649-1660: Plays and Entertainments, Manchester, Manchester University Press, 2002. The work was significant in the evolution of English opera and musical theatre, and also of English drama; Davenant brought into the public theatre the techniques of scenery and painted backdrops that had previously been employed only in the courtly masque. It was by presenting his work in a musical rather than a dramatic context that Davenant was able to circumvent the Puritan Commonwealth's prohibition on plays. Indeed, Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell encouraged the production of this work and Davenant's ensuing The History of Sir Francis Drake (1659) as anti-Spanish propaganda. (The English had been at war with Spain since 1655.) ==The show== The Cruelty was presented at the Cockpit Theatre in the summer of 1658; it was on the stage by July. The work consists of six scenes or tableaux, called \\"Entries,\\" each of which starts with a speech by the Chief Priest of Peru and proceeds to a song. The Chief Priest was dressed in a \\"Garment of Feathers\\" and a \\"bonnet\\" with an \\"ornament of Plumes.\\" He carried \\"the Figure of the Sun on his Bonnet and Breast\\" because \\"the Peruvians were worshippers of the Sun.\\" The first Entry shows the Peruvians in their state of innocence; the second displays the arrival of the Spaniards. The third is devoted to the quarrel and civil war between \\"the two Royall Brethren, sons of the last Inca.\\" The fourth displays the Spanish conquest of the Incas, and the fifth, their oppression and torture. The sixth celebrates the arrival of English soldiers, their defeat of the Spanish and rescue of the Peruvians (which, Davenant acknowledged, was something that had not yet occurred in reality). Davenant loaded his show with extras and diversions. Between the Entries, the audience was amused with acrobats who performed \\"the Trick of Activity, called the Sea-horse,\\" as well as the \\"Porpoise\\" and the \\"double Somerset,\\" plus two trained apes walking a tightrope.Dale B.

Locke was involved in both The Siege of Rhodes and Francis Drake, the Davenant works that preceded and succeeded The Cruelty, and is therefore a logical candidate for The Cruelty also.Ian Spink, Henry Lawes: Cavalier Songwriter, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2000; p. 111. In addition to Locke, the other composers involved in The Siege of Rhodes -- Henry Lawes, George Hudson, Charles Coleman, and Captain Henry Cooke ‚Äî are natural possibilities for composers for The Cruelty. ==Publication== The work was entered into the Stationers' Register on 30 November 1658, and was published soon after in a quarto issued by the bookseller Henry Herringman, under the fulsome title The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru. Exprest by Instrumentall and Vocall Musick, and by the Art of Perspective in Scenes, &c.; represented daily at the Cockpit in Drury-Lane, At Three after noone punctually. The printed text was unusual in that it was intended for release while the stage production was continuing. At the end of the text was printed this advertisement: \\"Notwithstanding the great expense necessary to scenes, and to other ornaments in this entertainment, there is a good provision made of places for a shilling. And it shall begin certainly at three afternoon.\\" This was a polar reversal of earlier practice in English Renaissance theatre, in which the actors tried to keep their plays out of print. Davenant and Herringman appear to have attempted a synergistic approach that foreshadowed modern marketing, with the stage production and the printed text complementing and promoting each other. (Though it is unknown if Davenant's stage show was still playing at the Cockpit as late as November.) Davenant later used the text of his entertainment as Act IV of his The Playhouse to Be Let (1663). ==Sources== As a source for his text, Davenant depended upon The Tears of the Indians, John Phillips' 1656 translation of the Brev√≠sima relaci√≥n de la destrucci√≥n de las Indias by Bartolom√© de las Casas (1551). Davenant also used the Comentarios Reales of Garcilaso de la Vega (El Inca) (1609), which was translated into French in 1633.Susan Wiseman, Drama and Politics in the English Civil War, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1998; p. 145.

It was composed in 1913, is written in the key of A major, and is around six minutes long. The tune as noted by Butterworth from the singing of Mr & Cranstone of Billingshurst, Sussex, in June 1907. It varies in several respects from that used in the orchestral work of 1913. ==Composition== This is a short orchestral piece by George Butterworth, probably the most played of his three works for orchestra. It has certainly been his most recorded orchestral work. Described by its composer as an \\"Idyll\\", and written in 1913, it is scored for a small orchestra consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, one trumpet, harp and strings.Score published by Stainer & Bell, London, 1918 It is thus a belated companion to the Two English Idylls of 1910-1911. All three pieces are founded on folk melodies Butterworth collected in Sussex in 1907, each has a similar \\"arch\\" shape, and each lasts between 4¬Ω and 6 minutes.Barlow, Michael, Whom The Gods Love, Toccata Press, London, 1997 Butterworth based The Banks of Green Willow on two folk song melodies that he noted in 1907 - \\"The Banks of Green Willow\\" (Child 24, Roud 172) and \\"Green Bushes\\" (Roud 1040, Laws P2). The first was noted from the singing of \\"Mr & Mrs Cranstone\\" of Billingshurst,All songs that Butterworth collected are in the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library, Cecil Sharp House, London. The Cranstone song is manuscript no.GB/6b/26. though a few bars from the end (after the flute and harp have played Green Bushes) a solo violin muses on a variant of the tune, recorded by Butterworth in 1909, using a phonograph, from the singing of David Clements in Basingstoke Workhouse.EFDSS cylinders no.97 & 104 Versions of the second tune were noted from at least ten different singers, though the tune as it appears in the Idyll is not any of them. Each use of each tune varies slightly, and it is likely that Butterworth created new variants based on features of all the various versions he collected. Green Bushes as it appears in the Idyll most closely resembles that sung by Ned Harding of Lower Beeding, Sussex, in June 1907.Manuscript no.GB/6a/80. Vaughan Williams Memorial Library, Cecil Sharp House, London. It is interesting that the composer also noted a version from Mr Cranstone, though it is not much like the one in the Idyll. Green Bushes was a common tune, and there are notable uses of it in works by Ralph Vaughan Williams (Folk Song Suite, Movement 2) and Percy Grainger (Passacaglia: Green Bushes and The Lost Lady Found). A solo clarinet and strings create a pastoral scene with the title theme, followed by a short development and restatement of the tune. The mood becomes more sombre and agitated as a new theme (Butterworth's own, on horns) is introduced. An animated motif leads to the main climax, which is surprisingly passionate for such a short work, before the music subsides to introduce Green Bushes hesitantly on oboe. This is repeated gently on flute, accompanied by harp, and the piece ends tranquilly with snatches of the variant title theme on violin solo, horn and oboe. As the composer said this piece is a \\"musical illustration to the ballad of the same name\\", it may be useful to realise that the folk ballad tells the tale of a farmer's daughter who falls in love with a young sea-captain, becomes pregnant and runs away with him to sea, having first stolen money from her parents. When her child is born on board ship, the labour is especially difficult and there is no \\"woman's help\\" available. Knowing she will die, she asks her lover to \\"bind a napkin round my head, then throw me overboard, both me and my baby\\"Text as noted by Butterworth from Mr & Mrs Cranstone, Vaughan Williams Memorial Library, Cecil Sharp House, London. Manuscript no.GB/6b/26. Her lover does this and watches as she \\"quivers\\" - presumably in her death-throes - and he sings a lament to \\"my true love, whom I once loved so dearly\\" and who shall be buried on \\"The Banks of Green Willow\\" (Butterworth's capitalisation). It is a shocking tale, even more so in other collected versions, where it is the man who decides to throw the girl and baby overboard rather than risk the shame of taking them home (Mr & Mrs Cranstone's text is a little more palatable). The premiere of The Banks of Green Willow took place on 27 February 1914, when Adrian Boult conducted a combined orchestra of forty members of the Hall√© and Liverpool orchestras in West Kirby. This was, in fact, the 24-year-old conductor‚Äôs first concert with a professional orchestra (he also gave the British premiere of Hugo Wolf's Italian Serenade at the same concert).

He served with the Australian Army during World War II. He founded Kenja with his partner, Jan Hamilton, in 1982. In 1993 he was charged with sexual offences against four young girls, but was found not guilty on ten of the 11 counts, with the remaining conviction overturned in 2002. He was again charged with child sexual assault in 2005. The court case received a temporary stay on the grounds of ill health, but Dyers committed suicide before the case could return to court. ==Early life== Dyers was born on 14 July 1922.From a full-page memorial tribute to Dyers on the first anniversary of his death, containing an edited version of Jan Hamilton-Dyers' eulogy, The Age, 25 July 2008. His father was 54 when he was born. Dyers claimed that his father, Charlie Dyers, was a toddler on Daly Waters station in the Northern Territory where he had become lost in 1872, at the age of three. He further claimed that Charlie was picked up by a drover three years later at the age of six and returned to Daly Waters station, and that he had lived with an Aboriginal tribe in the intervening years. However, there is no record of that event. Daly Waters was named by John McDouall Stuart in his third attempt to cross the continent from south to north in 1862. A pastoral map of the area from 1887 shows that there were no pastoral stations operating in the area of Daly Waters at that time, and the Overland Telegraph station there was not established until in 1872.Northern Territory Library ==War record== During World War II, Dyers served in the Australian Army as a military policeman with 9th Division Provost Company from his arrival in the Middle East on 25 September 1941 until he embarked for Sydney on 27 January 1943, and again from 30 July 1943 until his return to Sydney on 23 March 1944. His record details a chequered career, and a large amount of time in field hospitals and casualty clearing stations. Dyers served in the 32 Works Company in Australia until he was discharged. He was court-martialled three times. In late 1943, he was in jail for five days awaiting trial on three charges, and eventually convicted of \\"conduct prejudicial to the good order and military discipline\\".http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/imagine.asp?B=8916510&I;=1&SE;=1 In June 1944, he went absent without leave for 16 days.http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/imagine.asp?B=8891613&I;=1&SE;=1 In April 1945, he was fined for leaving his sentry post, and was fined again in July for misconduct. The record also contains an assessment of his \\"mental instability\\" which is rated at 10 per cent on the day he was demobbed in August 1946. (full army record) In his article examining the inconsistencies between Dyers' claims and verifiable records, Sydney Morning Herald journalist, Robert Wainright, referred to Dyers' wartime biography as exposing a 'Walter Mitty Complex'. ==Scientology== Hubbard's beliefs and practices, drawn from a diverse set of sources, influenced numerous offshoots, splinter- groups, and new movements. Dyers joined the Church of Scientology but later left it. In a list published from the 1950s onwards by the organisation, he is listed as an \\"SP\\" (a Suppressive Person). ==Child sexual assault== In 1993, Dyers was charged with 11 counts of sexual offences against four girls between the ages of 8 and 15, three of whom were sisters. After several trials and appeals, which lasted almost a decade, Dyers was found not guilty of 10 of the charges. He was found guilty of one charge (tried separately) and jailed at Long Bay Correctional Centre for six days before being released on bail. An appeal in 2000 failed and, in 2002, the charge was overturned in the High Court of Australia on the grounds that the trial judge had potentially misdirected the jury. A new trial was ordered but the DPP did not seek a retrial because it determined that Dyers had served his sentence. On 28 October 2005, Dyers was charged in Sutherland Local Court with the sexual assault of two 12-year-old girls, alleged to have taken place at Kenja's Surry Hills headquarters in 2001-2002. Dyers was released on bail under the condition that he attend Sutherland Police Station weekly and not attend Kenja premises or events. Dyers applied for a \\"permanent stay\\" of the court case on the grounds of ill health. He also applied for and received a variance to his bail conditions to travel to a Kenja function in Melbourne. His application for a permanent stay was rejected, as was a further application to attend a Kenja function in Sydney. He was given a temporary stay for one year on the grounds of mental health. Dyers denied he was guilty of the charges against him, claiming that they were the result of former members trying to destroy him as part of a witch-hunt. His lawyer offered the defence that 13-year-old girls \\"know how to say no, they get educated in school\\" and that \\"there will be contrary medical evidence indicating that Mr Dyers has had erectile dysfunction for almost 15 years\\". Dyers was phoned by his solicitor on 25 July and informed the NSW Police would interview him again regarding fresh allegations from another young girl. Dyers committed suicide by gunshot to the head on 25 July 2007. Twenty-two charges of sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault had been committed to trial by Magistrate Jaqueline Trad at the time of Dyers' suicide, and he had received a one-year reprieve from attending court on the grounds of mental health. His solicitor had informed him of further charges from a third girl on the day before his suicide. ==References== Category:1922 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Suicides by firearm in Australia Category:Australian Scientologists Category:Suicide in 2007 ","title":"Ken Dyers"},{"id":"19326238","text":"The International Day of Older Persons is observed on October 1 each year.

She sang Ben (a Michael Jackson song written by Walter Scharf), on the Flemish showbiz TV show De Kinderacademie (child academy). This show was not a contest, but an entertainment program, where children between 4 and 12 years old could perform an act (sing act, dance act, telling a little fairy tale or poem, ...). Her performance was so well- received that an independent recording studio signed her to a contract. Under the name \\"Silvy Melody\\" she recorded some songs (including a Dutch version of Ben) as solo-artist and also some numbers together with other famous Belgian singers. Many of her songs were in top 10 charts. Her career as child star stopped abruptly in 1994 due to Belgian law regarding child labour which is forbidden in Belgium. In 2000, she became the female vocalist for the dance band Liquid feat., later in 2001 the band's name was changed to Sylver. Alongside the successes with Sylver, she started also solo.

It also includes provision for an annuity for former Governors-General and spouses or partners of former Governors-General, compensation for lost or adversely affected superannuation rights, and travelling expenses. Section 7 of the Act grants the Governor-General an exemption from taxation. This part was repealed and replaced by the Governor-General Act 2010. === Part Two: Ministers and Parliamentary Under-Secretaries === Part two of the Act defines payments to Ministers of the Crown and Parliamentary Under-Secretaries. === Part Three: Remuneration === Part three of the Act determines the remuneration of Ministers of the Crown, Parliamentary Under-Secretaries, and members of Parliament. It establishes the Remuneration Authority to fix salaries and allowances for MPs, and includes provisions for the Speaker of House of Representatives and Chairpersons of Committees. Section 20 of the Act allows for deductions to be made from members' salaries and allowances, and defines travel, accommodation, attendance, and communications services for members. === Part Four: Miscellaneous provisions === Part four of the Act grants annuity for former Prime Ministers and spouses or partners of former Prime Ministers. The Act also defines payments to spouse or partner, or dependent children of member of Parliament dying in office. == Review == In 2008, the New Zealand Law Commission began a review of the Act. In a press release, Law Commission President Sir Geoffrey Palmer said \\"The Act has not been comprehensively reviewed for many years. Some of its provisions are outdated. Some of the language is archaic. There is some unnecessary overlap between this Act and other legislation which creates complexity.\\" The review was completed in December 2009. The Law Commission recommended that part 1 of the Civil List Act be repealed, and replaced with a new statute to reflect the nature of the modern office of Governor-General. The most significant change would be that the Governor-General is no longer exempt from paying income tax on their salary. The changes proposed in the report would take effect for the appointment and term of the next Governor-General. The Governor-General Bill was introduced into Parliament on 28 June 2010. It was passed as the Governor- General Act 2010. == See also == * Civil list == References  External links == * New Zealand Legislation - Civil List Act 1979 Category:New Zealand Statutes Category:1979 in New Zealand law ","title":"Civil List Act 1979"},{"id":"19326365","text":"Map of Ekondo Titi Municipality Ekondo-Titi is a commune and arrondissement in the Ndian department, Southwest Province, western Cameroon.

The party seeks to represent the Ladin minority in the Province and especially Ladins living in Fassa Valley. ==History== Fassa was formed as Fassa List (Lista Fassa) in August 2008 as a centre-right alternative to the centre-left Ladin Autonomist Union (UAL), which used to garner a large majority of Ladin votes in Fassa Valley. Its first leader was Gino Fontana, mayor of Vigo di Fassa and, formerly, provincial councillor for Daisy Civic List, a centrist party aligned with the centre-left. A year later, the List was institutionalised and became a fully fledged party under the current name. In the 2008 provincial election the party won 0.6% of the vote (26.6% in Fassa Valley), while the UAL gained 1.2% (54.0%). In March 2012 the party replaced its leadership during an assembly: Elena Testor was elected president and Luca Guglielmi secretary. In September 2013 Riccardo Franceschetti, mayor of Moena and leading member of the UAL, left that party in order to join Fassa. In the 2013 provincial election the party won 0.8% of the vote (31.9% in Fassa Valley), but still lost to the UAL, which gained 1.1% (51.8%). However, in 2015, the party prevailed over the UAL in the first Fassa community election and Testor was elected Attorney General. In the 2016 Italian constitutional referendum won Fassa supported the No with 57.9% against the UAL supported Yes in Fassa Valley.

He was elected as a substitute member of the Norwegian parliament for the city of Oslo in 2013, representing the right-wing and anti-immigration Progress Party, and attended parliamentary sessions from 2013 to 2018 as the substitute of the mandate holder Siv Jensen who has been on leave from parliament during her government service. As a politician he was known for taking a hard stance on immigration, calling for a complete ban on further immigration to Norway, a stop to the practice of accepting asylum seekers in Norway, and the deportation of immigrants convicted of crimes. In 2019 he was convicted of aggravated fraud for defrauding the Norwegian parliament and sentenced to 7 months imprisonment. He has been on leave from the Norwegian parliament since his indictment in 2018 and left the Progress Party in October 2019. In 2019 he was also arrested and charged with making violent threats. ==Early life and education== Born in Tehran, Iran. Mazyar Keshvari and his family left Iran in the aftermath of the Islamic Revolution because his family had ties to the Shah, and came to Norway as an asylum seeker in 1986, eventually settling in Oslo. Upon finishing Ulsrud Upper Secondary school in 2001, he enrolled at the BI Norwegian Business School and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Information and Public Relations in 2005. ==Political career== He joined the Youth of the Progress Party in 2001 and quickly became a rising star, first chairing the local Groruddalen chapter and later chairing its Oslo chapter from 2004 to 2006; he is still a member of its Central committee. He has also been editor-in-chief of the political magazine Fri Kapitalisme. He was first elected to Oslo city council in 2007, and was re-elected for another term in 2011, and is the current chairman of the Standing Committee on Health and Care Services. Since 2005, Keshvari has been serving as a deputy representative from Oslo to the Parliament of Norway. He was re-elected to a second four-year term running to 2013. Apart from politics he sits on the board of directors at the Sunnaas Hospital, as well as being chairman of the official Constitution Day committee. In 2013 he was elected as a deputy MP for a third term. As Siv Jensen was selected as a member of Solberg's Cabinet, Keshvari advanced to a regular representative. In 2019 he cancelled his membership in the Progress Party. == Political views  Iran === He has made his mark in the Norwegian public sphere as a staunch opponent of the Iranian theocracy, often condemning the regime in the media. In June 2009 he called for tough sanctions against Iran including a complete boycott of the regime. During the 2009 Iranian election protests he described the regime as not only a threat against the Iranian people, but the entire world at large. In response to the violent crackdown on the protesters he called the Iranian leadership a \\"terror- regime\\", and compared Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to comical Ali. A fierce critic of the Red-green coalition's foreign policy on Iran, he states : The Norwegian government's failed policies are putting world peace in danger. By giving this islamo-fascist regime with nuclear ambitions resources and technology, they are sustaining and legitimizing its existence === Immigration === Keshvari is known taking a hard stance on immigration, calling for a complete ban on further immigration to Norway, a stop to the practice of accepting asylum seekers in Norway, and the deportation of immigrants convicted of crimes. He has stated that immigrants who do not comply with \\"Norwegian values\\" should \\"beat it\\". He has repeatedly called for a complete ban on further immigration to Norway, stating that it is not sustainable in the long-term. Responding to government plans to open a centre for asylum- seekers on And√∏ya in 2008 he described the plans as \\"irresponsible\\" and \\"almost madness\\" and stated that immigration to Norway was \\"totally out of control\\". Outspoken against what he perceives as progressive ethnic segregation of Oslo neighborhoods, Keshvari has repeatedly accused fellow politicians who reside in Oslo's largely homogeneous west-end of having \\"elitist-attitudes\\" when praising the situation. Especially he targeted the Conservative Party's Julie Brodtkorb who he believed had \\"elitist-syndrome\\". In response to public outcry over the establishment of roma tent encampments in the center of Oslo during the summer of 2012, Keshvari demanded their \\"immediate expulsion\\" along with the forced closure of such camps, while reiterating the need for a total ban on public begging, but at the same he warned politicians against inflaming already high anti-roma sentiment in the city. He also opposes female genital mutilation. === Animal rights === Keshvari has advocated a rich and diverse wildlife in and around Oslo. He has opposed calls from the Centre Party for the culling of the grey wolf population in the √∏stmarka woods outside Oslo. == Controversy == In 2014 Keshvari was accused of making death threats against NRK debate moderator Ingunn Solheim in an Oslo pub. Keshvari maintained that the comments were made in jest, and NRK decided against filing charges. In 2018 Aftenposten revealed that Keshvari had received several reimbursements of travel expenses for trips that he could not possibly have made. Keshvari admitted to defrauding the Storting, and declared that he wanted to make amends and pay back the reimbursements.. In October 2019, he canceled his membership in the Progress Party and he was sentenced to seven months prison for gross fraud. In February 2019, Keshvari was arrested for making \\"serious threats\\" involving a firearm. He has denied any wrongdoing. ==Personal life== He lives in the Oslo suburb of Ellingsrud. A lifelong aficionado of Persian culture and cuisine, his favourite food is Jujeh kabab. He is also a patron of fine arts including paintings, and especially the works of Edvard Munch, replicas of which adorned his former office at Oslo City Hall. ==References External links == * *Official Twitter account Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Norwegian fraudsters Category:Prisoners and detainees of Norway Category:Iranian emigrants to Norway Category:Progress Party (Norway) politicians Category:Members of the Storting Category:Politicians from Oslo Category:BI Norwegian Business School alumni Category:People from Tehran Category:Norwegian politicians of Iranian descent Category:21st-century Norwegian politicians ","title":"Mazyar Keshvari"},{"id":"19326570","text":"The Smart EQ Fortwo, formerly Smart Fortwo electric drive, smart ed or Smart Fortwo EV, is a battery electric vehicle variant of the Smart Fortwo city car made by Smart.

It had a capacity of 5,000 if including the club 'status', which was part of the building but was advertised as a second nightclub in the earlier years. Otherwise, the capacity was 4,500, with a 2,200 capacity in the downstairs section, and a 2,300 capacity in the higher levels. The higher floors were tiered, with the VIP section being at the top of the tier overlooking a balcony section below which itself overlooked the dancefloor. The dance floor area had a revolving dance floor in the middle of it. This whole upper section of floors was a single open space and was named the 'Dance Arena'. ==HistoryABC Theatre=== The building was originally an ABC theatre and then a cinema. The former Hippodrome Theatre was bought by Associated British Cinemas (ABC) in April 1929. They planned to rebuild it in 1939, which was halted by the outbreak of World War II. The theatre closed in 1960. Most of the building was then demolished and the new ABC Theatre was built in the shell of the old building with stalls and circle seating with a capacity of 1,934. It also had a permanent revolving stage. The ABC Theatre opened on 31 May 1963 with the Holiday Carnival summer season stage show which starred Cliff Richard and The Shadows. It was used for stage shows during the summer months with films and concerts in the winter. ABC Weekend Television televised their Blackpool Night Out show from the theatre which starred the likes of Freddie Davies, Mike & Bernie Winters and Pearl Carr & Teddy Johnson. The Beatles played a concert there in 1963 and in August 1965 they played at the Blackpool Night Out on ABC Weekend Television. It was the first time they had played the song \\"Yesterday\\" on British television and the gig has become popular on the video sharing website YouTube. Four songs they sang live at the gig appeared on the Anthology 2 compilation album in 1996 ‚Äì \\"I Feel Fine\\", \\"Ticket to Ride\\", \\"Yesterday\\" and \\"Help!\\". The Beatles were also shown singing \\"Help\\" at the ABC in Episode four of the 1995 The Beatles Anthology documentary series. The summer shows starred the likes of Frank Ifield, Cilla Black, Morcambe and Wise, and Tommy Steele. ===ABC Cinema=== In January 1981, the theatre closed and was converted into a triple screen cinema which reopened on 30 April 1981, although the revolving stage was retained together with the orchestra pit, original proscenium and front stalls and dressing rooms, though hidden behind the screens. The circle was used for one screen with the stalls divided into two screens. It was renamed the Cannon Cinema in 1986, the MGM Cinema in May 1993 before reverting to the ABC name. It closed as a cinema in July 2000. ===The Syndicate=== The ABC building was bought in the summer of 2001 for about ¬£4million by local entrepreneurs Mike and Sandra Nordwind and converted into the Syndicate nightclub. It opened in December 2002, with none of the original interior remaining. The club was closed for a month in October 2005 when it lost its late night drinks licence in court, after Blackpool Police had presented a dossier of alleged violence at the club, which magistrates decided was so serious they withdrew the licence to sell alcohol after 11:00 pm. The club re-opened on 26 November after agreeing to withdraw their application for a new 4 am licence. After the club closed in January 2006 following the refusal of a 4am licence, it was bought in May by national operator Nexum Leisure who undertook a ¬£1m refurbishment of the venue. In June 2007 the venue launched a weekly Polish Night (Polska Noc) aimed at the resorts Polish and Eastern European population. On 7 September 2008, John Robb the vocalist in the punk rock band Goldblade who co-founded The Membranes in Blackpool in 1977 and who also works as a journalist and television pundit, hosted a special event entitled \\"A Celebration of Music, Fashion & Football 1975‚Äì1995\\" at the Syndicate, with guest speakers Andy Nicholls, Shane Meadows and former Inspiral Carpets musician Clint Boon. On 14 September 2008 the Syndicate staged a boxing event with American former world heavyweight champion, Tim Witherspoon making a guest appearance. Eric \\"Butterbean\\" Esch took on Mark Potter for the European Boxing Federation Heavyweight title. The Syndicate closed on 10 August 2011, posting a closing notice on Facebook. ==References *Syndicate Group website Category:Buildings and structures in Blackpool Category:Nightclubs in England Category:Music venues in Lancashire ","title":"Syndicate Blackpool"},{"id":"19326660","text":"William Pole Thornhill (1807 ‚Äì 12 February 1876) was a British Whig and then Liberal Party politician.

These preferences are traditionally associated with certain regions. Hence, the Central European pattern of alcohol consumption is associated with beer-drinking, the Mediterranean pattern with wine-drinking and the Eastern or Northern European pattern with spirit-drinking countries. However, traditional preferences do not necessarily correspond to current drinking habits, as beer has become the most popular alcoholic drink world- wide. ==Countries preferring spirits== The following countries are significant producers and consumers of spirits, particularly vodka: *Sweden *Norway *Iceland *Finland *Estonia *Latvia *Lithuania *Russia *Belarus *Ukraine *Poland\\"Krakow Beverages\\" at krakow-info.com (preferring beer as well) *Slovakia (preferring beer as well) The southern boundary of this region corresponds to the ‚àí2 ¬∞C January isotherm in lowlands. With the exception of Poland, Ukraine, and some regions of southern Russia, cultivation of grapes is impossible or very difficult. EU-countries preferring vodka produce over 70% of the EU's vodka. Vodka preference is sometimes associated exclusively with the Slavic countries of Central and Eastern Europe, as they are the historical homeland of vodka (Poland and Russia being the nations most often associated with the invention of the drink). Before the 19th century, vodka was considered very much a \\"people's drink\\" that was common among the peasantry who made up the majority of the population in most countries of the time, while the aristocracy preferred imported wines or other alcoholic drinks that were considered less plebeian. There are exceptions, such as ≈ªubr√≥wka, a type of Polish vodka that dates back to the 16th century, which became popular among the szlachta (nobility) as well as the peasantry as early as the 18th century. In his book about the Soviet Union,Alex de Jonge, \\"Stalin and the Shaping of the Soviet Union\\", Collins, (1986), , the relevant excerpt online Alex de Jonge elaborates on his concept of \\"geoalcoholics\\". In particular, he explains Russian peculiarities by their belonging to the vodka belt and the absence of the beer belt in the Soviet Union. Other than the prevalent hard liquor, the vodka belt is also characterised by a higher occurrence of binge drinking compared to the rest of Europe.\\"Alcohol Alert Digest\\", Institute of Alcohol Studies, UK. Likewise, in his Russia and the Russians, historian Geoffrey Hoskins notes the distinct effect vodka culture has had on the countries of the former Russian Empire, creating drinking as a social problem on a different level from other European countries. In many countries traditionally preferring vodka, the spirit has been supplanted by beer as the alcoholic drink of choice since the early 21st century. Residents of Finland and Sweden consume twice as much beer as vodka (in terms of pure alcohol).\\"Alcohol in Postwar Europe: A Discussion of Indicators on Consumption and Alcohol-Related Harm\\" The Polish Beer-Lovers' Party (which won 16 seats in the Sejm in 1991) was founded on the notion of fighting alcoholism by a cultural abandonment of vodka for beer. And indeed in 1998, beer surpassed vodka as the most popular alcoholic drink in Poland. The term has received much attention since 2006 in the context of the \\"vodka war\\"Vodka war: \\"MEPs serve up a compromise cocktail\\", a Europarliament news article within the European Union about the standardisation of vodka: the vodka-preferring countries insist that only spirits produced from grains and potato must be allowed to be branded as \\"vodka\\", according to the long established traditions of its production, a brand protection similar to the \\"protected designation of origin\\"., a 25 October 2006 Reuters article\\"A spirited war: The search for the real vodka\\", International Herald Tribune, 23 November 2006 The \\"Schnellhardt compromise\\", proposed by Horst Schnellhardt, suggests that vodkas from other than cereals, potatoes and molasses, should be labeled to say \\"Vodka produced from\\". ==Countries preferring beer== Countries in Europe in which beer is historically the most popular alcoholic drink are located to the southwest of countries preferring vodka and to the northeast of the countries preferring wine. These countries' geography is closely tied to the historical growing range of its two main ingredients, barley and hops. Barley was first domesticated during the Neolithic in the ancient Near East. It has been brewed into beer-like beverages for thousands of years, and grown in most of Europe since ancient times. Hops are more narrowly distributed, preferring humid temperate climates, similar to potatoes. Originally, European \\"ale\\" (not yet called beer) was produced without hops, which were introduced to Europe from the east. The first evidence of hops in Europe dates from , in the Hallertau region of present-day Germany, although the first mention of the use of hops in brewing in that country was not until 1079. The westward spread of hops was slow, not reaching England until 1524. Ireland was still importing hops in the eighteenth century; more than 500 tons of English hops were imported through Dublin alone in 1752.\\"The London magazine, 1752\\", page 332 In 1516, the Bavarian Reinheitsgebot (\\"Purity Law\\") established that barley, hops and water were the only allowable ingredients in beer (yeast was considered a by-product rather than an ingredient). This became the template for beers across Europe. While non-barley beers (e.g. wheat beer), and non-hopped-beers (e.g. flavoured with gruit) are still produced, across most of Europe \\"beer\\" is synonymous with barley and hops. Since the northern range of hops does not include most of Scandinavia or Russia (or much of Scotland), these areas, for the most part, are outside of the beer belt and lie in the vodka/whisky belt. the beer- preferring countries includes Belgium, Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Norway, Germany, some parts of Austria, Luxembourg, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Slovenia, Central Federal District of Russia, the northern and eastern (German-speaking) cantons of Switzerland and the French regions of Alsace, Lorraine, Nord-Pas-de-Calais and the d√©partment of Ardennes. There is quite a bit of overlap in these French regions, as well as in southwestern Germany and parts of Austria, due to the considerable consumption and cultivation of wine there, and Poland is also a part of the vodka belt. In 2016, UNESCO inscribed Belgian beer culture on their list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity. ==Countries preferring wine== Countries in Europe in which wine is historically the most popular alcoholic drink are located to the south of countries preferring beer or vodka. The wine belt has been variously defined as approximately between 41¬∞N - 44¬∞N, 30¬∞N - 50¬∞N, and 35¬∞N - 50/51¬∞N. Countries in the wine belt include Spain, Portugal, Italy, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Greece, Cyprus, Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Croatia, Bulgaria, Turkey, San Marino, Switzerland, Romania, France, and Southern Federal District of Russia. The countries of Austria, Hungary, and Slovenia may sometimes be considered as part of the wine belt, but they overlap largely and are in line more with the Beer Belt instead. Additionally, Southwest England (if one classes cider as a wine analogue), parts of the Low Countries, southwestern Germany and parts of Austria could be considered to lie either within the belt or within an overlap region. The UNESCO has declared some wine region in its World Heritage Sites: *France: Champagne hillsides, houses and cellars *Hungary: Tokaj wine region *Italy: Vineyard Landscape of Piedmont: Langhe-Roero and Monferrato, the traditional agricultural practice of cultivating the \\"vite ad alberello\\" (head-trained bush vines) of the community of Pantelleria and the Prosecco Hills of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene. *Portugal: Alto Douro Wine Region and Landscape of the Pico Island Vineyard Culture *Switzerland: Lavaux vineyard terraces ==See also== * List of national drinks ==References== Category:Regions of Europe Category:Belt regions Category:History of alcoholic drinks Category:Alcohol in Europe ","title":"Alcohol preferences in Europe"},{"id":"19326703","text":"Rubina Rana (27 May 1956 - 15 July 2003) was a Pakistani Norwegian politician for the Labour Party.

A spill may involve all leadership positions (leader and deputy leader in both houses), or just the leader. Where a rival to the existing leader calls for a spill, it may also be called a leadership challenge. When a leadership vacancy arises due to the voluntary resignation or death of the incumbent, the resulting leadership ballot is not a leadership spill. Therefore, the 1968 Liberal Party leadership ballot after the disappearance of Harold Holt was not a leadership spill, despite the contest involving four candidates. In Australian English the use of the word \\"spill\\" in this context has a long history, with its first recorded appearance traced to a Canberra Times article dated 20 August 1945. A leadership spill may result in a new hierarchy, or may confirm the status quo. If the party in question is in government, the election of a new leader will result in a new Prime Minister, Premier or Chief Minister; if the party is the opposition, the election of a new leader will result in a new Opposition Leader. There were 72 leadership spills between 1970 and 2015; the phenomenon became increasingly common in the early 21st century. None occurred in the 1960s, 10 in the 1970s, 18 in the 1980s, 13 in the 1990s, and 31 between 2000 and 2015. Spills are three times more likely to occur when a party is in opposition compared to when it holds government. The frequent leadership spills and political instability in the 21st century ‚Äì which saw five changes of Prime Ministers between 2010 and 2018 ‚Äì has led to Australia being dubbed \\"coup capital of the democratic world\\". ==Process== In the Westminster system of government, the leader of the party which forms government becomes the Prime Minister, while the leader of the largest party not in government becomes leader of the Opposition. Contenders for the role of leader of a major party usually (but not always) come from the cabinet or shadow cabinet. A leadership spill occurs when a member or members of the parliamentary party feel that the leader is taking the party in an undesirable direction or is simply not delivering on promises made to those who elected the leader, and does not have the numbers to back his or her position. A spill may be triggered by consistently poor opinion polls. A spill can be initiated by the party leader in office, usually in the hope of gaining a fresh mandate to quell dissenting voices in the party. It may occur at any time, leaving the person in the leadership position always 'on notice'. ===Federal ALP changes=== Following his return to the leadership of the Australian Labor Party in 2013, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd sought changes to the party's rules so that leadership spills would be more difficult to launch in future. The changes included the requirement for 75% support within the Australian Labor Party Caucus for a special leadership ballot against a sitting Labor prime minister, or 60% against an opposition leader. Another change was that future leadership ballots would include equally weighted voting rights between the caucus and party rank and file members with each block being counted separately and worth 50% of the total. The rule that a Labor prime minister can only be removed if 75 per cent of MPs agree to force a ballot (or 60 per cent of caucus for an opposition leader) is a caucus-approved rule and was not included in the 2018 National Platform. ===Federal Liberal Party changes=== Following the oustings of two Liberal Prime Ministers in 3 years, Scott Morrison, who won the leadership spill of 24 August 2018 introduced a new threshold to trigger a Liberal Party leadership change in government, requiring two-thirds of the partyroom vote to trigger a spill motion. The change was introduced at an hour long party room meeting on the evening of 3 December 2018. Morrison said the changes, which were drafted with feedback from former prime ministers John Howard and Tony Abbott, would only apply to leaders who lead the party to victory at a federal election. ==Impact== Historically, a governing party's replacement of its leader fails to improve its electoral fortunes. Across state and federal politics between 1970 and 2014, over 90% of governing parties that replaced their leader lost their majority at the subsequent election. The chances of success are higher when the party is in opposition, leading to success at the subsequent election about 50% of the time. ==Notable spill motions== The following spill motions occurred during a parliamentary term, rather than in the aftermath of an election loss. Colours denote the party holding the leadership spill motion. Blue represents the Liberal Party, red the Labor Party, and green the National Party. ===Federal=== {  - !Spill date ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Party !Status !Incumbent !Contenders !Outcome - 2 March 1931    Labor Government James Scullin  *James Scullin (Prime Minister) *Jack Beasley (Assistant Minister for Industry) During the 1931 Labor Party split, Prime Minister James Scullin was challenged by Jack Beasley of the Lang Labor faction, winning by 40 votes to five with seven abstentions. - 27 April 1966    Labor Opposition Arthur Calwell  *Arthur Calwell (Opposition Leader) *Gough Whitlam (Deputy Leader) Calwell defeated Whitlam by 49 votes to 25 after promising to resign if Labor did not win the November 1966 federal election. - 30 April 1968    Labor Opposition Gough Whitlam  *Gough Whitlam (Opposition Leader) *Jim Cairns Whitlam called a spill after conflict with the National Executive.

Premiered in September 2013, Sonic Movement proposes creating a new \\"adaptive\\" system of warning sounds and noises for electric cars, which is in opposition to another industry trend of replicating combustion engine noises for electric car sound effects. Founders James Brooks and Fernando Oca√±a are on the design team, as well as artists Holly Herndon and Matt Dryhurst. The project aims to meet a proposal for a US mandate which would require all quiet electric vehicles to emit warning sounds, as well as legislation passed by the European parliament in April 2014, which states that all new electric cars sold in the EU had to emit noise by 2019. However, Oca√±a notes that while legislators are \\"looking at this from a technical point of view, [Sonic Movement is] looking at it from a user experience point of view.\\" ==References * semcon.com * Semcon's share information Category:Companies based in Gothenburg Category:Multinational companies headquartered in Sweden Category:1980 establishments in Sweden Category:Companies established in 1980 Category:Engineering companies of Sweden Category:Companies listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange ","title":"Semcon"},{"id":"19326884","text":"A spill of the leadership of the Liberal Party of Australia took place on 15 September 2008. At a ballot on 16 September, Shadow Treasurer Malcolm Turnbull defeated the incumbent leader Brendan Nelson 45 votes to 41. ==Background== The Liberal-National coalition led by Prime Minister John Howard was defeated at the 2007 federal election by the Australian Labor Party led by Kevin Rudd. In the aftermath, Brendan Nelson was elected leader in an ensuing ballot, in a 45-42 vote against former Minister for the Environment, Malcolm Turnbull. Nelson's leadership came under intense pressure throughout 2008. Newspoll polling in February 2008 set a record low \\"Preferred Prime Minister\\" rating for any opposition leader at 9 percent, with March polling setting another record of 7 percent, with two party preferred setting another Newspoll record at 37-63 percent. In response to increased speculation about his leadership Nelson commented in April that he \\"will keep fighting and standing up for everyday Australians.\\" Support for Nelson as leader within the Liberal Party had all but collapsed by the end of July 2008, in part due to repeated gaffes on emissions trading and climate change. Expected to challenge him was either Peter Costello or Malcolm Turnbull, upon the release of Costello's book, The Costello Memoirs. Costello stated he would not be making any move for the Liberal leadership, but media outlets capitalised on Costello's failure to categorically rule out any future leadership challenge.

It was the first public exhibition shown in Germany of recent research on gay life. In 1985 the Verein der Freunde eines Schwulen Museums in Berlin e.V. (Society of Friends of a Gay Museum in Berlin) was founded and opened its own museum dedicated exclusively to LGBTQ+ topics at Mehringdamm 61 in the district of Kreuzberg.

The name of this Corolla model was taken from one of the New Zealand venues of the Tasman Series motor races. However Levin in Old English does mean lightning and Trueno in Spanish means thunder. In Japan, the Corolla Levin was exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store locations, and the Sprinter Trueno was exclusive to Toyota Auto Store locations, later renamed Toyota Vista Store in 1980. __TOC__ ==TE27 Series (1972‚Äì1974)== 1972 Toyota Corolla Levin 1600 (TE27) Toyota Sprinter Trueno (TE27) The first Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno of early 1972 were the high performance models of Corolla and Sprinter 2 door fastback coupe. They were powered by the 1.6 liter engines mated to a 5 speed manual transmission, borrowed from the Toyota Celica 1600GT. The inspiration came from Toyota manager Geisuke Kubo who wanted to offer something similar to the Alfa Romeo Giula Junior.‰Ωê„ÄÖÊú®Á¥´ÈÉé „Ç§„É≥„Çø„Éì„É•„Éº The Sprinter Trueno J had the 2T-B OHV with twin down draft carburettors. The other Levins and Truenos used the 2T-G (high compression) or 2T-GR (low compression) DOHC engines with two double venturi side draft Mikuni carburettors. Vehicles installed with the 1.6 litre engine obligated Japanese owners to pay more annual road tax. ==TE37, TE47, TE51, TE55, TE61, TE62 & TE65 Series (1974‚Äì1979)== 1977 Toyota Corolla Coupe 1600 Levin (TE51) 1975 Toyota Corolla Hardtop 1600 Levin (TE37) 1975 Toyota Sprinter Trueno 1600 GT (TE47) With the second generation of the Levin and Trueno Sprinter there was a clearer difference between the two through design. Though based on the same shell the whole nose design differed totally with the Levin (TE51 and TE55) having an aggressive forward raked design while the Trueno Sprinter (TE47, TE61, TE62 and TE65) had a sleeker and more curved design. In contrast to its predecessor this second generation of Levin and Trueno Sprinter was offered with a much wider array of engines and trim. The Trueno LT grade used the plain 2T engine and the Trueno ST grade used the twin downdraft carburettors 2T-B engine. The Levin and Trueno GT grades used the 2T-G engine with DOHC head from the previous TE27 with from two double Mikuni Solex carburettors and later with from the 2T-GEU engine with a Bosch K-Jetronic EFI system. ==AE71/TE71/TE72/TE75 Series (1979‚Äì1983)== Toyota Corolla Levin (TE71) Although the sporty Corolla and Sprinter available as 2 door Sedan, 2 door Hardtop, 3 door Coupe, and 3 door Liftback, the Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno were only produced as 3 door Coupe (TE71). Trim levels for the Japanese models were Base, S, and GT APEX, all with 2T-G engine. In the United States, the Corolla Levin was sold as SR5 with 1.6 liter 4A-C engine (AE71) and 1.8 liter 3T engine (TE72/75). ==AE85/86 Series (1983‚Äì1987)== The American version Corolla SR5 Coupe (AE86) The European version Corolla Levin 1600 GT Liftback (AE86) Toyota Sprinter Trueno 3-door (AE86) In this generation, the Corolla Levin came with fixed rectangular headlights which distinguished it from the Sprinter Trueno with retractable headlights. However, the American Corolla SR5 and GT-S also had retractable headlights the same as Japanese Trueno, but with longer bumpers to meet the US Federal standards. Engine *4A-GEU (16 valve): AE86 GT, GT APEX, GT-V Models *4A-GEC (16 valve): AE86 Corolla GT-S Model *4A-C (8 valve): AE86 SR5 Model *3A-U: AE85 SR, GT Models ==AE91/92 Series (1987‚Äì1991)== The Japanese version Corolla Levin 1.6 GT (AE92) The American version Corolla 1.6 GT-S (AE92) 1987 Toyota Sprinter Trueno 1.6 GT-Z (AE92) Like the previous generation, the Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno have different headlight styles. Again, American Corolla Coupe SR5 and GT-S adopted retractable headlights like the Trueno. This is the last generation of Corolla Coupe in America. The SR5 was powered by 4A-F engine, the GT-S came with high performance 4A-GE engine, while the GT-Z came with a 4A-GZE engine. Earlier GT-Zs were equipped with DLI and an AFM sensor while later versions would change to a MAP, oil squirters on the 4A block and a set of forged pistons. ==AE100/101 Series (1991‚Äì1995)== 1993‚Äì1995 Toyota Corolla Levin (AE101) GT Apex Toyota Sprinter Trueno GT APEX (AE101) Engine *4A-GE (20v)Silver-Top: GT Apex, GT Models *4A-GZE (Supercharged): GT-Z Model *4A-FE: SJ Model *5A-FE: S Model ==AE110/111/112 series (1995‚Äì2000)== 1997‚Äì2000 Toyota Corolla Levin BZ-R (AE111) 1995 Toyota Corolla Levin BZ-G (AE111) Toyota Sprinter Trueno XZ (AE111) Pre Facelift *Manufactured from 1995 to 1997 Facelift Model *Manufactured from 1997 to 2000 Engine *4A-GE (20v )\\"Black-Top\\": BZ-V, BZ-G, BZ-R Models *4A-FE: XZ Model *5A-FE: FZ Model The BZ-R variant featured a 6 speed manual transmission, LSD, bigger front rotors, ABS, improved calipers, a taller rear spoiler and Super Strut Suspension (SS) all of which could be added to the BZ-G and BZ-V models as factory options. Additionally a set of Recaro SR3 (confetti pattern) seats could be installed as a factory option. This is the last series where the Trueno name was used, as the Toyota Sprinter was discontinued, the Corolla Levin continued to be made. == Other uses of \\"Levin\\" name == The name \\"Corolla Levin\\" was later revived for the Toyota Auris in Australia and New Zealand, where certain Corolla trim levels have the Levin label.

Castiglione demonstrated that they were ready to climb up the Italian League, as the club won the Seconda Categoria title by one point over Roccalumera. ;Season 2004/2005 Following their promotion to the Prima Categoria, Castiglione, changed coaches, as Gaetano Mirto took over the helm. Castiglione spent the bulk of the 2004‚Äì2005 season, high up in the Prima Categoria table, and on the final match day was promoted again, leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of Linguaglossa Calcio, who would now remain in the Italian 8th tier. ;Season 2005/2006 Following their promotion to Promozione, the 7th tier of Italian football, Castiglione made few changes to the team, but drafted several players, under the advice of coach Mirto. Following the dilemma of financial issues that nearly cost the team its place with the Promozione, the club launched and did not stop. Coming to the conclusion of yet another impressive season, Mirto found his team just two points adrift of Fiumefreddo Calcio. The Eastern Sicilian club won the play-off contest in Pozzallo Plagonia 1‚Äì0 in extra ends and the team won promotion to Eccellenza. During the season the club also participated in the Coppa Italia, but was eliminated in the second round. Youth coach Antonino Tedesco led the Castiglione Primavera youth squad to a second-place finish in the Junior Championship and also a Provincial Group win. ;Season 2006/2007 Now in Eccellenza, the club again nearly dropped out due to economic problems which postponed the decision to enter the team until the last minute. The club officially remained in the division, and the coach Mirto remained. He put together a team of youth supported by several players of more experience, who remained with the club. After a positive start, and a solid mid-season position, Mirto found his team in the play-outs, after a late season stumble. After the final contest of the season, Castiglione met Plagonia Spadaforese in the play-outs. After holding a better seasonal head to head record, Castiglione had the advantage and a 0‚Äì0 draw allowed the club to remain in Eccellenza. In the same year the regional final of the Coppa Italia also took place. The Primavera also won the regional final beating teams like Palazzolo, Fiumefreddo and Nissa. On the national stage the juniors were defeated for the first time in the second round by Pianura. ;Season 2007‚Äì2008 Castiglione had another string of good performances during Eccellenza 2007‚Äì2008, as the club would dominate the league, and hence gain promotion to Serie D. The conquest to Serie D by a small central club like Castiglione di Sicilia, was extraordinary. No one could suppose that the exceptional escalation, in a few years, would bring the Castiglione from the Seconda Categoria up to the highest levels of the Lega Calcio amateur football with three consecutive promotions (Seconda Categoria to Eccellenza) and after a salvation won the play-out, and then, winning Eccellenza Sicily to earn promotion again. The club's exceptional exploits were very much equally divided between companies, the technical staff, and team environment. The club's two presidents, Carmelo Ginardi and Giovanni Zumbo, Nino Mollica, and head coach Gaetano Mirto, all remained with the club for its Serie D adventure. ;Season 2008‚Äì2009 For the Serie D adventure, ASD Castiglione Calcio started off well, but soon dropped down the table, and by the end of the season was fighting for salvation. Their efforts were not enough, and the club finished second from bottom in the Serie D G/I table and was relegated back down to the Eccellenza. The league was won however by fellow Sicilians, U.S. Siracusa. ==References * Official homepage Category:Football clubs in Italy Category:Football clubs in Sicily Category:1946 establishments in Italy ","title":"A.S.D.

Pluto and the other dwarf planets are not shown. The relative sizes of objects are drawn to scale; the distances between them are not. A photo of Earth (circled) taken by Voyager 1, 6.4 billion kilometers (4 billion miles) away. The streaks of light are diffraction spikes radiating from the Sun (off frame to the left). This photograph is known as Pale Blue Dot. Discovery and exploration of the Solar System is observation, visitation, and increase in knowledge and understanding of Earth's \\"cosmic neighborhood\\". This includes the Sun, Earth and the Moon, the major planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, their satellites, as well as smaller bodies including comets, asteroids, and dust. ==History== Earth's atmosphere Pioneer space probe's Quadrispherical Plasma Analyzer For many thousands of years, astronomers maintained a geocentric world view and did not recognize the existence of a Solar System. Most believed Earth was stationary at the center of the Universe and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky. Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos, Nicolaus Copernicus in the 16th century developed a mathematically predictive heliocentric system. His 17th- century successors Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton, developed a modern understanding of physics that led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that Earth moves around the Sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that govern Earth. In more recent times, this led to the investigation of geological phenomena such as mountains and craters and seasonal meteorological phenomena such as clouds, dust storms, and ice caps on the other planets. ==Antiquity and first observationsTelescopic observations== A replica of Isaac Newton's telescope. The first exploration of the Solar System was conducted by telescope, when astronomers first began to map those objects too faint to be seen with the naked eye. Galileo was the first to discover physical details about the individual bodies of the Solar System. He discovered that the Moon was cratered, that the Sun was marked with sunspots, and that Jupiter had four satellites in orbit around it. Christiaan Huygens followed on from Galileo's discoveries by discovering Saturn's moon Titan and the shape of the rings of Saturn. Giovanni Domenico Cassini later discovered four more moons of Saturn and the Cassini division in Saturn's rings. The Sun photographed through a telescope with special solar filter. Sunspots and limb darkening can be clearly seen. Mercury is transiting in the lower middle of the Sun's face. Edmond Halley realised in 1705 that repeated sightings of a comet were recording the same object, returning regularly once every 75‚Äì76 years. This was the first evidence that anything other than the planets orbited the Sun. Around this time (1704), the term \\"Solar System\\" first appeared in English. In 1781, William Herschel was looking for binary stars in the constellation of Taurus when he observed what he thought was a new comet. Its orbit revealed that it was a new planet, Uranus, the first ever discovered. Giuseppe Piazzi discovered Ceres in 1801, a small world between Mars and Jupiter. It was considered another planet, but after subsequent discoveries of other small worlds in the same region, it and the others were eventually reclassificated as asteroids. By 1846, discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus led many to suspect a large planet must be tugging at it from farther out. Urbain Le Verrier's calculations eventually led to the discovery of Neptune. The excess perihelion precession of Mercury's orbit led Le Verrier to postulate the intra-Mercurian planet Vulcan in 1859, but that would turn out to be an irrelevant thesis. Although it is debatable when the Solar System was truly \\"discovered\\", three 19th century observations determined its nature and place in the Universe beyond reasonable doubt. First, in 1838, Friedrich Bessel successfully measured a stellar parallax, an apparent shift in the position of a star created by Earth's motion around the Sun. This was not only the first direct, experimental proof of heliocentrism, but also revealed, for the first time, the vast distance between the Solar System and the stars. Then, in 1859, Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff, using the newly invented spectroscope, examined the spectral signature of the Sun and discovered that it was composed of the same elements as existed on Earth, establishing for the first time a physical similarity between Earth and the other bodies visible from Earth. Then, Father Angelo Secchi compared the spectral signature of the Sun with those of other stars, and found them virtually identical. The realisation that the Sun was a star led to the hypothesis that other stars could have systems of their own, though this was not to be proven for nearly 140 years. Radar-imaging of , a small near-Earth asteroid that passed by Earth in early February 2014 Further apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the outer planets led Percival Lowell to conclude that yet another planet, \\"Planet X\\", must lie beyond Neptune. After his death, his Lowell Observatory conducted a search that ultimately led to Clyde Tombaugh's discovery of Pluto in 1930. Pluto was, however, found to be too small to have disrupted the orbits of the outer planets, and its discovery was therefore coincidental. Like Ceres, it was initially considered to be a planet, but after the discovery of many other similarly sized objects in its vicinity it was reclassified in 2006 as a dwarf planet by the IAU. In 1992, the first evidence of a planetary system other than our own was discovered, orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12. Three years later, 51 Pegasi b, the first extrasolar planet around a Sunlike star, was discovered. As of 2017, 2687 extrasolar systems have been found. Also in 1992, astronomers David C. Jewitt of the University of Hawaii and Jane Luu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology discovered 15760 Albion. This object proved to be the first of a new population, which became known as the Kuiper belt; an icy analogue to the asteroid belt of which such objects as Pluto and Charon were deemed a part. Mike Brown, Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz announced the discovery of Eris in 2005, a scattered disc object initially thought to be larger than Pluto, which would make it the largest object discovered in orbit around the Sun since Neptune. New Horizons' fly-by of Pluto in July 2015 resulted in more-accurate measurements of Pluto, which is slightly larger, though less massive, than Eris. ==Observations by spacecraft== Lineae on Europa by Galileo spacecraft Timeline of Solar System exploration. Artist's conception of Pioneer 10, which passed the orbit of Pluto in 1983. The last transmission was received in January 2003, sent from approximately 82 AU away. The -year-old space probe is receding from the Sun at over 43,400 km/h (27,000 mph), so long as it has not hit anything Since the start of the Space Age, a great deal of exploration has been performed by robotic spacecraft missions that have been organized and executed by various space agencies. All planets in the Solar System have now been visited to varying degrees by spacecraft launched from Earth. Through these unmanned missions, humans have been able to get close-up photographs of all the planets and, in the case of landers, perform tests of the soils and atmospheres of some. The first artificial object sent into space was the Soviet satellite Sputnik 1, launched in 1957, which successfully orbited Earth until 4 January the following year. The American probe Explorer 6, launched in 1959, was the first satellite to image Earth from space. ===Flybys=== The first successful probe to fly by another Solar System body was Luna 1, which sped past the Moon in 1959. Originally meant to impact with the Moon, it instead missed its target and became the first artificial object to orbit the Sun. Mariner 2 was the first planetary flyby, passing Venus in 1962. The first successful flyby of Mars was made by Mariner 4 in 1965. Mariner 10 first passed Mercury in 1974. The first probe to explore the outer planets was Pioneer 10, which flew by Jupiter in 1973. Pioneer 11 was the first to visit Saturn, in 1979. The Voyager probes performed a grand tour of the outer planets following their launch in 1977, with both probes passing Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980 - 1981\\\\. Voyager 2 then went on to make close approaches to Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989. The two Voyager probes are now far beyond Neptune's orbit, and are on course to find and study the termination shock, heliosheath, and heliopause. According to NASA, both Voyager probes have encountered the termination shock at a distance of approximately 93 AU from the Sun. The first flyby of a comet occurred in 1985, when the International Cometary Explorer (ICE) passed by the comet Giacobini‚ÄìZinner,Comet Space Missions, accessed 2007-10-23. whereas the first flybys of asteroids were conducted by the Galileo space probe, which imaged both 951 Gaspra (in 1991) and 243 Ida (in 1993) on its way to Jupiter. Launched on January 19, 2006, the New Horizons probe is the first man-made spacecraft to explore the Kuiper belt. This unmanned mission flew by Pluto in July 2015. The mission was extended to observe a number of other Kuiper belt objects, including a close flyby of 486958 Arrokoth on New Year's Day, 2019. As of 2011, American scientists are concerned that exploration beyond the Asteroid Belt will hampered by a shortage of Plutonium-238. ===Orbiters, rovers and landers=== Curiosity rover self-portrait at \\"Rocknest\\" (October 31, 2012), with the rim of Gale Crater and the slopes of Aeolis Mons in the distance. In 1966, the Moon became the first Solar System body beyond Earth to be orbited by an artificial satellite (Luna 10), followed by Mars in 1971 (Mariner 9), Venus in 1975 (Venera 9), Jupiter in 1995 (Galileo), the asteroid 433 Eros in 2000 (NEAR Shoemaker), Saturn in 2004 (Cassini‚ÄìHuygens), and Mercury and Vesta in 2011 (MESSENGER and Dawn respectively). Dawn is orbiting the asteroid‚Äìdwarf planet Ceres as of 2015. The first probe to land on another Solar System body was the Soviet Luna 2 probe, which impacted the Moon in 1959. Since then, increasingly distant planets have been reached, with probes landing on or impacting the surfaces of Venus in 1966 (Venera 3), Mars in 1971 (Mars 3, although a fully successful landing didn't occur until Viking 1 in 1976), the asteroid 433 Eros in 2001 (NEAR Shoemaker), and Saturn's moon Titan (Huygens) and the comet Tempel 1 (Deep Impact) in 2005. The Galileo orbiter also dropped a probe into Jupiter's atmosphere in 1995; because Jupiter has no physical surface, it was destroyed by increasing temperature and pressure as it descended. To date, only two worlds in the Solar System, the Moon and Mars, have been visited by mobile rovers. The first robotic rover to visit another celestial body was the Soviet Lunokhod 1, which landed on the Moon in 1970. The first to visit another planet was Sojourner, which travelled 500 metres across the surface of Mars in 1997. The only manned rover to visit another world was NASA's Lunar Roving Vehicle, which traveled with Apollos 15, 16 and 17 between 1971 and 1972. ===Spacecraft exploration=== Overview of some missions to the Solar System. {  style=\\"float: left; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 1em;\\" + Examples of missions - ! # !Spacecraft !Launch year !Mercury !Venus !Mars !Ceres !Jupiter !Saturn !Uranus !Neptune !Pluto !End year -  1 Venera 3 1965           1966 -  2 Pioneer 10 1972           2003 -  3 Pioneer 11 1973           1995 -  4 Mariner 10 1973           1975 -  5 Voyager 1 1977          ‚Äî -  6 Voyager 2 1977          ‚Äî -  7 Galileo 1989          2003 -  8 Ulysses 1990          2009 -  9 Cassini 1997          2017 -  10 Mars Odyssey 2001          ‚Äî -  11 MER-A / B 2003           2010 / 2018 -  12 Mars Express 2003          ‚Äî -  13 MESSENGER 2004          2015 -  14 MRO 2005          ‚Äî -  15 Venus Express 2005          2014 -  16 New Horizons 2006          ‚Äî -  17  Dawn 2007          2018 -  18 Juno 2011          ‚Äî -  19 Curiosity (MSL) 2011          ‚Äî } See also the categories for missions to comets, asteroids, the Moon, and the Sun. == Crewed exploration == Owen Garriott on an Earth orbit EVA, 1973 Crewed exploration of the Solar System ended in 1972. The first human being to reach space (defined as an altitude of over 100 km) and to orbit Earth was Yuri Gagarin, a Soviet cosmonaut who was launched in Vostok 1 on April 12, 1961. The first human to walk on the surface of another Solar System body was Neil Armstrong, who stepped onto the Moon on July 21, 1969 during the Apollo 11 mission; five more Moon landings occurred through 1972. The United States' reusable Space Shuttle flew 135 missions between 1981 and 2011. Two of the five shuttles were destroyed in accidents. The first orbital space station to host more than one crew was NASA's Skylab, which successfully held three crews from 1973 to 1974. True human settlement in space began with the Soviet space station Mir, which was continuously occupied for close to ten years, from 1989 to 1999. Its successor, the International Space Station, has maintained a continuous human presence in space since 2001. In 2004, U.S. President George W. Bush announced the Vision for Space Exploration, which called for a replacement for the aging Shuttle, a return to the Moon and, ultimately, a crewed mission to Mars. ==Exploration survey== Bodies imaged up close: ==Sample return== Moon rock returned by Apollo 17 *Moon (Misc. missions including Apollo and Luna) *Comet dust (Stardust) *Solar wind (Genesis) *Asteroid (Hayabusa) See also: Meteorites and Cosmic dust ==See also== *List of Solar System probes *Timeline of space exploration *Timeline of Solar System exploration ==References== ","title":"Discovery and exploration of the Solar System"},{"id":"19327060","text":"The Communaut√© de communes du Saint-Polois was created on 28 December 1995 and is located in the Pas-de-Calais d√©partement, in northern France.

VGR is rapidly transforming production processes by enabling robots to be highly adaptable and more easily implemented, while dramatically reducing the cost and complexity of fixed tooling previously associated with the design and set up of robotic cells, whether for material handling, automated assembly, agricultural applications , life sciences, and more. Robotic Industries Association by Tanya M. Anandan, Contributing Editor POSTED 04/02/2013 http://www.robotics.org/content-detail.cfm?content_id=3992 In one classic though dated example of VGR used for industrial manufacturing, the vision system (camera and software) determines the position of randomly fed products onto a recycling conveyor. The vision system provides the exact location coordinates of the components to the robot, which are spread out randomly beneath the camera's field of view, enabling the robot arm(s) to position the attached end effector (gripper) to the selected component to pick from the conveyor belt. The conveyor may stop under the camera to allow the position of the part to be determined, or if the cycle time is sufficient, it is possible to pick a component without stopping the conveyor using a control scheme that tracks the moving component through the vision software, typically by fitting an encoder to the conveyor, and using this feedback signal to update and synchronize the vision and motion control loops. Such functionality is now common in the field of vision guided robotics (VGR). It is a fast-growing rapidly evolving technology proving to be economically advantageous in countries with high manufacturing overheads and skilled labor costs by reducing manual intervention, improving safety, increasing quality, and raising productivity rates, among other benefits.

Special Handling Systems, UK RNA Automation Ltd, http://www.rna- uk.com/products/specialisthandling/visionguidedrobots.html == Vision systems for robot guidance == Camera lens for machine vision A vision system comprises a camera and microprocessor or computer, with associated software. This is a very wide definition that can be used to cover many different types of systems which aim to solve a large variety of different tasks. Vision systems can be implemented in virtually any industry for any purpose. It can be used for quality control to check dimensions, angles, colour or surface structure-or for the recognition of an object as used in VGR systems. A camera can be anything from a standard compact camera system with integrated vision processor to more complex laser sensors and high resolution high speed cameras. Combinations of several cameras to build up 3D images of an object are also available. == Limitations of a vision system == There are always difficulties of integrated vision system to match the camera with the set expectations of the system, in most cases this is caused by lack of knowledge on behalf of the integrator or machine builder. Many vision systems can be applied successfully to virtually any production activity, as long as the user knows exactly how to set up system parameters. This set-up, however, requires a large amount of knowledge by the integrator and the number of possibilities can make the solution complex. Lighting in industrial environments can be another major downfall of many vision systems. == VGR Approaches == Typically, vision guidance systems fall into two categories; stationary camera mount, or robot arm-mounted camera. A stationary camera is typically mounted on a gantry or other structure where it can observe the entire robot cell area. This approach has the advantage of knowing its fixed position, providing a stable point of reference for all the activity within the cell. It has the disadvantage of additional infrastructure cost, and occasionally having its view obstructed by the robot arm's position. It also typically requires large image files (5 Mpixel or more) since the image must cover the entire work area. These may be 2D or 3D cameras, although the vast majority of installations (2019) are using machine vision 2D cameras offered by companies such as COGNEX, Basler, Sick, Datalogic and many others. Emerging players such as Pickit3D, Zivid, and Photoneo are offering 3D cameras for stationary use. COGNEX recently acquired EnShape to add 3D capabilities to its lineup as well. 3D stationary mount cameras create large image files and point clouds that require substantial computing resources to process. A camera mounted on a robot arm has some advantages and disadvantages. Some 3D cameras are simply too large to be practical when mounted on a robot, but Pickit 3D's Xbox cameras and 2D cameras such as Robotiq's wrist camera are compact and/or light enough to not meaningfully affect available robot working payload. An arm mounted camera has a smaller field of view, and can operate successfully at lower resolution, even VGA, because it is only surveying a fraction of the entire work cell at any point in time. This leads to faster image processing times. However, arm mounted cameras, whether 2D or 3D, typically suffer from XYZ disorientation because they are continually moving and have no way of knowing the robot arm's position. The typical workaround is to interrupt each robot cycle long enough for the camera to take another image and get reoriented. This is visible in essentially all published videos of arm-mounted camera's performance, whether 2D or 3D, and can increase cycle times by as much as double what would otherwise be required. Pickit 3D's Xbox camera has been arm-mounted for some applications. While capable of more complex 3D tasks such as bin picking, it still requires the stop-take-a-picture re-orientation mentioned above; it's 3D awareness does not help with that problem. Visual Robotics claims to eliminate this cycle interruption with their \\"Vision-in- Motion\\" capabilities. Their system combines a 2D imager with internal photogrammetry and software to perform 3D tasks at high speed, owing to the smaller image files. The company claims a pending patent covering techniques for ensuring the camera knows its location in 3D space without stopping to get reoriented, leading to substantially faster cycle times. While much faster than other 3D approaches, it is not likely to be able to handle the more complex 3D tasks a true stereo camera can. On the other hand, many 3D applications require relatively simple object identification easily supported by the technique. To date, their ability to visually pick objects in motion (e.g. items on a conveyor) using an arm-mounted camera appears to be unprecedented. == VGR systems Benefits == Traditional automation means serial production with large batch sizes and limited flexibility. Complete automation lines are usually built up around a single product or possibly a small family of similar products that can run in the same production line. If a component is changed or if a complete new product is introduced, this usually causes large changes in the automation process-in most cases new component fixtures are required with time-consuming setup procedures. If components are delivered to the process by traditional hoppers and vibrating feeders, new bowl feeder tooling or additional bowl feeder tops are required. It may be that different product must be manufactured on the same process line, the cost for pallets, fixtures and bowl feeders can often be a large part of the investment. Other areas to be considered are space constraints, storage of change parts, spare components, and changeover time between products. VGR systems can run side-by- side with very little mechanical set up, in the most extreme cases a gripper change is the only requirement, and the need to position components to set pick-up position is eliminated. With its vision system and control software, it is possible for the VGR system to handle different types of components. Parts with various geometry, can be fed in any random orientation to the system and be picked and placed without any mechanical changes to the machine, resulting in quick changeover times. Other features and benefits of VGR system are:Perks, Andrew. 2006. Advanced vision guided robotics provide 'future- proof' flexible automation.

He was in line for great estates and position as head of the distinguished Herbert family and heir to the earldom of Pembroke, but lived an irregular life in exile after a dissolute youth. ==BiographyEarly years=== Wilton House Herbert was born 19 September 1791 at Hill Street, London, the second (but eldest surviving) son of the 11th Earl of Pembroke by his first marriage to his first cousin, Elizabeth (d. 1793). She was the daughter of Topham Beauclerk by Lady Diana Beauclerk, dau. of Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough, and great-great-granddaughter of Charles II. He spent his childhood at Wilton House, the Pembroke country seat in Wiltshire.Storr, Paul. \\"The Pembroke Candelabra\\", Bonham's After education at Harrow School, he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1810.Alumni Oxonienses: The Members of the University of Oxford, 1715‚Äì1886, Volumes 1‚Äì2, Parker and Company, 1888, p. 643 He later travelled to Sicily. Against his father's wishes, Herbert made a disastrous clandestine marriage at the Butera Palace in Palermo on 17 August 1814. His bride was a Sicilian princess, Ottavia Spinelli (1779‚Äì1857), the recently widowed wife of the (much older) Prince Ercole Branciforte di Butera, and daughter of the Duke of Laurino.Doyle, James Edmund. The Official Baronage of England, vol. III, Longmans, Green, and Company, 1886, p. 37 Before the death of the Prince, the young Viscount Herbert had been the Princess's cavaliere servente. His father attempted to have the marriage dissolved without success, but succeeded in persuading the Sicilian authorities to separate the parties. Accordingly, Lord Herbert was imprisoned in a fortress and his wife in a convent. Herbert managed to escape, however, to Genoa and returned to England, where his father persuaded him to abandon the Princess. She promptly took a house in London under the name of Lady Herbert and brought a suit for restitution of conjugal rights in the English courts in 1819. The marriage was annulled and she was awarded ¬£800 p.a., which it is said was later increased to ¬£5,000, but Lord Herbert and the Princess never came together again. Neither did either ever remarry. ===Exile === Dance before a Fountain by Nicolas Lancret, Getty Center Herbert succeeded to the titles on the death of his father in 1827 and took his seat in the House of Lords in 1833. Under a family agreement, his diligent younger half brother, the statesman Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea, took control of managing the family estates centred on Wilton House, Wiltshire. Subsequently by 1837 Herbert was living in Paris, where Lord Malmesbury wrote of him, \\"Lord Pembroke lives in great state in Paris, and is as famous for his cook as for his horses. He is a very handsome man.\\" Herbert owned Lancret's \\"Dance before a Fountain\\", previously in the collection of Catherine the Great; it became part of his later estate sale in June 1862.Watteau, Music, and Theater, (Katharine Baetjer, ed.)

() The club currently plays in Eccellenza Sicily, the fifth-tier of Italy. The club, originally known as A.C. Palazzolo A.S.D. relocated from Palazzolo Acreide to Syracuse in 2013, and took a new name Sport Club Siracusa (S.C. Siracusa). S.C. Siracusa replaced the 2013 folded club A.S.D. Citt√† di Siracusa, an illegitimate phoenix club of U.S. Siracusa which itself was another illegitimate phoenix club of A.S. Siracusa. U.S. Siracusa and S.C. Siracusa had a derby in youth football in 2013‚Äì14 season. After the season S.C. Siracusa was renamed A.S.D. Citt√† di Siracusa, and changed to Siracusa Calcio S.r.l. circa 2016. However, the club folded again in 2019, which the third A.S.D. Citt√† di Siracusa was founded in 2019. The team was admitted to Promozione Sicily in August 2019. The holder of the assets of now defunct A.S. Siracusa, Amici del Siracusa, denied S.C. Siracusa the use of the logo of A.S. Siracusa in the 2013‚Äì14 season; in the 2014‚Äì15 season no club submitted a bid to Amici del Siracusa for the temporary rights to use the logo either. == History Palazzolo === The club located in Palazzolo Acreide, Sicily was founded in 1954 as Associazione Calcio Palazzolo Associazione Sportiva Dilettantistica. In July 2006, Palazzolo was merged with A.S.D. Xiridia 96 Floridia, a football club from Floridia. Palazzolo had took part in Serie D 3 times. The first participation in Serie D was in the 2007‚Äì08 season (as 2007 promotion playoffs winner) in which it was relegated the next year. The club was promoted to the Serie D after winning the group B of Eccellenza Sicily in the 2010‚Äì11 season, but was relegated back in Eccellenza at the end of the 2012‚Äì13 Serie D season. After the original club had relocated to Siracusa . The town of Palazzolo had re-founded another club S.C. Palazzolo. ===Relocation to Siracusa === In 2013 Palazzolo (registration number: 917156) relocated to Syracuse () as A.S.D. Sport Club Siracusa, in order to replace A.S.D. Citt√† di Siracusa (reg.no.: 936289), which was an illegitimate phoenix club of U.S. Siracusa. At the same time, a new club was founded in Palazzolo Acreide as A.S.D. Sport Club Palazzolo (reg.no.: 937886), which played in Promozione, by splitting the FIGC membership of C.S.D. Enzo Grasso, a local Syracuse team now plays in 5-a-side football only. However, the usage of the historic logo of A.S. Siracusa 1924 by S.C. Siracusa, was denied by Amici del Siracusa, an association that currently owned the rights to use it. S.C. Siracusa had a derby with U.S. Siracusa in the youth level in 2013‚Äì14 season, which the under-17 team of S.C.

Citt√† di Siracusa, retaining the same registration number of S.C. Siracusa (and A.C. Palazzolo A.S.D.). The club won Eccellenza Sicily in 2015, after 2 seasons in the league. New Siracusa promoted to Lega Pro at the end of 2015‚Äì16 Serie D as the Group I winner. The club was also incorporated as Siracusa Calcio S.r.l. circa 2016. However, after 3 seasons, new Siracusa failed to register for the new Serie C season and folded. ===Another re- foundation=== In July 2019, another phoenix club was founded and named after the city as A.S.D.

Yacouba Sawadogo is a farmer from Burkina Faso who has been successfully using a traditional farming technique called Za√Ø to restore soils damaged by desertification and drought. Such techniques are known by the collective terms agroforestry and farmer-managed natural regeneration. A 2010 documentary feature film The Man Who Stopped the Desert, first screened in the UK, portrays his life. He is a native speaker of Mossi. In 2018, he was awarded the Right Livelihood Award.'Blessed': Tree regeneration pioneer Tony Rinaudo gets global gong, Peter Hannam, Sydney Morning Herald, 24 September 2018 ==Early life== Sawadogo was sent to a religious school where the students often didn't have enough to eat. Being the smallest and youngest, he was the one who had to go without. ==Background== The northern portions of Burkina Faso fall in the Sahel Belt, a semi-arid region between the Sahara Desert to the north and tropical savannahs further south. The region periodically suffers from drought. The most recent major drought occurred from 1972 to 1984, resulting in a famine which killed hundreds of thousands of people. One effect of the drought was widespread desertification. Combined with other factors such as overgrazing, poor land management, and overpopulation, the drought led to a substantial increase in barren land, particularly on slopes, due to the comparative difficulty of cultivating sloping land. Uncultivated, the soil experienced increased erosion and compaction. Such practices also led to an annual one metre reduction in the water table in the 1980s. ==Soil rehabilitation== Together with Mathieu Ou√©draogo, another local farm innovator, Yacouba Sawadogo began experimenting with techniques for rehabilitating damaged soil in the 1970s. He relies on simple approaches traditional to the region: cordons pierreux and za√Ø holes. Both Sawadogo and Ou√©draogo have engaged in extension and outreach efforts to spread their techniques throughout the region. ===Cordons pierreux=== Cordons pierreux are thin lines of fist-sized stones laid across fields. Their purpose is to form a catchment. When rain falls, it pushes silt across the surface of the field, which then fetches up against the cordon. Slowing down the flow of water gives it more time to soak into the earth. The accumulated silt also provides a comparatively fertile spot for seeds of local plants to sprout. The plants slow the water even further in turn, and their roots break up the compacted soil, thereby making it easier for more water to soak in. ===Za√Ø holes=== Za√Ø holes also catch water, but take a slightly different approach. They are holes dug in the soil. Traditionally they were used in a limited way to restore barren land. Yacouba Sawadogo introduced the innovation of filling them with manure and other biodegradable waste, in order to provide a source of nutrients for plant life. The manure attracts termites, whose tunnels help break up the soil further. He also increased the size of the holes slightly over the traditional models. Za√Ø holes have been used to help cultivate trees, sorghum, and millet. From the mid-1980s until 2009, the use of za√Ø has also led to the water table levels rising by about on average, and as much as in some areas. ===Outreach=== To promote these methods, particularly za√Ø holes, Yacouba Sawadogo holds bi-yearly \\"Market Days\\" at his farm in the village of Gourga. Attendees from over a hundred regional villages come to share seed samples, swap tips, and learn from one another.Indigenous Knowledge Notes #77, The World Bank, February 2005. http://www.worldbank.org/afr/ik/iknt77.htm (last accessed 15 September 2008) The process was supported by the Dutch scientist Chris Reij (World Resources Institute) and OXFAM UK. ==Conflict with Burkinab√© government== Over a period of more than two decades, Yacouba Sawadogo's work with za√Ø holes allowed him to create a forested area of . The area is clearly visible on satellite images east of the hospital. Recently this area was annexed by the nearby city of Ouahigouya, under the auspices of a government program to increase city revenues. Under the provisions of the program, Yacouba Sawadogo and his immediate family members are each entitled to one tenth of 1 acre (400m) out of the plot, and do not receive any other compensation. In 2008, Sawadogo was attempting to raise US$20,000 to purchase the land. In 2009, Sawadogo was attempting to raise ‚Ç¨100,000 because land was now valued at ‚Ç¨100,000 from his increased work to fertilizing the lands. In 2012, settlers reached the edge of the wood. Since 2019, settlers are erecting the first buildings the forest. The authorities report about an ongoing administrative procedure to protect the land as municipal heritage. ==See also== * 2010 Sahel famine * Permaculture ==References== Category:Burkinab√© farmers Category:Living people Category:People involved with desert greening Category:Permaculturalists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Right Livelihood Award laureates ","title":"Yacouba Sawadogo"},{"id":"19327259","text":"The Communaut√© de communes de la R√©gion de Bapaume was created on December 30, 1992 and is located in the Pas-de-Calais d√©partement, in northern France.

A proposal, created in 2005, to make a home for the endangered cats in Pilibhit forests was sent to the government of India in April 2008. Pilibhit Tiger Reserve was declared as the 46th Tiger reserve of India in June 2014 on the basis of its special type of ecosystem with vast open spaces and sufficient feed for the elegant predators. https://projecttiger.nic.in/content/109_1_ListofTigerReservesCoreBufferAreas.aspx https://projecttiger.nic.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/file/Notification- Area/Core/Pilibhit.pdf ==Geography== The northeastern boundary of the reserve is the River Sharda (Nepali:Mahakali River) which defines the Indo-Nepal border, while the southwest boundary is marked by the River Sharda and the River Ghaghara. The reserve has a core zone area of and buffer zone area of . Elevation ranges from 168 to 175 meters above MSL ==Flora== This reserve is one of the finest examples of the highly diversified and productive Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands eco-system. The forest vegetation is of the North Indian moist deciduous type, having the finest sal Shorea robusta forests of the country. The Terai forests and grasslands constitute habitat for over 127 animals, 556 bird species and 2,100 flowering plants. The sal woodland is very dense with good natural regeneration, amounting to almost 76% of the reserve area. The forest patches are interspersed with grass meadows with several like Saccharum, Sclerostachya, Imperata, Themeda, Bothriochloa, Vetiveria, Apluda, Dichanthium, Digitaria and Cyperus. The grasslands are subjected to seasonal flooding water l Broadly, such waterlogged grasslands and water bodies constitute the wetland of the habitat. They are also home to around 6 million people who depend on them for their livelihoods. ==Fauna== The habitat has rich faunal diversity, having 5 out of 7 deer species found in the country. Besides, there are some critically endangered species such as the Bengal florican and his As many as 13 species of mammals, 9 species of birds and 11 species of reptiles/amphibians found in the reserve are endangered and listed in the Schedule I of the Wildlife (Prot Act, 1972. The major faunal species are Royal Bengal Tiger, leopard, fishing cat, leopard cat, swamp deer, spotted deer, hog deer, barking deer, blackbuck, sambar, sloth bear, fox, short-nosed fruit bat, Indian common yellow bat, painted bat, rhesus macaque, common langur, porcupine, small Indian civet, jackal, Indian fox, hyena, rattle.

Reptiles are well represented with lizards, several species of snakes, freshwater crocodile and Gharial. The river system harbor around 79 species of fishes. ==Ecotourism== Though the main focus is the protection and in-situ of wildlife, the reserve management has also encouraged low impact eco-tourism. Park management has developed a Chuka Ecotourism site on the bank of Sharda Sagar dam which is located inside the park. The Dudhwa tigers are distributed in one major and three smaller populations. Major population is constituted by Dudhwa reserve which includes Dudhwa National Park, Kishenpur and Katarniaghat wildlife sanctuaries, Pilibhit forests and north and south Kheri forests. Smaller tiger populations are present in Bijnor forests in west and Suhelwa and Sohagibarwa wildlife sanctuaries in east. According to a study by Wildlife Institute of India (WII), the Dudhwa-Pilibhit tiger population has high conservation value since it is the only population having the ecological and behavioral adaptations of the tiger unique to the Terai region.http://bigcatnews.blogspot.com/2008/05/up-to-get-new-tiger-reserve-in- pilibhit.html ==Corridors== Pilibhit tiger reserve is an important habitat for tiger owing to its connection with several tiger habitats within the State and outside. The important linkages are: # Surahi range- Terai East Division Uttarkhand # Lagga-Bagga - Shuklaphanta National Park (Nepal) # Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary ‚Äì Dudhwa The corridor linkages are used by the tiger and other wild animals and require monitoring and restoration by fostering a co- occurrence agenda with local people. == References  External links == * Category:Tiger reserves in Uttar Pradesh Category:Pilibhit district ","title":"Pilibhit Tiger Reserve"},{"id":"19327337","text":"*GK=Goalkeeper *B=Back *HB=Halfback *FW=Forward Field Hockey  Afghanistan had a squad of 18 players five of them are unknown.

It is a Grade I listed building. It was once the home of the poet and essayist Joseph Addison and of the sporting writer Charles James Apperley. ==History== A manor on this site was inherited by John Trussell from his father William in 1481. After John's death in 1499, his daughter, Elizabeth Trussell became the ward of John de Vere, afterwards 15th Earl of Oxford. Elizabeth later became de Vere's second wife. The manor of Bilton was held by this family line for nearly 70 years. In 1574 Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, leased it to John, Lord Darcye, and in 1580 he sold it to John Shuckburgh, who immediately leased it to Edward Cordell. When John Shuckburgh died in 1599, the manor was inherited by his eldest son Henry who sold it to Edward Boughton of Lawford Hall (who already held the portion of Bilton that had belonged to Pipewell Abbey) in 1610. Boughton rebuilt the manor, creating the central part of the current red brick and sandstone house in about 1623. He intended it for use by his son William. After the death of his father, William was created Baronet Boughton in 1642. Joseph Addison The house was generally occupied by junior members of the Boughton family and was sold by Edward Boughton in 1711 to the essayist and poet Joseph Addison, who wrote his book Evidences of Christianity while living there. Following Addison's death in 1719 the house was occupied by Addison family members until it was sold, about 1799, to John Bridgeman Simpson (1763‚Äì1850) of Babworh Hall, Babworth, a son of Henry Bridgeman, 1st Baron Bradford. A drawing by Turner may depict the hall c.1815.Joseph Mallord William Turner: A Tudor Mansion. ?Bilton Hall. Tate Gallery The British census of 1881 records that two of Simpson's unmarried daughters remained in residence. Apart from Addison, other noted residents include the sports writer Charles James Apperley, known as \\"Nimrod\\", and Henry Holyoake, who was the rector from 1705 to 1731. During World War I the house was in use as a military hospital. After World War II it was converted into flats. ==The building== The original building created by Boughton has been modified and extended several times. It was probably once in a regular H plan, but has since lost its symmetry.

The water of the spring stems from moderately-deep circulation and emerges from a water-filled limestone cave in a steep cliff. From the mouth of the cave, the water is funneled to flow out of the mouths of three ornamental stone-carved tiger heads into a square- shaped spring pool. From there it runs into the old city moat, next to which the spring is located. According to the tradition, there was a black rock lying in front of the cave in ancient times.online article from www.gochinatravel.com The name of the spring is said to be derived from the shape and color of the rock, which resembled a black tiger, and the sound of the water gushing past the rock being reminiscent of the roar of a tiger. The ancient layout of the spring is described in a poem by the Ming Dynasty poet, Yan Bizeng. ==Location== The Black Tiger Spring is located on the south bank of the old city moat, close to the southeastern corner of the moat.

One of the youngest-ever NWA New England Junior Heavyweight Champions, he faced some of the top light heavyweights in the Northeast including longtime friend and trainer John Brooks, Jason Rumble, Eddie Edwards, Mikey Whipwreck, and Gran Akuma. In 2004, he and Akuma met in the opening round of Chikara's Young Lions Cup tournament. Quirk's ring death in 2005 was the first major death to occur on the independent circuit as the result of an in-ring accident and concern was voiced by many in the professional wrestling industry including Al Snow, Percy Pringle, and Dan Mirade over negligence and regulation of independent wrestling in the United States. ==CareerEarly life and career=== Daniel Quirk was born to Mike Quirk and his wife in Bridgeport, Connecticut and grew up in Shelton, Connecticut. According to Quirk, he initially became interested in wrestling when a friend showed him action figures of Demolition in second grade. He began watching the World Wrestling Federation around 1990. Bret Hart, Mr. Perfect and The Rockers (Marty Jannetty & Shawn Michaels) would later influence his ring style. He was involved in \\"backyard wrestling\\" with his brothers and friends as a teenager and, in early 2002, Quirk began training under John Brooks and Bert Centano at the USA Pro Wrestling School in West Haven, Connecticut.Dolan, Adam. \\"Interview with Spider.\\" DeclarationofIndependents.net. November 2003. 15 Sep. 2008 . He also attended clinics held by Christopher Daniels, Mike Quackenbush and Tom Prichard. Quirk began appearing in local wrestling shows as Stuart the manager of the Scottish Gigolo. On July 21, 2002, Quirk made his professional debut against Beau Douglas in a gauntlet match for Jason Knight's Assault Championship Wrestling. A month later, he appeared on another gauntlet match for ACW teaming with trainer John Brooks in a tag team match against Bulldog & Shabba on August 24. He also lost a match to the Scottish Gigolo in Worcester, Massachusetts at the end of the month. He would spend much his early career on the road with frequent rival and a later personal friend, Nocturne. ===Independent circuit=== Later that year, he made his first appearance for the New Age Wrestling Federation when he defeated White Blaze and later participated in a battle royal on October 20. In mid-November, he lost to \\"Beautiful\\" Billy Body at a show for Afa's World Xtreme Wrestling on November 23 and teamed with Mark Gore against WXW Tag Team Champions Tommy Suade & Supreme Lee Great the following night. On December 1, he returned to ACW for another gauntlet match defeating Pepsi Boy but losing to DC Dillinger later on that night. During the next year, he would quickly become a regular on the independent circuit. On February 23, he took part in a gauntlet match for Pro Wrestling Alliance defeating Slate, Wicked before being eliminated by J-Busta. Quirk would trade matches with him at a PWA and NAWF show the next month. He also feuded with Mark Gore over the NAWF Junior Heavyweight Championship and eventually defeated him for the title in a ladder match on April 27, 2003. He would once again team with John Brooks defeating Leroy & Genesis at an NAWF event on May 21. The following week for South Coast Championship Wrestling, Quirk lost a five-way match for the SCCW Lightweight title against Stevie Sky, Derrick Destiny, The Kreeper and Kid Capri on May 30. Entering a championship tournament for the MWF Heavyweight Championship the next night, he was eliminated by John Brooks. On June 8, he also lost a four-way match to Jeff Rocker, Shabba White and Wiqued at an ACW show. On July 26, he won his first major title when he and Captain Charisma defeated NWA New England Junior Heavyweight Champion Jason Rumble & Paulie Gilmore in a tag team match. As a result of the pre-match stipulations ordered by NWA Commissioner Marc Greene, both Quirk and Captain Charisma are named co-champions. This is one of the very few, if any, that a title was defended by two wrestlers at once. Although the two would defend the title in a handicap match against Rumble on September 20, the title would eventually be vacated and declared inactive within another month. Successfully defending his NAWF title in a three-way match against Nocturne and Genesis, he lost to Genesis in a non-title match on September 6. The next night, he also failed to defeat Eddie Edwards for the ACW Junior Heavyweight Championship. On September 28, he lost a four-way match against J-Busta, Luis Ortiz and Mikey Whipwreck at an XBoku event. On October 5, he wrestled two matches in one night at an MWF show losing to Mighty Mini, Eddie Edwards and participating in a battle royal. At an October 18 East Coast Pro Wrestling show, he lost a three-way match to John Brooks and Genesis. On October 30, he lost a match to SSCW Lightweight Champion The Kreeper. In November, he lost to Supreme Lee Great at a November 16 show for LXW but defeated J-Busta at a CCW show a week later. He also made a brief appearance for the World Wrestling Alliance at the end of the month. On February 29, 2004, Quirk teamed with UltraMantis and Mister Zero to defeat Nocturne, Jigsaw and Rorschach at an LXW show. Feuding with Gran Akuma over the NAWF Junior Heavyweight Championship, he defeated him for the title on April 4. He held the title for two months before losing the title back to Akuma. In May, Quirk defeated Dan Barry in a ladder match. On July 10, 2004, he also lost to Gran Akuma in the opening rounds of Chikara's Young Lions Cup tournament. He and Dave Cole were also given a title shot against UCW Tag Team Champions The Millennium Killaz later that month, but failed to defeat them. Quirk would spend the rest of the year in Connecticut Championship Wrestling, East Coast Pro Wrestling and World Xtreme Wrestling. On September 10, he lost to Low Ryda in a match for the WXW Cruiserweight Championship. He also lost to CCW Northeast Champion Dave Cole two months later. On April 2, 2005, he teamed with Jason Blade and Nocturne against Mister Zero, Rorschach and Ultramantis defeating his former allies. He also appeared in Assault Championship Wrestling, Powerhouse Wrestling and Ultimate Championship Wrestling during early-2005. ==Death== Dan Quirk died after suffering fatal injuries at an Ultimate Championship Wrestling event in Taunton, Massachusetts. Quirk had been thrown to the floor outside the ring, and his opponent, Hi-Lite Kid, then tried a moonsault or a piscada (a jump over the ropes) but caught his foot in the top rope. Quirk tried to compensate for his falling opponent by catching him unusually high; this resulted in Hi-Lite Kid's ribs falling against Quirk's head and Kid's entire body weight forcing Quirk into the floor head- first. Quirk was unable to use his hands to brace the fall, and his head caught the entire impact of Hi-Lite Kid's fall. With blood visible on the floor, the match was stopped. An ambulance was called, but all efforts to revive Quirk were unsuccessful. According to eyewitnesses, no mats had been provided outside the ring and that may have been the deciding factor resulting in his fatal injuries. ===Aftermath=== In the days following his death, it was announced on his former website that the Daniel Michael Quirk Memorial Scholarship Fund would be set up in his memory. His father, Mike Quirk, said that the fund would be available for a graduating senior from Shelton High School majoring in graphic arts and communications. Quirk had studied graphic design at Northeastern University and the University of New Haven and later designed websites for various independent wrestlers and promotions in addition to being the webmaster of NAWF's official website. On June 11, 2005, Connecticut Championship Wrestling dedicated its WrestleJam 2 supercard to Quirk's memory. Prior to the show, a special ceremony was held at the ACES Collaborative Alternative Magnet School for Leadership in Northford, Connecticut while promoter Joe LaChance and Bulldog Blanski both gave a speech to the crowd. The entire CCW roster, including Matt Hardy, was present during the ceremony.

The band consists of four robots, created from scratch using a variety of spare parts and electronic equipment, and are based in Hamilton (nicknamed Hamiltron or The Tron for short). ==History== During the 1990s, while a member of the New Zealand musical duo The Emersons, Greg Locke toyed with the concept of developing a robotic drummer. This concept eventually grew into the idea of creating an entire band of robots. The four robots took about nine months to build and were created from electronic components of decommissioned photocopy-card vending machines (which formed part of Locke's daytime career), various scavenged parts and some advanced equipment. The construction of the band was assisted with a grant by the Hamilton Community Arts Council. ==About== The band is managed by its creator, Greg Locke, a New Zealand musician and mechanical engineer who has played in garage bands including The Hollow Grinders. The band contains no human members, consisting only of four robots named Ham, Wiggy, Swamp and Fifi. Ham plays the rhythm guitar and does the vocals. The vocals are produced through bits of tape loop created on an old tape machine and looped. Wiggy plays lead guitar which is single-string. It is only possible for the robots to play four chords. Swamp performs on the drums, using a pie-plate as a snare. Swamp was written several times on the drum set that Locke purchased for this robot (he guesses that it must have been the name of the band who had used it), thus the robot's name. Fifi plays the keyboard, using only one \\"hand\\". She originally played bass but performed poorly at it. The robots are made from a combination of scrap parts and more complex equipment and are controlled via a computer using a \\"top- secret\\" software package. The use of \\"flimsy material\\" makes the robots' actions similar to that of a human to create human-like music. Despite being robots, the members of the Trons are often treated as human by fans to the point where Swamp has received date requests. Locke explains this tendency to treat them as human arises from the \\"human element\\" required to create music. == Critical reputation == The Trons' first dip into stardom came from their YouTubeYouTube video video, which received over 80,000 hits in two days, going on to amass almost a million hits in only a few months.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00M3a9nYJi0 They have received mostly positive critical acclaim, being described as \\"pure genius\\" and as being better than Grammy Award-winning British band Coldplay. == References  External links == * * Waikato robot band an internet hit * * Category:New Zealand musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2008 Category:Robot musicians Category:Culture in Hamilton, New Zealand Category:Robots of New Zealand Category:2000s robots Category:Individual robots ","title":"The Trons"},{"id":"19327565","text":"Edith Atkins (2 February 1920 ‚Äì 28 August 1999) was a racing cyclist and a prolific breaker of long-distance recordsPENSIONER KILLED IN A45 TRAGEDY WAS A RECORD-BREAKING VETERAN, Coventry Evening Telegraph, 31 August 1999, Summers, Kathryn.

Atkins set the first women's amateur record for Land's End to John o' Groats, eight days after her Edinburgh-Glasgow-Edinburgh record. She beat the professional record by 4h 48m. Atkins was entered in the Golden Book of Cycling on 12 August 1953. 1957 saw more records broken. ==Retirement and death== Atkins remained an enthusiastic cyclist after her record-breaking years.

He also served as Deputy Administrator at United Nations Development Programme headquarters in New York. ==Education== Patel stood first in the Matriculation examination and established a record score that was never beaten. He then came top in his BA at the University of Bombay. He later earned Doctor of Philosophy in economics from King's College at University of Cambridge with a scholarship from the Gaekwads of Baroda.

After five years there, Patel came back to Delhi as Economic Adviser to the Ministry of Finance in 1954 and spent the next 18 years in one or other top capacity in the Government of India. In 1972 he became the Deputy Administrator of the UN Development Programme for five years, returning only to take up the position of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India.

He had to handle student protest about LSE's investments in South Africa and their support of Winston Silcott, who had been convicted of the murder of a police officer in the Broadwater Farm riots in Tottenham. Patel handled both the situations with tact and firmness but also with a sympathetic understanding of students' concerns about racism. His initiatives, too, in setting up an innovative inter-departmental forum bore fruit in the Interdisciplinary Management Institute and the Development Studies Institute. ===RBI Governor=== The Indian Rupee notes of 1000, 5000 and 10,000 denomination and the gold auctions were demonetized during his tenure (he later featured on a special commemorative 1000 rupee note).

By the end of the 3rd Socio-Economic and Cultural Development of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the tree provinces with the highest penetration rate were Tehran, Isfahan and Yazd respectively; from the point of view of performance, Tehran, Isfahan and Yazd had also the highest performance. The special services provided to the subscribers are call transfer, call waiting, caller ID, FDN services, call restriction, fax connection, data services, SMS and VMS systems, and international roaming. ===Evolution of the mobile telephone in the world=== As a personal communication means, the telephone network has the highest application in the world. The possibility of provision of mobile phone has emerged in 1960 in Scandinavian states (Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland) in 1960s. By the end of the decade the first point to point telephone was used and this was a turning point in telecommunication industry and thereby one of mankind's dreams was realized. The technology was introduced to the market by Scandinavian states to the market by use of analog technology. The first mobile telephone network (Nordic Mobile Telephone ‚Äì NMT) was introduced by these states. In early 1980s, the use of digital telephone in automobile was put into the agenda. In 1977, Canada has designed the first public information network and put into operation. The public international information systems were realized by use of computer, satellite and microwave transmitter and receivers. The USA introduced the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) to the market in 1983. Japan was the third country in the work, which introduced its mobile network that in turn was a mixture of Scandinavian and American systems, named HCMS; then developed NTT system with network connection possibility. In 1985, England introduced TACS system and thereby joined to the countries with mobile communication network. Thereafter, a NMT system with 450 mega Hz frequency was employed by Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland and they joined to the countries with mobile telephone network. The Netherlands, Luxemburg and Belgium accepted it a little changes and Cyprus jointed to the network in 1989. In the same year Canada accepted American network of AMPS. In the same year, European Telecommunication Standard Institute (ETSI), representing 17 European states, agreed to design and innovate a common standard for launching a digital mobile telephone network. The standard named GSM and currently has three parts with similar performance but different frequencies. In 1986 the international information network, Internet, was launched as the most extensive international information system and in 1987 narrow bandwidth was selected; in the same year, 13 European states entered into memorandum of understanding on due implementation of GSM specifications by all the MOU parties. These 13 countries have also agreed to make their borders open to each other for commercial activities in this field. By extension of information systems along with the telephone networks, the need to their integration became an essential in 1980s and finally led the countries to ISDN network establishment. ISDN was the result of the investigations and research of the scientists in connection with digital technology in 1960s. In digital system the relation between the parts, devices and equipment is mainly in the form of digits and the mechanical work is very low and, consequently, the noise is very low. Integrated System of Digital Network (ISDN) was submitted to the EU in the middle of 1980s for review. The network, which has been put into operation in some states, is a kind of switch-based closed network, which the voice and video services are provided by use of switching equipment. The system has high performance and flexibility, especially in high transmission of high volume data and huge number of demands for transmission of telephone messages, in central computers, computer terminals and other services which requires high level of flexibility and efficiency and low cost. Among the technologies, which put into service in the recent decade, is video conference and multimedia networks introduced in 1970s by ATST Company in New York. In this network, using TDM switch technology the simultaneous with transmission of the voice on a pair of wires the video and data is transmitted as well by use of remote control possibility. The First Generation of Mobile Telephone was put into operation in 1979 for commercial use in the United States and Japan. These telephones, which use the cell telecommunication system, evolved into G2 and digital system. The increase in the number of subscribers and lower possibility of call hearing in G2 finally led to development of G3 which is the estimated 2000 horizon of ITU in the 21st century. IMT 2000 is an advanced mobile communication which is used for provision of telecommunication services in global scale disregarding the network and terminal location. By integration of land and satellite mobile network different wireless access will be provided including the exiting services of the fixed telephone systems and other services provided for the mobile telephone subscribers. IMT-2000 will make possible the use of all mobile terminals in connection with land or satellite networks and also terminals designed for use in fixed or mobile applications. ===History of mobile telephone in Iran and the existing situation=== Council of Ministers, in its meeting on August 4, 2004, on the basis of Ministry of Communications and IT's proposal No. 100/13897 of August 4, 2004 and on the strength of Articles (2) and (4) of the 3rd Socio-Economic and Cultural Development of the Islamic Republic of Iran, approved in 2000 as well as approval of the Higher Administrative Council's approval under No. 1901/76016 of July 15, 2003 in line with implementation of Article (1) of the said Law, has approved the reorganization of Distance Measurement Center in the form of Mobile Communication Company of Iran. The exploitation of cell phone system was commenced for the first time in Iran in 1994 by use of 176 transmitters and receiver installed in 24 stations and with 9200 cell phone numbers. The high demand of the subscribers of this phenomenon forced ITC to extend the coverage and facilities and, by March 2006, the number of cell phone subscribers increased to 15907 and, in addition to Tehran, coverage provided for some cities including Mashhad, Ahwaz, Tabriz, Isfahan and Shiraz. The extension trend of the system continued in the following years and, in addition to the above-named cities, the coverage provided for a number of 28 new cities. Now, the number of subscribers had been increased form 59,967 in 1994 to 3,449,878 in March 2004. In line with this extension trend and following the policies of the government regarding provision of enjoyment for all classes of the community, including those living in small cities like large cities, the number of cities under network coverage increased from 134 in March 1997 to 667 cities in March 2004. Presently, the number of mobile telephone network subscribers has increased to more than 43 million more than 1120 cities and the coverage has been provided for more than 47,000 km road network throughout the country. The penetration coefficient of the subscribers is about 55% of the community and roaming services have been provided in more than 110 countries. ==See also== *Mobile phone market in Iran ==External links== *Official website ==References== Category:Mobile phone companies of Iran Category:Companies listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange Category:Iranian brands Category:Iranian companies established in 1992 Category:Telecommunications companies established in 1992 ","title":"Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran"},{"id":"19327736","text":"Yang Fuqing (; died 1874), born in Mei County (now Meixian District), Guangdong, was a rebel leader during the middle and late Taiping Rebellion against the Qing government in 1855-1874.

Phillips, the former valet of Panmure estate, bought Carnoustie estate from Bailie Milne in 1792 for the price of ¬£5,000 on his return from India, renaming it 'Taymouth'. Phillips was surprised by Lowson's request, as the land was thought to be agronomically poor, but granted Lowson the first feu of of land for seventy shillings. On hearing about it, Phillips' wife took pity on the apparently deluded Lowson and refunded him five shillings. In 1798, while transplanting cabbage seedlings on his new land, Lowson left the willow dibble stick he had been using stuck in the ground. He later found it had sprouted leaves.Thompson, A.L. (1998).

Rai Italia operates a television network that broadcasts around the world via 3 localized feeds. Programming features a mix of news, discussion-based programs, drama and documentaries as well as sports coverage including 4 live games per week from Italy's top football league, Serie A. From 1996 to 2013, Glauco Benigni is Head of Press International Office and Head of Promotion and Development of RAI International worldwide. ==Audience== Rai Italia is targeted at Italian expatriates, foreign citizens of Italian descent, and non-Italians interested in Italian language and culture; as such the network features a mix of the best programming from Rai as well as original programming created especially for this channel. Rai Italia started international television broadcasting on New Year's Day 1992 as Rai International, Rai Italia has worked under an agreement with the Italian government in order to develop the presence of public service in international radio and television broadcasting. Rai Italia also strives to meet the demands for information and services from Italian communities abroad. Rai Italia broadcasts three television channels, via satellite, which vary according to the different geographical targets. No service is available for Europe as Rai's domestic channels are widely available free-to-air in this region. Rai Italia has organized the satellite service into 4 zones with each having a different localized schedule: { Rai Italia America - Broadcasts to The Americas - Rai Italia Asia - Broadcasts to Asia - Rai Italia Australia - Broadcasts to Australia - Rai Italia Africa - Broadcasts to Africa } In Europe, Rai Italia has broadcast for a short period timesharing with Rai Med (Arabic language entertainment, FTA), but this broadcast has ended. It also shares a cable TV channel with TV Guide Channel in the Boston, MA area on Comcast. ==Controversy in Canada== In Canada, Rai Italia's programming was originally seen on Telelatino, a Canadian licensed channel launched in 1984 and currently majority owned by Corus together with three prominent Italian-Canadians. Telelatino ( or \\"TLN\\") was launched over a decade before a RAI international TV channel ever existed. TLN had provided a level of availability and variety of Italian domestic and foreign programming to Canadians that was unsurpassed anywhere outside Italy. However, in 2003, RAI pulled the Rai International programming from Telelatino and, with the help of Rogers Communications (which itself owns several multicultural stations in Toronto under the Omni Television system), petitioned the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to allow Rai Italia to be broadcast in Canada.https://web.archive.org/web/20040229000238/http://www.international.rai.it/canada/continuazioni_stampa/20040109_c.shtml Although the Italian community in Montreal was in favour of admitting Rai International into the Canadian media marketplace, the Italian community in Toronto was divided, since some believed that it was a ploy by the then Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to gain influence over Canadian Italian-language media. This theory may have been advanced by Telelatino's primary carriage of programming from Berlusconi-controlled Mediaset after RAI's Canadian launch. Originally, the CRTC denied RAI's application, on the grounds that RAI had improperly denied supply of programming to TLN's Canadian viewers and that RAI's attempt to enter Canada on an unrestricted basis without any Canadian programming and financial obligations would be unfair competition. However, some Italian-Canadians could watch Rai Italia through grey-market satellite TV viewing cards that allowed them to watch US satellite television. Eventually, in 2005, the CRTC allowed Rai Italia to broadcast in Canada after a review of its policy on third-language foreign language TV services. ==Logos== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"1\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #aaa\\" - align=center !height=\\"150px\\" bgcolor=\\"#F9F9F9\\"  !height=\\"150px\\" bgcolor=\\"#F9F9F9\\"  !height=\\"150px\\" bgcolor=\\"#F9F9F9\\"  !height=\\"150px\\" bgcolor=\\"#F9F9F9\\"  !height=\\"150px\\" bgcolor=\\"#F9F9F9\\"  !height=\\"150px\\" bgcolor=\\"#F9F9F9\\"  120px !height=\\"150px\\" bgcolor=\\"#F9F9F9\\"  120px - !width=\\"150px\\" colspan=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\"  1992-1996 !width=\\"150px\\" colspan=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\"  1996-2008 !width=\\"150px\\" colspan=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\"  2008 !width=\\"150px\\" colspan=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\"  2008‚Äì2009 !width=\\"150px\\" colspan=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\"  2009‚Äì2012 !width=\\"150px\\" colspan=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\"  2012-2017 !width=\\"150px\\" colspan=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\"  2017‚Äìpresent } ==See also== *RAI, Italy's publicly funded national broadcaster *Rai Satelradio Italy's former international radio service *Mediaset Italia ==Notes and references * Official Website in Italian, English and Spanish Category:International broadcasters Category:Television channels and stations established in 1995 Category:Italian-language television stations Italia ","title":"Rai Italia"},{"id":"19327804","text":"The Orly Airport attack was the 15 July 1983 bombing of a Turkish Airlines check-in counter at Orly Airport in Paris, by the Armenian terrorist organization ASALA as part of its campaign for the recognition of and reparations for the Armenian Genocide.The New York Times.

Ocala Star-Banner, 20 July 1983 A few days after the French arrest of fifty-one Armenians in connection with the Orly bombing, ASALA bombed the Air France office and the French Embassy in Tehran, and threatened more attacks. French police detained 29-year-old Varoujan Garabedian (Varadjian Garbidjian), a Syrian national of Armenian extraction, who confessed to planting the bomb at the airport. Garabedian claimed he was the head of the French branch of ASALA. At the airport, Garabedian said he had too much luggage and gave a passenger $65 to check the bag for him. The bomb was intended to explode aboard a Turkish Airways plane en route from Paris to Istanbul, but it detonated prematurely on a baggage ramp.The New York Times. Paris says suspect confesses attack. 21 July 1983 Garabedian confessed that the bomb was assembled at the home of an Armenian of Turkish nationality, Ohannes Semerci, in Villiers-le-Bel. In Marseilles, police later arrested another Turkish citizen of Armenian extraction, 22 years old Nayir Soner, an electronics specialist who was suspected of assembling the bomb.The Washington Post, 24 July 1983. Dutch Hold Suspect in Brussels Killing French press alleged that the French government had struck a secret deal with ASALA in January 1982, in which there would be no further attacks on French soil in return for French recognition that the Turks had attempted genocide against the Armenians in 1915. Under the terms of the deal ASALA members supposedly were also granted unrestricted use of French airports, and four ASALA members charged with the takeover of the Turkish consulate in Paris, in which a security guard was killed, were given light sentences (seven years in jail). Garabedian told French investigators that the violation of the secret pact by ASALA was an accident, and that the suitcase bomb was supposed to detonate on board the Turkish airliner, not on French soil. But the Orly airport attack forced the French government to crack down on ASALA.Jack Anderson, Dale Van Atta. Lebanese Is Key To Bombings Rocking France. Newsday, 29 October 1986, p. 80. == Trial == During an 11-day jury trial in suburban Cr√©teil, Garabedian, defended by Jacques Verg√®s, denied his earlier confession. He was found guilty and on 3 March 1985 he was given a life sentence. Nayir Soner, accused of buying bottles of gas used to make the bomb, was given a 15-year sentence, and Ohannes Semerci, in whose apartment ammunition and dynamite were found, received a 10-year sentence.United Press International. Foreign News Briefs. 4 March 1985. The victims were defended by Gide Loyrette Nouel: principal Jean Loyrette argued for denial of the Armenian Genocide; his collaborators Gilles de Poix and Christian de Thezillat argued on the attack itself, to demonstrate the guilt of the three defendants. Several Turkish scholars ‚Äì Sina Aksin, T√ºrkkaya Ata√∂v, Avedis Simon Hacinlyian, Hasan K√∂ni, M√ºmtaz Soysal ‚Äì testified for the prosecution during the trial. In 1995, over 1 million people in Armenia signed a petition to the authorities in France calling for the release of Garabedian from prison.Florence Avakian. \\"Over a Million in Armenia Plead for Release of Convicted ASALA Man.\\" The Armenian Reporter. 1995.

Armenian terrorist freed and deported from France. He was greeted by Prime Minister of Armenia Andranik Margaryan, who expressed happiness at Garabedian's release. In an interview in 2008, Garabedian explained the Orly bombing was a protest against the hanging execution of Levon Ekmekjian in Istanbul in 1982, and he planned to destroy a Turkish Airlines plane, which was to transport high- ranking representatives of the Turkish secret services, as well as Turkish generals and diplomats. Garabedian claims that as a result of the attack 10 Turks were killed and 60 were injured. == See also == * Bombing of French consulate in West Berlin * Terrorism in Europe == References  Bibliography == * Terrorist Attack at Orly: Statements and Evidence Presented at the Trial, 19 February ‚Äì 2 March 1985, Ankara, Faculty of Political Science, 1985. * Maxime Gauin, ‚Ä≥Remembering the Orly Attack,‚Ä≥ Review of International Law and Politics, vol. 7, no. 27, September 2011, pp. 113‚Äì139. * Francis P.

His family lived in Ilford, Essex. He was educated at University College London (UCL). ==Career== Baxter's first job (1975‚Äì1977) was at an insurance company. He then went to the Central Electricity Generating Board, where he researched ways to predict the available generator capacity given the incidence of breakdowns and the average time required for generator repairs. This work was accepted by UCL for a Ph.D. in 1980. Baxter was then offered a temporary post as a lecturer at the University of Delaware. The following year, he moved to the State University of New York at Stony Brook (SUNY) where he was granted tenure about ten years before his death. Leitmann (1997) reports that \\"Baxter was internationally renowned for his work in applied probability and reliability theory\\" and that he \\"published over 45 papers and did extensive consulting in this area\\".

The scene of the accident was a curved section of single track on the Metrolink Ventura County Line just east of Stoney Point. According to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which investigated the cause of the collision, the Metrolink train ran through a red signal before entering a section of single track where the opposing freight train had been given the right of way by the train dispatcher. The NTSB blamed the Metrolink train's engineer, 46-year-old Robert M. Sanchez, for the collision, concluding that he was distracted by text messages he was sending while on duty. This mass casualty event brought a massive emergency response by both the city and county of Los Angeles, but the nature and extent of physical trauma taxed the available resources. First responding officer Tom Gustofson described the wreck as ‚Äúbeyond human description‚Äù. Response included CEMP (California Emergency Mobile Patrol Search and Rescue) as a first responding unit requested by LAPD. With 25 deaths, this became the deadliest accident in Metrolink's history. Many survivors remained hospitalized for an extended period. Lawyers quickly began filing claims against Metrolink, and in total, they are expected to exceed a US$200 million liability limit set in 1997, portending the first legal challenges to that law. Issues surrounding this accident have also initiated and reinvigorated public debate on a range of topics including public relations, safety, and emergency management, which has also resulted in regulatory and legislative actions, including the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008. ==Collision== Metrolink commuter train 111, consisting of a EMD F59PH locomotive (SCAX 855) pulling three Bombardier BiLevel Coaches, departed Union Station in downtown Los Angeles at 3:35 p.m. PDT (22:35 UTC) heading westbound to Moorpark in suburban Ventura County. Approximately 40 minutes later, it departed the Chatsworth station with 222 people aboard, and had traveled approximately when it collided head-on with an eastbound Union Pacific local freight train. The freight train was led by two EMD SD70ACe locomotives, #8485 and 8491, and was pulling 17 freight cars. The Metrolink locomotive telescoped rearward into the passenger compartment of the first passenger car and caught fire. All three locomotives, the leading Metrolink passenger car, and ten freight cars were derailed, and both lead locomotives and the passenger car fell over. The collision occurred after the Metrolink passenger train engineer, 46-year-old Robert M. Sanchez, failed to obey a red stop signal that indicated it was not safe to proceed into the single track section. The train dispatcher's computer at a remote control center in Pomona did not display a warning prior to the accident according to the NTSB. Metrolink initially reported that the dispatcher tried in vain to contact the train crew to warn them; but the NTSB contradicted this report, saying the dispatcher noticed a problem only after the accident, and was notified by the passenger train's conductor first. Both trains were moving toward each other at the time of the collision. At least one passenger on the Metrolink train reported seeing the freight train moments before impact, coming around the curve. The conductor of the passenger train, who was in the rear car and was injured in the accident, estimated that his train was traveling at before it suddenly came to a dead stop after the collision. The NTSB reported that it was traveling at . The freight train was traveling at approximately the same speed after its engineer triggered the emergency air brake only two seconds before impact, while the Metrolink engineer never applied the brakes on his train. ===Location=== The accident occurred after the freight train emerged from the 500-foot-long (150-meter-long) tunnel #28, just south of California State Route 118 (Ronald Reagan Freeway) near the intersection of Heather Lee Lane and Andora Avenue near Chatsworth Hills Academy. The accident was in Chatsworth, a neighborhood of Los Angeles located at the northwestern edge of the San Fernando Valley. The trains collided on the Metrolink Ventura County Line, part of the Montalvo Cutoff, opened by the Southern Pacific Company on March 20, 1904, to improve the alignment of its Coast Line. Metrolink has operated the line since purchasing it in the 1990s from Southern Pacific (now owned by Union Pacific), which retained trackage rights for freight service. ===Railroad physical characteristics=== Both trains were on the same section of single track that runs between the Chatsworth station (which is double tracked) through the Santa Susana Pass. The line returns to double track again as it enters the Simi Valley. Three tunnels under the pass are only wide enough to support a single track, and it would be very costly to widen them. This single-track section carries 24 passenger trains and 12 freight trains each day. The line's railway signaling system is designed to ensure that trains wait on the double-track section while a train is proceeding in the other direction on the single track. The signal system was upgraded in the 1990s to support Metrolink commuter rail services, and Richard Stanger, the executive director of Metrolink in its early years of 1991 to 1998, said the system had functioned without trouble in the past. The Metrolink train would normally wait in the Chatsworth station for the daily Union Pacific freight train to pass before proceeding, unless the freight train was already waiting for it at Chatsworth. The location was not protected by catch points. ==Timeline== {  style=\\"float:right;margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" +Metrolink train #111's timetable - !Station !Time -  Union Station2:35 p.m. -  Glendale3:45 p.m. -  Downtown Burbank3:51 p.m. -  Bob Hope Airport3:55 p.m. -  Van Nuys4:02 p.m. -  Northridge4:09 p.m. -  Chatsworth4:16 p.m. -  Simi Valley4:28 p.m. -  Moorpark4:45 p.m. - } The events on September 12, 2008 leading up to the collision (all times local): { -  5:54 a.m.Engineer Sanchez begins his 11-hour split shift. -  6:44 a.m.Sanchez begins his morning run. -  8:53 a.m.Sanchez finishes his morning run after exchanging 45 text messages while en route. -  9:26 a.m.Sanchez finishes the first part of his shift and goes off duty. -  2:00 p.m.Sanchez returns to work after reportedly taking a two-hour nap. -  3:03 p.m.Sanchez begins his afternoon run. -  3:30 p.m.Sanchez uses his cell phone to order a roast beef sandwich from a restaurant in Moorpark. -  3:35 p.m.Metrolink train #111 departs Union Station with Sanchez at the controls of locomotive #855. -  4:13 p.m.The signal north of the Chatsworth station is set to red to hold the Metrolink train. -  4:16 p.m.Train #111 is scheduled to depart Chatsworth station with the next stop in Simi Valley.

The crew arrived at the address four minutes later, just before 4:30 p.m. PDT and accessed the scene by cutting through the backyard fence. Upon arrival, the captain on the scene immediately called for an additional five ambulances, then 30 fire engines, and after reaching the wreck he called for every heavy search and rescue unit in the city. Hundreds of emergency workers were eventually involved in the rescue and recovery efforts, including 250 firefighters. Two Los Angeles city firefighters received medals for risking their lives to enter a confined space with smokey and potentially toxic air, without their air bottles, to rescue one of the freight train crew members. LAPD Devonshire Division, Patrol Officers arrived on scene shortly after the first LAFD Engine Company. As firefighters were putting out the flames of the burning diesel fuel that had spilled out of the freight engine, Patrol Officers entered the damaged, smoke-filled train cars to rescue/administer first aid to several passengers who were stranded on the upper decks due to their critical injuries. Two Officers received medals, and two received commendations and were credited with potentially saving the lives of several injured passengers. The event was operationally identified as the \\"Chatsworth Incident\\" and was reclassified as a \\"mass casualty incident\\". All six of LAFD's air ambulances were mobilized, along with six additional helicopters from the Los Angeles County Fire Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The helicopters were requested under a mutual aid arrangement. A review of the emergency response and the on-site and hospital care was initiated by the Los Angeles County Supervisor immediately after the event, and was expected to take 90 days to complete. ===Casualties=== Recovery workers stand near the rear of the Metrolink locomotive after it was removed from the lead passenger car, where most of the serious injuries and deaths occurred. A total of 25 people died in the collision, including engineer Sanchez and two victims who died at hospitals in the days following the crash. This event is the deadliest railway accident in Metrolink's history, and the worst in the United States since the Big Bayou Canot train disaster in 1993. A total of 135 others were reported injured, 46 of them critically, with 85 of the injured transported to 13 hospitals and two transported themselves. Air ambulance helicopters medevaced 40 patients. LAFD Captain Steve Ruda reported that the high number of critically injured passengers taxed the area's emergency response capabilities, and patients were distributed to all 12 trauma centers in Los Angeles County. Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills treated 17 patients, more than any other hospital. Captain Ruda said his firefighters had never seen such carnage. Austin Walbridge, a train passenger, told a TV news reporter that the interior of the train was \\"bloody, a mess. Just a disaster. It was horrible.\\" Emergency responders described the victims as having crush-type injuries. Dr. Amal K. Obaid, a trauma surgeon who practices at USC University Hospital where several victims were treated, described their injuries in more detail, \\"They have head injuries, multiple facial fractures, chest trauma, collapsed lungs, rib fractures, pelvic fractures, leg and arm fractures, cuts in the skin and soft tissue. Some have blood in the brain.\\" The Los Angeles County Coroner set up an air-conditioned tent that functioned as a temporary morgue at the site. One off-duty Los Angeles Police Department officer was among the confirmed deaths, as was the Metrolink train's engineer, an employee of Veolia Transport, a contracted operator of Metrolink. One of the passengers who died was a survivor of the 2005 Glendale train crash. Another had been commuting by train since Metrolink's inception in 1992. Many victims were residents of suburban Simi Valley and Moorpark on their way home from work in the Los Angeles area. The four other crew members of the two trains survived. The conductor and engineer of the freight train were trapped inside the lead locomotive while it was engulfed in flames; the firefighters who rescued the pair found them banging on the thick glass windshield, unable to escape. The freight crew also had a brakeman riding in the second locomotive who was injured in the crash. The search for victims came to an end shortly after 14:30 PDT on September 13, approximately 22 hours after the collision. ===Service disruptions=== The crash disrupted service on the Pacific Surfliner and the Coast Starlight. Amtrak canceled service on the Pacific Surfliner between San Luis Obispo and Union Station in Los Angeles and Thruway Motorcoach buses transported Coast Starlight passengers from Union Station to Santa Barbara to board the trains. Metrolink service on the Ventura County Line was interrupted north of Chatsworth, and all service resumed four days after the accident. ===Investigation===  Preliminary investigation controversy  Metrolink spokeswoman Denise Tyrrell disclosed the day after the crash that a preliminary investigation of dispatch records and computers showed the engineer of the Metrolink passenger train failed to stop his train for a red railway signal, which indicated his train did not have authority to proceed on the main track . She was quoted as saying, \\"We don't know how the error happened, but this is what we believe happened. We believe it was our engineer who failed to stop at the signal.\\" Tyrrell said that if the engineer had obeyed the signal, the accident would not have occurred. However Los Angeles County Supervisor and Metrolink board member Don Knabe said it was premature to blame the engineer, speculating that \\"there could always be a technical malfunction where ... there was a green light both ways.\\" After a Metrolink board meeting two days after her remarks, Tyrrell resigned. Tyrrell stated that she quit because a Metrolink Board statement called her announcement premature and inappropriate; she maintained that it was proper to get out in front of the story before the NTSB took over the investigation. She stated that she asked for and received authorization to make the comments from David Solow, Metrolink's chief executive. Solow confirmed that he did give authorization, but said that, in hindsight, he would not have given permission. After her resignation, some good government proponents praised Tyrrell for her candor, including the chief public advocate with California Common Cause. The Los Angeles Times also published an editorial by columnist Patt Morrison sympathetic to Tyrrell's position, in which she says, \\"I am unclear of the concept of how the truth can somehow be premature. The truth is the truth.\\" Official investigation The NTSB led the official investigation to determine the probable cause, but NTSB officials had not commented on the accident prior to the Metrolink statement. In a subsequent press conference at the scene two hours after Tyrrell's comments, an NTSB official cautioned that the cause of the accident was still under investigation. The NTSB studied the data from the train event recorders, which had been recovered by NTSB investigators working at the scene. The Metrolink train had two data recorders, one badly damaged, and the freight train had a data and a video recorder. The NTSB said it would collect other evidence and interview witnesses to try to officially report within a year's time why the crash occurred. Tests of the railway signal system after the accident showed it was working properly, and should have shown proper signal indications to the Metrolink train, with two yellow signals as the train approached the Chatsworth station, and a red signal at the switch north of the station. \\"We can say with confidence that the signal system was working,\\" the lead NTSB board member stated at a news conference after the tests. This focused the NTSB investigation on human factors. Before releasing the accident scene and allowing restoration of service, the NTSB also conducted a final sight distance test. An identical Metrolink train and pair of Union Pacific locomotives were brought together at the point of impact and slowly backed away from each other. The test showed that the trains' engineers could not see each other until less than five seconds before the collision. The surviving crew members could not be interviewed by the NTSB immediately after the accident because they were still recovering from their injuries. The NTSB was able to interview the Metrolink conductor about recorded radio communications, which did not capture the required communication between the conductor and engineer on the aspects displayed by the last two signals the train passed before the accident. He confirmed they did not call out the last two signals. The NTSB also stated that a railroad switch showed evidence of damage consistent with the Metrolink passenger train \\"running through\\" the trailing switch points while they were set to allow the freight train to proceed onto the adjacent track, forcing them out of the way. \\"The switch bars were bent like a banana. It should be perfectly straight,\\" according to the NTSB official. The NTSB member in charge of the investigative team said they were also concerned with possible fatigue issues related to the engineer's split shift. The engineer worked an 11.5-hour shift split with a 3.5-hour break, leaving only nine hours away from work between workdays. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is also investigating to determine if any federal safety regulations were violated. The California Public Utilities Commission, the state agency responsible for regulating railroads, also reported that it has ten investigators with railroad experience working in conjunction with the NTSB, and will also be looking into the matter of the Tyrrell resignation. = Possible false green = Before the conclusion of the formal investigation, three witnesses came forward to say that they observed the signal to be green as the Metrolink train departed the Chatsworth station just before the collision. A newspaper reporter interviewed the witnesses at the station, and confirmed that the signal was visible from the station, and that the witnesses could correctly identify the colors displayed. A safety consultant said that although this type of signal failure is extremely rare, he had seen it twice before in his 13-year career as a locomotive engineer. The NTSB considered the eyewitness' accounts and, based on the results of its tests of the signal system and on the distance between the witnesses and the signal, rejected them as \\"contrary to the other evidence\\". Text messaging KCAL-TV news showed a text message allegedly sent by the Metrolink train's engineer 22 seconds before the crash. Local television news broke the story that the Metrolink engineer was exchanging brief text messages with a 16-year-old railfan while operating the train, a violation of Metrolink rules according to the agency. The last message received from the engineer, time-stamped at 4:22:01, 22 seconds before the collision, reportedly said, \\"yea ... usually @ north camarillo,\\" referencing Camarillo, CA, a town farther down the line, where the engineer expected to meet another train. The NTSB did not recover the engineer's cellphone in the wreckage and said the teenagers were cooperating with the investigation, initially noting that similar rumors about an engineer using a cell phone from an investigation recently conducted in Boston were unfounded. After receiving the engineer's cell phone records under subpoena, the NTSB confirmed that the engineer was texting while on duty, but had not yet correlated the messages with the accident timeline. After completing a preliminary timeline, the NTSB placed the last text message sent by the engineer at 22 seconds before impact. An NTSB representative refused to comment further on the preliminary timeline, which investigators were still refining. Two University of Southern California academics used the information in the NTSB statement to determine that the last text message sent by the Metrolink train's engineer would have been sent a few seconds after he had passed the last red signal. This would make unconsciousness an unlikely cause for this error, since the engineer was able to compose and send the message; instead a psychology professor from the University of Utah raised the possibility that \\"inattentional blindness\\" caused the engineer to fail to see the signal. The day after the NTSB confirmed the engineer was texting, and less than one week after the accident, the California Public Utilities Commission unanimously passed an emergency order to temporarily ban the use of cellular communication devices by train crew members, citing this accident and a previous San Francisco Municipal Railway accident where the train operator was using a cell phone. A week later, texting while driving an automobile was outlawed in California, effective January 1, 2009. There was no federal regulation prohibiting cell phone use by train crews at the time of the accident, but the NTSB had recommended the Federal Railroad Administration address the issue in 2003, after concluding cell phone use by a freight train engineer contributed to a fatal head-on train collision in Texas in 2002. However, 19 days after the accident the FRA administrator issued Emergency Order No. 26 restricting the use of \\"personal electronic or electrical devices\\" by railroad operating employees. On March 3, 2009, federal investigators released records showing that the train engineer Robert M. Sanchez had allowed a train enthusiast to ride in the cab several days before the crash, and that he was planning to let him run the train between four stations on the evening of the crash. \\"I'm gonna do all the radio talkin' ... ur gonna run the locomotive & I'm gonna tell u how to do it,\\" Sanchez wrote in one text. Records also show Sanchez had received two prior warnings from his supervisors about improper use of cellphones while in the control cab. Conductor's role The operating rules for trains with a single engineer is that all signals are to be reported to the conductor. This allows the conductor to pull the air (apply the emergency brakes) should the engineer appear to be incapacitated for any reason. However, in this incident, according to the data video, the last two signals were not reported, nor did the conductor apply the brakes. Unusually, the conductor told the engineer that the starting signal was green, rather than the other way around.http://www.justicenewsflash.com/2010/01/21/deadly-metrolink-chatsworth- crash-investigations-coming-close_201001213080.html NTSB's conclusions and recommendations On January 21, 2010, the NTSB issued a press release announcing its conclusions from the investigation into the collision. In the report, the NTSB concluded that the cause of the accident was most likely the result of the Metrolink engineer's use of text messaging while on duty, which led to the train passing a signal at danger and traveling into the path of the oncoming Union Pacific freight train. In addition, the Board cited the lack of positive train control on the Metrolink train as a contributing factor. The investigation has led the NTSB to recommend that the federal government require the installation of video and audio recording equipment in all locomotive and train operating cabs, and to reiterate its calls for positive train control, which had been on the Board's Wanted List since 1990. ===Positive train control=== Positive train control (PTC) is a system of functional requirements for monitoring and controlling train movements and is a type of train protection system.\\"Positive Train Control  Federal Railroad Administration\\". www.fra.dot.gov. Department of Transportation. Retrieved February 12, 2018. Attention was focused almost immediately about the lack of PTC on equipment involved in the Chatsworth collision; Federal Railroad Administrator Joseph H. Boardman told a reporter days after the accident that PTC \\"would have stopped the train before there was a collision\\". The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) member leading the investigation also said she was convinced that such a system \\"would have prevented this accident\\". In 2008, Congress passed the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 in direct response to the accident. It required Class I Railroad mainlines with regularly scheduled intercity and commuter rail passenger service to fully implement PTC by December 31, 2015.Positive Train Control. U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration By 2015, few railroads were anywhere close to implementing PTC and asked for an extension; the deadline was extended to December 31, 2018, with a provision extending compliance to December 31, 2020 if railroads submit plans for doing the work by December 31, 2018. The failure to implement PTC earlier was cited by the Board as a contributing factor in the 2015 Philadelphia train derailment. Metrolink was the first commuter system to deploy the technology, and it is currently fully active on 341 miles of trackage owned by Metrolink. Regarding the other 171 miles of Metrolink track that are owned by freight lines BNSF and UPRR, the agency states as of 2017 that they are \\"working towards PTC interoperability\\". ===Litigation=== As the result of a provision in the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-134), there is a US$200 million cap on the aggregate of all passengers' damage claims in a railroad accident against a passenger railroad, including punitive damages. In dividing the $200 million among the 25 dead and more than 100 injured in the Chatsworth case, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter D. Lichtman characterized the awards as \\"judicial triage\\", stated victims were undercompensated by at least $64 million, and admitting that awards were unlikely to cover future medical expenses. ===Memorials=== Following the collision a temporary, spontaneous memorial of flowers and notes was erected at the Simi Valley Amtrak/Metrolink Station. On September 8, 2009, the first permanent memorial, a plaque, was placed in Union Station. The Metrolink Memorial Plaza was dedicated on September 12, 2009 at the Simi Valley station. The plaza features 11 columns, one each for the ten deceased passengers from Simi Valley and an additional one for the 14 other deceased victims. There are also 25 markers on the grounds to commemorate each victim as well as a seating area and a plaque in remembrance to the 2005 Glendale train crash. Two days later, on the first anniversary of the crash a memorial ceremony was held at Stony Point Park, near the location of the collision. ==See also== *Bad Aibling rail accident, 2016 crash in Germany caused when dispatcher was distracted by a game on his cell phone. *List of American railroad accidents *List of rail accidents (2000‚Äì2009) ==References *Audio and video from KNX 1070 AM *Brief Overview of the Head-On Collision Between Metrolink Train 111 and a Union Pacific Freight Train, September 12, 2008, California Public Utilities Commission *List of victims from the Los Angeles Times *Los Angeles Times full coverage page *Gallery from KABC-TV *Gallery from the Los Angeles Times *Gallery from Traverse Legal, PLC *NTSB report Category:2008 disasters in the United States Category:Accidents and incidents involving Metrolink (California) Category:Railway accidents and incidents in Los Angeles Category:Railway accidents in 2008 Category:Transportation in the San Fernando Valley Category:Railway accidents involving a disregarded signal Category:Accidents and incidents involving Union Pacific Railroad Chatsworth train Category:Train collisions in the United States ","title":"2008 Chatsworth train collision"},{"id":"19327972","text":"David Brown (June 9, 1895 ‚Äì disappeared April 27, 1925)\\"Dave Brown Negro League Statistics & History\\". baseball-reference.com.

His career came to a premature end when he became a fugitive after allegedly killing a man in 1925. ==Early career== Brown was born in Leon County, Texas. He had a good curveball and excellent control. He was also a good fielder and had outstanding speed but was a weak hitter. Brown played with the Dallas Black Giants in 1917 and 1918.\\"Plenty of Baseball Provided for Fans of Dallas Today\\" Dallas Morning News, Dallas, Texas, Sunday, August 11, 1918, Page 8, Column 2 He was regarded as a \\"timid nice guy\\" who did not cause trouble, but during his time with the Dallas Black Giants he was involved in a highway robbery.Riley, p. 117. Although Brown was reported to have become a fugitive, Rube Foster agreed to pay $20,000 for Brown's parole and he became a member of Foster's Chicago American Giants.Cottrell, p. 165. ==Chicago American Giants Seasons== 1919 Chicago American Giants Brown became the ace of the American Giants as they dominated negro league baseball in the early 1920s. From 1920 through 1922, he posted a 29-8 record in league games. His 11-3 record led them to a pennant win in 1921 including three victories in a playoff with the Bacharach Giants.Cottrell, p. 160. His 8-3 record contributed to another pennant in 1922.Cottrell, p. 163. In the winter following the 1922 season, Brown joined Oscar Charleston for the first season of the Cuban League's Santa Clara Leopardos.Heaphy, pp. 173-174. ==League change and abrupt career end== For the 1923 season, Brown left Rube Foster's American Giants for the brand new Eastern Colored League. Foster voiced his displeasure, pointing out that Brown had been paroled to him and that he had promised Brown's mother to take care of him. He pointed out that the public would vilify him if he revoked.Cottrell, p. 165. Brown posted a losing record in his first season with the New York Lincoln Giants but he and Charleston returned to Cuba the following winter and helped Santa Clara compile one of the best records in Cuban baseball history.Riley, p. 118.Heaphy, p. 174. His second season with the Lincoln Giants improved on the first and he defeated \\"Cannonball\\" Dick Redding and the Brooklyn Royal Giants to win the New York City championship. Brown's career came to an abrupt end in 1925. He went to a bar on the night of April 27, 1925[The League of Outsider Baseball: An Illustrated History of Baseball's ...By Gary Cieradkowski pp. 128-129] with Frank Wickware and Oliver Marcelle.James, p. 184. Marcelle was a third baseman with a reputation for trouble off the field. A fight erupted at the bar, possibly involving cocaine, and Brown killed one of the participants, Benjamin Adair.Cards that never were Wickware and Marcelle were questioned the next day at the ballpark, but Brown had disappeared. ==Rumors and legacy== The FBI searched for Brown but he was never officially seen again. Rumors abounded that he continued playing baseball under the alias \\"Lefty Wilson\\" with semi- professional teams through the Midwestern United States. Lefty Wilson toured with Gilkerson's Union Giants in 1926,\\"Gilkerson Union Giants Swamp Knights of Columbus Nine 11 to 4\\" Davenport Democrat and Leader, Davenport, IA, Monday Evening, June 21, 1926, Page 7, Columns 1 and 2 a white team in Bertha, Minnesota in 1927 and 1928, and he was rumored to have played in Sioux City, Iowa in 1929 and Little Falls, Minnesota in 1930. More unsubstantiated rumors claimed that Brown died in mysterious circumstances in Denver, Colorado in 1930.

He authored the familiar hymn, This is My Father's World, among others. ==Early life== Babcock as a young man Babcock was born at Syracuse, New York,More precisely, Babcock was born at 708 East Fayette Street, Syracuse,photos and description of house here eldest son of Henry and Emily Maria (Maltbie) Babcock. His first American ancestor was James Babcock (1612‚Äì1679), a native of England, who emigrated in 1642, settling first at Portsmouth, Rhode Island and then in Westerly, where his descendants became prominent.William Richard Cutter, New England Families, Genealogical and Memorial (1915:529). Maltbie Davenport Babcock's great- grandfather, Henry Davis, was second president of Hamilton College, and his grandfather, Rev. Ebenezer Davenport Maltbie, was also a Presbyterian minister of note. As a young man, Babcock was described as \\"tall and broad-shouldered\\" and a muscular swimmer and baseball player. Maltbie Babcock was educated in the public schools of Syracuse and graduated in 1879 from Syracuse University with highest honors. He played Baseball on the University's ball team and was a member of the Psi Upslion Fraternity. He was selected to give the Alumni Address in 1895. He studied theology at the Auburn Theological Seminary, receiving his degree there in 1882. ==Ministry== Upon receiving his degree in theology in 1882, Babcock became pastor of a church at Lockport, New York. He was described as having \\"an unusually brilliant intellect and stirring oratorical powers that commanded admiration, [that] won for him a foremost place among the favorites of his denomination\\".Maltbie Davenport Babcock, The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, Supplement I. New York: James T. White (1910 edition). From 1887 to 1900, Babcock was senior minister of the prestigious Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church in Baltimore, Maryland.Jane T. Swope, A History of Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church 1870‚Äì1995, Baltimore, Maryland, 1995. While pastoring Brown Memorial, he was acclaimed for his oratory and use of colorful metaphors in his sermons.Memorial service (PDF), Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church, Baltimore, Md., June 2, 1901. He also led a fund-raising effort to assist Jewish refugees from Russia who were victims of an anti-Jewish pogrom in the 1880s. Babcock was honored by a Doctor of Divinity degree from Syracuse University in 1896. He was called to the Brick Church of New York City in 1900, where his annual compensation was approximately $30,000. So popular was he that many prominent Baltimoreans, including the faculty of Johns Hopkins University, unsuccessfully implored Babcock to remain at Brown instead of accepting the call to Brick Presbyterian Church. A 1910 biography said of him, ==Personal life== The Holy City by Louis Comfort Tiffany, honoring Babcock at Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church On October 4, 1882, he married Katherine Eliot Tallman, the youngest daughter of John Peck Higgins Tallman a prominent lawyer of Poughkeepsie, New York. They had two children, both of whom died in infancy: * Edward Anderson Babcock (d. August 21, 1883) * John Tallman Babcock (d. February 11, 1890) Babcock died at age 42 in Naples, Italy, on May 18, 1901, returning from a trip to the Holy Land. According to a New York Times report of May 20, 1901, and widely carried by newspapers coast-to-coast, he committed suicide by slitting his wrist and ingesting \\"corrosive sublimate\\" or mercuric chloride. He was being treated in the International Hospital in Naples for what was called \\"Mediterranean fever,\\" an archaic term for brucellosis. Several of his travel companions suffered from this bacterial infection which causes fever, pain and depression. Babcock had been hospitalized for \\"nervous prostration\\" (depression) in Danville, New York, ten years before his death. At his funeral in New York City, the presiding clergyman eulogized him, \\"We do not need a candle to show a sunbeam...The work our brother has done ‚Äî the life he lived speaks for him.\\" In Baltimore, a memorial service was held on June 2, 1901, where he was eulogized by various prominent educators, including Daniel C. Gilman, the first president of Johns Hopkins University, John Goucher, the founder of Goucher College, and Francis L. Patton, president of Princeton University. Babcock was praised as \\"always wise, patient, sympathetic and inspiring\\". He is buried at Oakwood Cemetery in Syracuse, New York. ===Legacy=== When Babcock lived in Lockport, he took frequent walks along the Niagara Escarpment to enjoy the overlook's panoramic vista of upstate New York scenery and Lake Ontario, telling his wife he was \\"going out to see the Father's world\\". She published a poem by Babcock shortly after his death, entitled This is My Father's World. Now sung as a well-known hymn, its verses are: ::This is my Father's world, and to my listening ears all nature sings, and round me rings the music of the spheres. ::This is my Father's world: I rest me in the thought of rocks and trees, of skies and seas; his hand the wonders wrought. ::This is my Father's world, the birds their carols raise, the morning light, the lily white, declare their maker's praise. ::This is my Father's world, he shines in all that's fair; in the rustling grass I hear him pass; he speaks to me everywhere. ::This is my Father's world. O let me ne'er forget that though the wrong seems oft so strong, God is the ruler yet. ::This is my Father's world: why should my heart be sad? The Lord is King; let the heavens ring! God reigns; let the earth be glad! A large stained glass window was installed in 1905 at Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church in Babcock's memory. The Holy City, by Louis Comfort Tiffany, depicts St. John's vision of the \\"New Jerusalem\\" described in . It has brilliant red, orange, and yellow glass etched for the sunrise, with textured glass used to create the effect of moving water. It is said to be one of the two largest windows crafted by Tiffany.Joan S. Feldman, Sacred Glass: The Tiffany Windows of Brown Memorial Park Avenue Presbyterian Church.
